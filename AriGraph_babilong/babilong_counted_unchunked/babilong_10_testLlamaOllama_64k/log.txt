EPISODIC MEMORY: ['##############\n\n\'This represents the total amount of the benefits of civilization and\nnecessaries of life produced by the people in number four.We now\nproceed to "Share Out" the things in the same way as they are actually\ndivided amongst the different classes of the population under the\npresent imbecile system.\'As the people in divisions one and two are universally considered to\nbe the most worthy and deserving we give them--two-thirds of the whole.\'The remainder we give to be "Shared Out" amongst the people\nrepresented by divisions three and four.1             2             3            4\n  +------------+-------------+-------------+------------+------------+\n  | Tramps     | Exploiters  | All those   | All those  |            |\n  | Beggars    | of Labour   | engaged in  | engaged in |            |\n  | Society    | Thieves     | unnecessary | necessary  |     U      |\n  | People     | Swindlers   | work        | work--the  |     N      |\n  | Aristoc-   | Pickpockets |             | production |     E      |\n  | racy       | Burglars    |             | of the     |     M      |\n  | Great      | Bishops     |             | benefits   |     P      |\n  | Landowners | Financiers  |             | of         |     L      |\n  | All those  | Capitalists |             | civiliz-   |     O      |\n  | possessed  | Share-      |             | ation      |     Y      |\n  | of         | holders     |             |            |     E      |\n  | hereditary | Ministers   |             |            |     D      |\n  | wealth     | of religion |             |            |            |\n  +------------+-------------+-------------+------------+------------+\n  \\___________  ____________/ \\___________  ___________/\n              \\/                          \\/\n            #########                    #####\n            #########                    #####\n            #########                    #####\n            #########                    #####\n            #########                    #####\n            #########                    #####\n    How the things produced by the people in division 4 are\'shared\n         out\' amongst the different classes of the population.\'Now you mustn\'t run away with the idea that the people in three and\nfour take their share quietly and divide the things equally between\nthem.Some get very little, some none, some more than a\nfair share.It is in these two divisions that the ferocious "Battle of\nLife" rages most fiercely; and of course in this battle the weak and\nthe virtuous fare the worst.Even those whose exceptional abilities or\nopportunities enable them to succeed, are compelled to practise\nselfishness, because a man of exceptional ability who was not selfish\nwould devote his abilities to relieving the manifest sufferings of\nothers, and not to his own profit, and if he did the former he would\nnot be successful in the sense that the world understands the word.All those who really seek to "Love their neighbour as themselves", or\nto return good for evil, the gentle, the kind, and all those who\nrefrain from doing to others the things they would not like to suffer\nthemselves; all these are of necessity found amongst the vanquished;\nbecause only the worst--only those who are aggressive, cunning, selfish\nand mean are fitted to survive.And all these people in numbers three\nand four are so fully occupied in this dreadful struggle to secure a\nlittle, that but few of them pause to inquire why there are not more of\nthe things they are fighting for, or why it is necessary to fight like\nthis at all!\'For a few minutes silence prevailed, each man\'s mind being busy trying\nto think of some objection to the lecturer\'s arguments.\'How could the small number of people in number one and two consume as\nmuch as you\'ve given \'em in your drorin\'?\'\'They don\'t actually consume all of it,\' replied Owen.\'Much of it is\nwantonly wasted.They also make fortunes by selling some of it in\nforeign countries; but they consume a great part of it themselves,\nbecause the amount of labour expended on the things enjoyed by these\npeople is greater than that expended in the production of the things\nused by the workers.Most of the people who do nothing get the best of\neverything.More than three-quarters of the time of the working\nclasses is spent in producing the things used by the wealthy.Compare\nthe quality and quantity of the clothing possessed by the wife or\ndaughter of a rich man with that of the wife or daughter of a worker.The time and labour spent on producing the one is twenty times greater\nin one case than in the other; and it\'s the same with everything else.Their homes, their clothing, boots, hats, jewellery, and their food.Everything must be of the very best that art or long and painful labour\ncan produce.But for most of those whose labour produces all these\ngood things--anything is considered good enough.For themselves, the\nphilanthropic workers manufacture shoddy cloth--that is, cheap cloth\nmade of old rags and dirt; and shoddy, uncomfortable ironclad boots.If you see a workman wearing a really good suit of clothes you may\nsafely conclude that he is either leading an unnatural life--that is,\nhe is not married--or that he has obtained it from a tallyman on the\nhire system and has not yet paid for it--or that it is someone else\'s\ncast-off suit that he has bought second-hand or had given to him by\nsome charitable person.All the ducks and\ngeese, pheasants, partridges, and all the very best parts of the very\nbest meat--all the soles and the finest plaice and salmon and trout--\'\n\n\'\'Ere chuck it,\' cried Harlow, fiercely.\'We don\'t want to \'ear no\nmore of it,\' and several others protested against the lecturer wasting\ntime on such mere details.\n\n\'--all the very best of everything is reserved exclusively for the\nenjoyment of the people in divisions one and two, while the workers\nsubsist on block ornaments, margarine, adulterated tea, mysterious\nbeer, and are content--only grumbling when they are unable to obtain\neven such fare as this.\'Owen paused and a gloomy silence followed, but suddenly Crass\nbrightened up.He detected a serious flaw in the lecturer\'s argument.\'You say the people in one and two gets all the best of everything, but\nwhat about the tramps and beggars?You see, that\'s the proper place for them.They are no better mentally or morally than any of\nthe other loafers in that division; neither are they of any more use.Of course, when we consider them in relation to the amount they consume\nof the things produced by others, they are not so harmful as the other\nloafers, because they consume comparatively little.But all the same\nthey are in their right place in that division.All those people don\'t\nget the same share.The section represents not individuals--but the\nloafer class.\'\'But I thought you said you was goin\' to prove that money was the cause\nof poverty,\' said Easton.\'Can\'t you see that it\'s money that\'s caused\nall these people to lose sight of the true purpose of labour--the\nproduction of the things we need?All these people are suffering from\nthe delusion that it doesn\'t matter what kind of work they do--or\nwhether they merely do nothing--so long as they get MONEY for doing it.Under the present extraordinary system, that\'s the only object they\nhave in view--to get money.Their ideas are so topsy-turvey that they\nregard with contempt those who are engaged in useful work!With the\nexception of criminals and the poorer sort of loafers, the working\nclasses are considered to be the lowest and least worthy in the\ncommunity.Those who manage to get money for doing something other\nthan productive work are considered more worthy of respect on that\naccount.Those who do nothing themselves, but get money out of the\nlabour of others, are regarded as being more worthy still!But the\nones who are esteemed most of all and honoured above all the rest, are\nthose who obtain money for doing absolutely nothing!\'\'But I can\'t see as that proves that money is the cause of poverty,\'\nsaid Easton.\'The people in number four produce everything,\ndon\'t they?\'\'Yes; we knows all about that,\' interrupted Harlow.\'But they gets\npaid for it, don\'t they?\'Yes, and what does their wages consist of?\'\'Why, money, of course,\' replied Harlow, impatiently.And what do they do with their money when they get it?Do they eat it,\nor drink it, or wear it?\'At this apparently absurd question several of those who had hitherto\nbeen attentive listeners laughed derisively; it was really very\ndifficult to listen patiently to such nonsense.\'Of course they don\'t,\' answered Harlow scornfully.\'They buy the\nthings they want with it.\'\'Do you think that most of them manage to save a part of their\nwages--put it away in the bank.\'\'Well, I can speak for meself,\' replied Harlow amid laughter.\'It\ntakes me all my bloody time to pay my rent and other expenses and to\nkeep my little lot in shoe leather, and it\'s dam little I spend on\nbeer; p\'r\'aps a tanner or a bob a week at the most.\'\'A single man can save money if he likes,\' said Slyme.\'I\'m not speaking of single men,\' replied Owen.\'I\'m referring to\nthose who live natural lives.\'\'What about all the money what\'s in the Post Office Savings Bank, and\nBuilding and Friendly Societies?\'\'A very large part of that belongs to people who are in business, or\nwho have some other source of income than their own wages.There are\nsome exceptionally fortunate workers who happen to have good situations\nand higher wages than the ordinary run of workmen.Then there are some\nwho are so placed--by letting lodgings, for instance--that they are\nable to live rent free.Others whose wives go out to work; and others\nagain who have exceptional jobs and work a lot of overtime--but these\nare all exceptional cases.\'\'I say as no married workin\' man can save any money at all!\'shouted\nHarlow, \'not unless \'e goes without some of even the few things we are\nable to get--and makes \'is wife and kids go without as well.\'\'\'Ear, \'ear,\' said everybody except Crass and Slyme, who were both\nthrifty working men, and each of them had some money saved in one or\nother of the institutions mentioned.\'Then that means,\' said Owen, \'that means that the wages the people in\ndivision four receive is not equivalent to the work they do.\'\'Why the \'ell don\'t yer talk\nplain English without draggin\' in a lot of long words wot nobody can\'t\nunderstand?\'\'I mean this,\' replied Owen, speaking very slowly.\'Everything is\nproduced by the people in number four.In return for their work they\nare given--Money, and the things they have made become the property of\nthe people who do nothing.Then, as the money is of no use, the\nworkers go to shops and give it away in exchange for some of the things\nthey themselves have made.They spend--or give back--ALL their wages;\nbut as the money they got as wages is not equal in value to the things\nthey produced, they find that they are only able to buy back a VERY\nSMALL PART.So you see that these little discs of metal--this\nMoney--is a device for enabling those who do not work to rob the\nworkers of the greater part of the fruits of their toil.\'The silence that ensued was broken by Crass.\'It sounds very pretty,\' he sneered, \'but I can\'t make no \'ead or tail\nof it, meself.\'\'The producing class--these people in number\nfour are supposed to be paid for their work.Their wages are supposed\nto be equal in value to their work.If it were, by\nspending all their wages, the producing class would be able to buy back\nAll they had produced.\'Owen ceased speaking and silence once more ensued.No one gave any\nsign of understanding, or of agreeing or of disagreeing with what he\nhad said.Barrington\'s pipe had\ngone out during the argument.He relit it from the fire with a piece\nof twisted paper.\'If their wages were really equal in value to the product of their\nlabour,\' Owen repeated, \'they would be able to buy back not a small\npart--but the Whole.\'...At this, a remark from Bundy caused a shout of laughter, and when\nWantley added point to the joke by making a sound like the discharge of\na pistol the merriment increased tenfold.\'Well, that\'s done it,\' remarked Easton, as he got up and opened the\nwindow.\'It\'s about time you was buried, if the smell\'s anything to go by,\'\nsaid Harlow, addressing Wantley, who laughed and appeared to think he\nhad distinguished himself.\'But even if we include the whole of the working classes,\' continued\nOwen, \'that is, the people in number three as well as those in number\nfour, we find that their combined wages are insufficient to buy the\nthings made by the producers.The total value of the wealth produced\nin this country during the last year was L1,800,000,000, and the total\namount paid in wages during the same period was only L600,000,000.In\nother words, by means of the Money Trick, the workers were robbed of\ntwo-thirds of the value of their labour.All the people in numbers\nthree and four are working and suffering and starving and fighting in\norder that the rich people in numbers one and two may live in luxury,\nand do nothing.These are the wretches who cause poverty: they not\nonly devour or waste or hoard the things made by the worker, but as\nsoon as their own wants are supplied--they compel the workers to cease\nworking and prevent them producing the things they need.cried Owen, his usually pale face flushing red and his eyes\nshining with sudden anger,\'most of these people do not deserve to be\ncalled human beings at all!They know that whilst\nthey are indulging in pleasures of every kind--all around them men and\nwomen and little children are existing in want or dying of hunger.\'The silence which followed was at length broken by Harlow:\n\n\'You say the workers is entitled to all they produce, but you forget\nthere\'s the raw materials to pay for.\'Of course the workers don\'t create the raw materials,\' replied Owen.\'But I am not aware that the capitalists or the landlords do so either.The raw materials exist in abundance in and on the earth, but they are\nof no use until labour has been applied to them.\'\'But then, you see, the earth belongs to the landlords!\'cried Crass,\nunguardedly.\'I know that; and of course you think it\'s right that the whole country\nshould belong to a few people--\'\n\n\'I must call the lecturer to horder,\' interrupted Philpot.\'The land\nquestion is not before the meeting at present.\'\'You talk about the producers being robbed of most of the value of what\nthey produce,\' said Harlow, \'but you must remember that it ain\'t all\nproduced by hand labour.What about the things what\'s made by\nmachinery?\'\'The machines themselves were made by the workers,\' returned Owen, \'but\nof course they do not belong to the workers, who have been robbed of\nthem by means of the Money Trick.\'\'That\'s more than you or I or anyone else can say,\' returned Owen, \'but\nit certainly wasn\'t the wealthy loafer class, or the landlords, or the\nemployers.Most of the men who invented the machinery lived and died\nunknown, in poverty and often in actual want.The inventors too were\nrobbed by the exploiter-of-labour class.There are no men living at\npresent who can justly claim to have invented the machinery that exists\ntoday.The most they can truthfully say is that they have added to or\nimproved upon the ideas of those who lived and worked before them.Even Watt and Stevenson merely improved upon steam engines and\nlocomotives already existing.Your question has really nothing to do\nwith the subject we are discussing: we are only trying to find out why\nthe majority of people have to go short of the benefits of\ncivilization.One of the causes is--the majority of the population are\nengaged in work that does not produce those things; and most of what IS\nproduced is appropriated and wasted by those who have no right to it.If you walk through the streets of a\ntown or a city, and look around, Everything that you can\nsee--Factories, Machinery, Houses, Railways, Tramways, Canals,\nFurniture, Clothing, Food and the very road or pavement you stand upon\nwere all made by the working class, who spend all their wages in buying\nback only a very small part of the things they produce.Therefore what\nremains in the possession of their masters represents the difference\nbetween the value of the work done and the wages paid for doing it.This systematic robbery has been going on for generations, the value of\nthe accumulated loot is enormous, and all of it, all the wealth at\npresent in the possession of the rich, is rightly the property of the\nworking class--it has been stolen from them by means of the Money\nTrick.\'...The men stared with\npuzzled, uncomfortable looks alternately at each other and at the\ndrawings on the wall.They were compelled to do a little thinking on\ntheir own account, and it was a process to which they were\nunaccustomed.In their infancy they had been taught to distrust their\nown intelligence and to leave \'thinking\' to their \'pastors\' and masters\nand to their \'betters\' generally.All their lives they had been true\nto this teaching, they had always had blind, unreasoning faith in the\nwisdom and humanity of their pastors and masters.That was the reason\nwhy they and their children had been all their lives on the verge of\nstarvation and nakedness, whilst their \'betters\'--who did nothing but\nthe thinking--went clothed in purple and fine linen and fared\nsumptuously every day.Several men had risen from their seats and were attentively studying\nthe diagrams Owen had drawn on the wall; and nearly all the others were\nmaking the same mental efforts--they were trying to think of something\nto say in defence of those who robbed them of the fruits of their toil.\'I don\'t see no bloody sense in always runnin\' down the rich,\' said\nHarlow at last.\'There\'s always been rich and poor in the world and\nthere always will be.\'\'It says in the Bible that the poor shall\nalways be with us.\'\'What the bloody \'ell kind of system do you think we ought to \'ave?\'\'If everything\'s wrong, \'ow\'s it goin\' to be altered?\'At this, everybody brightened up again, and exchanged looks of\nsatisfaction and relief.It wasn\'t necessary to think\nabout these things at all!Nothing could ever be altered: it had\nalways been more or less the same, and it always would be.\'It seems to me that you all HOPE it is impossible to alter it,\' said\nOwen.\'Without trying to find out whether it could be done, you\npersuade yourselves that it is impossible, and then, instead of being\nsorry, you\'re glad!\'Some of them laughed in a silly, half-ashamed way.\'How do YOU reckon it could be altered?\'\'The way to alter it is, first to enlighten the people as to the real\ncause of their sufferings, and then--\'\n\n\'Well,\' interrupted Crass, with a self-satisfied chuckle, \'it\'ll take a\nbetter bloody man than you to enlighten ME!\'\'I don\'t want to be henlightened into Darkness!\'\'But what sort of System do you propose, then?\'\'After you\'ve got \'em all enlightened--if you don\'t believe in sharing\nout all the money equal, how ARE you goin\' to alter it?\'\'I don\'t know \'ow \'e\'s goin\' to alter it,\' sneered Crass, looking at\nhis watch and standing up, \'but I do know what the time is--two minits\npast one!\'\'The next lecture,\' said Philpot, addressing the meeting as they all\nprepared to return to work, \'the next lecture will be postponded till\ntomorrer at the usual time, when it will be my painful dooty to call\nupon Mr Owen to give \'is well-known and most hobnoxious address\nentitled "Work and how to avoid it."Hall them as wants to be\nhenlightened kindly attend.\'\'Or hall them as don\'t get the sack tonight,\' remarked Easton grimly.Chapter 26\n\nThe Slaughter\n\n\nDuring the afternoon, Rushton and Sweater visited the house, the latter\nhaving an appointment to meet there a gardener to whom he wished to\ngive instructions concerning the laying out of the grounds, which had\nbeen torn up for the purpose of putting in the new drains.Sweater had\nalready arranged with the head gardener of the public park to steal\nsome of the best plants from that place and have them sent up to \'The\nCave\'.These plants had been arriving in small lots for about a week.They must have been brought there either in the evening after the men\nleft off or very early in the morning before they came.The two\ngentlemen remained at the house for about half an hour and as they went\naway the mournful sound of the Town Hall bell--which was always tolled\nto summon meetings of the Council--was heard in the distance, and the\nhands remarked to each other that another robbery was about to be\nperpetrated.Hunter did not come to the job again that day: he had been sent by\nRushton to price some work for which the firm was going to tender an\nestimate.There was only one person who felt any regret at his\nabsence, and that was Mrs White--Bert\'s mother, who had been working at\n\'The Cave\' for several days, scrubbing the floors.As a rule, Hunter\npaid her wages every night, and on this occasion she happened to need\nthe money even more than usual.As leaving off time drew near, she\nmentioned the matter to Crass, who advised her to call at the office on\nher way home and ask the young lady clerk for the money.As Hunter did\nnot appear, she followed the foreman\'s advice.When she reached the shop Rushton was just coming out.She explained\nto him what she wanted and he instructed Mr Budd to tell Miss Wade to\npay her.The shopman accordingly escorted her to the office at the\nback of the shop, and the young lady book-keeper--after referring to\nformer entries to make quite certain of the amount, paid her the sum\nthat Hunter had represented as her wages, the same amount that Miss\nWade had on the previous occasions given him to pay the charwoman.When\nMrs White got outside she found that she held in her hand half a crown\ninstead of the two shillings she usually received from Mr Hunter.At\nfirst she felt inclined to take it back, but after some hesitation she\nthought it better to wait until she saw Hunter, when she could tell him\nabout it; but the next morning when she saw the disciple at \'The Cave\'\nhe broached the subject first, and told her that Miss Wade had made a\nmistake.And that evening when he paid her, he deducted the sixpence\nfrom the usual two shillings.The lecture announced by Philpot was not delivered.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Anxiously awaiting\nthe impending slaughter the men kept tearing into it as usual, for they\ngenerally keep working in the usual way, each one trying to outdo the\nothers so as not to lose his chance of being one of the lucky one...\n\nMisery now went round and informed all the men with the exception of\nCrass, Owen, Slyme and Sawkins--that they would have to stand off that\nnight.He told them that the firm had several jobs in view--work they\nhad tendered for and hoped to get, and said they could look round after\nChristmas and he might--possibly--be able to start some of them again.They would be paid at the office tomorrow--Saturday--at one o\'clock as\nusual, but if any of them wished they could have their money tonight.The men thanked him, and most of them said they would come for their\nwages at the usual pay-time, and would call round as he suggested,\nafter the holidays, to see if there was anything to do.In all, fifteen men--including Philpot, Harlow, Easton and Ned Dawson,\nwere to\'stand off\' that night.They took their dismissal stolidly,\nwithout any remark, some of them even with an affectation of\nindifference, but there were few attempts at conversation afterwards.The little work that remained to be done they did in silence, every man\noppressed by the same terror--the dread of the impending want, the\nprivation and unhappiness that they knew they and their families would\nhave to suffer during the next few months.Bundy and his mate Dawson were working in the kitchen fixing the new\nrange in place of the old one which they had taken out.They had been\nengaged on this job all day, and their hands and faces and clothes were\ncovered with soot, which they had also contrived to smear and dab all\nover the surfaces of the doors and other woodwork in the room, much to\nthe indignation of Crass and Slyme, who had to wash it all off before\nthey could put on the final coat of paint.\'You can\'t help makin\' a little mess on a job of this kind, you know,\'\nremarked Bundy, as he was giving the finishing touches to the work,\nmaking good the broken parts of the wall with cement, whilst his mate\nwas clearing away the debris.\'Yes; but there\'s no need to claw \'old of the bloody doors every time\nyou goes in and out,\' snarled Crass, \'and you could \'ave put yer tools\non the floor instead of makin\' a bench of the dresser.\'\'You can \'ave the bloody place all to yerself in about five minutes,\'\nreplied Bundy, as he assisted to lift a sack of cement weighing about\ntwo hundredweight on to Dawson\'s back.When they had cleared away all the dirt and fragments of bricks and\nmortar, while Crass and Slyme proceeded with the painting, Bundy and\nDawson loaded up their hand-cart with the old range and the bags of\nunused cement and plaster, which they took back to the yard.Meantime,\nMisery was wandering about the house and gounds like an evil spirit\nseeking rest and finding none.He stood for some time gloomily\nwatching the four gardeners, who were busily at work laying strips of\nturf, mowing the lawn, rolling the gravel paths and trimming the trees\nand bushes.The boy Bert, Philpot, Harlow, Easton and Sawkins were\nloading a hand-cart with ladders and empty paint-pots to return to the\nyard.Just as they were setting out, Misery stopped them, remarking\nthat the cart was not half loaded--he said it would take a month to get\nall the stuff away if they went on like that; so by his directions they\nplaced another long ladder on top of the pile and once more started on\ntheir way, but before they had gone two dozen yards one of the wheels\nof the cart collapsed and the load was scattered over the roadway.Bert was at the same side of the cart as the wheel that broke and he\nwas thrown violently to the ground, where he lay half stunned, in the\nmidst of the ladders and planks.When they got him out they were\nastonished to find that, thanks to the special Providence that watches\nover all small boys, he was almost unhurt--just a little dazed, that\nwas all; and by the time Sawkins returned with another cart, Bert was\nable to help to gather up the fallen paint-pots and to accompany the\nmen with the load to the yard.At the corner of the road they paused\nto take a last look at the \'job\'.said Harlow, tragically, extending his arm towards\nthe house.A job that if they\'d only have let us do\nit properly, couldn\'t \'ave been done with the number of \'ands we\'ve\n\'ad, in less than four months; and there it is, finished, messed up,\nslobbered over and scamped, in nine weeks!\'\'Yes, and now we can all go to \'ell,\' said Philpot, gloomily.At the yard they found Bundy and his mate, Ned Dawson, who helped them\nto hang up the ladders in their usual places.Philpot was glad to get\nout of assisting to do this, for he had contracted a rather severe\nattack of rheumatism when working outside at the \'Cave\'.Whilst the\nothers were putting the ladders away he assisted Bert to carry the\npaint-pots and buckets into the paint shop, and while there he filled a\nsmall medicine bottle he had brought with him for the purpose, with\nturpentine from the tank.He wanted this stuff to rub into his\nshoulders and legs, and as he secreted the bottle in the inner pocket\nof his coat, he muttered: \'This is where we gets some of our own back.\'They took the key of the yard to the office and as they separated to go\nhome Bundy suggested that the best thing they could do would be to sew\ntheir bloody mouths up for a few months, because there was not much\nprobability of their getting another job until about March.The next morning while Crass and Slyme were finishing inside, Owen\nwrote the two gates.On the front entrance \'The Cave\' and on the back\n\'Tradesmens Entrance\', in gilded letters.In the meantime, Sawkins and\nBert made several journeys to the Yard with the hand-cart.Crass--working in the kitchen with Slyme--was very silent and\nthoughtful.Ever since the job was started, every time Mr Sweater had\nvisited the house to see what progress was being made, Crass had been\ngrovelling to him in the hope of receiving a tip when the work was\nfinished.He had been very careful to act upon any suggestions that\nSweater had made from time to time and on several occasions had taken a\nlot of trouble to get just the right tints of certain colours, making\nup a number of different shades and combinations, and doing parts of\nthe skirtings or mouldings of rooms in order that Mr Sweater might see\nexactly--before they went on with it--what it would look like when\nfinished.He made a great pretence of deferring to Sweater\'s opinion,\nand assured him that he did not care how much trouble he took as long\nas he--Sweater--was pleased.In fact, it was no trouble at all: it was\na pleasure.As the work neared completion, Crass began to speculate\nupon the probable amount of the donation he would receive as the reward\nof nine weeks of cringing, fawning, abject servility.He thought it\nquite possible that he might get a quid: it would not be too much,\nconsidering all the trouble he had taken.At\nany rate, he felt certain that he was sure to get ten bob; a gentleman\nlike Mr Sweater would never have the cheek to offer less.The more he\nthought about it the more improbable it appeared that the amount would\nbe less than a quid, and he made up his mind that whatever he got he\nwould take good care that none of the other men knew anything about it.HE was the one who had had all the worry of the job, and he was the\nonly one entitled to anything there was to be had.Besides, even if he\ngot a quid, by the time you divided that up amongst a dozen--or even\namongst two or three--it would not be worth having.At about eleven o\'clock Mr Sweater arrived and began to walk over the\nhouse, followed by Crass, who carried a pot of paint and a small brush\nand made believe to be \'touching up\' and finishing off parts of the\nwork.As Sweater went from one room to another Crass repeatedly placed\nhimself in the way in the hope of being spoken to, but Sweater took no\nnotice of him whatever.Once or twice Crass\'s heart began to beat\nquickly as he furtively watched the great man and saw him thrust his\nthumb and finger into his waistcoat pocket, but on each occasion\nSweater withdrew his hand with nothing in it.After a while, observing\nthat the gentleman was about to depart without having spoken, Crass\ndetermined to break the ice himself.\'It\'s a little better weather we\'re \'avin\' now, sir.\'\'I was beginnin\' to be afraid as I shouldn\'t be hable to git\nheverything finished in time for you to move in before Christmas, sir,\'\nCrass continued, \'but it\'s hall done now, sir.\'\'I\'ve kept the fire agoin\' in hall the rooms has you told me, sir,\'\nresumed Crass after a pause.\'I think you\'ll find as the place is nice\nand dry, sir; the honly places as is a bit damp is the kitchen and\nscullery and the other rooms in the basement, sir, but of course that\'s\nnearly halways the case, sir, when the rooms is partly hunderground,\nsir.\'But of course it don\'t matter so much about the basement, sir, because\nit\'s honly the servants what \'as to use it, sir, and even down there\nit\'ll be hall right hin the summer, sir.\'One would scarcely think, from the contemptuous way in which he spoke\nof\'servants\' that Crass\'s own daughter was \'in service\', but such was\nthe case.\'Oh, yes, there\'s no doubt about that,\' replied Sweater as he moved\ntowards the door; \'there\'s no doubt it will be dry enough in the\nsummer.\'Good morning to YOU, sir,\' said Crass, following him.\'I \'opes as\nyou\'re pleased with all the work, sir; everything satisfactory, sir.\'I think it looks very nice; very nice indeed; I\'m very\npleased with it,\' said Sweater affably.\'Good morning, sir,\' replied the foreman with a sickly smile as Sweater\ndeparted.When the other was gone, Crass sat down dejectedly on the bottom step\nof the stairs, overwhelmed with the ruin of his hopes and expectations.He tried to comfort himself with the reflection that all hope was not\nlost, because he would have to come to the house again on Monday and\nTuesday to fix the venetian blinds; but all the same he could not help\nthinking that it was only a very faint hope, for he felt that if\nSweater had intended giving anything he would have done so today; and\nit was very improbable that he would see Sweater on Monday or Tuesday\nat all, for the latter did not usually visit the job in the early part\nof the week.However, Crass made up his mind to hope for the best,\nand, pulling himself together, he presently returned to the kitchen,\nwhere he found Slyme and Sawkins waiting for him.He had not mentioned\nhis hopes of a tip to either of them, but they did not need any telling\nand they were both determined to have their share of whatever he got.demanded Sawkins, going straight to the point.Slyme laughed in a sneering, incredulous way, but Sawkins was inclined\nto be abusive.He averred that he had been watching Crass and Sweater\nand had seen the latter put his thumb and finger into his waistcoat\npocket as he walked into the dining-room, followed by Crass.It took\nthe latter a long time to convince his two workmates of the truth of\nhis own account, but he succeeded at last, and they all three agreed\nthat Old Sweater was a sanguinary rotter, and they lamented over the\ndecay of the good old-fashioned customs.\'Why, at one time o\' day,\' said Crass, \'only a few years ago, if you\nwent to a gentleman\'s \'ouse to paint one or two rooms you could always\nbe sure of a bob or two when you\'d finished.\'By half past twelve everything was squared up, and, having loaded up\nthe hand-cart with all that remained of the materials, dirty paint-pots\nand plant, they all set out together for the yard, to put all the\nthings away before going to the office for their money.Sawkins took\nthe handle of the cart, Slyme and Crass walked at one side and Owen and\nBert at the other.There was no need to push, for the road was\ndownhill most of the way; so much so that they had all to help to hold\nback the cart, which travelled so rapidly that Bert found it difficult\nto keep pace with the others and frequently broke into a trot to\nrecover lost ground, and Crass--being fleshy and bloated with beer,\nbesides being unused to much exertion--began to perspire and soon\nappealed to the others not to let it go so fast--there was no need to\nget done before one o\'clock.Chapter 27\n\nThe March of the Imperialists\n\n\nIt was an unusually fine day for the time of year, and as they passed\nalong the Grand Parade--which faced due south--they felt quite warm.The Parade was crowded with richly dressed and bejewelled loafers,\nwhose countenances in many instances bore unmistakable signs of\ndrunkenness and gluttony.Some of the females had tried to conceal the\nravages of vice and dissipation by coating their faces with powder and\npaint.Mingling with and part of this crowd were a number of\nwell-fed-looking individuals dressed in long garments of black cloth of\nthe finest texture, and broad-brimmed soft felt hats.Most of these\npersons had gold rings on their soft white fingers and glove-like kid\nor calfskin boots on their feet.They belonged to the great army of\nimposters who obtain an easy living by taking advantage of the\nignorance and simplicity of their fellow-men, and pretending to be the\n\'followers\' and\'servants\' of the lowly Carpenter of Nazareth--the Man\nof Sorrows, who had not where to lay His head.None of these black-garbed \'disciples\' were associating with the groups\nof unemployed carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, and painters who\nstood here and there in the carriage-way dressed in mean and shabby\nclothing and with faces pale with privation.Many of these latter were\nknown to our friends with the cart, and nodded to them as they passed.Now and then some of them came over and walked a little distance by\ntheir side, inquiring whether there was any news of another job at\nRushton\'s.When they were about half-way down the Parade, just near the Fountain,\nCrass and his mates encountered a number of men on whose arms were\nwhite bands with the word \'Collector\' in black letters.They carried\ncollecting boxes and accosted the people in the street, begging for\nmoney for the unemployed.These men were a kind of skirmishers for the\nmain body, which could be seen some distance behind.As the procession drew near, Sawkins steered the cart into the kerb and\nhalted as they went past.There were about three hundred men\naltogether, marching four abreast.They carried three large white\nbanners with black letters, \'Thanks to our Subscribers\' \'In aid of\nGenuine Unemployed\', \'The Children must be Fed\'.Although there were a\nnumber of artisans in the procession, the majority of the men belonged\nto what is called the unskilled labourer class.The skilled artisan\ndoes not as a rule take part in such a procession except as a very last\nresource...  And all the time he strives to keep up an appearance of\nbeing well-to-do, and would be highly indignant if anyone suggested\nthat he was really in a condition of abject, miserable poverty.Although he knows that his children are often not so well fed as are\nthe pet dogs and cats of his \'betters\', he tries to bluff his\nneighbours into thinking that he has some mysterious private means of\nwhich they know nothing, and conceals his poverty as if it were a\ncrime.Most of this class of men would rather starve than beg.Consequently not more than a quarter of the men in the procession were\nskilled artisans; the majority were labourers.There was also a sprinkling of those unfortunate outcasts of\nsociety--tramps and destitute, drunken loafers.If the self-righteous\nhypocrites who despise these poor wretches had been subjected to the\nsame conditions, the majority of them would inevitably have become the\nsame as these.Haggard and pale, shabbily or raggedly dressed, their boots broken and\ndown at heel, they slouched past.Some of them stared about with a\ndazed or half-wild expression, but most of them walked with downcast\neyes or staring blankly straight in front of them.They appeared\nutterly broken-spirited, hopeless and ashamed...\n\n\'Anyone can see what THEY are,\' sneered Crass, \'there isn\'t fifty\ngenuine tradesmen in the whole crowd, and most of \'em wouldn\'t work if\nthey \'ad the offer of it.\'\'That\'s just what I was thinkin\',\' agreed Sawkins with a laugh.\'There will be plenty of time to say that when they have been offered\nwork and have refused to do it,\' said Owen.\'This sort of thing does the town a lot of \'arm,\' remarked Slyme; \'it\noughtn\'t to be allowed; the police ought to stop it.It\'s enough to\ndrive all the gentry out of the place!\'\'Bloody disgraceful, I call it,\' said Crass,\'marchin\' along the Grand\nParade on a beautiful day like this, just at the very time when most of\nthe gentry is out enjoyin\' the fresh hair.\'\'I suppose you think they ought to stay at home and starve quietly,\'\nsaid Owen.\'I don\'t see why these men should care what harm they do to\nthe town; the town doesn\'t seem to care much what becomes of THEM.\'\'Do you believe in this sort of thing, then?\'I don\'t believe in begging as a favour for what\none is entitled to demand as a right from the thieves who have robbed\nthem and who are now enjoying the fruits of their labour.From the\nlook of shame on their faces you might think that they were the\ncriminals instead of being the victims.\'\'Well you must admit that most of them is very inferior men,\' said\nCrass with a self-satisfied air.\'There\'s very few mechanics amongst\nem.\'\'They\'re human beings, and they have as much right to live as\nanyone else.What is called unskilled labour is just as necessary and\nuseful as yours or mine.I am no more capable of doing the "unskilled"\nlabour that most of these men do than most of them would be capable of\ndoing my work.\'\'Well, if they was skilled tradesmen, they might find it easier to get\na job,\' said Crass.\'Do you mean to say you think that if all these men could be\ntransformed into skilled carpenters, plasterers, bricklayers, and\npainters, that it would be easier for all those other chaps whom we\npassed a little while ago to get work?Is it possible that you or any\nother sane man can believe anything so silly as that?\'\'If there is not enough work to employ all the mechanics whom we see\nstanding idle about the streets, how would it help these labourers in\nthe procession if they could all become skilled workmen?\'Still Crass did not answer, and neither Slyme nor Sawkins came to his\nassistance.\'If that could be done,\' continued Owen, \'it would simply make things\nworse for those who are already skilled mechanics.A greater number of\nskilled workers--keener competition for skilled workmen\'s jobs--a\nlarger number of mechanics out of employment, and consequently,\nimproved opportunities for employers to reduce wages.That is probably\nthe reason why the Liberal Party--which consists for the most part of\nexploiters of labour--procured the great Jim Scalds to tell us that\nimproved technical education is the remedy for unemployment and\npoverty.\'\'I suppose you think Jim Scalds is a bloody fool, the same as everybody\nelse what don\'t see things YOUR way?\'\'I should think he was a fool if I thought he believed what he says.He says it because he thinks the\nmajority of the working classes are such fools that they will believe\nhim.If he didn\'t think that most of us are fools he wouldn\'t tell us\nsuch a yarn as that.\'\'And I suppose you think as \'is opinion ain\'t far wrong,\' snarled Crass.\'We shall be better able to judge of that after the next General\nElection,\' replied Owen.\'If the working classes again elect a\nmajority of Liberal or Tory landlords and employers to rule over them,\nit will prove that Jim Scalds\' estimate of their intelligence is about\nright.\'\'Well, anyhow,\' persisted Slyme, \'I don\'t think it\'s a right thing that\nthey should be allowed to go marchin\' about like that--driving visitors\nout of the town.\'\'What do you think they ought to do, then?\'\'Let the b--rs go to the bloody workhouse!\'\'But before they could be received there they would have to be\nabsolutely homeless and destitute, and then the ratepayers would have\nto keep them.It costs about twelve shillings a week for each inmate,\nso it seems to me that it would be more sensible and economical for the\ncommunity to employ them on some productive work.\'They had by this time arrived at the yard.The steps and ladders were\nput away in their places and the dirty paint-pots and pails were placed\nin the paint-shop on the bench and on the floor.With what had\npreviously been brought back there were a great many of these things,\nall needing to be cleaned out, so Bert at any rate stood in no danger\nof being out of employment for some time to come.When they were paid at the office, Owen on opening his envelope found\nit contained as usual, a time sheet for the next week, which meant that\nhe was not\'stood off\' although he did not know what work there would\nbe to do.Crass and Slyme were both to go to the \'Cave\' to fix the\nvenetian blinds, and Sawkins also was to come to work as usual.Chapter 28\n\nThe Week before Christmas\n\n\nDuring the next week Owen painted a sign on the outer wall of one of\nthe workshops at the yard, and he also wrote the name of the firm on\nthree of the handcarts.These and other odd jobs kept him employed a few hours every day, so\nthat he was not actually out of work.One afternoon--there being nothing to do--he went home at three\no\'clock, but almost as soon as he reached the house Bert White came\nwith a coffin-plate which had to be written at once.The lad said he\nhad been instructed to wait for it.Nora gave the boy some tea and bread and butter to eat whilst Owen was\ndoing the coffin-plate, and presently Frankie--who had been playing out\nin the street--made his appearance.The two boys were already known to\neach other, for Bert had been there several times before--on errands\nsimilar to the present one, or to take lessons on graining and\nletter-painting from Owen.\'I\'m going to have a party next Monday--after Christmas,\' remarked\nFrankie.\'Mother told me I might ask you if you\'ll come?\'\'All right,\' said Bert; \'and I\'ll bring my Pandoramer.\'No, of course not,\' replied Bert with a superior air.\'It\'s a\nshow, like they have at the Hippodrome or the Circus.\'\'Not very big: it\'s made out of a sugar-box.It\'s\nnot quite finished yet, but I shall get it done this week.There\'s a\nband as well, you know.\'This\' was a large mouth organ which he produced from the inner pocket\nof his coat.Bert accordingly played, and Frankie sang at the top of his voice a\nselection of popular songs, including \'The Old Bull and Bush\', \'Has\nAnyone seen a German Band?\', \'Waiting at the Church\' and\nfinally--possibly as a dirge for the individual whose coffin-plate Owen\nwas writing--\'Goodbye, Mignonette\' and \'I wouldn\'t leave my little\nwooden hut for you\'.\'You don\'t know what\'s in that,\' said Frankie, referring to a large\nearthenware bread-pan which Nora had just asked Owen to help her to\nlift from the floor on to one of the chairs.The vessel in question\nwas covered with a clean white cloth.\'We got the things out of\nthe Christmas Club on Saturday.We\'ve been paying in ever since last\nChristmas.We\'re going to mix it now, and you can have a stir too if\nyou like, for luck.\'Whilst they were stirring the pudding, Frankie several times requested\nthe others to feel his muscle: he said he felt sure that he would soon\nbe strong enough to go out to work, and he explained to Bert that the\nextraordinary strength he possessed was to be attributed to the fact\nthat he lived almost exclusively on porridge and milk.For the rest of the week, Owen continued to work down at the yard with\nSawkins, Crass, and Slyme, painting some of the ladders, steps and\nother plant belonging to the firm.These things had to have two coats\nof paint and the name Rushton & Co.As soon as they\nhad got some of them second-coated, Owen went on with the writing,\nleaving the painting for the others, so as to share the work as fairly\nas possible.Several times during the week one or other of them was\ntaken away to do some other work; once Crass and Slyme had to go and\nwash off and whiten a ceiling somewhere, and several times Sawkins was\nsent out to assist the plumbers.Every day some of the men who had been\'stood off\' called at the yard\nto ask if any other \'jobs\' had \'come in\'.From these callers they\nheard all the news.Old Jack Linden had not succeeded in getting\nanything to do at the trade since he was discharged from Rushton\'s, and\nit was reported that he was trying to earn a little money by hawking\nbloaters from house to house.As for Philpot, he said that he had been\nround to nearly all the firms in the town and none of them had any work\nto speak of.Newman--the man whom the reader will remember was sacked for taking too\nmuch pains with his work--had been arrested and sentenced to a month\'s\nimprisonment because he had not been able to pay his poor rates, and\nthe Board of Guardians were allowing his wife three shillings a week to\nmaintain herself and the three children.Philpot had been to see them,\nand she told him that the landlord was threatening to turn them into\nthe street; he would have seized their furniture and sold it if it had\nbeen worth the expense of the doing.\'I feel ashamed of meself,\' Philpot added in confidence to Owen, \'when\nI think of all the money I chuck away on beer.If it wasn\'t for that,\nI shouldn\'t be in such a hole meself now, and I might be able to lend\n\'em a \'elpin\' \'and.\'\'It ain\'t so much that I likes the beer, you know,\' he continued; \'it\'s\nthe company.When you ain\'t got no \'ome, in a manner o\' speakin\', like\nme, the pub\'s about the only place where you can get a little\nenjoyment.But you ain\'t very welcome there unless you spends your\nmoney.\'\'Is the three shillings all they have to live on?\'\'I think she goes out charin\' when she can get it,\' replied Philpot,\n\'but I don\'t see as she can do a great deal o\' that with three young\n\'uns to look after, and from what I hear of it she\'s only just got over\na illness and ain\'t fit to do much.\'\'I\'ll tell you what,\' said Philpot.\'I\'ve been thinking we might get\nup a bit of a subscription for \'em.There\'s several chaps in work what\nknows Newman, and if they was each to give a trifle we could get enough\nto pay for a Christmas dinner, anyway.I\'ve brought a sheet of\nfoolscap with me, and I was goin\' to ask you to write out the heading\nfor me.\'As there was no pen available at the workshop, Philpot waited till four\no\'clock and then accompanied Owen home, where the heading of the list\nwas written.Owen put his name down for a shilling and Philpot his for\na similar amount.Philpot stayed to tea and accepted an invitation to spend Christmas Day\nwith them, and to come to Frankie\'s party on the Monday after.The next morning Philpot brought the list to the yard and Crass and\nSlyme put their names down for a shilling each, and Sawkins for\nthreepence, it being arranged that the money was to be paid on\npayday--Christmas Eve.In the meantime, Philpot was to see as many as\nhe could of those who were in work, at other firms and get as many\nsubscriptions as possible.At pay-time on Christmas Eve Philpot turned up with the list and Owen\nand the others paid him the amounts they had put their names down for.From other men he had succeeded in obtaining nine and sixpence, mostly\nin sixpences and threepences.Some of this money he had already\nreceived, but for the most part he had made appointments with the\nsubscribers to call at their homes that evening.It was decided that\nOwen should accompany him and also go with him to hand over the money\nto Mrs Newman.It took them nearly three hours to get in all the money, for the places\nthey had to go to were in different localities, and in one or two cases\nthey had to wait because their man had not yet come home, and sometimes\nit was not possible to get away without wasting a little time in talk.In three instances those who had put their names down for threepence\nincreased the amount to sixpence and one who had promised sixpence gave\na shilling.There were two items of threepence each which they did not\nget at all, the individuals who had put their names down having gone\nupon the drunk.Another cause of delay was that they met or called on\nseveral other men who had not yet been asked for a subscription, and\nthere were several others--including some members of the Painters\nSociety whom Owen had spoken to during the week--who had promised him\nto give a subscription.In the end they succeeded in increasing the\ntotal amount to nineteen and ninepence, and they then put\nthree-halfpence each to make it up to a pound.The Newmans lived in a small house the rent of which was six shillings\nper week and taxes.To reach the house one had to go down a dark and\nnarrow passage between two shops, the house being in a kind of well,\nsurrounded by the high walls of the back parts of larger\nbuildings--chiefly business premises and offices.The air did not\ncirculate very freely in this place, and the rays of the sun never\nreached it.In the summer the atmosphere was close and foul with the\nvarious odours which came from the back-yards of the adjoining\nbuildings, and in the winter it was dark and damp and gloomy, a\nculture-ground for bacteria and microbes.The majority of those who\nprofess to be desirous of preventing and curing the disease called\nconsumption must be either hypocrites or fools, for they ridicule the\nsuggestion that it is necessary first to cure and prevent the poverty\nthat compels badly clothed and half-starved human beings to sleep in\nsuch dens as this.The front door opened into the living-room or, rather, kitchen, which\nwas dimly lighted by a small paraffin lamp on the table, where were\nalso some tea-cups and saucers, each of a different pattern, and the\nremains of a loaf of bread.The wallpaper was old and discoloured; a\nfew almanacs and unframed prints were fixed to the walls, and on the\nmantelshelf were some cracked and worthless vases and ornaments.At\none time they had possessed a clock and an overmantel and some framed\npictures, but they had all been sold to obtain money to buy food.Nearly everything of any value had been parted with for the same\nreason--the furniture, the pictures, the bedclothes, the carpet and the\noilcloth, piece by piece, nearly everything that had once constituted\nthe home--had been either pawned or sold to buy food or to pay rent\nduring the times when Newman was out of work--periods that had recurred\nduring the last few years with constantly increasing frequency and\nduration.Now there was nothing left but these few old broken chairs\nand the deal table which no one would buy; and upstairs, the wretched\nbedsteads and mattresses whereon they slept at night, covering\nthemselves with worn-out remnants of blankets and the clothes they wore\nduring the day.In answer to Philpot\'s knock, the door was opened by a little girl\nabout seven years old, who at once recognized Philpot, and called out\nhis name to her mother, and the latter came also to the door, closely\nfollowed by two other children, a little, fragile-looking girl about\nthree, and a boy about five years of age, who held on to her skirt and\npeered curiously at the visitors.Mrs Newman was about thirty, and her\nappearance confirmed the statement of Philpot that she had only just\nrecovered from an illness; she was very white and thin and\ndejected-looking.When Philpot explained the object of their visit and\nhanded her the money, the poor woman burst into tears, and the two\nsmaller children--thinking that this piece of paper betokened some\nfresh calamity--began to cry also.They remembered that all their\ntroubles had been preceded by the visits of men who brought pieces of\npaper, and it was rather difficult to reassure them.That evening, after Frankie was asleep, Owen and Nora went out to do\ntheir Christmas marketing.They had not much money to spend, for Owen\nhad brought home only seventeen shillings.He had worked thirty-three\nhours--that came to nineteen and threepence--one shilling and\nthreehalfpence had gone on the subscription list, and he had given the\nrest of the coppers to a ragged wreck of a man who was singing a hymn\nin the street.The other shilling had been deducted from his wages in\nrepayment of a\'sub\' he had had during the week.There was a great deal to be done with this seventeen shillings.First\nof all there was the rent--seven shillings--that left ten.Then there\nwas the week\'s bread bill--one and threepence.They had a pint of milk\nevery day, chiefly for the boy\'s sake--that came to one and two.Then\nthere was one and eight for a hundredweight of coal that had been\nbought on credit.Fortunately, there were no groceries to buy, for the\nthings they had obtained with their Christmas Club money would be more\nthan sufficient for the ensuing week.Frankie\'s stockings were all broken and beyond mending, so it was\npositively necessary to buy him another pair for fivepence\nthree-farthings.These stockings were not much good--a pair at double\nthe price would have been much cheaper, for they would have lasted\nthree or four times longer; but they could not afford to buy the dearer\nkind.It was just the same with the coal: if they had been able to\nafford it, they could have bought a ton of the same class of coal for\ntwenty-six shillings, but buying it as they did, by the hundredweight,\nthey had to pay at the rate of thirty-three shillings and fourpence a\nton.It was just the same with nearly everything else.This is how\nthe working classes are robbed.Although their incomes are the lowest,\nthey are compelled to buy the most expensive articles--that is, the\nlowest-priced articles.Everybody knows that good clothes, boots or\nfurniture are really the cheapest in the end, although they cost more\nmoney at first; but the working classes can seldom or never afford to\nbuy good things; they have to buy cheap rubbish which is dear at any\nprice.Six weeks previously Owen bought a pair of second-hand boots for three\nshillings and they were now literally falling to pieces.Nora\'s shoes\nwere in much the same condition, but, as she said, it did not matter so\nmuch about hers because there was no need for her to go out if the\nweather were not fine.In addition to the articles already mentioned, they had to spend\nfourpence for half a gallon of paraffin oil, and to put sixpence into\nthe slot of the gas-stove.This reduced the money to five and\nsevenpence farthing, and of this it was necessary to spend a shilling\non potatoes and other vegetables.They both needed some new underclothing, for what they had was so old\nand worn that it was quite useless for the purpose it was supposed to\nserve; but there was no use thinking of these things, for they had now\nonly four shillings and sevenpence farthing left, and all that would be\nneeded for toys.They had to buy something special for Frankie for\nChristmas, and it would also be necessary to buy something for each of\nthe children who were coming to the party on the following Monday.Fortunately, there was no meat to buy, for Nora had been paying into\nthe Christmas Club at the butcher\'s as well as at the grocer\'s.They stopped to look at the display of toys at Sweater\'s Emporium.For\nseveral days past Frankie had been talking of the wonders contained in\nthese windows, so they wished if possible to buy him something here.They recognized many of the things from the description the boy had\ngiven of them, but nearly everything was so dear that for a long time\nthey looked in vain for something it would be possible to buy.\'That\'s the engine he talks so much about,\' said Non, indicating a\nmodel railway locomotive; that one marked five shillings.\'\'It might just as well be marked five pounds as far as we\'re\nconcerned,\' replied Owen.As they were speaking, one of the salesmen appeared at the back of the\nwindow and, reaching forward, removed the engine.It was probably the\nlast one of the kind and had evidently just been sold.Owen and Nora\nexperienced a certain amount of consolation in knowing that even if\nthey had the money they would not have been able to buy it.After lengthy consideration, they decided on a clockwork engine at a\nshilling, but the other toys they resolved to buy at a cheaper shop.Nora went into the Emporium to get the toy and whilst Owen was waiting\nfor her Mr and Mrs Rushton came out.They did not appear to see Owen,\nwho observed that the shape of one of several parcels they carried\nsuggested that it contained the engine that had been taken from the\nwindow a little while before.When Nora returned with her purchase, they went in search of a cheaper\nplace and after a time they found what they wanted.For sixpence they\nbought a cardboard box that had come all the way from Japan and\ncontained a whole family of dolls--father, mother and four children of\ndifferent sizes.A box of paints, threepence: a sixpenny tea service,\na threepenny drawing slate, and a rag doll, sixpence.On their way home they called at a greengrocer\'s where Owen had ordered\nand paid for a small Christmas tree a few weeks before; and as they\nwere turning the corner of the street where they lived they met Crass,\nhalf-drunk, with a fine fat goose slung over his shoulder by its neck.He greeted Owen jovially and held up the bird for their inspection.\'Not a bad tanner\'s-worth, eh?\'I won this and a box of cigars--fifty--for a tanner, and the\nother one I got out of the Club at our Church Mission \'all: threepence\na week for twenty-eight weeks; that makes seven bob.But,\' he added,\nconfidentially,\'\'you couldn\'t buy \'em for that price in a shop, you\nknow.They costs the committee a good bit more nor that--wholesale;\nbut we\'ve got some rich gents on our committee and they makes up the\ndifference,\' and with a nod and a cunning leer he lurched off.Frankie was sleeping soundly when they reached home, and so was the\nkitten, which was curled up on the quilt on the foot of the bed.After\nthey had had some supper, although it was after eleven o\'clock, Owen\nfixed the tree in a large flower-pot that had served a similar purpose\nbefore, and Nora brought out from the place where it had been stored\naway since last Christmas a cardboard box containing a lot of\nglittering tinsel ornaments--globes of silvered or gilded or painted\nglass, birds, butterflies and stars.Some of these things had done\nduty three Christmases ago and although they were in some instances\nslightly tarnished most of them were as good as new.In addition to\nthese and the toys they had bought that evening they had a box of\nbon-bons and a box of small  wax candles, both of which had\nformed part of the things they got from the grocer\'s with the Christmas\nClub money; and there were also a lot of little  paper bags of\nsweets, and a number of sugar and chocolate toys and animals which had\nbeen bought two or three at a time for several weeks past and put away\nfor this occasion.There was something suitable for each child that\nwas coming, with the exception of Bert White; they had intended to\ninclude a sixpenny pocket knife for him in their purchases that\nevening, but as they had not been able to afford this Owen decided to\ngive him an old set of steel graining combs which he knew the lad had\noften longed to possess.The tin case containing these tools was\naccordingly wrapped in some red tissue paper and hung on the tree with\nthe other things.They moved about as quietly as possible so as not to disturb those who\nwere sleeping in the rooms beneath, because long before they were\nfinished the people in the other parts of the house had all retired to\nrest, and silence had fallen on the deserted streets outside.As they\nwere putting the final touches to their work the profound stillness of\nthe night was suddenly broken by the voices of a band of carol-singers.The sound overwhelmed them with memories of other and happier times,\nand Nora stretched out her hands impulsively to Owen, who drew her\nclose to his side.They had been married just over eight years, and although during all\nthat time they had never been really free from anxiety for the future,\nyet on no previous Christmas had they been quite so poor as now.During\nthe last few years periods of unemployment had gradually become more\nfrequent and protracted, and the attempt he had made in the early part\nof the year to get work elsewhere had only resulted in plunging them\ninto even greater poverty than before.But all the same there was much\nto be thankful for: poor though they were, they were far better off\nthan many thousands of others: they still had food and shelter, and\nthey had each other and the boy.Before they went to bed Owen carried the tree into Frankie\'s bedroom\nand placed it so that he would be able to see it in all its glittering\nglory as soon as he awoke on Christmas morning.Chapter 29\n\nThe Pandorama\n\n\nAlthough the party was not supposed to begin till six o\'clock, Bert\nturned up at half past four, bringing the \'Pandoramer\' with him.At about half past five the other guests began to arrive.Elsie and\nCharley Linden came first, the girl in a pretty blue frock trimmed with\nwhite lace, and Charley resplendent in a new suit, which, like his\nsister\'s dress, had been made out of somebody\'s cast-off clothes that\nhad been given to their mother by a visiting lady.It had taken Mrs\nLinden many hours of hard work to contrive these garments; in fact,\nmore time than the things were worth, for although they looked all\nright--especially Elsie\'s--the stuff was so old that it would not wear\nvery long: but this was the only way in which she could get clothes for\nthe children at all: she certainly could not afford to buy them any.So she spent hours and hours making things that she knew would fall to\npieces almost as soon as they were made.After these came Nellie, Rosie and Tommy Newman.These presented a\nmuch less prosperous appearance than the other two.Their mother was\nnot so skilful at contriving new clothes out of old.Nellie was\nwearing a grown-up woman\'s blouse, and by way of ulster she had on an\nold-fashioned jacket of thick cloth with large pearl buttons.This was\nalso a grown-up woman\'s garment: it was shaped to fit the figure of a\ntall woman with wide shoulders and a small waist; consequently, it did\nnot fit Nellie to perfection.The waist reached below the poor child\'s\nhips.Tommy was arrayed in the patched remains of what had once been a good\nsuit of clothes.They had been purchased at a second-hand shop last\nsummer and had been his \'best\' for several months, but they were now\nmuch too small for him.Little Rosie--who was only just over three years old--was better off\nthan either of the other two, for she had a red cloth dress that fitted\nher perfectly: indeed, as the district visitor who gave it to her\nmother had remarked, it looked as if it had been made for her.\'It\'s not much to look at,\' observed Nellie, referring to her big\njacket, but all the same we was very glad of it when the rain came on.\'The coat was so big that by withdrawing her arms from the sleeves and\nusing it as a cloak or shawl she had managed to make it do for all\nthree of them.Tommy\'s boots were so broken that the wet had got in and saturated his\nstockings, so Nora made him take them all off and wear some old ones of\nFrankie\'s whilst his own were drying at the fire.Philpot, with two large paper bags full of oranges and nuts, arrived\njust as they were sitting down to tea--or rather cocoa--for with the\nexception of Bert all the children expressed a preference for the\nlatter beverage.Bert would have liked to have cocoa also, but hearing\nthat the grown-ups were going to have tea, he thought it would be more\nmanly to do the same.This question of having tea or cocoa for tea\nbecame a cause of much uproarious merriment on the part of the\nchildren, who asked each other repeatedly which they liked best, \'tea\ntea?\'They thought it so funny that they said it over\nand over again, screaming with laughter all the while, until Tommy got\na piece of cake stuck in his throat and became nearly black in the\nface, and then Philpot had to turn him upside down and punch him in the\nback to save him from choking to death.This rather sobered the\nothers, but for some time afterwards whenever they looked at each other\nthey began to laugh afresh because they thought it was such a good joke.When they had filled themselves up with the \'cocoa-tea\' and cakes and\nbread and jam, Elsie Linden and Nellie Newman helped to clear away the\ncups and saucers, and then Owen lit the candles on the Christmas tree\nand distributed the toys to the children, and a little while afterwards\nPhilpot--who had got a funny-looking mask out of one of the\nbon-bons--started a fine game pretending to be a dreadful wild animal\nwhich he called a Pandroculus, and crawling about on all fours, rolled\nhis goggle eyes and growled out he must have a little boy or girl to\neat for his supper.He looked so terrible that although they knew it was only a joke they\nwere almost afraid of him, and ran away laughing and screaming to\nshelter themselves behind Nora or Owen; but all the same, whenever\nPhilpot left off playing, they entreated him to \'be it again\', and so\nhe had to keep on being a Pandroculus, until exhaustion compelled him\nto return to his natural form.After this they all sat round the table and had a game of cards;\n\'Snap\', they called it, but nobody paid much attention to the rules of\nthe game: everyone seemed to think that the principal thing to do was\nto kick up as much row as possible.After a while Philpot suggested a\nchange to \'Beggar my neighbour\', and won quite a lot of cards before\nthey found out that he had hidden all the jacks in the pocket of his\ncoat, and then they mobbed him for a cheat.He might have been\nseriously injured if it had not been for Bert, who created a diversion\nby standing on a chair and announcing that he was about to introduce to\ntheir notice \'Bert White\'s World-famed Pandorama\' as exhibited before\nall the nobility and crowned heads of Europe, England, Ireland and\nScotland, including North America and Wales.Loud cheers greeted the conclusion of Bert\'s speech.The box was\nplaced on the table, which was then moved to the end of the room, and\nthe chairs were ranged in two rows in front.The \'Pandorama\' consisted of a stage-front made of painted cardboard\nand fixed on the front of a wooden box about three feet long by two\nfeet six inches high, and about one foot deep from back to front.The\n\'Show\' was a lot of pictures cut out of illustrated weekly papers and\npasted together, end to end, so as to form a long strip or ribbon.Bert\nhad  all the pictures with water-colours.Just behind the wings of the stage-front at each end of the box--was an\nupright roller, and the long strip of pictures was rolled up on this.The upper ends of the rollers came through the top of the box and had\nhandles attached to them.When these handles were turned the pictures\npassed across the stage, unrolling from one roller and rolling on to\nthe other, and were illuminated by the light of three candles placed\nbehind.The idea of constructing this machine had been suggested to Bert by a\npanorama entertainment he had been to see some time before.\'The Style of the decorations,\' he remarked, alluding to the painted\nstage-front, \'is Moorish.\'He lit the candles at the back of the stage and, having borrowed a\ntea-tray from Nora, desired the audience to take their seats.When\nthey had all done so, he requested Owen to put out the lamp and the\ncandles on the tree, and then he made another speech, imitating the\nmanner of the lecturer at the panorama entertainment before mentioned.\'Ladies and Gentlemen: with your kind permission I am about to\nhinterduce to your notice some pitchers of events in different parts of\nthe world.As each pitcher appears on the stage I will give a short\nexplanation of the subject, and afterwards the band will play a\nsuitable collection of appropriated music, consisting of hymns and all\nthe latest and most popular songs of the day, and the audience is\nkindly requested to join in the chorus.\'Our first scene,\' continued Bert as he turned the handles and brought\nthe picture into view,\'represents the docks at Southampton; the\nmagnificent steamer which you see lying alongside the shore is the ship\nwhich is waiting to take us to foreign parts.As we have already paid\nour fare, we will now go on board and set sail.\'As an accompaniment to this picture Bert played the tune of \'Goodbye,\nDolly, I must leave you\', and by the time the audience had  finished\nsinging the chorus he had rolled on another scene, which depicted a\ndreadful storm at sea, with a large ship evidently on the point of\nfoundering.The waves were running mountains high and the inky clouds\nwere riven by forked lightning.To increase the terrifying effect,\nBert rattled the tea tray and played \'The Bay of Biscay\', and the\nchildren sung the chorus whilst he rolled the next picture into view.This scene showed the streets of a large city; mounted police with\ndrawn swords were dispersing a crowd: several men had been ridden down\nand were being trampled under the hoofs of the horses, and a number of\nothers were bleeding profusely from wounds on the head and face.\'After a rather stormy passage we arrives safely at the beautiful city\nof Berlin, in Germany, just in time to see a procession of unemployed\nworkmen being charged by the military police.This picture is\nhintitled "Tariff Reform means Work for All".\'As an appropriate musical selection Bert played the tune of a\nwell-known song, and the children sang the words:\n\n        \'To be there!Oh, I knew what it was to be there!And when they tore me clothes,\n        Blacked me eyes and broke me nose,\n        Then I knew what it was to be there!\'During the singing Bert turned the handles backwards and again brought\non the picture of the storm at sea.\'As we don\'t want to get knocked on the \'ed, we clears out of Berlin as\nsoon as we can--whiles we\'re safe--and once more embarks on our gallint\nship\' and after a few more turns of the \'andle we finds ourselves back\nonce more in Merry Hingland, where we see the inside of a blacksmith\'s\nshop with a lot of half-starved women making iron chains.They work\nseventy hours a week for seven shillings.Our next scene is hintitled\n"The Hook and Eye Carders".\'Ere we see the inside of a room in\nSlumtown, with a mother and three children and the old grandmother\nsewin\' hooks and eyes on cards to be sold in drapers\' shops.It ses\nunderneath the pitcher that 384 hooks and 384 eyes has to be joined\ntogether and sewed on cards for one penny.\'While this picture was being rolled away the band played and the\nchildren sang with great enthusiasm:\n\n        \'Rule, Brittania, Brittania rules the waves!Britons, never, never, never shall be slaves!\'\'Our next picture is called "An Englishman\'s Home".\'Ere we see the\ninside of another room in Slumtown, with the father and mother and four\nchildren sitting down to dinner--bread and drippin\' and tea.It ses\nunderneath the pitcher that there\'s Thirteen millions of people in\nEngland always on the verge of starvation.These people that you see\nin the pitcher might be able to get a better dinner than this if it\nwasn\'t that most of the money wot the bloke earns \'as to pay the rent.Again we turns the \'andle and presently we comes to another very\nbeautiful scene--"Early Morning in Trafalgar Square".\'Ere we see a\nlot of Englishmen who have been sleepin\' out all night because they\nain\'t got no \'omes to go to.\'As a suitable selection for this picture, Bert played the tune of a\nmusic-hall song, the words of which were familiar to all the\nyoungsters, who sang at the top of their voices:\n\n        \'I live in Trafalgar Square,\n        With four lions to guard me,\n        Pictures and statues all over the place,\n        Lord Nelson staring me straight in the face,\n        Of course it\'s rather draughty,\n        But still I\'m sure you\'ll agree,\n        If it\'s good enough for Lord Nelson,\n        It\'s quite good enough for me.\'\'Next we \'ave a view of the dining-hall at the Topside Hotel in London,\nwhere we see the tables set for a millionaires\' banquet.The forks and\nspoons is made of solid gold and the plates is made of silver.The\nflowers that you see on the tables and \'angin\' down from the ceilin\'\nand on the walls is worth L2,000 and it cost the bloke wot give the\nsupper over L30,000 for this one beano.A few more turns of the \'andle\nshows us another glorious banquet--the King of Rhineland being\nentertained by the people of England.Next we finds ourselves looking\non at the Lord Mayor\'s supper at the Mansion House.All the fat men\nthat you see sittin\' at the tables is Liberal and Tory Members of\nParlimint.After this we \'ave a very beautiful pitcher hintitled "Four\nfooted Haristocrats".\'Ere you see Lady Slumrent\'s pet dogs sittin\' up\non chairs at their dinner table with white linen napkins tied round\ntheir necks, eatin\' orf silver plates like human people and being\nwaited on by real live waiters in hevening dress.Lady Slumrent is\nvery fond of her pretty pets and she does not allow them to be fed on\nanything but the very best food; they gets chicken, rump steak, mutton\nchops, rice pudding, jelly and custard.\'\'I wished I was a pet dog, don\'t you?\'remarked Tommy Newman to Charley\nLinden.\'Here we see another unemployed procession,\' continued Bert as he\nrolled another picture into sight; \'2,000 able-bodied men who are not\nallowed to work.Next we see the hinterior of a Hindustrial\n\'Ome--Blind children and <DW36>s working for their living.Our next\nscene is called "Cheap Labour".\'Ere we see a lot of small boys about\ntwelve and thirteen years old bein\' served out with their Labour\nStifficats, which gives \'em the right to go to work and earn money to\nhelp their unemployed fathers to pay the slum rent.\'Once more we turns the \'andle and brings on one of our finest scenes.This lovely pitcher is hintitled "The Hangel of Charity", and shows us\nthe beautiful Lady Slumrent seated at the table in a cosy corner of \'er\ncharmin\' boodore, writin\' out a little cheque for the relief of the\npoor of Slumtown.\'Our next scene is called "The Rival Candidates, or, a Scene during the\nGeneral Election".On the left you will observe, standin\' up in a\nmotor car, a swell bloke with a eyeglass stuck in one eye, and a\novercoat with a big fur collar and cuffs, addressing the crowd: this is\nthe Honourable Augustus Slumrent, the Conservative candidate.On the\nother side of the road we see another motor car and another swell bloke\nwith a round pane of glass in one eye and a overcoat with a big fur\ncollar and cuffs, standing up in the car and addressin\' the crowd.This\nis Mr Mandriver, the Liberal candidate.The crowds of shabby-lookin\'\nchaps standin\' round the motor cars wavin\' their \'ats and cheerin\' is\nworkin\' men.Both the candidates is tellin\' \'em the same old story,\nand each of \'em is askin\' the workin\' men to elect \'im to Parlimint,\nand promisin\' to do something or other to make things better for the\nlower horders.\'As an appropriate selection to go with this picture, Bert played the\ntune of a popular song, the words being well known to the children, who\nsang enthusiastically, clapping their hands and stamping their feet on\nthe floor in time with the music:\n\n        \'We\'ve both been there before,\n        Many a time, many a time!We\'ve both been there before,\n        Many a time!To colour his nose and mine,\n        We\'ve both been there before,\n        Many a time, many a time!\'At the conclusion of the singing, Bert turned another picture into view.\'\'Ere we \'ave another election scene.At each side we see the two\ncandidates the same as in the last pitcher.In the middle of the road\nwe see a man lying on the ground, covered with blood, with a lot of\nLiberal and Tory working men kickin\' \'im, jumpin\' on \'im, and stampin\'\non \'is face with their \'obnailed boots.The bloke on the ground is a\nSocialist, and the reason why they\'re kickin\' \'is face in is because \'e\nsaid that the only difference between Slumrent and Mandriver was that\nthey was both alike.\'While the audience were admiring this picture, Bert played another\nwell-known tune, and the children sang the words:\n\n        \'Two lovely black eyes,\n        Oh what a surprise!Only for telling a man he was wrong,\n        Two lovely black eyes.\'Bert continued to turn the handles of the rollers and a long succession\nof pictures passed across the stage, to the delight of the children,\nwho cheered and sang as occasion demanded, but the most enthusiastic\noutburst of all greeted the appearance of the final picture, which was\na portrait of the King.Directly the children saw it--without waiting\nfor the band--they gave three cheers and began to sing the chorus of\nthe National Anthem.John went back to the garden.A round of applause for Bert concluded the Pandorama performance; the\nlamp and the candles of the Christmas tree were relit--for although all\nthe toys had been taken off, the tree still made a fine show with the\nshining glass ornaments--and then they had some more games; blind man\'s\nbuff, a tug-of-war--in which Philpot was defeated with great\nlaughter--and a lot of other games.And when they were tired of these,\neach child\'said a piece\' or sung a song, learnt specially for the\noccasion.The only one who had not come prepared in this respect was\nlittle Rosie, and even she--so as to be the same as the\nothers--insisted on reciting the only piece she knew.Kneeling on the\nhearthrug, she put her hands together, palm to palm, and shutting her\neyes very tightly she repeated the verse she always said every night\nbefore going to bed:\n\n        \'Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,\n        Look on me, a little child.Pity my simplicity,\n        Suffer me to come to Thee.\'Then she stood up and kissed everyone in turn, and Philpot crossed over\nand began looking out of the window, and coughed, and blew his nose,\nbecause a nut that he had been eating had gone down the wrong way.Most of them were by this time quite tired out, so after some supper\nthe party broke up.Although they were nearly all very sleepy, none of\nthem were very willing to go, but they were consoled by the thought of\nanother entertainment to which they were going later on in the\nweek--the Band of Hope Tea and Prize Distribution at the Shining Light\nChapel.Bert undertook to see Elsie and Charley safely home, and Philpot\nvolunteered to accompany Nellie and Tommy Newman, and to carry Rosie,\nwho was so tired that she fell asleep on his shoulder before they left\nthe house.As they were going down the stairs Frankie held a hurried consultation\nwith his mother, with the result that he was able to shout after them\nan invitation to come again next Christmas.Chapter 30\n\nThe Brigands hold a Council of War\n\n\nIt being now what is usually called the festive season--possibly\nbecause at this period of the year a greater number of people are\nsuffering from hunger and cold than at any other time--the reader will\nnot be surprised at being invited to another little party which took\nplace on the day after the one we have just left.The scene was Mr\nSweater\'s office.Mr Sweater was seated at his desk, but with his\nchair swung round to enable him to face his guests--Messrs Rushton,\nDidlum, and Grinder, who were also seated.\'Something will \'ave to be done, and that very soon,\' Grinder was\nsaying.\'We can\'t go on much longer as we\'re doing at present.For my\npart, I think the best thing to do is to chuck up the sponge at once;\nthe company is practically bankrupt now, and the longer we waits the\nworser it will be.\'\'That\'s just my opinion,\' said Didlum dejectedly.\'If we could supply\nthe electric light at the same price as gas, or a little cheaper, we\nmight have some chance; but we can\'t do it.The fact is that the\nmachinery we\'ve got is no dam good; it\'s too small and it\'s wore out,\nconsequently the light we supply is inferior to gas and costs more.\'\'Yes, I think we\'re fairly beaten this time,\' said Rushton.\'Why, even\nif the Gas Coy hadn\'t moved their works beyond the borough boundary,\nstill we shouldn\'t \'ave been hable to compete with \'em.\'\'The truth of the matter is just wot\nDidlum says.Our machinery is too small, it\'s worn hout, and good for\nnothing but to be throwed on the scrap-heap.So there\'s only one thing\nleft to do and that is--go into liquidation.\'\'I don\'t see it,\' remarked Sweater.\'Well, what do you propose, then?\'Pull down the works and\nbuild fresh, and buy some new machinery?And then most likely not make\na do of it after all?You\nwon\'t catch me chuckin\' good money after bad in that way.\'remarked Didlum, very decidedly.\'I\'m not such a fool as to suggest anything\nof that sort,\' he said.\'You seem to forget that I am one of the\nlargest shareholders myself.replied Grinder with a contemptuous laugh in which the\nothers joined.\'Who\'s going to buy the shares of a concern that\'s\npractically bankrupt and never paid a dividend?\'\'I\'ve tried to sell my little lot several times already,\' said Didlum\nwith a sickly smile, \'but nobody won\'t buy \'em.\'repeated Sweater, replying to Grinder.Why shouldn\'t Mugsborough go\nin for Socialism as well as other towns?\'Rushton, Didlum and Grinder fairly gasped for breath: the audacity of\nthe chief\'s proposal nearly paralysed them.\'I\'m afraid we should never git away with it,\' ejaculated Didlum, as\nsoon as he could speak.\'When the people tumbled to it, there\'d be no\nhend of a row.\'\'The majority of the\npeople will never know anything about it!Listen to me--\'\n\n\'Are you quite sure as we can\'t be over\'eard?\'interrupted Rushton,\nglancing nervously at the door and round the office.\'It\'s all right,\' answered Sweater, who nevertheless lowered his voice\nalmost to a whisper, and the others drew their chairs closer and bent\nforward to listen.\'You know we still have a little money in hand: well, what I propose is\nthis: At the annual meeting, which, as you know, comes off next week,\nwe\'ll arrange for the Secretary to read a highly satisfactory report,\nand we\'ll declare a dividend of 15 per cent--we can arrange it somehow\nbetween us.Of course, we\'ll have to cook the accounts a little, but\nI\'ll see that it\'s done properly.The other shareholders are not going\nto ask any awkward questions, and we all understand each other.\'Sweater paused, and regarded the other three brigands intently.\'Yes, yes,\' said Didlum eagerly.And Rushton and\nGrinder nodded assent.\'Afterwards,\' resumed Sweater, \'I\'ll arrange for a good report of the\nmeeting to appear in the Weekly Ananias.I\'ll instruct the Editor to\nwrite it himself, and I\'ll tell him just what to say.I\'ll also get\nhim to write a leading article about it, saying that electricity is\nsure to supersede gas for lighting purposes in the very near future.Then the article will go on to refer to the huge profits made by the\nGas Coy and to say how much better it would have been if the town had\nbought the gasworks years ago, so that those profits might have been\nused to reduce the rates, the same as has been done in other towns.Finally, the article will declare that it\'s a great pity that the\nElectric Light Supply should be in the hands of a private company, and\nto suggest that an effort be made to acquire it for the town.\'In the meantime we can all go about--in a very quiet and judicious\nway, of course--bragging about what a good thing we\'ve got, and saying\nwe don\'t mean to sell.We shall say that we\'ve overcome all the\ninitial expenses and difficulties connected with the installation of\nthe works--that we are only just beginning to reap the reward of our\nindustry and enterprise, and so on.\'Then,\' continued the Chief, \'we can arrange for it to be proposed in\nthe Council that the Town should purchase the Electric Light Works.\'\'But not by one of us four, you know,\' said Grinder with a cunning leer.\'Certainly not; that would give the show away at once.There are, as\nyou know--several members of the Band who are not shareholders in the\ncompany; we\'ll get some of them to do most of the talking.We, being\nthe directors of the company, must pretend to be against selling, and\nstick out for our own price; and when we do finally consent we must\nmake out that we are sacrificing our private interests for the good of\nthe Town.We\'ll get a committee appointed--we\'ll have an expert\nengineer down from London--I know a man that will suit our purpose\nadmirably--we\'ll pay him a trifle and he\'ll say whatever we tell him\nto--and we\'ll rush the whole business through before you can say "Jack\nRobinson", and before the rate-payers have time to realize what\'s being\ndone.Not that we need worry ourselves much about them.Most of them\ntake no interest in public affairs, but even if there is something\nsaid, it won\'t matter much to us once we\'ve got the money.It\'ll be a\nnine days\' wonder and then we\'ll hear no more of it.\'As the Chief ceased speaking, the other brigands also remained silent,\nspeechless with admiration of his cleverness.\'Well, what do you think of it?\'\'I think it\'s\nsplendid!If we can honly git away with it,\nI reckon it\'ll be one of the smartest thing we\'ve ever done.\'\'Smart ain\'t the word for it,\' observed Rushton.\'There\'s no doubt it\'s a grand idear!\'exclaimed Didlum, \'and I\'ve just\nthought of something else that might be done to help it along.We could\narrange to \'ave a lot of letters sent "To the Editor of the Obscurer"\nand "To the Editor of the Ananias," and "To the Editor of the Weekly\nChloroform" in favour of the scheme.\'\'Yes, that\'s a very good idea,\' said Grinder.\'For that matter the\neditors could write them to themselves and sign them "Progress",\n"Ratepayer", "Advance Mugsborough", and sich-like.\'\'Yes, that\'s all right,\' said the Chief, thoughtfully, \'but we must be\ncareful not to overdo it; of course there will have to be a certain\namount of publicity, but we don\'t want to create too much interest in\nit.\'\'Come to think of it,\' observed Rushton arrogantly, \'why should we\ntrouble ourselves about the opinion of the ratepayers at all?Why\nshould we trouble to fake the books, or declare a dividend or \'ave the\nharticles in the papers or anything else?We\'ve got the game in our\nown \'ands; we\'ve got a majority in the Council, and, as Mr Sweater ses,\nvery few people even take the trouble to read the reports of the\nmeetings.\'\'Yes, that\'s right enough,\' said Grinder.\'But it\'s just them few wot\nwould make a lot of trouble and talk; THEY\'RE the very people we \'as to\nthink about.If we can only manage to put THEM in a fog we\'ll be all\nright, and the way to do it is as Mr Sweater proposes.\'\'Yes, I think so,\' said the Chief.I can\nwork it all right in the Ananias and the Chloroform, and of course\nyou\'ll see that the Obscurer backs us up.\'\'I\'ll take care of that,\' said Grinder, grimly.The three local papers were run by limited companies.Sweater held\nnearly all the shares of the Ananias and of the Weekly Chloroform, and\ncontrolled their policy and contents.Grinder occupied the same\nposition with regard to the Obscurer.The editors were a sort of\nmarionettes who danced as Sweater and Grinder pulled the strings.\'I wonder how Dr Weakling will take it?\'\'That\'s the very thing I was just thinkin\' about,\' cried Didlum.\'Don\'t\nyou think it would be a good plan if we could arrange to \'ave somebody\ntook bad--you know, fall down in a fit or something in the street just\noutside the Town \'All just before the matter is brought forward in the\nCouncil, and then \'ave someone to come and call \'im out to attend to\nthe party wot\'s ill, and keep \'im out till the business is done.\'\'Yes, that\'s a capital idear,\' said Grinder thoughtfully.\'But who\ncould we get to \'ave the fit?It would \'ave to be someone we could\ntrust, you know.\'You wouldn\'t mind doin\' it, would yer?\'\'I should strongly object,\' said Rushton haughtily.He regarded the\nsuggestion that he should act such an undignified part, as a kind of\nsacrilege.\'Then I\'ll do it meself if necessary,\' said Didlum.\'I\'m not proud\nwhen there\'s money to be made; anything for an honest living.\'\'Well, I think we\'re all agreed, so far,\' remarked Sweater.\'And I think we all deserve a drink,\' the Chief continued, producing a\ndecanter and a box of cigars from a cupboard by the side of his desk.\'Pass that water bottle from behind you, Didlum.\'\'I suppose nobody won\'t be comin\' in?\'\'I\'m\na teetotaler, you know.\'\'Oh, it\'s all right,\' said Sweater, taking four glasses out of the\ncupboard and pouring out the whisky.\'I\'ve given orders that we\'re not\nto be disturbed for anyone.\'Well, \'ere\'s success to Socialism,\' cried Grinder, raising his glass,\nand taking a big drink.\'Amen--\'ear, \'ear, I mean,\' said Didlum, hastily correcting himself.\'Wot I likes about this \'ere business is that we\'re not only doin\'\nourselves a bit of good,\' continued Grinder with a laugh, \'we\'re not\nonly doin\' ourselves a bit of good, but we\'re likewise doin\' the\nSocialists a lot of \'arm.When the ratepayers \'ave bought the Works,\nand they begins to kick up a row because they\'re losin\' money over\nit--we can tell \'em that it\'s Socialism!And then they\'ll say that if\nthat\'s Socialism they don\'t want no more of it.\'The other brigands laughed gleefully, and some of Didlum\'s whisky went\ndown the wrong way and nearly sent him into a fit.\'You might as well kill a man at once,\' he protested as he wiped the\ntears from his eyes, \'you might as well kill a man at once as choke \'im\nto death.\'\'And now I\'ve got a bit of good news for you,\' said the Chief as he put\nhis empty glass down.\'Although we\'ve had a very rough time of it in our contest with the\nGasworks Company, and although we\'ve got the worst of it, it hasn\'t\nbeen all lavender for them, you know.They\'ve not enjoyed themselves\neither: we hit them pretty hard when we put up the coal dues.\'\'A damn good job too,\' said Grinder malignantly.\'Well,\' continued Sweater, \'they\'re just as sick of the fight as they\nwant to be, because of course they don\'t know exactly how badly we\'ve\nbeen hit.For all they know, we could have continued the struggle\nindefinitely: and--well, to make a long story short, I\'ve had a talk\nwith the managing director and one or two others, and they\'re willing\nto let us in with them.So that we can put the money we get for the\nElectric Light Works into gas shares!\'This was such splendid news that they had another drink on the strength\nof it, and Didlum said that one of the first things they would have to\ndo would be to totally abolish the Coal Dues, because they pressed so\nhard on the poor.Chapter 31\n\nThe Deserter\n\n\nAbout the end of January, Slyme left Easton\'s.The latter had not\nsucceeded in getting anything to do since the work at \'The Cave\' was\nfinished, and latterly the quality of the food had been falling off.The twelve shillings Slyme paid for his board and lodging was all that\nRuth had to keep house with.She had tried to get some work to do\nherself, but generally without success; there were one or two jobs that\nshe might have had if she had been able to give her whole time to them,\nbut of course that was not possible; the child and the housework had to\nbe attended to, and Slyme\'s meals had to be prepared.Nevertheless, she\ncontrived to get away several times when she had a chance of earning a\nfew shillings by doing a day\'s charing for some lady or other, and then\nshe left everything in such order at home that Easton was able to\nmanage all right while she was away.On these occasions, she usually\nleft the baby with Owen\'s wife, who was an old schoolmate of hers.Nora was the more willing to render her this service because Frankie\nused to be so highly delighted whenever it happened.He never tired of\nplaying with the child, and for several days afterwards he used to\nworry his mother with entreaties to buy a baby of their own.Easton earned a few shillings occasionally; now and then he got a job\nto clean windows, and once or twice he did a few days\' or hours\' work\nwith some other painter who had been fortunate enough to get a little\njob \'on his own\'--such as a ceiling to wash and whiten, or a room or\ntwo to paint; but such jobs were few.Sometimes, when they were very hard up, they sold something; the Bible\nthat used to lie on the little table in the bay window was one of the\nfirst things to be parted with.Ruth erased the inscription from the\nfly-leaf and then they sold the book at a second-hand shop for two\nshillings.As time went on, they sold nearly everything that was\nsaleable, except of course, the things that were obtained on the hire\nsystem.Slyme could see that they were getting very much into debt and behind\nwith the rent, and on two occasions already Easton had borrowed five\nshillings from him, which he might never be able to pay back.Another\nthing was that Slyme was always in fear that Ruth--who had never wholly\nabandoned herself to wrongdoing--might tell Easton what had happened;\nmore than once she had talked of doing so, and the principal reason why\nshe refrained was that she knew that even if he forgave her, he could\nnever think the same of her as before.Slyme repeatedly urged this\nview upon her, pointing out that no good could result from such a\nconfession.Latterly the house had become very uncomfortable.It was not only that\nthe food was bad and that sometimes there was no fire, but Ruth and\nEaston were nearly always quarrelling about something or other.She\nscarcely spoke to Slyme at all, and avoided sitting at the table with\nhim whenever possible.He was in constant dread that Easton might\nnotice her manner towards him, and seek for some explanation.Altogether the situation was so unpleasant that Slyme determined to\nclear out.He made the excuse that he had been offered a few weeks\'\nwork at a place some little distance outside the town.After he was\ngone they lived for several weeks in semi-starvation on what credit\nthey could get and by selling the furniture or anything else they\npossessed that could be turned into money.The things out of Slyme\'s\nroom were sold almost directly he left.Chapter 32\n\nThe Veteran\n\n\nOld Jack Linden had tried hard to earn a little money by selling\nbloaters, but they often went bad, and even when he managed to sell\nthem all the profit was so slight that it was not worth doing.Before the work at \'The Cave\' was finished, Philpot was a good friend\nto them; he frequently gave old Jack sixpence or a shilling and often\nbrought a bag of cakes or buns for the children.Sometimes he came to\ntea with them on Sundays as an excuse for bringing a tin of salmon.Elsie and Charley frequently went to Owen\'s house to take tea with\nFrankie; in fact, whilst Owen had anything to do, they almost lived\nthere, for both Owen and Nora, knowing that the Lindens had nothing to\nlive on except the earnings of the young woman, encouraged the children\nto come often.Old Jack made some hopeless attempts to get work--work of any kind, but\nnobody wanted him; and to make things worse, his eyesight, which had\nbeen failing for a long time, became very bad.Once he was given a job\nby a big provision firm to carry an advertisement about the streets.The man who had been carrying it before--an old soldier--had been\nsacked the previous day for getting drunk while on duty.The\nadvertisement was not an ordinary pair of sandwich boards, but a sort\nof box without any bottom or lid, a wooden frame, four sides covered\nwith canvas, on which were pasted printed bills advertising margarine.Each side of this box or frame was rather larger than an ordinary\nsandwich board.Old Linden had to get inside this thing and carry it about the streets;\ntwo straps fixed across the top of the frame and passing one over each\nof his shoulders enabled him to carry it.It swayed about a good deal\nas he walked along, especially when the wind caught it, but there were\ntwo handles inside to hold it steady by.The pay was eighteenpence a\nday, and he had to travel a certain route, up and down the busiest\nstreets.At first the frame did not feel very heavy, but the weight seemed to\nincrease as the time went on, and the straps hurt his shoulders.He\nfelt very much ashamed, also, whenever he encountered any of his old\nmates, some of whom laughed at him.In consequence of the frame requiring so much attention to keep it\nsteady, and being unused to the work, and his sight so bad, he several\ntimes narrowly escaped being run over.Another thing that added to his\nembarrassment was the jeering of the other sandwichmen, the loafers\noutside the public houses, and the boys, who shouted \'old Jack in the\nbox\' after him.Sometimes the boys threw refuse at the frame, and once\na decayed orange thrown by one of them knocked his hat off.By the time evening came he was scarcely able to stand for weariness.His shoulders, his legs and his feet ached terribly, and as he was\ntaking the thing back to the shop he was accosted by a ragged,\ndirty-looking, beer-sodden old man whose face was inflamed with drink\nand fury.\'This was the old soldier who had been discharged the\nprevious day.He cursed and swore in the most awful manner and accused\nLinden of \'taking the bread out of his mouth\', and, shaking his fist\nfiercely at him, shouted that he had a good mind to knock his face\nthrough his head and out of the back of his neck.He might possibly\nhave tried to put this threat into practice but for the timely\nappearance of a policeman, when he calmed down at once and took himself\noff.Jack did not go back the next day; he felt that he would rather starve\nthan have any more of the advertisement frame, and after this he seemed\nto abandon all hope of earning money: wherever he went it was the\nsame--no one wanted him.So he just wandered about the streets\naimlessly, now and then meeting an old workmate who asked him to have a\ndrink, but this was not often, for nearly all of them were out of work\nand penniless.Chapter 33\n\nThe Soldier\'s Children\n\n\nDuring most of this time, Jack Linden\'s daughter-in-law had \'Plenty of\nWork\', making blouses and pinafores for Sweater & Co.She had so much\nto do that one might have thought that the Tory Millennium had arrived,\nand that Tariff Reform was already an accomplished fact.At first they had employed her exclusively on the cheapest kind of\nblouses--those that were paid for at the rate of two shillings a dozen,\nbut they did not give her many of that sort now.She did the work so\nneatly that they kept her busy on the better qualities, which did not\npay her so well, because although she was paid more per dozen, there\nwas a great deal more work in them than in the cheaper kinds.Once she\nhad a very special one to make, for which she was paid six shillings;\nbut it took her four and a half days--working early and late--to do it.The lady who bought this blouse was told that it came from Paris, and\npaid three guineas for it.But of course Mrs Linden knew nothing of\nthat, and even if she had known, it would have made no difference to\nher.Most of the money she earned went to pay the rent, and sometimes there\nwas only two or three shillings left to buy food for all of them:\nsometimes not even so much, because although she had Plenty of Work she\nwas not always able to do it.There were times when the strain of\nworking the machine was unendurable: her shoulders ached, her arms\nbecame cramped, and her eyes pained so that it was impossible to\ncontinue.Then for a change she would leave the sewing and do some\nhousework.Once, when they owed four weeks\' rent, the agent was so threatening\nthat they were terrified at the thought of being sold up and turned out\nof the house, and so she decided to sell the round mahogany table and\nsome of the other things out of the sitting-room.Nearly all the\nfurniture that was in the house now belonged to her, and had formed her\nhome before her husband died.The old people had given most of their\nthings away at different times to their other sons since she had come\nto live there.These men were all married and all in employment.One\nwas a fitter at the gasworks; the second was a railway porter, and the\nother was a butcher; but now that the old man was out of work they\nseldom came to the house.The last time they had been there was on\nChristmas Eve, and then there had been such a terrible row between them\nthat the children had been awakened by it and frightened nearly out of\ntheir lives.The cause of the row was that some time previously they\nhad mutually agreed to each give a shilling a week to the old people.They had done this for three weeks and after that the butcher had\nstopped his contribution: it had occurred to him that he was not to be\nexpected to help to keep his brother\'s widow and her children.If the\nold people liked to give up the house and go to live in a room\nsomewhere by themselves, he would continue paying his shilling a week,\nbut not otherwise.Upon this the railway porter and the gas-fitter\nalso ceased paying.They said it wasn\'t fair that they should pay a\nshilling a week each when the butcher--who was the eldest and earned\nthe best wages--paid nothing.Provided he paid, they would pay; but if\nhe didn\'t pay anything, neither would they.On Christmas Eve they all\nhappened to come to the house at the same time; each denounced the\nothers, and after nearly coming to blows they all went away raging and\ncursing and had not been near the place since.As soon as she decided to sell the things, Mary went to Didlum\'s\nsecond-hand furniture store, and the manager said he would ask Mr\nDidlum to call and see the table and other articles.She waited\nanxiously all the morning, but he did not appear, so she went once more\nto the shop to remind him.When he did come at last he was very\ncontemptuous of the table and of everything else she offered to sell.Five shillings was the very most he could think of giving for the\ntable, and even then he doubted whether he would ever get his money\nback.Eventually he gave her thirty shillings for the table, the\novermantel, the easy chair, three other chairs and the two best\npictures--one a large steel engraving of \'The Good Samaritan\' and the\nother \'Christ Blessing Little Children\'.He paid the money at once; half an hour afterwards the van came to take\nthe things away, and when they were gone, Mary sank down on the\nhearthrug in the wrecked room and sobbed as if her heart would break.Slowly, piece by\npiece, in order to buy food and to pay the rent, the furniture was\nsold.Every time Didlum came he affected to be doing them a very great\nfavour by buying the things at all.Business was so bad: it might be years before he could\nsell them again, and so on.Once or twice he asked Mary if she did not\nwant to sell the clock--the one that her late husband had made for his\nmother, but Mary shrank from the thought of selling this, until at last\nthere was nothing else left that Didlum would buy, and one week, when\nMary was too ill to do any needlework--it had to go.He gave them ten\nshillings for it.Mary had expected the old woman to be heartbroken at having to part\nwith this clock, but she was surprised to see her almost indifferent.The truth was, that lately both the old people seemed stunned, and\nincapable of taking an intelligent interest in what was happening\naround them, and Mary had to attend to everything.From time to time nearly all their other possessions--things of\ninferior value that Didlum would not look at, she carried out and sold\nat small second-hand shops in back streets or pledged at the\npawn-broker\'s.The feather pillows, sheets, and blankets: bits of\ncarpet or oilcloth, and as much of their clothing as was saleable or\npawnable.They felt the loss of the bedclothes more than anything\nelse, for although all the clothes they wore during the day, and all\nthe old clothes and dresses in the house, and even an old \ntablecloth, were put on the beds at night, they did not compensate for\nthe blankets, and they were often unable to sleep on account of the\nintense cold.A lady district visitor who called occasionally sometimes gave Mary an\norder for a hundredweight of coal or a shillingsworth of groceries, or\na ticket for a quart of soup, which Elsie fetched in the evening from\nthe Soup Kitchen.But this was not very often, because, as the lady\nsaid, there were so many cases similar to theirs that it was impossible\nto do more than a very little for any one of them.Sometimes Mary became so weak and exhausted through overwork, worry,\nand lack of proper food that she broke down altogether for the time\nbeing, and positively could not do any work at all.Then she used to\nlie down on the bed in her room and cry.Whenever she became like this, Elsie and Charley used to do the\nhousework when they came home from school, and make tea and toast for\nher, and bring it to the bedside on a chair so that she could eat lying\ndown.When there was no margarine or dripping to put on the toast,\nthey made it very thin and crisp and pretended it was biscuit.The children rather enjoyed these times; the quiet and leisure was so\ndifferent from other days when their mother was so busy she had no time\nto speak to them.They would sit on the side of the bed, the old grandmother in her chair\nopposite with the cat beside her listening to the conversation and\npurring or mewing whenever they stroked it or spoke to it.They talked\nprincipally of the future.Elsie said she was going to be a teacher\nand earn a lot of money to bring home to her mother to buy things with.Charley was thinking of opening a grocer\'s shop and having a horse and\ncart.When one has a grocer\'s shop, there is always plenty to eat;\neven if you have no money, you can take as much as you like out of your\nshop--good stuff, too, tins of salmon, jam, sardines, eggs, cakes,\nbiscuits and all those sorts of things--and one was almost certain to\nhave some money every day, because it wasn\'t likely that a whole day\nwould go by without someone or other coming into the shop to buy\nsomething.When delivering the groceries with the horse and cart, he\nwould give rides to all the boys he knew, and in the summertime, after\nthe work was done and the shop shut up, Mother and Elsie and Granny\ncould also come for long rides into the country.The old grandmother--who had latterly become quite childish--used to\nsit and listen to all this talk with a superior air.Sometimes she\nargued with the children about their plans, and ridiculed them.She\nused to say with a chuckle that she had heard people talk like that\nbefore--lots of times--but it never came to nothing in the end.One week about the middle of February, when they were in very sore\nstraits indeed, old Jack applied to the secretary of the Organized\nBenevolence Society for assistance.It was about eleven o\'clock in the\nmorning when he turned the corner of the street where the office of the\nsociety was situated and saw a crowd of about thirty men waiting for\nthe doors to be opened in order to apply for soup tickets.Some of\nthese men were of the tramp or the drunken loafer class; some were old,\nbroken-down workmen like himself, and others were labourers wearing\ncorduroy or moleskin trousers with straps round their legs under their\nknees.Linden waited at a distance until all these were gone before he went\nin.The secretary received him sympathetically and gave him a big form\nto fill up, but as Linden\'s eyes were so bad and his hand so unsteady\nthe secretary very obligingly wrote in the answers himself, and\ninformed him that he would inquire into the case and lay his\napplication before the committee at the next meeting, which was to be\nheld on the following Thursday--it was then Monday.Linden explained to him that they were actually starving.He had been\nout of work for sixteen weeks, and during all that time they had lived\nfor the most part on the earnings of his daughter-in-law, but she had\nnot done anything for nearly a fortnight now, because the firm she\nworked for had not had any work for her to do.There was no food in\nthe house and the children were crying for something to eat.All last\nweek they had been going to school hungry, for they had had nothing but\ndry bread and tea every day: but this week--as far as he could\nsee--they would not get even that.After some further talk the\nsecretary gave him two soup tickets and an order for a loaf of bread,\nand repeated his promise to inquire into the case and bring it before\nthe committee.As Jack was returning home he passed the Soup Kitchen, where he saw the\nsame lot of men who had been to the office of the Organized Benevolence\nSociety for the soup tickets.They were waiting in a long line to be\nadmitted.The premises being so small, the proprietor served them in\nbatches of ten at a time.On Wednesday the secretary called at the house, and on Friday Jack\nreceived a letter from him to the effect that the case had been duly\nconsidered by the committee, who had come to the conclusion that as it\nwas a \'chronic\' case they were unable to deal with it, and advised him\nto apply to the Board of Guardians.This was what Linden had hitherto\nshrunk from doing, but the situation was desperate.They owed five\nweeks\' rent, and to crown their misfortune his eyesight had become so\nbad that even if there had been any prospect of obtaining work it was\nvery doubtful if he could have managed to do it.So Linden, feeling\nutterly crushed and degraded, swallowed all that remained of his pride\nand went like a beaten dog to see the relieving officer, who took him\nbefore the Board, who did not think it a suitable case for out-relief,\nand after some preliminaries it was arranged that Linden and his wife\nwere to go into the workhouse, and Mary was to be allowed three\nshillings a week to help her to support herself and the two children.As for Linden\'s sons, the Guardians intimated their Intention of\ncompelling them to contribute towards the cost of their parents\'\nmaintenance.Mary accompanied the old people to the gates of their future\ndwelling-place, and when she returned home she found there a letter\naddressed to J. Linden.It was from the house agent and contained a\nnotice to leave the house before the end of the ensuing week.Nothing\nwas said about the rent that was due.Perhaps Mr Sweater thought that\nas he had already received nearly six hundred pounds in rent from\nLinden he could afford to be generous about the five weeks that were\nstill owing--or perhaps he thought there was no possibility of getting\nthe money.However that may have been, there was no reference to it in\nthe letter--it was simply a notice to clear out, addressed to Linden,\nbut meant for Mary.It was about half past three o\'clock in the afternoon when she returned\nhome and found this letter on the floor in the front passage.She was\nfaint with fatigue and hunger, for she had had nothing but a cup of tea\nand a slice of bread that day, and her fare had not been much better\nfor many weeks past.The children were at school, and the house--now\nalmost destitute of furniture and without carpets or oilcloth on the\nfloors--was deserted and cold and silent as a tomb.On the kitchen\ntable were a few cracked cups and saucers, a broken knife, some lead\nteaspoons, a part of a loaf, a small basin containing some dripping and\na brown earthenware teapot with a broken spout.Near the table were two\nbroken kitchen chairs, one with the top cross-piece gone from the back,\nand the other with no back to the seat at all.The bareness of the\nwalls was relieved only by a  almanac and some paper pictures\nwhich the children had tacked upon them, and by the side of the\nfireplace was the empty wicker chair where the old woman used to sit.There was no fire in the grate, and the cold hearth was untidy with an\naccumulation of ashes, for during the trouble of these last few days\nshe had not had time or heart to do any housework.The floor was\nunswept and littered with scraps of paper and dust: in one corner was a\nheap of twigs and small branches of trees that Charley had found\nsomewhere and brought home for the fire.The same disorder prevailed all through the house: all the doors were\nopen, and from where she stood in the kitchen she could see the bed she\nshared with Elsie, with its heterogeneous heap of coverings.The\nsitting-room contained nothing but a collection of odds and ends of\nrubbish which belonged to Charley--his \'things\' as he called them--bits\nof wood, string and rope; one wheel of a perambulator, a top, an iron\nhoop and so on.Through the other door was visible the dilapidated\nbedstead that had been used by the old people, with a similar lot of\nbedclothes to those on her own bed, and the torn, ragged covering of\nthe mattress through the side of which the flock was protruding and\nfalling in particles on to the floor.As she stood there with the letter in her hand--faint and weary in the\nmidst of all this desolation, it seemed to her as if the whole world\nwere falling to pieces and crumbling away all around her.Chapter 34\n\nThe Beginning of the End\n\n\nDuring the months of January and February, Owen, Crass, Slyme and\nSawkins continued to work at irregular intervals for Rushton & Co.,\nalthough--even when there was anything to do--they now put in only six\nhours a day, commencing in the morning and leaving off at four, with an\nhour\'s interval for dinner between twelve and one.They finished the\n\'plant\' and painted the front of Rushton\'s shop.When all this was\ncompleted, as no other work came in, they all had to\'stand off\' with\nthe exception of Sawkins, who was kept on because he was cheap and able\nto do all sorts of odd jobs, such as unstopping drains, repairing leaky\nroofs, rough painting or lime-washing, and he was also useful as a\nlabourer for the plumbers, of whom there were now three employed at\nRushton\'s, the severe weather which had come in with January having\nmade a lot of work in that trade.With the exception of this one\nbranch, practically all work was at a standstill.had had several \'boxing-up\' jobs to do,\nand Crass always did the polishing of the coffins on these occasions,\nbesides assisting to take the \'box\' home when finished and to \'lift in\'\nthe corpse, and afterwards he always acted as one of the bearers at the\nfunerals.For an ordinary class funeral he usually put in about three\nhours for the polishing; that came to one and nine.Taking home the\ncoffin and lifting in the corpse, one shilling--usually there were two\nmen to do this besides Hunter, who always accompanied them to\nsuperintend the work--attending the funeral and acting as bearer, four\nshillings: so that altogether Crass made six shillings and ninepence\nout of each funeral, and sometimes a little more.For instance, when\nthere was an unusually good-class corpse they had a double coffin and\nthen of course there were two \'lifts in\', for the shell was taken home\nfirst and the outer coffin perhaps a day or two later: this made\nanother shilling.No matter how expensive the funeral was, the bearers\nnever got any more money.Sometimes the carpenter and Crass were able\nto charge an hour or two more on the making and polishing of a coffin\nfor a good job, but that was all.Sometimes, when there was a very\ncheap job, they were paid only three shillings for attending as\nbearers, but this was not often: as a rule they got the same amount\nwhether it was a cheap funeral or an expensive one.Slyme earned only\nfive shillings out of each funeral, and Owen only one and six--for\nwriting the coffin plate.Sometimes there were three or four funerals in a week, and then Crass\ndid very well indeed.He still had the two young men lodgers at his\nhouse, and although one of them was out of work he was still able to\npay his way because he had some money in the bank.One of the funeral jobs led to a terrible row between Crass and\nSawkins.The corpse was that of a well-to-do woman who had been ill\nfor a long time with cancer of the stomach, and after the funeral\nRushton & Co.had to clean and repaint and paper the room she had\noccupied during her illness.Although cancer is not supposed to be an\ninfectious disease, they had orders to take all the bedding away and\nhave it burnt.Sawkins was instructed to take a truck to the house and\nget the bedding and take it to the town Refuse Destructor to be\ndestroyed.There were two feather beds, a bolster and two pillows:\nthey were such good things that Sawkins secretly resolved that instead\nof taking them to the Destructor he would take them to a second-hand\ndealer and sell them.As he was coming away from the house with the things he met Hunter, who\ntold him that he wanted him for some other work; so he was to take the\ntruck to the yard and leave it there for the present; he could take the\nbedding to the Destructor later on in the day.Sawkins did as Hunter\nordered, and in the meantime Crass, who happened to be working at the\nyard painting some venetian blinds, saw the things on the truck, and,\nhearing what was to be done with them, he also thought it was a pity\nthat such good things should be destroyed: so when Sawkins came in the\nafternoon to take them away Crass told him he need not trouble; \'I\'m\ngoin\' to \'ave that lot, he said; \'they\'re too good to chuck away;\nthere\'s nothing wrong with \'em.\'He said he had been told to take\nthem to the Destructor, and he was going to do so.He was dragging the\ncart out of the yard when Crass rushed up and lifted the bundle off and\ncarried it into the paint-shop.Sawkins ran after him and they began\nto curse and swear at each other; Crass accusing Sawkins of intending\nto take the things to the marine stores and sell them.Sawkins seized\nhold of the bundle with the object of replacing it on the cart, but\nCrass got hold of it as well and they had a tussle for it--a kind of\ntug of war--reeling and struggling all over the shop.cursing and\nswearing horribly all the time.Finally, Sawkins--being the better man\nof the two--succeeded in wrenching the bundle away and put it on the\ncart again, and then Crass hurriedly put on his coat and said he was\ngoing to the office to ask Mr Rushton if he might have the things.Upon hearing this, Sawkins became so infuriated that he lifted the\nbundle off the cart and, throwing it upon the muddy ground, right into\na pool of dirty water, trampled it underfoot; and then, taking out his\nclasp knife, began savagely hacking and ripping the ticking so that the\nfeathers all came falling out.In a few minutes he had damaged the\nthings beyond hope of repair, while Crass stood by, white and\ntrembling, watching the proceedings but lacking the courage to\ninterfere.\'Now go to the office and ask Rushton for \'em, if you like!\'\'You can \'ave \'em now, if you want \'em.\'Crass made no answer and, after a moment\'s hesitation, went back to his\nwork, and Sawkins piled the things on the cart once more and took them\naway to the Destructor.He would not be able to sell them now, but at\nany rate he had stopped that dirty swine Crass from getting them.When Crass went back to the paint-shop he found there one of the\npillows which had fallen out of the bundle during the struggle.He\ntook it home with him that evening and slept upon it.It was a fine\npillow, much fuller and softer and more cosy than the one he had been\naccustomed to.A few days afterwards when he was working at the room where the woman\ndied, they gave him some other things that had belonged to her to do\naway with, and amongst them was a kind of wrap of grey knitted wool.Crass kept this for himself: it was just the thing to wrap round one\'s\nneck when going to work on a cold morning, and he used it for that\npurpose all through the winter.In addition to the funerals, there was\na little other work: sometimes a room or two to be painted and papered\nand ceilings whitened, and once they had the outside of two small\ncottages to paint--doors and windows--two coats.All four of them\nworked at this job and it was finished in two days.Some weeks Crass earned a pound or eighteen shillings; sometimes a\nlittle more, generally less and occasionally nothing at all.There was a lot of jealousy and ill-feeling amongst them about the\nwork.Slyme and Crass were both aggrieved about Sawkins whenever they\nwere idle, especially if the latter were painting or whitewashing, and\ntheir indignation was shared by all the others who were \'off\'.Harlow\nswore horribly about it, and they all agreed that it was disgraceful\nthat a bloody labourer should be employed doing what ought to be\nskilled work for fivepence an hour, while properly qualified men were\n\'walking about\'.These other men were also incensed against Slyme and\nCrass because the latter were given the preference whenever there was a\nlittle job to do, and it was darkly insinuated that in order to secure\nthis preference these two were working for sixpence an hour.There was\nno love lost between Crass and Slyme either: Crass was furious whenever\nit happened that Slyme had a few hours\' work to do if he himself were\nidle, and if ever Crass was working while Slyme was\'standing still\'\nthe latter went about amongst the other unemployed men saying ugly\nthings about Crass, whom he accused of being a \'crawler\'.Owen also\ncame in for his share of abuse and blame: most of them said that a man\nlike him should stick out for higher wages whether employed on special\nwork or not, and then he would not get any preference.But all the\nsame, whatever they said about each other behind each other\'s backs,\nthey were all most friendly to each other when they met face to face.Once or twice Owen did some work--such as graining a door or writing a\nsign--for one or other of his fellow workmen who had managed to secure\na little job \'on his own\', but putting it all together, the\ncoffin-plates and other work at Rushton\'s and all, his earnings had not\naveraged ten shillings a week for the last six weeks.Often they had\nno coal and sometimes not even a penny to put into the gas meter, and\nthen, having nothing left good enough to pawn, he sometimes obtained a\nfew pence by selling some of his books to second-hand book dealers.However, bad as their condition was, Owen knew that they were better\noff than the majority of the others, for whenever he went out he was\ncertain to meet numbers of men whom he had worked with at different\ntimes, who said--some of them--that they had been idle for ten, twelve,\nfifteen and in some cases for twenty weeks without having earned a\nshilling.Owen used to wonder how they managed to continue to exist.Most of\nthem were wearing other people\'s cast-off clothes, hats, and boots,\nwhich had in some instances been given to their wives by \'visiting\nladies\', or by the people at whose houses their wives went to work,\ncharing.As for food, most of them lived on such credit as they could\nget, and on the scraps of broken victuals and meat that their wives\nbrought home from the places they worked at.Some of them had grown-up\nsons and daughters who still lived with them and whose earnings kept\ntheir homes together, and the wives of some of them eked out a\nmiserable existence by letting lodgings.The week before old Linden went into the workhouse Owen earned nothing,\nand to make matters worse the grocer from whom they usually bought\ntheir things suddenly refused to let them have any more credit.Owen\nwent to see him, and the man said he was very sorry, but he could not\nlet them have anything more without the money; he did not mind waiting\na few weeks for what was already owing, but he could not let the amount\nget any higher; his books were full of bad debts already.In\nconclusion, he said that he hoped Owen would not do as so many others\nhad done and take his ready money elsewhere.People came and got\ncredit from him when they were hard up, and afterwards spent their\nready money at the Monopole Company\'s stores on the other side of the\nstreet, because their goods were a trifle cheaper, and it was not fair.Owen admitted that it was not fair, but reminded him that they always\nbought their things at his shop.The grocer, however, was inexorable;\nhe repeated several times that his books were full of bad debts and his\nown creditors were pressing him.During their conversation the\nshopkeeper\'s eyes wandered continually to the big store on the other\nside of the street; the huge, gilded letters of the name \'Monopole\nStores\' seemed to have an irresistible attraction for him.Once he\ninterrupted himself in the middle of a sentence to point out to Owen a\nlittle girl who was just coming out of the Stores with a small parcel\nin her hand.\'Her father owes me nearly thirty shillings,\' he said, \'but they spend\ntheir ready money there.\'The front of the grocer\'s shop badly needed repainting, and the name on\nthe fascia, \'A.Smallman\', was so faded as to be almost indecipherable.It had been Owen\'s intention to offer to do this work--the cost to go\nagainst his account--but the man appeared to be so harassed that Owen\nrefrained from making the suggestion.They still had credit at the baker\'s, but they did not take much bread:\nwhen one has had scarcely anything else but bread to eat for nearly a\nmonth one finds it difficult to eat at all.That same day, when he\nreturned home after his interview with the grocer, they had a loaf of\nbeautiful fresh bread, but none of them could eat it, although they\nwere hungry: it seemed to stick in their throats, and they could not\nswallow it even with the help of a drink of tea.But they drank the\ntea, which was the one thing that enabled them to go on living.The next week Owen earned eight shillings altogether: a few hours he\nput in assisting Crass to wash off and whiten a ceiling and paint a\nroom, and there was one coffin-plate.He wrote the latter at home, and\nwhile he was doing it he heard Frankie--who was out in the scullery\nwith Nora--say to her:\n\n\'Mother, how many more days to you think we\'ll have to have only dry\nbread and tea?\'Owen\'s heart seemed to stop as he heard the child\'s question and\nlistened for Nora\'s answer, but the question was not to be answered at\nall just then, for at that moment they heard someone running up the\nstairs and presently the door was unceremoniously thrown open and\nCharley Linden rushed into the house, out of breath, hatless, and\ncrying piteously.His clothes were old and ragged; they had been\npatched at the knees and elbows, but the patches were tearing away from\nthe rotting fabric into which they had been sewn.He had on a pair of\nblack stockings full of holes through which the skin was showing.The\nsoles of his boots were worn through at one side right to the uppers,\nand as he walked the sides of his bare heels came into contact with the\nfloor, the front part of the sole of one boot was separated from the\nupper, and his bare toes, red with cold and covered with mud, protruded\nthrough the gap.Some sharp substance--a nail or a piece of glass or\nflint--had evidently lacerated his right foot, for blood was oozing\nfrom the broken heel of his boot on to the floor.They were unable to make much sense of the confused story he told them\nthrough his sobs as soon as he was able to speak.All that was clear\nwas that there was something very serious the matter at home: he\nthought his mother must be either dying or dead, because she did not\nspeak or move or open her eyes, and \'please, please, please will you\ncome home with me and see her?\'While Nora was getting ready to go with the boy, Owen made him sit on a\nchair, and having removed the boot from the foot that was bleeding,\nwashed the cut with some warm water and bandaged it with a piece of\nclean rag, and then they tried to persuade him to stay there with\nFrankie while Nora went to see his mother, but the boy would not hear\nof it.Owen could not go because\nhe had to finish the coffin-plate, which was only just commenced.It will be remembered that we left Mary Linden alone in the house after\nshe returned from seeing the old people away.When the children came\nhome from school, about half an hour afterwards, they found her sitting\nin one of the chairs with her head resting on her arms on the table,\nunconscious.They were terrified, because they could not awaken her\nand began to cry, but presently Charley thought of Frankie\'s mother\nand, telling his sister to stay there while he was gone, he started off\nat a run for Owen\'s house, leaving the front door wide open after him.When Nora and the two boys reached the house they found there two other\nwomen neighbours, who had heard Elsie crying and had come to see what\nwas wrong.Mary had recovered from her faint and was lying down on the\nbed.Nora stayed with her for some time after the other women went\naway.She lit the fire and gave the children their tea--there was\nstill some coal and food left of what had been bought with the three\nshillings obtained from the Board of Guardians--and afterwards she\ntidied the house.Mary said that she did not know exactly what she would have to do in\nthe future.If she could get a room somewhere for two or three\nshillings a week, her allowance from the Guardians would pay the rent,\nand she would be able to earn enough for herself and the children to\nlive on.This was the substance of the story that Nora told Owen when she\nreturned home.He had finished writing the coffin-plate, and as it was\nnow nearly dry he put on his coat and took it down to the carpenter\'s\nshop at the yard.On his way back he met Easton, who had been hanging about in the vain\nhope of seeing Hunter and finding out if there was any chance of a job.As they walked along together, Easton confided to Owen that he had\nearned scarcely anything since he had been stood off at Rushton\'s, and\nwhat he had earned had gone, as usual, to pay the rent.Slyme had left\nthem some time ago.Ruth did not seem able to get on with him; she had\nbeen in a funny sort of temper altogether, but since he had gone she\nhad had a little work at a boarding-house on the Grand Parade.But\nthings had been going from bad to worse.They had not been able to keep\nup the payments for the furniture they had hired, so the things had\nbeen seized and carted off.They had even stripped the oilcloth from\nthe floor.Easton remarked he was sorry he had not tacked the bloody\nstuff down in such a manner that they would not have been able to take\nit up without destroying it.He had been to see Didlum, who said he\ndidn\'t want to be hard on them, and that he would keep the things\ntogether for three months, and if Easton had paid up arrears by that\ntime he could have them back again, but there was, in Easton\'s opinion,\nvery little chance of that.Here was a man who grumbled at\nthe present state of things, yet took no trouble to think for himself\nand try to alter them, and who at the first chance would vote for the\nperpetuation of the System which produced his misery.\'Have you heard that old Jack Linden and his wife went to the workhouse\ntoday,\' he said.\'No,\' replied Easton, indifferently.Owen then suggested it would not be a bad plan for Easton to let his\nfront room, now that it was empty, to Mrs Linden, who would be sure to\npay her rent, which would help Easton to pay his.Easton agreed and\nsaid he would mention it to Ruth, and a few minutes later they parted.The next morning Nora found Ruth talking to Mary Linden about the room\nand as the Eastons lived only about five minutes\' walk away, they all\nthree went round there in order that Mary might see the room.The\nappearance of the house from outside was unaltered: the white lace\ncurtains still draped the windows of the front room; and in the centre\nof the bay was what appeared to be a small round table covered with a\nred cloth, and upon it a geranium in a flowerpot standing in a saucer\nwith a frill of  tissue paper round it.These things and the\ncurtains, which fell close together, made it impossible for anyone to\nsee that the room was, otherwise, unfurnished.The \'table\' consisted\nof an empty wooden box--procured from the grocer\'s--stood on end, with\nthe lid of the scullery copper placed upside down upon it for a top and\ncovered with an old piece of red cloth.The purpose of this was to\nprevent the neighbours from thinking that they were hard up; although\nthey knew that nearly all those same neighbours were in more or less\nsimilar straits.It was not a very large room, considering that it would have to serve\nall purposes for herself and the two children, but Mrs Linden knew that\nit was not likely that she would be able to get one as good elsewhere\nfor the same price, so she agreed to take it from the following Monday\nat two shillings a week.As the distance was so short they were able to carry most of the\nsmaller things to their new home during the next few days, and on the\nMonday evening, when it was dark.Owen and Easton brought the\nremainder on a truck they borrowed for the purpose from Hunter.During the last weeks of February the severity of the weather\nincreased.There was a heavy fall of snow on the 20th followed by a\nhard frost which lasted several days.About ten o\'clock one night a policeman found a man lying unconscious\nin the middle of a lonely road.At first he thought the man was drunk,\nand after dragging him on to the footpath out of the way of passing\nvehicles he went for the stretcher.They took the man to the station\nand put him into a cell, which was already occupied by a man who had\nbeen caught in the act of stealing a swede turnip from a barn.When the\npolice surgeon came he pronounced the supposed drunken man to be dying\nfrom bronchitis and want of food; and he further said that there was\nnothing to indicate that the man was addicted to drink.When the\ninquest was held a few days afterwards, the coroner remarked that it\nwas the third case of death from destitution that had occurred in the\ntown within six weeks.The evidence showed that the man was a plasterer who had walked from\nLondon with the hope of finding work somewhere in the country.He had\nno money in his possession when he was found by the policeman; all that\nhis pockets contained being several pawn-tickets and a letter from his\nwife, which was not found until after he died, because it was in an\ninner pocket of his waistcoat.A few days before this inquest was\nheld, the man who had been arrested for stealing the turnip had been\ntaken before the magistrates.The poor wretch said he did it because\nhe was starving, but Aldermen Sweater and Grinder, after telling him\nthat starvation was no excuse for dishonesty, sentenced him to pay a\nfine of seven shillings and costs, or go to prison for seven days with\nhard labour.As the convict had neither money nor friends, he had to\ngo to jail, where he was, after all, better off than most of those who\nwere still outside because they lacked either the courage or the\nopportunity to steal something to relieve their sufferings.As time went on the long-continued privation began to tell upon Owen\nand his family.He had a severe cough: his eyes became deeply sunken\nand of remarkable brilliancy, and his thin face was always either\ndeathly pale or dyed with a crimson flush.Frankie also began to show the effects of being obliged to go so often\nwithout his porridge and milk; he became very pale and thin and his\nlong hair came out in handfuls when his mother combed or brushed it.This was a great trouble to the boy, who, since hearing the story of\nSamson read out of the Bible at school, had ceased from asking to have\nhis hair cut short, lest he should lose his strength in consequence.He\nused to test himself by going through a certain exercise he had himself\ninvented, with a flat iron, and he was always much relieved when he\nfound that, notwithstanding the loss of the porridge, he was still able\nto lift the iron the proper number of times.But after a while, as he\nfound that it became increasingly difficult to go through the exercise,\nhe gave it up altogether, secretly resolving to wait until \'Dad\' had\nmore work to do, so that he could have the porridge and milk again.He\nwas sorry to have to discontinue the exercise, but he said nothing\nabout it to his father or mother because he did not want to \'worry\'\nthem...\n\nSometimes Nora managed to get a small job of needlework.On one\noccasion a woman with a small son brought a parcel of garments\nbelonging to herself or her husband, an old ulster, several coats, and\nso on--things that although they were too old-fashioned or shabby to\nwear, yet might look all right if turned and made up for the boy.Nora undertook to do this, and after working several hours every day\nfor a week she earned four shillings: and even then the woman thought\nit was so dear that she did not bring any more.Another time Mrs Easton got her some work at a boarding-house where she\nherself was employed.The servant was laid up, and they wanted some\nhelp for a few days.The pay was to be two shillings a day, and\ndinner.Owen did not want her to go because he feared she was not\nstrong enough to do the work, but he gave way at last and Nora went.She had to do the bedrooms, and on the evening of the second day, as a\nresult of the constant running up and down the stairs carrying heavy\ncans and pails of water, she was in such intense pain that she was\nscarcely able to walk home, and for several days afterwards had to lie\nin bed through a recurrence of her old illness, which caused her to\nsuffer untold agony whenever she tried to stand.Owen was alternately dejected and maddened by the knowledge of his own\nhelplessness: when he was not doing anything for Rushton he went about\nthe town trying to find some other work, but usually with scant\nsuccess.He did some samples of showcard and window tickets and\nendeavoured to get some orders by canvassing the shops in the town, but\nthis was also a failure, for these people generally had a ticket-writer\nto whom they usually gave their work.He did get a few trifling\norders, but they were scarcely worth doing at the price he got for\nthem.He used to feel like a criminal when he went into the shops to\nask them for the work, because he realized fully that, in effect, he\nwas saying to them: \'Take your work away from the other man, and employ\nme.\'He was so conscious of this that it gave him a shamefaced manner,\nwhich, coupled as it was with his shabby clothing, did not create a\nvery favourable impression upon those he addressed, who usually treated\nhim with about as much courtesy as they would have extended to any\nother sort of beggar.Generally, after a day\'s canvassing, he returned\nhome unsuccessful and faint with hunger and fatigue.Once, when there was a bitterly cold east wind blowing, he was out on\none of these canvassing expeditions and contracted a severe cold: his\nchest became so bad that he found it almost impossible to speak,\nbecause the effort to do so often brought on a violent fit of coughing.It was during this time that a firm of drapers, for whom he had done\nsome showcards, sent him an order for one they wanted in a hurry, it\nhad to be delivered the next morning, so he stayed up by himself till\nnearly midnight to do it.As he worked, he felt a strange sensation in\nhis chest: it was not exactly a pain, and he would have found it\ndifficult to describe it in words--it was just a sensation.He did not\nattach much importance to it, thinking it an effect of the cold he had\ntaken, but whatever it was he could not help feeling conscious of it\nall the time.Frankie had been put to bed that evening at the customary hour, but did\nnot seem to be sleeping as well as usual.Owen could hear him twisting\nand turning about and uttering little cries in his sleep.He left his work several times to go into the boy\'s room and cover him\nwith the bedclothes which his restless movements had disordered.As\nthe time wore on, the child became more tranquil, and about eleven\no\'clock, when Owen went in to look at him, he found him in a deep\nsleep, lying on his side with his head thrown back on the pillow,\nbreathing so softly through his slightly parted lips that the sound was\nalmost imperceptible.The fair hair that clustered round his forehead\nwas damp with perspiration, and he was so still and pale and silent\nthat one might have thought he was sleeping the sleep that knows no\nawakening.About an hour later, when he had finished writing the showcard, Owen\nwent out into the scullery to wash his hands before going to bed: and\nwhilst he was drying them on the towel, the strange sensation he had\nbeen conscious of all the evening became more intense, and a few\nseconds afterwards he was terrified to find his mouth suddenly filled\nwith blood.For what seemed an eternity he fought for breath against the\nsuffocating torrent, and when at length it stopped, he sank trembling\ninto a chair by the side of the table, holding the towel to his mouth\nand scarcely daring to breathe, whilst a cold sweat streamed from every\npore and gathered in large drops upon his forehead.Through the deathlike silence of the night there came from time to time\nthe chimes of the clock of a distant church, but he continued to sit\nthere motionless, taking no heed of the passing hours, and possessed\nwith an awful terror.And afterwards the other two\nwould be left by themselves at the mercy of the world.In a few years\'\ntime the boy would be like Bert White, in the clutches of some\npsalm-singing devil like Hunter or Rushton, who would use him as if he\nwere a beast of burden.He imagined he could see him now as he would\nbe then: worked, driven, and bullied, carrying loads, dragging carts,\nand running here and there, trying his best to satisfy the brutal\ntyrants, whose only thought would be to get profit out of him for\nthemselves.If he lived, it would be to grow up with his body deformed\nand dwarfed by unnatural labour and with his mind stultified, degraded\nand brutalized by ignorance and poverty.As this vision of the child\'s\nfuture rose before him, Owen resolved that it should never be!He\nwould not leave them alone and defenceless in the midst of the\n\'Christian\' wolves who were waiting to rend them as soon as he was\ngone.If he could not give them happiness, he could at least put them\nout of the reach of further suffering.If he could not stay with them,\nthey would have to come with him.It would be kinder and more merciful.Chapter 35\n\nFacing the \'Problem\'\n\n\nNearly every other firm in the town was in much the same plight as\nRushton & Co.; none of them had anything to speak of to do, and the\nworkmen no longer troubled to go to the different shops asking for a\njob.Most of them just walked about\naimlessly or stood talking in groups in the streets, principally in the\nneighbourhood of the Wage Slave Market near the fountain on the Grand\nParade.They congregated here in such numbers that one or two\nresidents wrote to the local papers complaining of the \'nuisance\', and\npointing out that it was calculated to drive the \'better-class\'\nvisitors out of the town.After this two or three extra policemen were\nput on duty near the fountain with instructions to\'move on\' any groups\nof unemployed that formed.They could not stop them from coming there,\nbut they prevented them standing about.The processions of unemployed continued every day, and the money they\nbegged from the public was divided equally amongst those who took part.Sometimes it amounted to one and sixpence each, sometimes it was a\nlittle more and sometimes a little less.These men presented a\nterrible spectacle as they slunk through the dreary streets, through\nthe rain or the snow, with the slush soaking into their broken boots,\nand, worse still, with the bitterly cold east wind penetrating their\nrotten clothing and freezing their famished bodies.The majority of the skilled workers still held aloof from these\nprocessions, although their haggard faces bore involuntary testimony to\ntheir sufferings.Although privation reigned supreme in their desolate\nhomes, where there was often neither food nor light nor fire, they were\ntoo \'proud\' to parade their misery before each other or the world.They secretly sold or pawned their clothing and their furniture and\nlived in semi-starvation on the proceeds, and on credit, but they would\nnot beg.Many of them even echoed the sentiments of those who had\nwritten to the papers, and with a strange lack of class-sympathy blamed\nthose who took part in the processions.They said it was that sort of\nthing that drove the \'better class\' away, injured the town, and caused\nall the poverty and unemployment.However, some of them accepted\ncharity in other ways; district visitors distributed tickets for coal\nand groceries.Not that that sort of thing made much difference; there\nwas usually a great deal of fuss and advice, many quotations of\nScripture, and very little groceries.And even what there was\ngenerally went to the least-deserving people, because the only way to\nobtain any of this sort of \'charity\' is by hypocritically pretending to\nbe religious: and the greater the hypocrite, the greater the quantity\nof coal and groceries.These \'charitable\' people went into the\nwretched homes of the poor and--in effect--said: \'Abandon every\nparticle of self-respect: cringe and fawn: come to church: bow down and\ngrovel to us, and in return we\'ll give you a ticket that you can take\nto a certain shop and exchange for a shillingsworth of groceries.And,\nif you\'re very servile and humble we may give you another one next\nweek.\'They never gave the \'case\' the money.It prevents the \'case\' abusing the \'charity\' by spending the\nmoney on drink.It advertises the benevolence of the donors: and it\nenables the grocer--who is usually a member of the church--to get rid\nof any stale or damaged stock he may have on hand.When these visiting ladies\' went into a workman\'s house and found it\nclean and decently furnished, and the children clean and tidy, they\ncame to the conclusion that those people were not suitable \'cases\' for\nassistance.Perhaps the children had had next to nothing to eat, and\nwould have been in rags if the mother had not worked like a slave\nwashing and mending their clothes.But these were not the sort of\ncases that the visiting ladies assisted; they only gave to those who\nwere in a state of absolute squalor and destitution, and then only on\ncondition that they whined and grovelled.In addition to this district visitor business, the well-to-do\ninhabitants and the local authorities attempted--or rather,\npretended--to grapple with the poverty \'problem\' in many other ways,\nand the columns of the local papers were filled with letters from all\nsorts of cranks who suggested various remedies.One individual, whose\nincome was derived from brewery shares, attributed the prevailing\ndistress to the drunken and improvident habits of the lower orders.Another suggested that it was a Divine protest against the growth of\nRitualism and what he called \'fleshly religion\', and suggested a day of\nhumiliation and prayer.A great number of well-fed persons thought\nthis such an excellent proposition that they proceeded to put it into\npractice.They prayed, whilst the unemployed and the little children\nfasted.If one had not been oppressed by the tragedy of Want and Misery, one\nmight have laughed at the farcical, imbecile measures that were taken\nto relieve it.Several churches held what they called \'Rummage\' or\n\'jumble\' sales.They sent out circulars something like this:\n\n                              JUMBLE SALE\n                       in aid of the Unemployed.If you have any articles of any description which are of no\n    further use to you, we should be grateful for them, and if you\n    will kindly fill in annexed form and post it to us, we will send\n    and collect them.On the day of the sale the parish room was transformed into a kind of\nMarine Stores, filled with all manner of rubbish, with the parson and\nthe visiting ladies grinning in the midst.The things were sold for\nnext to nothing to such as cared to buy them, and the local\nrag-and-bone man reaped a fine harvest.The proceeds of these sales\nwere distributed in \'charity\' and it was usually a case of much cry and\nlittle wool.There was a religious organization, called \'The Mugsborough Skull and\nCrossbones Boys\', which existed for the purpose of perpetuating the\ngreat religious festival of Guy Fawkes.This association also came to\nthe aid of the unemployed and organized a Grand Fancy Dress Carnival\nand Torchlight Procession.When this took place, although there was a\nslight sprinkling of individuals dressed in tawdry costumes as\ncavaliers of the time of Charles I, and a few more as highwaymen or\nfootpads, the majority of the processionists were boys in women\'s\nclothes, or wearing sacks with holes cut in them for their heads and\narms, and with their faces smeared with soot.There were also a number\nof men carrying frying-pans in which they burnt red and blue fire.The\nprocession--or rather, mob--was headed by a band, and the band was\nheaded by two men, arm in arm, one very tall, dressed to represent\nSatan, in red tights, with horns on his head, and smoking a large\ncigar, and the other attired in the no less picturesque costume of a\nbishop of the Established Church.This crew paraded the town, howling and dancing, carrying flaring\ntorches, burning the blue and red fire, and some of them singing silly\nor obscene songs; whilst the collectors ran about with the boxes\nbegging for money from people who were in most cases nearly as\npoverty-stricken as the unemployed they were asked to assist.The\nmoney thus obtained was afterwards handed over to the Secretary of the\nOrganized Benevolence Society, Mr Sawney Grinder.Then there was the Soup Kitchen, which was really an inferior\neating-house in a mean street.The man who ran this was a relative of\nthe secretary of the OBS.He cadged all the ingredients for the soup\nfrom different tradespeople: bones and scraps of meat from butchers:\npea meal and split peas from provision dealers: vegetables from\ngreengrocers: stale bread from bakers, and so on.Well-intentioned,\ncharitable old women with more money than sense sent him donations in\ncash, and he sold the soup for a penny a basin--or a penny a quart to\nthose who brought jugs.He had a large number of shilling books printed, each containing\nthirteen penny tickets.The Organized Benevolence Society bought a lot\nof these books and resold them to benevolent persons, or gave them away\nto \'deserving cases\'.It was this connection with the OBS that gave\nthe Soup Kitchen a semi-official character in the estimation of the\npublic, and furnished the proprietor with the excuse for cadging the\nmaterials and money donations.In the case of the Soup Kitchen, as with the unemployed processions,\nmost of those who benefited were unskilled labourers or derelicts: with\nbut few exceptions the unemployed artisans--although their need was\njust as great as that of the others--avoided the place as if it were\ninfected with the plague.They were afraid even to pass through the\nstreet where it was situated lest anyone seeing them coming from that\ndirection should think they had been there.But all the same, some of\nthem allowed their children to go there by stealth, by night, to buy\nsome of this charity-tainted food.Another brilliant scheme, practical and statesmanlike, so different\nfrom the wild projects of demented Socialists, was started by the Rev.Mr Bosher, a popular preacher, the Vicar of the fashionable Church of\nthe Whited Sepulchre.He collected some subscriptions from a number of\nsemi-imbecile old women who attended his church.With some of this\nmoney he bought a quantity of timber and opened what he called a Labour\nYard, where he employed a number of men sawing firewood.Being a\nclergyman, and because he said he wanted it for a charitable purpose,\nof course he obtained the timber very cheaply--for about half what\nanyone else would have had to pay for it.The wood-sawing was done piecework.A log of wood about the size of a\nrailway sleeper had to be sawn into twelve pieces, and each of these\nhad to be chopped into four.For sawing and chopping one log in this\nmanner the worker was paid ninepence.One log made two bags of\nfirewood, which were sold for a shilling each--a trifle under the usual\nprice.The men who delivered the bags were paid three half-pence for\neach two bags.As there were such a lot of men wanting to do this work, no one was\nallowed to do more than three lots in one day--that came to two\nshillings and threepence--and no one was allowed to do more than two\ndays in one week.The Vicar had a number of bills printed and displayed in shop windows\ncalling attention to what he was doing, and informing the public that\norders could be sent to the Vicarage by post and would receive prompt\nattention and the fuel could be delivered at any address--Messrs\nRushton & Co.having very kindly lent a handcart for the use of the men\nemployed at the Labour Yard.As a result of the appearance of this bill, and of the laudatory\nnotices in the columns of the Ananias, the Obscurer, and the\nChloroform--the papers did not mind giving the business a free\nadvertisement, because it was a charitable concern--many persons\nwithdrew their custom from those who usually supplied them with\nfirewood, and gave their orders to the Yard; and they had the\nsatisfaction of getting their fuel cheaper than before and of\nperforming a charitable action at the same time.As a remedy for unemployment this scheme was on a par with the method\nof the tailor in the fable who thought to lengthen his cloth by cutting\na piece off one end and sewing it on to the other; but there was one\nthing about it that recommended it to the Vicar--it was\nself-supporting.He found that there would be no need to use all the\nmoney he had extracted from the semi-imbecile old ladies for timber, so\nhe bought himself a Newfoundland dog, an antique set of carved ivory\nchessmen, and a dozen bottles of whisky with the remainder of the cash.The reverend gentleman hit upon yet another means of helping the poor.He wrote a letter to the Weekly Chloroform appealing for cast-off boots\nfor poor children.This was considered such a splendid idea that the\neditors of all the local papers referred to it in leading articles, and\nseveral other letters were written by prominent citizens extolling the\nwisdom and benevolence of the profound Bosher.Most of the boots that\nwere sent in response to this appeal had been worn until they needed\nrepair--in a very large proportion of instances, until they were beyond\nrepair.The poor people to whom they were given could not afford to\nhave them mended before using them, and the result was that the boots\ngenerally began to fall to pieces after a few days\' wear.It did not increase the number of\ncast-off boots, and most of the people who \'cast off\' their boots\ngenerally gave them to someone or other.The only difference It can\nhave made was that possibly a few persons who usually threw their boots\naway or sold them to second-hand dealers may have been induced to send\nthem to Mr Bosher instead.But all the same nearly everybody said it\nwas a splendid idea: its originator was applauded as a public\nbenefactor, and the pettifogging busybodies who amused themselves with\nwhat they were pleased to term \'charitable work\' went into imbecile\necstasies over him.Chapter 36\n\nThe OBS\n\n\nOne of the most important agencies for the relief of distress was the\nOrganized Benevolence Society.The proceeds of the fancy-dress carnival; the\ncollections from different churches and chapels which held special\nservices in aid of the unemployed; the weekly collections made by the\nemployees of several local firms and business houses; the proceeds of\nconcerts, bazaars, and entertainments, donations from charitable\npersons, and the subscriptions of the members.The society also\nreceived large quantities of cast-off clothing and boots, and tickets\nof admission to hospitals, convalescent homes and dispensaries from\nsubscribers to those institutions, or from people like Rushton & Co.,\nwho had collecting-boxes in their workshops and offices.Altogether during the last year the Society had received from various\nsources about three hundred pounds in hard cash.This money was\ndevoted to the relief of cases of distress.The largest item in the expenditure of the Society was the salary of\nthe General Secretary, Mr Sawney Grinder--a most deserving case--who\nwas paid one hundred pounds a year.After the death of the previous secretary there were so many candidates\nfor the vacant post that the election of the new secretary was a rather\nexciting affair.The excitement was all the more intense because it\nwas restrained.A special meeting of the society was held: the Mayor,\nAlderman Sweater, presided, and amongst those present were Councillors\nRushton, Didlum and Grinder, Mrs Starvem, Rev.Mr Bosher, a number of\nthe rich, semi-imbecile old women who had helped to open the Labour\nYard, and several other \'ladies\'.Some of these were the district\nvisitors already alluded to, most of them the wives of wealthy citizens\nand retired tradesmen, richly dressed, ignorant, insolent, overbearing\nfrumps, who--after filling themselves with good things in their own\nluxurious homes--went flouncing into the poverty-stricken dwellings of\ntheir poor\'sisters\' and talked to them of\'religion\', lectured them\nabout sobriety and thrift, and--sometimes--gave them tickets for soup\nor orders for shillingsworths of groceries or coal.Some of these\noverfed females--the wives of tradesmen, for instance--belonged to the\nOrganized Benevolence Society, and engaged in this \'work\' for the\npurpose of becoming acquainted with people of superior social\nposition--one of the members was a colonel, and Sir Graball\nD\'Encloseland--the Member of Parliament for the borough--also belonged\nto the Society and occasionally attended its meetings.Others took up\ndistrict visiting as a hobby; they had nothing to do, and being densely\nignorant and of inferior mentality, they had no desire or capacity for\nany intellectual pursuit.So they took up this work for the pleasure\nof playing the grand lady and the superior person at a very small\nexpense.Other of these visiting ladies were middle-aged, unmarried\nwomen with small private incomes--some of them well-meaning,\ncompassionate, gentle creatures who did this work because they\nsincerely desired to help others, and they knew of no better way.These\ndid not take much part in the business of the meetings; they paid their\nsubscriptions and helped to distribute the cast-off clothing and boots\nto those who needed them, and occasionally obtained from the secretary\nan order for provisions or coal or bread for some poverty-stricken\nfamily; but the poor, toil-worn women whom they visited welcomed them\nmore for their sisterly sympathy than for the gifts they brought.Some\nof the visiting ladies were of this character--but they were not many.They were as a few fragrant flowers amidst a dense accumulation of\nnoxious weeds.They were examples of humility and kindness shining\namidst a vile and loathsome mass of hypocrisy, arrogance, and cant.When the Chairman had opened the meeting, Mr Rushton moved a vote of\ncondolence with the relatives of the late secretary whom he eulogized\nin the most extraordinary terms.\'The poor of Mugsborough had lost a kind and sympathetic friend\', \'One\nwho had devoted his life to helping the needy\', and so on and so forth.(As a matter of fact, most of the time of the defunct had been passed\nin helping himself, but Rushton said nothing about that.)Mr Didlum seconded the vote of condolence in similar terms, and it was\ncarried unanimously.Then the Chairman said that the next business was\nto elect a successor to the departed paragon; and immediately no fewer\nthan nine members rose to propose a suitable person--they each had a\nnoble-minded friend or relative willing to sacrifice himself for the\ngood of the poor.The nine Benevolent stood looking at each other and at the Chairman\nwith sickly smiles upon their hypocritical faces.It would never\ndo to have a contest.The Secretary of the OBS was usually regarded as\na sort of philanthropist by the outside public, and it was necessary to\nkeep this fiction alive.For one or two minutes an awkward silence reigned.Then, one after\nanother they all reluctantly resumed their seats with the exception of\nMr Amos Grinder, who said he wished to propose his nephew, Mr Sawney\nGrinder, a young man of a most benevolent disposition who was desirous\nof immolating himself upon the altar of charity for the benefit of the\npoor--or words to that effect.Mr Didlum seconded, and there being no other nomination--for they all\nknew that it would give the game away to have a contest--the Chairman\nput Mr Grinder\'s proposal to the meeting and declared it carried\nunanimously.Another considerable item in the expenditure of the society was the\nrent of the offices--a house in a back street.The landlord of this\nplace was another very deserving case.There were numerous other expenses: stationery and stamps, printing,\nand so on, and what was left of the money was used for the purpose for\nwhich it had been given--a reasonable amount being kept in hand for\nfuture expenses.All the details were of course duly set forth in the\nReport and Balance Sheet at the annual meetings.No copy of this\ndocument was ever handed to the reporters for publication; it was read\nto the meeting by the Secretary; the representatives of the Press took\nnotes, and in the reports of the meeting that subsequently appeared in\nthe local papers the thing was so mixed up and garbled together that\nthe few people who read it could not make head or tail of it.The only\nthing that was clear was that the society had been doing a great deal\nof good to someone or other, and that more money was urgently needed to\ncarry on the work.It usually appeared something like this:\n\n                            HELPING THE NEEDY\n                 Mugsborough Organized Benevolence Society\n                      Annual Meeting at the Town Hall\n\n           A Splendid record of Miscellaneous and Valuable Work.The annual meeting of the above Society was held yesterday at the\n    Town Hall.The Mayor, Alderman Sweater, presided, and amongst\n    those present were Sir Graball D\'Encloseland, Lady D\'Encloseland,\n    Lady Slumrent.Mr Bosher, Mr Cheeseman, Mrs Bilder, Mrs\n    Grosare, Mrs Daree, Mrs Butcher, Mrs Taylor, Mrs Baker, Mrs\n    Starvem, Mrs Slodging, Mrs M. B. Sile, Mrs Knobrane, Mrs M. T.\n    Head, Mr Rushton, Mr Didlum, Mr Grinder and (here followed about a\n    quarter of a column of names of other charitable persons, all\n    subscribers to the Society).The Secretary read the annual report which contained the following\n    amongst other interesting items:\n\n\n    During the year, 1,972 applications for assistance have been\n    received, and of this number 1,302 have been assisted as follows:\n    Bread or grocery orders, 273.Nurses provided,\n    2.Twenty-nine persons, whose cases being chronic, were referred to\n    the Poor Law Guardians.Bedding redeemed,\n    1.Loans granted to people to enable them to pay their rent, 8.Railway fares for men who were\n    going away from the town to employment elsewhere, 12.Advertisements for employment, 4--\n    and so on.There was about another quarter of a column of these details, the\nreading of which was punctuated with applause and concluded with:\n\'Leaving 670 cases which for various reasons the Society was unable to\nassist\'.The report then went on to explain that the work of inquiring\ninto the genuineness of the applications entailed a lot of labour on\nthe part of the Secretary, some cases taking several days.No fewer\nthan 649 letters had been sent out from the office, and 97 postcards.Very few cash gifts were granted, as it was most necessary\nto guard against the Charity being abused.Then followed a most remarkable paragraph headed \'The Balance Sheet\',\nwhich--as it was put--\'included the following\'.\'The following\' was a\njumbled list of items of expenditure, subscriptions, donations,\nlegacies, and collections, winding up with \'the general summary showed\na balance in hand of L178.4.6\'.(They always kept a good balance in\nhand because of the Secretary\'s salary and the rent of the offices.)After this very explicit financial statement came the most important\npart of the report: \'Thanks are expressed to Sir Graball D\'Encloseland\nfor a donation of 2 guineas.Mrs Starvem,\nHospital tickets.Lady Slumrent, letter of admission to Convalescent\nHome.Mrs Sledging, gifts of clothing--and so on for another\nquarter of a column, the whole concluding with a vote of thanks to the\nSecretary and an urgent appeal to the charitable public for more funds\nto enable the Society to continue its noble work.Meantime, in spite of this and kindred organizations the conditions of\nthe under-paid poverty stricken and unemployed workers remained the\nsame.Although the people who got the grocery and coal orders, the\n\'Nourishment\', and the cast-off clothes and boots, were very glad to\nhave them, yet these things did far more harm than good.They\nhumiliated, degraded and pauperized those who received them, and the\nexistence of the societies prevented the problem being grappled with in\na sane and practical manner.The people lacked the necessaries of\nlife: the necessaries of life are produced by Work: these people were\nwilling to work, but were prevented from doing so by the idiotic system\nof society which these \'charitable\' people are determined to do their\nbest to perpetuate.If the people who expect to be praised and glorified for being\ncharitable were never to give another farthing it would be far better\nfor the industrious poor, because then the community as a whole would\nbe compelled to deal with the absurd and unnecessary state of affairs\nthat exists today--millions of people living and dying in wretchedness\nand poverty in an age when science and machinery have made it possible\nto produce such an abundance of everything that everyone might enjoy\nplenty and comfort.It if were not for all this so-called charity the\nstarving unemployed men all over the country would demand to be allowed\nto work and produce the things they are perishing for want of, instead\nof being--as they are now--content to wear their masters\' cast-off\nclothing and to eat the crumbs that fall from his table.Chapter 37\n\nA Brilliant Epigram\n\n\nAll through the winter, the wise, practical, philanthropic, fat persons\nwhom the people of Mugsborough had elected to manage their affairs--or\nwhom they permitted to manage them without being elected--continued to\ngrapple, or to pretend to grapple, with the \'problem\' of unemployment\nand poverty.They continued to hold meetings, rummage and jumble\nsales, entertainments and special services.They continued to\ndistribute the rotten cast-off clothing and boots, and the nourishment\ntickets.They were all so sorry for the poor, especially for the \'dear\nlittle children\'.They did all sorts of things to help the children.In fact, there was nothing that they would not do for them except levy\na halfpenny rate.It might pauperize\nthe parents and destroy parental responsibility.They evidently\nthought that it would be better to destroy the health or even the lives\nof the \'dear little children\' than to pauperize the parents or\nundermine parental responsibility.These people seemed to think that\nthe children were the property of their parents.They did not have\nsense enough to see that the children are not the property of their\nparents at all, but the property of the community.When they attain to\nmanhood and womanhood they will be, if mentally or physically\ninefficient, a burden on the community; if they become criminals, they\nwill prey upon the community, and if they are healthy, educated and\nbrought up in good surroundings, they will become useful citizens, able\nto render valuable service, not merely to their parents, but to the\ncommunity.Therefore the children are the property of the community,\nand it is the business and to the interest of the community to see that\ntheir constitutions are not undermined by starvation.The Secretary of\nthe local Trades Council, a body formed of delegates from all the\ndifferent trades unions in the town, wrote a letter to the Obscurer,\nsetting forth this view.He pointed out that a halfpenny rate in that\ntown would produce a sum of L800, which would be more than sufficient\nto provide food for all the hungry schoolchildren.In the next issue\nof the paper several other letters appeared from leading citizens,\nincluding, of course, Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, ridiculing\nthe proposal of the Trades Council, who were insultingly alluded to as\n\'pothouse politicians\', \'beer-sodden agitators\' and so forth.Their\nright to be regarded as representatives of the working men was denied,\nand Grinder, who, having made inquiries amongst working men, was\nacquainted with the facts, stated that there was scarcely one of the\nlocal branches of the trades unions which had more than a dozen\nmembers; and as Grinder\'s statement was true, the Secretary was unable\nto contradict it.The majority of the working men were also very\nindignant when they heard about the Secretary\'s letter: they said the\nrates were quite high enough as it was, and they sneered at him for\npresuming to write to the papers at all:\n\n\'Who the bloody \'ell was \'e?\'\'E\nwas only a workin\' man the same as themselves--a common carpenter!What\nthe \'ell did \'e know about it?\'E was just trying to make\n\'isself out to be Somebody, that was all.The idea of one of the likes\nof them writing to the papers!\'One day, having nothing better to do, Owen was looking at some books\nthat were exposed for sale on a table outside a second-hand furniture\nshop.One book in particular took his attention: he read several pages\nwith great interest, and regretted that he had not the necessary\nsixpence to buy it.The title of the book was: Consumption: Its Causes\nand Its Cure.The author was a well-known physician who devoted his\nwhole attention to the study of that disease.Amongst other things,\nthe book gave rules for the feeding of delicate children, and there\nwere also several different dietaries recommended for adult persons\nsuffering from the disease.One of these dietaries amused him very\nmuch, because as far as the majority of those who suffer from\nconsumption are concerned, the good doctor might just as well have\nprescribed a trip to the moon:\n\n\'Immediately on waking in the morning, half a pint of milk--this should\nbe hot, if possible--with a small slice of bread and butter.\'At breakfast: half a pint of milk, with coffee, chocolate, or oatmeal:\neggs and bacon, bread and butter, or dry toast.\'At eleven o\'clock: half a pint of milk with an egg beaten up in it or\nsome beef tea and bread and butter.\'At one o\'clock: half a pint of warm milk with a biscuit or sandwich.\'At two o\'clock: fish and roast mutton, or a mutton chop, with as much\nfat as possible: poultry, game, etc., may be taken with vegetables, and\nmilk pudding.\'At five o\'clock: hot milk with coffee or chocolate, bread and butter,\nwatercress, etc.\'At eight o\'clock: a pint of milk, with oatmeal or chocolate, and\ngluten bread, or two lightly boiled eggs with bread and butter.\'Before retiring to rest: a glass of warm milk.\'During the night: a glass of milk with a biscuit or bread and butter\nshould be placed by the bedside and be eaten if the patient awakes.\'Whilst Owen was reading this book, Crass, Harlow, Philpot and Easton\nwere talking together on the other side of the street, and presently\nCrass caught sight of him.They had been discussing the Secretary\'s\nletter re the halfpenny rate, and as Owen was one of the members of the\nTrades Council, Crass suggested that they should go across and tackle\nhim about it.asked Owen after listening for\nabout a quarter of an hour to Crass\'s objection.\'That means that you would have to pay sevenpence per year if we had a\nhalfpenny rate.Wouldn\'t it be worth sevenpence a year to you to know\nthat there were no starving children in the town?\'\'Why should I \'ave to \'elp to keep the children of a man who\'s too lazy\nto work, or spends all \'is money on drink?\'\'\'Ow are\nyer goin\' to make out about the likes o\' them?\'\'If his children are starving we should feed them first, and punish him\nafterwards.\'\'The rates is quite high enough as it is,\' grumbled Harlow, who had\nfour children himself.\'That\'s quite true, but you must remember that the rates the working\nclasses at present pay are spent mostly for the benefit of other\npeople.Good roads are maintained for people who ride in motor cars\nand carriages; the Park and the Town Band for those who have leisure to\nenjoy them; the Police force to protect the property of those who have\nsomething to lose, and so on.But if we pay this rate we shall get\nsomething for our money.\'\'We gets the benefit of the good roads when we \'as to push a \'andcart\nwith a load o\' paint and ladders,\' said Easton.\'Of course,\' said Crass, \'and besides, the workin\' class gets the\nbenefit of all the other things too, because it all makes work.\'\'Well, for my part,\' said Philpot, \'I wouldn\'t mind payin\' my share\ntowards a \'appeny rate, although I ain\'t got no kids o\' me own.\'The hostility of most of the working men to the proposed rate was\nalmost as bitter as that of the \'better\' classes--the noble-minded\nphilanthropists who were always gushing out their sympathy for the\n\'dear little ones\', the loathsome hypocrites who pretended that there\nwas no need to levy a rate because they were willing to give sufficient\nmoney in the form of charity to meet the case: but the children\ncontinued to go hungry all the same.\'Loathsome hypocrites\' may seem a hard saying, but it was a matter of\ncommon knowledge that the majority of the children attending the local\nelementary schools were insufficiently fed.It was admitted that the\nmoney that could be raised by a halfpenny rate would be more than\nsufficient to provide them all with one good meal every day.The\ncharity-mongers who professed such extravagant sympathy with the \'dear\nlittle children\' resisted the levying of the rate \'because it would\npress so heavily on the poorer ratepayers\', and said that they were\nwilling to give more in voluntary charity than the rate would amount\nto: but, the \'dear little children\'--as they were so fond of calling\nthem--continued to go to school hungry all the same.To judge them by their profession and their performances, it appeared\nthat these good kind persons were willing to do any mortal thing for\nthe \'dear little children\' except allow them to be fed.If these people had really meant to do what they pretended, they would\nnot have cared whether they paid the money to a rate-collector or to\nthe secretary of a charity society and they would have preferred to\naccomplish their object in the most efficient and economical way.But although they would not allow the children to be fed, they went to\nchurch and to chapel, glittering with jewellery, their fat carcases\nclothed in rich raiment, and sat with smug smiles upon their faces\nlistening to the fat parsons reading out of a Book that none of them\nseemed able to understand, for this was what they read:\n\n\'And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in the midst of\nthem, and said: Whosoever shall receive one such little child in My\nname, receiveth Me.But whoso shall offend one of these little ones,\nit were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and\nthat he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\'Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say unto\nyou that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father.\'And this: \'Then shall He say unto them: Depart from me, ye cursed, into\nthe everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was\nan hungered and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty and ye gave Me no\ndrink: I was a stranger and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye clothed Me\nnot.\'Then shall they answer: "Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered or athirst\nor a stranger or naked, or sick, and did not minister unto Thee?"and\nHe shall answer them, "Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not\nto one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me."\'These were the sayings that the infidel parsons mouthed in the infidel\ntemples to the richly dressed infidel congregations, who heard but did\nnot understand, for their hearts were become gross and their ears dull\nof hearing.And meantime, all around them, in the alley and the slum,\nand more terrible still--because more secret--in the better sort of\nstreets where lived the respectable class of skilled artisans, the\nlittle children became thinner and paler day by day for lack of proper\nfood, and went to bed early because there was no fire.Sir Graball D\'Encloseland, the Member of Parliament for the borough,\nwas one of the bitterest opponents of the halfpenny rate, but as he\nthought it was probable that there would soon be another General\nElection and he wanted the children\'s fathers to vote for him again, he\nwas willing to do something for them in another way.He had a\nten-year-old daughter whose birthday was in that month, so the\nkind-hearted Baronet made arrangements to give a Tea to all the school\nchildren in the town in honour of the occasion.The tea was served in\nthe schoolrooms and each child was presented with a gilt-edged card on\nwhich was a printed portrait of the little hostess, with \'From your\nloving little friend, Honoria D\'Encloseland\', in gold letters.During\nthe evening the little girl, accompanied by Sir Graball and Lady\nD\'Encloseland, motored round to all the schools where the tea was being\nconsumed: the Baronet made a few remarks, and Honoria made a pretty\nlittle speech, specially learnt for the occasion, at each place, and\nthey were loudly cheered and greatly admired in response.The\nenthusiasm was not confined to the boys and girls, for while the\nspeechmaking was going on inside, a little crowd of grown-up children\nwere gathered round outside the entrance, worshipping the motor car:\nand when the little party came out the crowd worshipped them also,\ngoing into imbecile ecstasies of admiration of their benevolence and\ntheir beautiful clothes.For several weeks everybody in the town was in raptures over this\ntea--or, rather, everybody except a miserable little minority of\nSocialists, who said it was bribery, an electioneering dodge, that did\nno real good, and who continued to clamour for a halfpenny rate.Another specious fraud was the \'Distress Committee\'.This body--or\ncorpse, for there was not much vitality in it--was supposed to exist\nfor the purpose of providing employment for \'deserving cases\'.One\nmight be excused for thinking that any man--no matter what his past may\nhave been--who is willing to work for his living is a \'deserving case\':\nbut this was evidently not the opinion of the persons who devised the\nregulations for the working of this committee.Every applicant for\nwork was immediately given a long job, and presented with a double\nsheet of foolscap paper to do it with.Now, if the object of the\ncommittee had been to furnish the applicant with material for the\nmanufacture of an appropriate headdress for himself, no one could\nreasonably have found fault with them: but the foolscap was not to be\nutilized in that way; it was called a \'Record Paper\', three pages of it\nwere covered with insulting, inquisitive, irrelevant questions\nconcerning the private affairs and past life of the \'case\' who wished\nto be permitted to work for his living, and all these had to be\nanswered to the satisfaction of Messrs D\'Encloseland, Bosher, Sweater,\nRushton, Didlum, Grinder and the other members of the committee, before\nthe case stood any chance of getting employment.However, notwithstanding the offensive nature of the questions on the\napplication form, during the five months that this precious committee\nwas in session, no fewer than 1,237 broken-spirited and humble \'lion\'s\nwhelps\' filled up the forms and answered the questions as meekly as if\nthey had been sheep.The funds of the committee consisted of L500,\nobtained from the Imperial Exchequer, and about L250 in charitable\ndonations.This money was used to pay wages for certain work--some of\nwhich would have had to be done even if the committee had never\nexisted--and if each of the 1,237 applicants had had an equal share of\nthe work, the wages they would have received would have amounted to\nabout twelve shillings each.This was what the \'practical\' persons,\nthe \'business-men\', called \'dealing with the problem of unemployment\'.Imagine having to keep your family for five months with twelve\nshillings!And, if you like, imagine that the Government grant had been four times\nas much as it was, and that the charity had amounted to four times as\nmuch as it did, and then fancy having to keep your family for five\nmonths with two pounds eight shillings!It is true that some of the members of the committee would have been\nvery glad if they had been able to put the means of earning a living\nwithin the reach of every man who was willing to work; but they simply\ndid not know what to do, or how to do it.They were not ignorant of\nthe reality of the evil they were supposed to be \'dealing\nwith\'--appalling evidences of it faced them on every side, and as,\nafter all, these committee men were human beings and not devils, they\nwould have been glad to mitigate it if they could have done so without\nhurting themselves: but the truth was that they did not know what to do!These are the \'practical\' men; the monopolists of intelligence, the\nwise individuals who control the affairs of the world: it is in\naccordance with the ideas of such men as these that the conditions of\nhuman life are regulated.This is the position:\n\nIt is admitted that never before in the history of mankind was it\npossible to produce the necessaries of life in such abundance as at\npresent.The management of the affairs of the world--the business of arranging\nthe conditions under which we live--is at present in the hands of\nPractical, Level-headed, Sensible Business-men.The result of their management is, that the majority of the people find\nit a hard struggle to live.Large numbers exist in perpetual poverty:\na great many more periodically starve: many actually die of want:\nhundreds destroy themselves rather than continue to live and suffer.When the Practical, Level-headed, Sensible Business-men are asked why\nthey do not remedy this state of things, they reply that they do not\nknow what to do!or, that it is impossible to remedy it!And yet it is admitted that it is now possible to produce the\nnecessaries of life, in greater abundance than ever before!With lavish kindness, the Supreme Being had provided all things\nnecessary for the existence and happiness of his creatures.To suggest\nthat it is not so is a blasphemous lie: it is to suggest that the\nSupreme Being is not good or even just.On every side there is an\noverflowing superfluity of the materials requisite for the production\nof all the necessaries of life: from these materials everything we need\nmay be produced in abundance--by Work.Here was an army of people\nlacking the things that may be made by work, standing idle.Willing to\nwork; clamouring to be allowed to work, and the Practical,\nLevel-headed, Sensible Business-men did not know what to do!Of course, the real reason for the difficulty is that the raw materials\nthat were created for the use and benefit of all have been stolen by a\nsmall number, who refuse to allow them to be used for the purposes for\nwhich they were intended.This numerically insignificant minority\nrefused to allow the majority to work and produce the things they need;\nand what work they do graciously permit to be done is not done with the\nobject of producing the necessaries of life for those who work, but for\nthe purpose of creating profit for their masters.And then, strangest fact of all, the people who find it a hard struggle\nto live, or who exist in dreadful poverty and sometimes starve, instead\nof trying to understand the causes of their misery and to find out a\nremedy themselves, spend all their time applauding the Practical,\nSensible, Level-headed Business-men, who bungle and mismanage their\naffairs, and pay them huge salaries for doing so.Sir Graball\nD\'Encloseland, for instance, was a \'Secretary of State\' and was paid\nL5,000 a year.When he first got the job the wages were only a\nbeggarly L2,000, but as he found it impossible to exist on less than\nL100 a week he decided to raise his salary to that amount; and the\nfoolish people who find it a hard struggle to live paid it willingly,\nand when they saw the beautiful motor car and the lovely clothes and\njewellery he purchased for his wife with the money, and heard the Great\nSpeech he made--telling them how the shortage of everything was caused\nby Over-production and Foreign Competition, they clapped their hands\nand went frantic with admiration.Their only regret was that there\nwere no horses attached to the motor car, because if there had been,\nthey could have taken them out and harnessed themselves to it instead.Nothing delighted the childish minds of these poor people so much as\nlistening to or reading extracts from the speeches of such men as\nthese; so in order to amuse them, every now and then, in the midst of\nall the wretchedness, some of the great statesmen made \'great speeches\'\nfull of cunning phrases intended to hoodwink the fools who had elected\nthem.The very same week that Sir Graball\'s salary was increased to\nL5,000 a year, all the papers were full of a very fine one that he\nmade.They appeared with large headlines like this:\n\n             GREAT SPEECH BY SIR GRABALL D\'ENCLOSELAND\n\n                          Brilliant Epigram!None should have more than they need, whilst any have less than\n    they need!The hypocrisy of such a saying in the mouth of a man who was drawing a\nsalary of five thousand pounds a year did not appear to occur to\nanyone.On the contrary, the hired scribes of the capitalist Press\nwrote columns of fulsome admiration of the miserable claptrap, and the\nworking men who had elected this man went into raptures over the\n\'Brilliant Epigram\' as if it were good to eat.They cut it out of the\npapers and carried it about with them: they showed it to each other:\nthey read it and repeated it to each other: they wondered at it and\nwere delighted with it, grinning and gibbering at each other in the\nexuberance of their imbecile enthusiasm.The Distress Committee was not the only body pretending to \'deal\' with\nthe poverty \'problem\': its efforts were supplemented by all the other\nagencies already mentioned--the Labour Yard, the Rummage Sales, the\nOrganized Benevolence Society, and so on, to say nothing of a most\nbenevolent scheme originated by the management of Sweater\'s Emporium,\nwho announced in a letter that was published in the local Press that\nthey were prepared to employ fifty men for one week to carry sandwich\nboards at one shilling--and a loaf of bread--per day.They got the men; some unskilled labourers, a few old, worn out\nartisans whom misery had deprived of the last vestiges of pride or\nshame; a number of habitual drunkards and loafers, and a non-descript\nlot of poor ragged old men--old soldiers and others of whom it would be\nimpossible to say what they had once been.The procession of sandwich men was headed by the Semi-drunk and the\nBesotted Wretch, and each board was covered with a printed poster:\n\'Great Sale of Ladies\' Blouses now Proceeding at Adam Sweater\'s\nEmporium.\'Besides this artful scheme of Sweater\'s for getting a good\nadvertisement on the cheap, numerous other plans for providing\nemployment or alleviating the prevailing misery were put forward in the\ncolumns of the local papers and at the various meetings that were held.Any foolish, idiotic, useless suggestion was certain to receive\nrespectful attention; any crafty plan devised in his own interest or\nfor his own profit by one or other of the crew of sweaters and\nlandlords who controlled the town was sure to be approved of by the\nother inhabitants of Mugsborough, the majority of whom were persons of\nfeeble intellect who not only allowed themselves to be robbed and\nexploited by a few cunning scoundrels, but venerated and applauded them\nfor doing it.Chapter 38\n\nThe Brigands\' Cave\n\n\nOne evening in the drawing-room at \'The Cave\' there was a meeting of a\nnumber of the \'Shining Lights\' to arrange the details of a Rummage\nSale, that was to be held in aid of the unemployed.It was an informal\naffair, and while they were waiting for the other luminaries, the early\narrivals, Messrs Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, Mr Oyley Sweater, the\nBorough Surveyor, Mr Wireman, the electrical engineer who had been\nengaged as an \'expert\' to examine and report on the Electric Light\nWorks, and two or three other gentlemen--all members of the Band--took\nadvantage of the opportunity to discuss a number of things they were\nmutually interested in, which were to be dealt with at the meeting of\nthe Town Council the next day.First, there was the affair of the\nuntenanted Kiosk on the Grand Parade.This building belonged to the\nCorporation, and \'The Cosy Corner Refreshment Coy.\'of which Mr Grinder\nwas the managing director, was thinking of hiring it to open as a\nhigh-class refreshment lounge, provided the Corporation would make\ncertain alterations and let the place at a reasonable rent.Another\nitem which was to be discussed at the Council meeting was Mr Sweater\'s\ngenerous offer to the Corporation respecting the new drain connecting\n\'The Cave\' with the Town Main.The report of Mr Wireman, the electrical expert, was also to be dealt\nwith, and afterwards a resolution in favour of the purchase of the\nMugsborough Electric light and Installation Co.Ltd by the town, was to\nbe proposed.In addition to these matters, several other items, including a proposal\nby Mr Didlum for an important reform in the matter of conducting the\nmeetings of the Council, formed subjects for animated conversation\nbetween the brigands and their host.During this discussion other luminaries arrived, including several\nladies and the Rev.Mr Bosher, of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre.The drawing-room of \'The Cave\' was now elaborately furnished.A large\nmirror in a richly gilt frame reached from the carved marble\nmantelpiece to the cornice.A magnificent clock in an alabaster case\nstood in the centre of the mantelpiece and was flanked by two\nexquisitely painted and gilded vases of Dresden ware.The windows were\ndraped with costly hangings, the floor was covered with a luxurious\ncarpet and expensive rugs.Sumptuously upholstered couches and easy\nchairs added to the comfort of the apartment, which was warmed by the\nimmense fire of coal and oak logs that blazed and crackled in the grate.The conversation now became general and at times highly philosophical\nin character, although Mr Bosher did not take much part, being too\nbusily engaged gobbling up the biscuits and tea, and only occasionally\nspluttering out a reply when a remark or question was directly\naddressed to him.This was Mr Grinder\'s first visit at the house, and he expressed his\nadmiration of the manner in which the ceiling and the walls were\ndecorated, remarking that he had always liked this \'ere Japanese style.Mr Bosher, with his mouth full of biscuit, mumbled that it was sweetly\npretty--charming--beautifully done--must have cost a lot of money.\'Hardly wot you\'d call Japanese, though, is it?\'observed Didlum,\nlooking round with the air of a connoisseur.\'I should be inclined to\nsay it was rather more of the--er--Chinese or Egyptian.\'\'Moorish,\' explained Mr Sweater with a smile.\'I got the idear at the\nParis Exhibition.It\'s simler to the decorations in the "Halambara",\nthe palace of the Sultan of Morocco.That clock there is in the same\nstyle.\'The case of the clock referred to--which stood on a table in a corner\nof the room--was of fretwork, in the form of an Indian Mosque, with a\npointed dome and pinnacles.This was the case that Mary Linden had\nsold to Didlum; the latter had had it stained a dark colour and\npolished and further improved it by substituting a clock of more\nsuitable design than the one it originally held.Mr Sweater had\nnoticed it in Didlum\'s window and, seeing that the design was similar\nin character to the painted decorations on the ceiling and walls of his\ndrawing-room, had purchased it.\'I went to the Paris Exhibition meself,\' said Grinder, when everyone\nhad admired the exquisite workmanship of the clock-case.\'I remember\n\'avin\' a look at the moon through that big telescope.I was never so\nsurprised in me life: you can see it quite plain, and it\'s round!\'You didn\'t used to think it was square, did yer?\'\'No, of course not, but I always used to think it was flat--like a\nplate, but it\'s round like a football.\'\'Certainly: the moon is a very simler body to the earth,\' explained\nDidlum, describing an aerial circle with a wave of his hand.They\nmoves through the air together, but the earth is always nearest to the\nsun and consequently once a fortnight the shadder of the earth falls on\nthe moon and darkens it so that it\'s invisible to the naked eye.The\nnew moon is caused by the moon movin\' a little bit out of the earth\'s\nshadder, and it keeps on comin\' more and more until we gets the full\nmoon; and then it goes back again into the shadder; and so it keeps on.\'For about a minute everyone looked very solemn, and the profound\nsilence was disturbed only the the crunching of the biscuits between\nthe jaws of Mr Bosher, and by certain gurglings in the interior of that\ngentleman.\'Science is a wonderful thing,\' said Mr Sweater at length, wagging his\nhead gravely, \'wonderful!\'\'Yes: but a lot of it is mere theory, you know,\' observed Rushton.\'Take this idear that the world is round, for instance; I fail to see\nit!And then they say as Hawstralia is on the other side of the globe,\nunderneath our feet.In my opinion it\'s ridiculous, because if it was\ntrue, wot\'s to prevent the people droppin\' orf?\'\'Yes: well, of course it\'s very strange,\' admitted Sweater.\'I\'ve\noften thought of that myself.If it was true, we ought to be able to\nwalk on the ceiling of this room, for instance; but of course we know\nthat\'s impossible, and I really don\'t see that the other is any more\nreasonable.\'\'I\'ve often noticed flies walkin\' on the ceilin\',\' remarked Didlum, who\nfelt called upon to defend the globular theory.\'Yes; but they\'re different,\' replied Rushton.\'Flies is provided by\nnature with a gluey substance which oozes out of their feet for the\npurpose of enabling them to walk upside down.\'\'There\'s one thing that seems to me to finish that idear once for all,\'\nsaid Grinder, \'and that is--water always finds its own level.You can\'t\nget away from that; and if the world was round, as they want us to\nbelieve, all the water would run off except just a little at the top.To my mind, that settles the whole argymint.\'\'Another thing that gets over me,\' continued Rushton, \'is this:\naccording to science, the earth turns round on its axle at the rate of\ntwenty miles a minit.Well, what about when a lark goes up in the sky\nand stays there about a quarter of an hour?Why, if it was true that\nthe earth was turnin\' round at that rate all the time, when the bird\ncame down it would find itself \'undreds of miles away from the place\nwhere it went up from!But that doesn\'t \'appen at all; the bird always\ncomes down in the same spot.\'\'Yes, and the same thing applies to balloons and flyin\' machines,\' said\nGrinder.\'If it was true that the world is spinnin\' round on its axle\nso quick as that, if a man started out from Calais to fly to Dover, by\nthe time he got to England he\'d find \'imself in North America, or\np\'r\'aps farther off still.\'\'And if it was true that the world goes round the sun at the rate they\nmakes out, when a balloon went up, the earth would run away from it!They\'d never be able to get back again!\'This was so obvious that nearly everyone said there was probably\nsomething in it, and Didlum could think of no reply.Mr Bosher upon\nbeing appealed to for his opinion, explained that science was alright\nin its way, but unreliable: the things scientists said yesterday they\ncontradicted today, and what they said today they would probably\nrepudiate tomorrow.It was necessary to be very cautious before\naccepting any of their assertions.\'Talking about science,\' said Grinder, as the holy man relapsed into\nsilence and started on another biscuit and a fresh cup of tea.\'Talking\nabout science reminds me of a conversation I \'ad with Dr Weakling the\nother day.You know, he believes we\'re all descended from monkeys.\'Everyone laughed; the thing was so absurd: the idea of placing\nintellectual beings on a level with animals!\'But just wait till you hear how nicely I flattened \'im out,\' continued\nGrinder.\'After we\'d been arguin\' a long time about wot \'e called\neverlution or some sich name, and a lot more tommy-rot that I couldn\'t\nmake no \'ead or tail of--and to tell you the truth I don\'t believe \'e\nunderstood \'arf of it \'imself--I ses to \'im, "Well," I ses, "if it\'s\ntrue that we\'re hall descended from monkeys," I ses, "I think your\nfamly must \'ave left orf where mine begun."\'In the midst of the laughter that greeted the conclusion of Grinder\'s\nstory it was seen that Mr Bosher had become black in the face.He was\nwaving his arms and writhing about like one in a fit, his goggle eyes\nbursting from their sockets, whilst his huge stomach quivering\nspasmodically, alternately contracted and expanded as if it were about\nto explode.In the exuberance of his mirth, the unfortunate disciple had swallowed\ntwo biscuits at once.Everybody rushed to his assistance, Grinder and\nDidlum seized an arm and a shoulder each and forced his head down.Rushton punched him in the back and the ladies shrieked with alarm.They gave him a big drink of tea to help to get the biscuits down, and\nwhen he at last succeeded in swallowing them he sat in the armchair\nwith his eyes red-rimmed and full of tears, which ran down over his\nwhite, flabby face.The arrival of the other members of the committee put an end to the\ninteresting discussion, and they shortly afterwards proceeded with the\nbusiness for which the meeting had been called--the arrangements for\nthe forthcoming Rummage Sale.Chapter 39\n\nThe Brigands at Work\n\n\nThe next day, at the meeting of the Town Council, Mr Wireman\'s report\nconcerning the Electric Light Works was read.The expert\'s opinion was\nso favourable--and it was endorsed by the Borough Engineer, Mr Oyley\nSweater--that a resolution was unanimously carried in favour of\nacquiring the Works for the town, and a secret committee was appointed\nto arrange the preliminaries.Alderman Sweater then suggested that a\nsuitable honorarium be voted to Mr Wireman for his services.This was\ngreeted with a murmur of approval from most of the members, and Mr\nDidlum rose with the intention of proposing a resolution to that effect\nwhen he was interrupted by Alderman Grinder, who said he couldn\'t see\nno sense in giving the man a thing like that.\'Why not give him a sum\nof money?\'Several members said \'Hear, hear,\' to this, but some of the others\nlaughed.\'I can\'t see nothing to laugh at,\' cried Grinder angrily.\'For my part\nI wouldn\'t give you tuppence for all the honorariums in the country.I\nmove that we pay \'im a sum of money.\'\'I\'ll second that,\' said another member of the Band--one of those who\nhad cried \'Hear, Hear.\'Alderman Sweater said that there seemed to be a little misunderstanding\nand explained that an honorarium WAS a sum of money.\'Oh, well, in that case I\'ll withdraw my resolution,\' said Grinder.John journeyed to the hallway.\'I\nthought you wanted to give \'im a \'luminated address or something like\nthat.\'Didlum now moved that a letter of thanks and a fee of fifty guineas be\nvoted to Mr Wireman, and this was also unanimously agreed to.Dr\nWeakling said that it seemed rather a lot, but he did not go so far as\nto vote against it.The next business was the proposal that the Corporation should take\nover the drain connecting Mr Sweater\'s house with the town main.Mr\nSweater--being a public-spirited man--proposed to hand this connecting\ndrain--which ran through a private road--over to the Corporation to be\ntheirs and their successors for ever, on condition that they would pay\nhim the cost of construction--L55--and agreed to keep it in proper\nrepair.After a brief discussion it was decided to take over the drain\non the terms offered, and then Councillor Didlum proposed a vote of\nthanks to Alderman Sweater for his generosity in the matter: this was\npromptly seconded by Councillor Rushton and would have been carried\nnem.con., but for the disgraceful conduct of Dr Weakling, who had the\nbad taste to suggest that the amount was about double what the drain\ncould possibly have cost to construct, that it was of no use to the\nCorporation at all, and that they would merely acquire the liability to\nkeep it in repair.However, no one took the trouble to reply to Weakling, and the Band\nproceeded to the consideration of the next business, which was Mr\nGrinder\'s offer--on behalf of the \'Cosy Corner Refreshment Company\'--to\ntake the Kiosk on the Grand Parade.Mr Grinder submitted a plan of\ncertain alterations that he would require the Corporation to make at\nthe Kiosk, and, provided the Council agreed to do this work he was\nwilling to take a lease of the place for five years at L20 per year.Councillor Didlum proposed that the offer of the \'Cosy Corner\nRefreshment Co.Ltd\' be accepted and the required alterations proceeded\nwith at once.The Kiosk had brought in no rent for nearly two years,\nbut, apart from that consideration, if they accepted this offer they\nwould be able to set some of the unemployed to work.Dr Weakling pointed out that as the proposed alterations would cost\nabout L175--according to the estimate of the Borough Engineer--and, the\nrent being only L20 a year, it would mean that the Council would be L75\nout of pocket at the end of the five years; to say nothing of the\nexpense of keeping the place in repair during all that time.He moved as an amendment that the alterations be made,\nand that they then invite tenders, and let the place to the highest\nbidder.Councillor Rushton said he was disgusted with the attitude taken up by\nthat man Weakling.Perhaps it was hardly right to call\nhim a man.In the matter of these alterations they had\nhad the use of Councillor Grinder\'s brains: it was he who first thought\nof making these improvements in the Kiosk, and therefore he--or rather\nthe company he represented--had a moral right to the tenancy.Dr Weakling said that he thought it was understood that when a man was\nelected to that Council it was because he was supposed to be willing to\nuse his brains for the benefit of his constituents.The Mayor asked if there was any seconder to Weakling\'s amendment, and\nas there was not the original proposition was put and carried.Councillor Rushton suggested that a large shelter with seating\naccommodation for about two hundred persons should be erected on the\nGrand Parade near the Kiosk.The shelter would serve as a protection\nagainst rain, or the rays of the sun in summer.It would add\nmaterially to the comfort of visitors and would be a notable addition\nto the attractions of the town.Councillor Didlum said it was a very good idear, and proposed that the\nSurveyor be instructed to get out the plans.It seemed to him that the\nobject was to benefit, not the town, but Mr Grinder.If\nthis shelter were erected, it would increase the value of the Kiosk as\na refreshment bar by a hundred per cent.If Mr Grinder wanted a\nshelter for his customers he should pay for it himself.He\n(Dr Weakling) was sorry to have to say it, but he could not help\nthinking that this was a Put-up job.(Loud cries of \'Withdraw\'\n\'Apologize\' \'Cast \'im out\' and terrific uproar.)Weakling did not apologize or withdraw, but he said no more.Didlum\'s\nproposition was carried, and the \'Band\' went on to the next item on the\nagenda, which was a proposal by Councillor Didlum to increase the\nsalary of Mr Oyley Sweater, the Borough Engineer, from fifteen pounds\nto seventeen pounds per week.Councillor Didlum said that when they had a good man they ought to\nappreciate him.Compared with other officials, the\nBorough Engineer was not fairly paid.The magistrates\'\nclerk received seventeen pounds a week.The Town Clerk seventeen\npounds per week.He did not wish it to be understood that he thought\nthose gentlemen were overpaid--far from it.It was not\nthat they got too much but that the Engineer got too little.How could\nthey expect a man like that to exist on a paltry fifteen pounds a week?Why, it was nothing more or less than sweating!He had\nmuch pleasure in moving that the Borough Engineer\'s salary be increased\nto seventeen pounds a week, and that his annual holiday be extended\nfrom a fortnight to one calendar month with hard la--he begged\npardon--with full pay.Councillor Rushton said that he did not propose to make a long\nspeech--it was not necessary.He would content himself with formally\nseconding Councillor Didlum\'s excellent proposition.Councillor Weakling, whose rising was greeted with derisive laughter,\nsaid he must oppose the resolution.He wished it to be understood that\nhe was not actuated by any feeling of personal animosity towards the\nBorough Engineer, but at the same time he considered it his duty to say\nthat in his (Dr Weakling\'s) opinion, that official would be dear at\nhalf the price they were now paying him.He did not\nappear to understand his business, nearly all the work that was done\ncost in the end about double what the Borough Engineer estimated it\ncould be done for.He considered him to be a grossly\nincompetent person (uproar) and was of opinion that if they were to\nadvertise they could get dozens of better men who would be glad to do\nthe work for five pounds a week.He moved that Mr Oyley Sweater be\nasked to resign and that they advertise for a man at five pounds a\nweek.Councillor Grinder rose to a point of order.He appealed to the\nChairman to squash the amendment.Councillor Didlum remarked that he supposed Councillor Grinder meant\n\'quash\': in that case, he would support the suggestion.Councillor Grinder said it was about time they put a stopper on that\nfeller Weakling.He (Grinder) did not care whether they called it\nsquashing or quashing; it was all the same so long as they nipped him\nin the bud.The man was a disgrace to the Council; always\ninterfering and hindering the business.The Mayor--Alderman Sweater--said that he did not think it consistent\nwith the dignity of that Council to waste any more time over this\nscurrilous amendment.He was proud to say that it had\nnever even been seconded, and therefore he would put Mr Didlum\'s\nresolution--a proposition which he had no hesitation in saying\nreflected the highest credit upon that gentleman and upon all those who\nsupported it.All those who were in favour signified their approval in the customary\nmanner, and as Weakling was the only one opposed, the resolution was\ncarried and the meeting proceeded to the next business.Councillor Rushton said that several influential ratepayers and\nemployers of labour had complained to him about the high wages of the\nCorporation workmen, some of whom were paid sevenpence-halfpenny an\nhour.Sevenpence an hour was the maximum wage paid to skilled workmen\nby private employers in that town, and he failed to see why the\nCorporation should pay more.It had a very bad effect\non the minds of the men in the employment of private firms, tending to\nmake them dissatisfied with their wages.The same state of affairs\nprevailed with regard to the unskilled labourers in the Council\'s\nemployment.Private employers could get that class of labour for\nfourpence-halfpenny or fivepence an hour, and yet the corporation paid\nfivepence-halfpenny and even sixpence for the same class of work.Considering\nthat the men in the employment of the Corporation had almost constant\nwork, if there was to be a difference at all, they should get not more,\nbut less, than those who worked for private firms.He moved\nthat the wages of the Corporation workmen be reduced in all cases to\nthe same level as those paid by private firms.He said it amounted to a positive\nscandal.Why, in the summer-time some of these men drew as much as\n35/- in a single week!and it was quite common for unskilled\nlabourers--fellers who did nothing but the very hardest and most\nlaborious work, sich as carrying sacks of cement, or digging up the\nroads to get at the drains, and sich-like easy jobs--to walk off with\n25/- a week!He had often noticed some of these men\nswaggering about the town on Sundays, dressed like millionaires and\ncigared up!They seemed quite a different class of men from those who\nworked for private firms, and to look at the way some of their children\nwas dressed you\'d think their fathers was Cabinet Minstrels!No wonder\nthe ratepayers complained ot the high rates.Another grievance was\nthat all the Corporation workmen were allowed two days\' holiday every\nyear, in addition to the Bank Holidays, and were paid for them!(Cries\nof\'shame\', \'Scandalous\', \'Disgraceful\', etc.)No private contractor\npaid his men for Bank Holidays, and why should the Corporation do so?He had much pleasure in seconding Councillor Rushton\'s resolution.He thought that 35/- a week was\nlittle enough for a man to keep a wife and family with (Rot), even if\nall the men got it regularly, which they did not.Members should\nconsider what was the average amount per week throughout the whole\nyear, not merely the busy time, and if they did that they would find\nthat even the skilled men did not average more than 25/- a week, and in\nmany cases not so much.If this subject had not been introduced by\nCouncillor Rushton, he (Dr Weakling) had intended to propose that the\nwages of the Corporation workmen should be increased to the standard\nrecognized by the Trades Unions.It had been proved\nthat the notoriously short lives of the working people--whose average\nspan of life was about twenty years less than that of the well-to-do\nclasses--their increasingly inferior physique, and the high rate of\nmortality amongst their children was caused by the wretched\nremuneration they received for hard and tiring work, the excessive\nnumber of hours they have to work, when employed, the bad quality of\ntheir food, the badly constructed and insanitary homes their poverty\ncompels them to occupy, and the anxiety, worry, and depression of mind\nthey have to suffer when out of employment.(Cries of \'Rot\', \'Bosh\',\nand loud laughter.)Councillor Didlum said, \'Rot\'.It was a very good\nword to describe the disease that was sapping the foundations of\nsociety and destroying the health and happiness and the very lives of\nso many of their fellow countrymen and women.(Renewed merriment and\nshouts of \'Go and buy a red tie.\')He appealed to the members to\nreject the resolution.He was very glad to say that he believed it was\ntrue that the workmen in the employ of the Corporation were a little\nbetter off than those in the employ of private contractors, and if it\nwere so, it was as it should be.They had need to be better off than\nthe poverty-stricken, half-starved poor wretches who worked for private\nfirms.Councillor Didlum said that it was very evident that Dr Weakling had\nobtained his seat on that Council by false pretences.If he had told\nthe ratepayers that he was a Socialist, they would never have elected\nhim.Practically every Christian minister in the\ncountry would agree with him (Didlum) when he said that the poverty of\nthe working classes was caused not by the \'wretched remuneration they\nreceive as wages\', but by Drink.And he was very\nsure that the testimony of the clergy of all denominations was more to\nbe relied upon than the opinion of a man like Dr Weakling.Dr Weakling said that if some of the clergymen referred to or some of\nthe members of the council had to exist and toil amid the same sordid\nsurroundings, overcrowding and ignorance as some of the working\nclasses, they would probably seek to secure some share of pleasure and\nforgetfulness in drink themselves!(Great uproar and shouts of\n\'Order\', \'Withdraw\', \'Apologize\'.)Councillor Grinder said that even if it was true that the haverage\nlives of the working classes was twenty years shorter than those of the\nbetter classes, he could not see what it had got to do with Dr\nWeakling.So long as the working class was contented to\ndie twenty years before their time, he failed to see what it had got to\ndo with other people.They was not runnin\' short of workers, was they?So long as the\nworkin\' class was satisfied to die orf--let \'em die orf!The workin\' class adn\'t arst Dr Weakling to\nstick up for them, had they?If they wasn\'t satisfied, they would\nstick up for theirselves!The working men didn\'t want the likes of Dr\nWeakling to stick up for them, and they would let \'im know it when the\nnext election came round.If he (Grinder) was a wordly man, he would\nnot mind betting that the workin\' men of Dr Weakling\'s ward would give\nhim \'the dirty kick out\' next November.Councillor Weakling, who knew that this was probably true, made no\nfurther protest.Rushton\'s proposition was carried, and then the Clerk\nannounced that the next item was the resolution Mr Didlum had given\nnotice of at the last meeting, and the Mayor accordingly called upon\nthat gentleman.Councillor Didlum, who was received with loud cheers, said that\nunfortunately a certain member of that Council seemed to think he had a\nright to oppose nearly everything that was brought forward.(The majority of the members of the Band glared malignantly at\nWeakling.)He hoped that for once the individual he referred to would have the\ndecency to restrain himself, because the resolution he (Didlum) was\nabout to have the honour of proposing was one that he believed no\nright-minded man--no matter what his politics or religious\nopinions--could possibly object to; and he trusted that for the credit\nof the Council it would be entered on the records as an unopposed\nmotion.The resolution was as follows:\n\n\'That from this date all the meetings of this Council shall be opened\nwith prayer and closed with the singing of the Doxology.\'Councillor Rushton seconded the resolution, which was also supported by\nMr Grinder, who said that at a time like the present, when there was\nsich a lot of infiddles about who said that we all came from monkeys,\nthe Council would be showing a good example to the working classes by\nadopting the resolution.Councillor Weakling said nothing, so the new rule was carried nem.con., and as there was no more business to be done it was put into\noperation for the first time there and then.Mr Sweater conducting the\nsinging with a roll of paper--the plan of the drain of \'The Cave\'--and\neach member singing a different tune.Weakling withdrew during the singing, and afterwards, before the Band\ndispersed, it was agreed that a certain number of them were to meet the\nChief at the Cave, on the following evening to arrange the details of\nthe proposed raid on the finances of the town in connection with the\nsale of the Electric Light Works.The alterations which the Corporation had undertaken to make in the\nKiosk on the Grand Parade provided employment for several carpenters\nand plasterers for about three weeks, and afterwards for several\npainters.Sandra went back to the bathroom.This fact was sufficient to secure the working men\'s\nunqualified approval of the action of the Council in letting the place\nto Grinder, and Councillor Weakling\'s opposition--the reasons of which\nthey did not take the trouble to inquire into or understand--they as\nheartily condemned.All they knew or cared was that he had tried to\nprevent the work being done, and that he had referred in insulting\nterms to the working men of the town.What right had he to call them\nhalf-starved, poverty-stricken, poor wretches?If it came to being\npoverty-stricken, according to all accounts, he wasn\'t any too well orf\nhisself.Some of those blokes who went swaggering about in frock-coats\nand pot-\'ats was just as \'ard up as anyone else if the truth was known.As for the Corporation workmen, it was quite right that their wages\nshould be reduced.Why should they get more money than anyone else?\'It\'s us what\'s got to find the money,\' they said.\'We\'re the\nratepayers, and why should we have to pay them more wages than we get\nourselves?And why should they be paid for holidays any more than us?\'During the next few weeks the dearth of employment continued, for, of\ncourse, the work at the Kiosk and the few others jobs that were being\ndone did not make much difference to the general situation.Groups of\nworkmen stood at the corners or walked aimlessly about the streets.Most of them no longer troubled to go to the different firms to ask for\nwork, they were usually told that they would be sent for if wanted.During this time Owen did his best to convert the other men to his\nviews.He had accumulated a little library of Socialist books and\npamphlets which he lent to those he hoped to influence.Some of them\ntook these books and promised, with the air of men who were conferring\na great favour, that they would read them.As a rule, when they\nreturned them it was with vague expressions of approval, but they\nusually evinced a disinclination to discuss the contents in detail\nbecause, in nine instances out of ten, they had not attempted to read\nthem.As for those who did make a half-hearted effort to do so, in the\nmajority of cases their minds were so rusty and stultified by long\nyears of disuse, that, although the pamphlets were generally written in\nsuch simple language that a child might have understood, the argument\nwas generally too obscure to be grasped by men whose minds were addled\nby the stories told them by their Liberal and Tory masters.Some, when\nOwen offered to lend them some books or pamphlets refused to accept\nthem, and others who did him the great favour of accepting them,\nafterwards boasted that they had used them as toilet paper.Owen frequently entered into long arguments with the other men, saying\nthat it was the duty of the State to provide productive work for all\nthose who were willing to do it.Some few of them listened like men\nwho only vaguely understood, but were willing to be convinced.It\'s right enough what you say,\' they would remark.Others ridiculed this doctrine of State employment: It was all very\nfine, but where was the money to come from?And then those who had\nbeen disposed to agree with Owen could relapse into their old apathy.There were others who did not listen so quietly, but shouted with many\ncurses that it was the likes of such fellows as Owen who were\nresponsible for all the depression in trade.All this talk about\nSocialism and State employment was frightening Capital out of the\ncountry.Those who had money were afraid to invest it in industries,\nor to have any work done for fear they would be robbed.When Owen\nquoted statistics to prove that as far as commerce and the quantity\nproduced of commodities of all kinds was concerned, the last year had\nbeen a record one, they became more infuriated than ever, and talked\nthreateningly of what they would like to do to those bloody Socialists\nwho were upsetting everything.One day Crass, who was one of these upholders of the existing system,\nscored off Owen finely.A little group of them were standing talking\nin the Wage Slave Market near the Fountain.In the course of the\nargument, Owen made the remark that under existing conditions life was\nnot worth living, and Crass said that if he really thought so, there\nwas no compulsion about it; if he wasn\'t satisfied--if he didn\'t want\nto live--he could go and die.Why the hell didn\'t he go and make a\nhole in the water, or cut his bloody throat?On this particular occasion the subject of the argument was--at\nfirst--the recent increase of the Borough Engineer\'s salary to\nseventeen pounds per week.Owen had said it was robbery, but the\nmajority of the others expressed their approval of the increase.They\nasked Owen if he expected a man like that to work for nothing!It was\nnot as if he were one of the likes of themselves.They said that, as\nfor it being robbery, Owen would be very glad to have the chance of\ngetting it himself.Most of them seemed to think the fact that anyone\nwould be glad to have seventeen pounds a week, proved that it was right\nfor them to pay that amount to the Borough Engineer!Usually whenever Owen reflected upon the gross injustices, and\ninhumanity of the existing social disorder, he became convinced that it\ncould not possibly last; it was bound to fall to pieces because of its\nown rottenness.It was not just, it was not common sense, and\ntherefore it could not endure.But always after one of these\narguments--or, rather, disputes--with his fellow workmen, he almost\nrelapsed into hopelessness and despondency, for then he realized how\nvast and how strong are the fortifications that surround the present\nsystem; the great barriers and ramparts of invincible ignorance, apathy\nand self-contempt, which will have to be broken down before the system\nof society of which they are the defences, can be swept away.At other times as he thought of this marvellous system, it presented\nitself to him in such an aspect of almost comical absurdity that he was\nforced to laugh and to wonder whether it really existed at all, or if\nit were only an illusion of his own disordered mind.One of the things that the human race needed in order to exist was\nshelter; so with much painful labour they had constructed a large\nnumber of houses.Thousands of these houses were now standing\nunoccupied, while millions of the people who had helped to build the\nhouses were either homeless or herding together in overcrowded hovels.These human beings had such a strange system of arranging their affairs\nthat if anyone were to go and burn down a lot of the houses he would be\nconferring a great boon upon those who had built them, because such an\nact would \'Make a lot more work!\'Another very comical thing was that thousands of people wore broken\nboots and ragged clothes, while millions of pairs of boots and\nabundance of clothing, which they had helped to make, were locked up in\nwarehouses, and the System had the keys.Thousands of people lacked the necessaries of life.The necessaries of\nlife are all produced by work.The people who lacked begged to be\nallowed to work and create those things of which they stood in need.If anyone asked the System why it prevented these people from producing\nthe things of which they were in want, the System replied:\n\n\'Because they have already produced too much.The warehouses are filled and overflowing, and there is nothing more\nfor them to do.\'There was in existence a huge accumulation of everything necessary.A\ngreat number of the people whose labour had produced that vast store\nwere now living in want, but the System said that they could not be\npermitted to partake of the things they had created.Then, after a\ntime, when these people, being reduced to the last extreme of misery,\ncried out that they and their children were dying of hunger, the System\ngrudgingly unlocked the doors of the great warehouses, and taking out a\nsmall part of the things that were stored within, distributed it\namongst the famished workers, at the same time reminding them that it\nwas Charity, because all the things in the warehouses, although they\nhad been made by the workers, were now the property of the people who\ndo nothing.And then the starving, bootless, ragged, stupid wretches fell down and\nworshipped the System, and offered up their children as living\nsacrifices upon its altars, saying:\n\n\'This beautiful System is the only one possible, and the best that\nhuman wisdom can devise.Cursed be\nthose who seek to destroy the System!\'As the absurdity of the thing forced itself upon him, Owen, in spite of\nthe unhappiness he felt at the sight of all the misery by which he was\nsurrounded, laughed aloud and said to himself that if he was sane, then\nall these people must be mad.In the face of such colossal imbecility it was absurd to hope for any\nimmediate improvement.The little already accomplished was the work of\na few self-sacrificing enthusiasts, battling against the opposition of\nthose they sought to benefit, and the results of their labours were, in\nmany instances, as pearls cast before the swine who stood watching for\nopportunities to fall upon and rend their benefactors.It was possible that the monopolists,\nencouraged by the extraordinary stupidity and apathy of the people\nwould proceed to lay upon them even greater burdens, until at last,\ngoaded by suffering, and not having sufficient intelligence to\nunderstand any other remedy, these miserable wretches would turn upon\ntheir oppressors and drown both them and their System in a sea of blood.Besides the work at the Kiosk, towards the end of March things\ngradually began to improve in other directions.Several firms began to\ntake on a few hands.Several large empty houses that were relet had to\nbe renovated for their new tenants, and there was a fair amount of\ninside work arising out of the annual spring-cleaning in other houses.There was not enough work to keep everyone employed, and most of those\nwho were taken on as a rule only managed to make a few hours a week,\nbut still it was better than absolute idleness, and there also began to\nbe talk of several large outside jobs that were to be done as soon as\nthe weather was settled.This bad weather, by the way, was a sort of boon to the defenders of\nthe present system, who were hard-up for sensible arguments to explain\nthe cause of poverty.One of the principal causes was, of course, the\nweather, which was keeping everything back.There was not the\nslightest doubt that if only the weather would allow there would always\nbe plenty of work, and poverty would be abolished.had a fair share of what work there was, and Crass,\nSawkins, Slyme and Owen were kept employed pretty regularly, although\nthey did not start until half past eight and left off at four.At\ndifferent houses in various parts of the town they had ceilings to wash\noff and distemper, to strip the old paper from the walls, and to\nrepaint and paper the rooms, and sometimes there were the venetian\nblinds to repair and repaint.Occasionally a few extra hands were\ntaken on for a few days, and discharged again as soon as the job they\nwere taken on to do was finished.The defenders of the existing system may possibly believe that the\nknowledge that they would be discharged directly the job was done was a\nvery good incentive to industry, that they would naturally under these\ncircumstances do their best to get the work done as quickly as\npossible.But then it must be remembered that most of the defenders of\nthe existing system are so constituted, that they can believe anything\nprovided it is not true and sufficiently silly.All the same, it was a fact that the workmen did do their very best to\nget over this work in the shortest possible time, because although they\nknew that to do so was contrary to their own interests, they also knew\nthat it would be very much more contrary to their interests not to do\nso.Their only chance of being kept on if other work came in was to\ntear into it for all they were worth.Consequently, most of the work\nwas rushed and botched and slobbered over in about half the time that\nit would have taken to do it properly.Rooms for which the customers\npaid to have three coats of paint were scamped with one or two.What\nMisery did not know about scamping and faking the work, the men\nsuggested to and showed him in the hope of currying favour with him in\norder that they might get the preference over others and be sent for\nwhen the next job came in.This is the principal incentive provided by\nthe present system, the incentive to cheat.These fellows cheated the\ncustomers of their money.They cheated themselves and their fellow\nworkmen of work, and their children of bread, but it was all for a good\ncause--to make profit for their master.Harlow and Slyme did one job--a room that Rushton & Co.It was finished with two and the men cleared\naway their paints.The next day, when Slyme went there to paper the\nroom, the lady of the house said that the painting was not yet\nfinished--it was to have another coat.Slyme assured her that it had\nalready had three, but, as the lady insisted, Slyme went to the shop\nand sought out Misery.Harlow had been stood off, as there was not\nanother job in just then, but fortunately he happened to be standing in\nthe street outside the shop, so they called him and then the three of\nthem went round to the job and swore that the room had had three coats.She had watched the progress of\nthe work.Besides, it was impossible; they had only been there three\ndays.The first day they had not put any paint on at all; they had\ndone the ceiling and stripped the walls; the painting was not started\ntill the second day.Misery\nexplained the mystery: he said that for first coating they had an extra\nspecial very fast-drying paint--paint that dried so quickly that they\nwere able to give the work two coats in one day.For instance, one man\ndid the window, the other the door: when these were finished both men\ndid the skirting; by the time the skirting was finished the door and\nwindow were dry enough to second coat; and then, on the following\nday--the finishing coat!Of course, this extra special quick-drying paint was very expensive,\nbut the firm did not mind that.They knew that most of their customers\nwished to have their work finished as quickly as possible, and their\nstudy was to give satisfaction to the customers.This explanation\nsatisfied the lady--a poverty-stricken widow making a precarious living\nby taking in lodgers--who was the more easily deceived because she\nregarded Misery as a very holy man, having seen him preaching in the\nstreet on many occasions.There was another job at another boarding-house that Owen and Easton\ndid--two rooms which had to be painted three coats of white paint and\none of enamel, making four coats altogether.That was what the firm\nhad contracted to do.As the old paint in these rooms was of a rather\ndark shade it was absolutely necessary to give the work three coats\nbefore enamelling it.Misery wanted them to let it go with two, but\nOwen pointed out that if they did so it would be such a ghastly mess\nthat it would never pass.After thinking the matter over for a few\nminutes, Misery told them to go on with the third coat of paint.Then\nhe went downstairs and asked to see the lady of the house.He\nexplained to her that, in consequence of the old paint being so dark,\nhe found that it would be necessary, in order to make a good job of it,\nto give the work four coats before enamelling it.Of course, they had\nagreed for only three, but as they always made a point of doing their\nwork in a first-class manner rather than not make a good job, they\nwould give it the extra coat for nothing, but he was sure she would not\nwish them to do that.The lady said that she did not want them to work\nfor nothing, and she wanted it done properly.If it were necessary to\ngive it an extra coat, they must do so and she would pay for it.The lady was satisfied, and Misery\nwas in the seventh heaven.Then he went upstairs again and warned Owen\nand Easton to be sure to say, if they were asked, that the work had had\nfour coats.It would not be reasonable to blame Misery or Rushton for not wishing\nto do good, honest work--there was no incentive.When they secured a\ncontract, if they had thought first of making the very best possible\njob of it, they would not have made so much profit.The incentive was\nnot to do the work as well as possible, but to do as little as\npossible.The incentive was not to make good work, but to make good\nprofit.They could not justly be blamed\nfor not doing good work--there was no incentive.To do good work\nrequires time and pains.Most of them would have liked to take time\nand pains, because all those who are capable of doing good work find\npleasure and happiness in doing it, and have pride in it when done: but\nthere was no incentive, unless the certainty of getting the sack could\nbe called an incentive, for it was a moral certainty that any man who\nwas caught taking time and pains with his work would be promptly\npresented with the order of the boot.But there was plenty of\nincentive to hurry and scamp and slobber and botch.There was another job at a lodging-house--two rooms to be painted and\npapered.The landlord paid for the work, but the tenant had the\nprivilege of choosing the paper.She could have any pattern she liked\nso long as the cost did not exceed one shilling per roll, Rushton\'s\nestimate being for paper of that price.Misery sent her several\npatterns of sixpenny papers, marked at a shilling, to choose from, but\nshe did not fancy any of them, and said that she would come to the shop\nto make her selection.So Hunter tore round to the shop in a great\nhurry to get there before her.In his haste to dismount, he fell off\nhis bicycle into the muddy road, and nearly smashed the plate-glass\nwindow with the handle-bar of the machine as he placed it against the\nshop front before going in.Without waiting to clean the mud off his clothes, he ordered Budd, the\npimply-faced shopman, to get out rolls of all the sixpenny papers they\nhad, and then they both set to work and altered the price marked upon\nthem from sixpence to a shilling.Then they got out a number of\nshilling papers and altered the price marked upon them, changing it\nfrom a shilling to one and six.When the unfortunate woman arrived, Misery was waiting for her with a\nbenign smile upon his long visage.He showed her all the sixpenny\nones, but she did not like any of them, so after a while Nimrod\nsuggested that perhaps she would like a paper of a little better\nquality, and she could pay the trifling difference out of her own\npocket.Then he showed her the shilling papers that he had marked up\nto one and sixpence, and eventually the lady selected one of these and\npaid the extra sixpence per roll herself, as Nimrod suggested.There\nwere fifteen rolls of paper altogether--seven for one room and eight\nfor the other--so that in addition to the ordinary profit on the sale\nof the paper--about two hundred and seventy-five per cent.--the firm\nmade seven and sixpence on this transaction.They might have done\nbetter out of the job itself if Slyme had not been hanging the paper\npiece-work, for, the two rooms being of the same pattern, he could\neasily have managed to do them with fourteen rolls; in fact, that was\nall he did use, but he cut up and partly destroyed the one that was\nover so that he could charge for hanging it.Owen was working there at the same time, for the painting of the rooms\nwas not done before Slyme papered them; the finishing coat was put on\nafter the paper was hung.He noticed Slyme destroying the paper and,\nguessing the reason, asked him how he could reconcile such conduct as\nthat with his profession of religion.Slyme replied that the fact that he was a Christian did not imply that\nhe never did anything wrong: if he committed a sin, he was a Christian\nall the same, and it would be forgiven him for the sake of the Blood.As for this affair of the paper, it was a matter between himself and\nGod, and Owen had no right to set himself up as a Judge.In addition to all this work, there were a number of funerals.Crass\nand Slyme did very well out of it all, working all day white-washing or\npainting, and sometimes part of the night painting venetian blinds or\npolishing coffins and taking them home, to say nothing of the lifting\nin of the corpses and afterwards acting as bearers.As time went on, the number of small jobs increased, and as the days\ngrew longer the men were allowed to put in a greater number of hours.Most of the firms had some work, but there was never enough to keep all\nthe men in the town employed at the same time.It worked like this:\nEvery firm had a certain number of men who were regarded as the regular\nhands.When there was any work to do, they got the preference over\nstrangers or outsiders.When things were busy, outsiders were taken on\ntemporarily.When the work fell off, these casual hands were the first\nto be\'stood still\'.If it continued to fall off, the old hands were\nalso stood still in order of seniority, the older hands being preferred\nto strangers--so long, of course, as they were not old in the sense of\nbeing aged or inefficient.This kind of thing usually continued all through the spring and summer.In good years the men of all trades, carpenters, bricklayers,\nplasterers, painters and so on, were able to keep almost regularly at\nwork, except in wet weather.The difference between a good and bad spring and summer is that in good\nyears it is sometimes possible to make a little overtime, and the\nperiods of unemployment are shorter and less frequent than in bad\nyears.It is rare even in good years for one of the casual hands to be\nemployed by one firm for more than one, two or three months without a\nbreak.It is usual for them to put in a month with one firm, then a\nfortnight with another, then perhaps six weeks somewhere else, and\noften between there are two or three days or even weeks of enforced\nidleness.This sort of thing goes on all through spring, summer and\nautumn.The Beano Meeting\n\n\nBy the beginning of April, Rushton & Co.were again working nine hours\na day, from seven in the morning till five-thirty at night, and after\nEaster they started working full time from 6 A.M.till 5.30 P.M.,\neleven and a half hours--or, rather, ten hours, for they had to lose\nhalf an hour at breakfast and an hour at dinner.Just before Easter several of the men asked Hunter if they might be\nallowed to work on Good Friday and Easter Monday, as, they said, they\nhad had enough holidays during the winter; they had no money to spare\nfor holiday-making, and they did not wish to lose two days\' pay when\nthere was work to be done.Hunter told them that there was not\nsufficient work in to justify him in doing as they requested: things\nwere getting very slack again, and Mr Rushton had decided to cease work\nfrom Thursday night till Tuesday morning.They were thus prevented\nfrom working on Good Friday, but it is true that not more than one\nworking man in fifty went to any religious service on that day or on\nany other day during the Easter festival.On the contrary, this\nfestival was the occasion of much cursing and blaspheming on the part\nof those whose penniless, poverty-stricken condition it helped to\naggravate by enforcing unprofitable idleness which they lacked the\nmeans to enjoy.During these holidays some of the men did little jobs on their own\naccount and others put in the whole time--including Good Friday and\nEaster Sunday--gardening, digging and planting their plots of allotment\nground.When Owen arrived home one evening during the week before Easter,\nFrankie gave him an envelope which he had brought home from school.It\ncontained a printed leaflet:\n\n                   CHURCH OF THE WHITED SEPULCHRE,\n                             MUGSBOROUGH\n\n                             Easter 19--\n\nDear Sir (or Madam),\n\nIn accordance with the usual custom we invite you to join with us in\npresenting the Vicar, the Rev.Habbakuk Bosher, with an Easter\nOffering, as a token of affection and regard.Yours faithfully,\n                          A. Cheeseman }\n                          W. Taylor    }  Churchwardens\n\nMr Bosher\'s income from various sources connected with the church was\nover six hundred pounds a year, or about twelve pounds per week, but as\nthat sum was evidently insufficient, his admirers had adopted this\ndevice for supplementing it.Frankie said all the boys had one of\nthese letters and were going to ask their fathers for some money to\ngive towards the Easter offering.Most of them expected to get\ntwopence.As the boy had evidently set his heart on doing the same as the other\nchildren, Owen gave him the twopence, and they afterwards learned that\nthe Easter Offering for that year was one hundred and twenty-seven\npounds, which was made up of the amounts collected from the\nparishioners by the children, the district visitors and the verger, the\ncollection at a special Service, and donations from the feeble-minded\nold females elsewhere referred to.By the end of April nearly all the old hands were back at work, and\nseveral casual hands had also been taken on, the Semi-drunk being one\nof the number.In addition to these, Misery had taken on a number of\nwhat he called \'lightweights\', men who were not really skilled workmen,\nbut had picked up sufficient knowledge of the simpler parts of the\ntrade to be able to get over it passably.These were paid fivepence or\nfivepence-halfpenny, and were employed in preference to those who had\nserved their time, because the latter wanted more money and therefore\nwere only employed when absolutely necessary.Besides the lightweights\nthere were a few young fellows called improvers, who were also employed\nbecause they were cheap.Crass now acted as colourman, having been appointed possibly because he\nknew absolutely nothing about the laws of colour.As most of the work\nconsisted of small jobs, all the paint and distemper was mixed up at\nthe shop and sent out ready for use to the various jobs.Sawkins or some of the other lightweights generally carried the heavier\nlots of colour or scaffolding, but the smaller lots of colour or such\nthings as a pair of steps or a painter\'s plank were usually sent by the\nboy, whose slender legs had become quite bowed since he had been\nengaged helping the other philanthropists to make money for Mr Rushton.Crass\'s work as colourman was simplified, to a certain extent, by the\ngreat number of specially prepared paints and distempers in all\ncolours, supplied by the manufacturers ready for use.Most of these\nnew-fangled concoctions were regarded with an eye of suspicion and\ndislike by the hands, and Philpot voiced the general opinion about them\none day during a dinner-hour discussion when he said they might appear\nto be all right for a time, but they would probably not last, because\nthey was mostly made of kimicles.One of these new-fashioned paints was called \'Petrifying Liquid\', and\nwas used for first-coating decaying stone or plaster work.It was also\nsupposed to be used for thinning up a certain kind of patent distemper,\nbut when Misery found out that it was possible to thin the latter with\nwater, the use of \'Petrifying Liquid\' for that purpose was\ndiscontinued.This \'Petrifying Liquid\' was a source of much merriment\nto the hands.The name was applied to the tea that they made in\nbuckets on some of the jobs, and also to the four-ale that was supplied\nby certain pubs.One of the new inventions was regarded with a certain amount of\nindignation by the hands: it was a white enamel, and they objected to\nit for two reasons--one was because, as Philpot remarked, it dried so\nquickly that you had to work like greased lightning; you had to be all\nover the door directly you started it.The other reason was that, because it dried so quickly, it was\nnecessary to keep closed the doors and windows of the room where it was\nbeing used, and the smell was so awful that it brought on fits of\ndizziness and sometimes vomiting.Needless to say, the fact that it\ncompelled those who used it to work quickly recommended the stuff to\nMisery.As for the smell, he did not care about that; he did not have to inhale\nthe fumes himself.It was just about this time that Crass, after due consultation with\nseveral of the others, including Philpot, Harlow, Bundy, Slyme, Easton\nand the Semi-drunk, decided to call a meeting of the hands for the\npurpose of considering the advisability of holding the usual Beano\nlater on in the summer.The meeting was held in the carpenter\'s shop\ndown at the yard one evening at six o\'clock, which allowed time for\nthose interested to attend after leaving work.The hands sat on the benches or carpenter\'s stools, or reclined upon\nheaps of shavings.On a pair of tressels in the centre of the workshop\nstood a large oak coffin which Crass had just finished polishing.When all those who were expected to turn up had arrived, Payne, the\nforeman carpenter--the man who made the coffins--was voted to the chair\non the proposition of Crass, seconded by Philpot, and then a solemn\nsilence ensued, which was broken at last by the chairman, who, in a\nlengthy speech, explained the object of the meeting.Possibly with a\nlaudable desire that there should be no mistake about it, he took the\ntrouble to explain several times, going over the same ground and\nrepeating the same words over and over again, whilst the audience\nwaited in a deathlike and miserable silence for him to leave off.Payne, however, did not appear to have any intention of leaving off,\nfor he continued, like a man in a trance, to repeat what he had said\nbefore, seeming to be under the impression that he had to make a\nseparate explanation to each individual member of the audience.At\nlast the crowd could stand it no longer, and began to shout \'Hear,\nhear\' and to bang bits of wood and hammers on the floor and the\nbenches; and then, after a final repetition of the statement, that the\nobject of the meeting was to consider the advisability of holding an\nouting, or beanfeast, the chairman collapsed on to a carpenter\'s stool\nand wiped the sweat from his forehead.Crass then reminded the meeting that the last year\'s Beano had been an\nunqualified success, and for his part he would be very sorry if they\ndid not have one this year.Last year they had four brakes, and they\nwent to Tubberton Village.It was true that there was nothing much to see at Tubberton, but there\nwas one thing they could rely on getting there that they could not be\nsure of getting for the same money anywhere else, and that was--a good\nfeed.Just for the sake of getting on with the business,\nhe would propose that they decide to go to Tubberton, and that a\ncommittee be appointed to make arrangements--about the dinner--with the\nlandlord of the Queen Elizabeth\'s Head at that place.Philpot seconded the motion, and Payne was about to call for a show of\nhands when Harlow rose to a point of order.It appeared to him that\nthey were getting on a bit too fast.The proper way to do this\nbusiness was first to take the feeling of the meeting as to whether\nthey wished to have a Beano at all, and then, if the meeting was in\nfavour of it, they could decide where they were to go, and whether they\nwould have a whole day or only half a day.The Semi-drunk said that he didn\'t care a dreadful expression where\nthey went: he was willing to abide by the decision of the majority.It was a matter of indifference to him whether they had a\nday, or half a day, or two days; he was agreeable to anything.Easton suggested that a special saloon carriage might be engaged, and\nthey could go and visit Madame Tussaud\'s Waxworks.He had never been\nto that place and had often wished to see it.But Philpot objected\nthat if they went there, Madame Tussaud\'s might be unwilling to let\nthem out again.Bundy endorsed the remarks that had fallen from Crass with reference to\nTubberton.He did not care where they went, they would never get such\na good spread for the money as they did last year at the Queen\nElizabeth.The chairman said that he remembered the last Beano very well.They\nhad half a day--left off work on Saturday at twelve instead of one--so\nthere was only one hour\'s wages lost--they went home, had a wash and\nchanged their clothes, and got up to the Cricketers, where the brakes\nwas waiting, at one.Then they had the two hours\' drive to Tubberton,\nstopping on the way for drinks at the Blue Lion, the Warrior\'s Head,\nthe Bird in Hand, the Dewdrop Inn and the World Turned Upside Down.They arrived at the Queen Elizabeth at three-thirty, and\nthe dinner was ready; and it was one of the finest blow-outs he had\never had.There was soup, vegetables, roast beef, roast\nmutton, lamb and mint sauce, plum duff, Yorkshire, and a lot more.The\nlandlord of the Elizabeth kept as good a drop of beer as anyone could\nwish to drink, and as for the teetotallers, they could have tea, coffee\nor ginger beer.Having thus made another start, Payne found it very difficult to leave\noff, and was proceeding to relate further details of the last Beano\nwhen Harlow again rose up from his heap of shavings and said he wished\nto call the chairman to order.What the hell was the\nuse of all this discussion before they had even decided to have a Beano\nat all!Was the meeting in favour of a Beano or not?Everyone was very\nuncomfortable, looking stolidly on the ground or staring straight in\nfront of them.At last Easton broke the silence by suggesting that it would not be a\nbad plan if someone was to make a motion that a Beano be held.This\nwas greeted with a general murmur of \'Hear, hear,\' followed by another\nawkward pause, and then the chairman asked Easton if he would move a\nresolution to that effect.After some hesitation, Easton agreed, and\nformally moved: \'That this meeting is in favour of a Beano.\'The Semi-drunk said that, in order to get on with the business, he\nwould second the resolution.But meantime, several arguments had\nbroken out between the advocates of different places, and several men\nbegan to relate anecdotes of previous Beanos.Nearly everyone was\nspeaking at once and it was some time before the chairman was able to\nput the resolution.Finding it impossible to make his voice heard\nabove the uproar, he began to hammer on the bench with a wooden mallet,\nand to shout requests for order, but this only served to increase the\ndin.Some of them looked at him curiously and wondered what was the\nmatter with him, but the majority were so interested in their own\narguments that they did not notice him at all.Whilst the chairman was trying to get the attention of the meeting in\norder to put the question, Bundy had become involved in an argument\nwith several of the new hands who claimed to know of an even better\nplace than the Queen Elizabeth, a pub called \'The New Found Out\', at\nMirkfield, a few miles further on than Tubberton, and another\nindividual joined in the dispute, alleging that a house called \'The\nThree Loggerheads\' at Slushton-cum-Dryditch was the finest place for a\nBeano within a hundred miles of Mugsborough.He went there last year\nwith Pushem and Driver\'s crowd, and they had roast beef, goose, jam\ntarts, mince pies, sardines, blancmange, calves\' feet jelly and one\npint for each man was included in the cost of the dinner.In the\nmiddle of the discussion, they noticed that most of the others were\nholding up their hands, so to show there was no ill feeling they held\nup theirs also and then the chairman declared it was carried\nunanimously.Bundy said he would like to ask the chairman to read out the resolution\nwhich had just been passed, as he had not caught the words.The chairman replied that there was no written resolution.The motion\nwas just to express the feeling of this meeting as to whether there was\nto be an outing or not.Bundy said he was only asking a civil question, a point of information:\nall he wanted to know was, what was the terms of the resolution?Was\nthey in favour of the Beano or not?The chairman responded that the meeting was unanimously in favour.Harlow said that the next thing to be done was to decide upon the date.That would give them\nplenty of time to pay in.Sawkins asked whether it was proposed to have a day or only half a day.He himself was in favour of the whole day.It would only mean losing a\nmorning\'s work.It was hardly worth going at all if they only had half\nthe day.The Semi-drunk remarked that he had just thought of a very good place\nto go if they decided to have a change.Three years ago he was working\nfor Dauber and Botchit and they went to \'The First In and the Last Out\'\nat Bashford.It was a very small place, but there was a field where\nyou could have a game of cricket or football, and the dinner was A1 at\nLloyds.There was also a skittle alley attached to the pub and no\ncharge was made for the use of it.There was a bit of a river there,\nand one of the chaps got so drunk that he went orf his onion and jumped\ninto the water, and when they got him out the village policeman locked\nhim up, and the next day he was took before the beak and fined two\npounds or a month\'s hard labour for trying to commit suicide.Easton pointed out that there was another way to look at it: supposing\nthey decided to have the Beano, he supposed it would come to about six\nshillings a head.If they had it at the end of August and started\npaying in now, say a tanner a week, they would have plenty of time to\nmake up the amount, but supposing the work fell off and some of them\ngot the push?Crass said that in that case a man could either have his money back or\nhe could leave it, and continue his payments even if he were working\nfor some other firm; the fact that he was off from Rushton\'s would not\nprevent him from going to the Beano.Harlow proposed that they decide to go to the Queen Elizabeth the same\nas last year, and that they have half a day.Philpot said that, in order to get on with the business, he would\nsecond the resolution.Bundy suggested--as an amendment--that it should be a whole day,\nstarting from the Cricketers at nine in the morning, and Sawkins said\nthat, in order to get on with the business, he would second the\namendment.One of the new hands said he wished to move another amendment.He\nproposed to strike out the Queen Elizabeth and substitute the Three\nLoggerheads.The Chairman--after a pause--inquired if there were any seconder to\nthis, and the Semi-drunk said that, although he did not care much where\nthey went, still, to get on with the business, he would second the\namendment, although for his own part he would prefer to go to the\n\'First In and Last Out\' at Bashford.The new hand offered to withdraw his suggestion re the Three\nLoggerheads in favour of the Semi-drunks proposition, but the latter\nsaid it didn\'t matter; it could go as it was.As it was getting rather late, several men went home, and cries of \'Put\nthe question\' began to be heard on all sides; the chairman accordingly\nwas proceeding to put Harlow\'s proposition when the new hand\ninterrupted him by pointing out that it was his duty as chairman to put\nthe amendments first.This produced another long discussion, in the\ncourse of which a very tall, thin man who had a harsh, metallic voice\ngave a long rambling lecture about the rules of order and the conduct\nof public meetings.He spoke very slowly and deliberately, using very\nlong words and dealing with the subject in an exhaustive manner.A\nresolution was a resolution, and an amendment was an amendment; then\nthere was what was called an amendment to an amendment; the procedure\nof the House of Commons differed very materially from that of the House\nof Lords--and so on.This man kept on talking for about ten minutes, and might have\ncontinued for ten hours if he had not been rudely interrupted by\nHarlow, who said that it seemed to him that they were likely to stay\nthere all night if they went on like they were going.He wanted his\ntea, and he would also like to get a few hours\' sleep before having to\nresume work in the morning.He was getting about sick of all this\ntalk.In order to get on with the business, he would\nwithdraw his resolution if the others would withdraw their amendments.If they would agree to do this, he would then propose another\nresolution which--if carried--would meet all the requirements of the\ncase.The man with the metallic voice observed that it was not necessary to\nask the consent of those who had moved amendments: if the original\nproposition was withdrawed, all the amendments fell to the ground.\'Last year,\' observed Crass, \'when we was goin\' out of the room after\nwe\'d finished our dinner at the Queen Elizabeth, the landlord pointed\nto the table and said, "There\'s enough left over for you all to \'ave\nanother lot."\'Harlow said that he would move that it be held on the last Saturday in\nAugust; that it be for half a day, starting at one o\'clock so that they\ncould work up till twelve, which would mean that they would only have\nto lose one hour\'s pay: that they go to the same place as last\nyear--the Queen Elizabeth.That the same committee that\nacted last year--Crass and Bundy--be appointed to make all the\narrangements and collect the subscriptions.The tall man observed that this was what was called a compound\nresolution, and was proceeding to explain further when the chairman\nexclaimed that it did not matter a dam\' what it was called--would\nanyone second it?The Semi-drunk said that he would--in order to get\non with the business.Bundy moved, and Sawkins seconded, as an amendment, that it should be a\nwhole day.The new hand moved to substitute the Loggerheads for the Queen\nElizabeth.Easton proposed to substitute Madame Tussaud\'s Waxworks for the Queen\nElizabeth.He said he moved this just to test the feeling of the\nmeeting.Harlow pointed out that it would cost at least a pound a head to defray\nthe expenses of such a trip.The railway fares, tram fares in London,\nmeals--for it would be necessary to have a whole day--and other\nincidental expenses; to say nothing of the loss of wages.It would not\nbe possible for any of them to save the necessary amount during the\nnext four months.Philpot repeated his warning as to the danger of visiting Madame\nTussaud\'s.He was certain that if she once got them in there she would\nnever let them out again.He had no desire to pass the rest of his\nlife as an image in a museum.One of the new hands--a man with a red tie--said that they would look\nwell, after having been soaked for a month or two in petrifying liquid,\nchained up in the Chamber of Horrors with labels round their\nnecks--\'Specimens of Liberal and Conservative upholders of the\nCapitalist System, 20 century\'.Crass protested against the introduction of politics into that meeting.The remarks of the last speakers were most uncalled-for.Easton said that he would withdraw his amendment.Acting under the directions of the man with the metallic voice, the\nchairman now proceeded to put the amendment to the vote.Bundy\'s\nproposal that it should be a whole day was defeated, only himself,\nSawkins and the Semi-drunk being in favour.The motion to substitute\nthe Loggerheads for the Queen Elizabeth was also defeated, and the\ncompound resolution proposed by Harlow was then carried nem.Philpot now proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the chairman for the\nvery able manner in which he had conducted the meeting.When this had\nbeen unanimously agreed to, the Semi-drunk moved a similar tribute of\ngratitude to Crass for his services to the cause and the meeting\ndispersed.Chapter 42\n\nJune\n\n\nDuring the early part of May the weather was exceptionally bad, with\nbitterly cold winds.Rain fell nearly every day,

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['don\'t you know me, _Senor Padre_?"he cried,\nslapping Jose roundly upon the back.The light of recognition slowly came into the priest\'s eyes.The man\nwas Don Jorge, his erstwhile traveling companion on the Magdalena\nriver."And now a cup of that coffee, if you will do me the favor, my good\n_Cura_.And then tell me what ails you here," he added, seating\nhimself."_Caramba_, what a town!Diego was right--the devil himself\nmade this place!But they say you have all taken to dying!_Caramba_, I do not wonder!Such a God-forsaken\nspot!_Caramba!_ so they told me down below, and I would not\nbelieve them!"One of our men brought it from Bodega Central."There isn\'t a trace of\ncholera in the place, as far as I know!You have all gone crazy--but\nsmall wonder!"His ears\nwere reporting things basely false."You say--" he began in\nbewilderment."I say what I have said, _amigo_!There is no more cholera in Bodega\nCentral than there is in heaven!I arrived there day before yesterday,\nand left before sunrise this morning.Jose sank weakly down at the man\'s side."But--Don Jorge--Feliz Gomez\nreturned from there three nights ago, and reported that a Turk, who\nhad come up from the coast, had died of the plague!"Don Jorge\'s brows knit in perplexity."I recall now," he said slowly,\nafter some moments of study."The innkeeper did say that a Turk had\ndied there--some sort of intestinal trouble, I believe.When I told\nhim I was bound for Simiti, he laughed as if he would split, and then\nbegan to talk about the great fright he had given a man from here.Said he scared the fellow until his black face turned white.But I was\noccupied with my own affairs, and paid him little attention.But come,\ntell me all about it."With the truth slowly dawning upon his clouded thought, Jose related\nthe grewsome experiences of the past three days.But, was Feliz Gomez sick before he went to Bodega Central?""Yes, senor," interposed Rosendo."He and Amado Sanchez both had bowel\ntrouble.Their women told my wife so, after you and I, Padre, had come\nup here to the hill.We have it here often, as you\nknow.""True," assented Jose, "but we have never given it any serious\nthought."Don Jorge leaned back and broke into a roar of laughter."_Por el amor\ndel cielo!_ You are all crazy, _amigo_--you die like rats of fear!Did\nyou ever put a mouse into a bottle and then scare it to death with a\nloud noise?_Hombre!_ That is what has happened to you!"The hill\nreverberated with his loud shouts.But Jose could not share in the merriment.The awful consequences of\nthe innkeeper\'s coarse joke upon the childish minds of these poor,\nimpressionable people pressed heavily upon his heart.Bitter tears\nwelled to his eyes."We must go down and tell these people the\ntruth!"Don Jorge joined them, and they all hastened down into the town.Ramona Chaves met them in the _plaza_, her eyes streaming."Padre," she wailed, "my man Pedro has the sickness!loudly cried Jose; "there is no cholera\nhere!"He hastened to the bedside of the writhing Pedro.There\nis no cholera in Simiti!He and Amado had only a touch of the flux, and they died\nof fear!"The priest\'s ringing words acted upon the man like magic.He roused up\nfrom his lethargy and stared at the assemblage.Don Jorge repeated the\npriest\'s words, and added his own laughing and boisterous comments.Pedro rose from his bed, and stood staring.Together, their little band augmented at every corner by the startled\npeople, they hurried to the homes of all who lay upon beds of\nsickness, spreading the glad tidings, until the little town was in a\nstate of uproar.Like black shadows before the light, the plague fled\ninto the realm of imagination from which it had come.By night, all\nbut Mateo Gil were up and about their usual affairs.But even Mateo\nhad revived wonderfully; and Jose was confident that the good news\nwould be the leaven of health that would work a complete restoration\nwithin him in time.The exiles left the hilltop and the old church,\nand returned again to their homes.Don Jorge took up his abode with\nJose."_Bien_," he said, as they sat at the rear door of the priest\'s house,\nlooking through the late afternoon haze out over the lake, "you have\nhad a strange experience--_Caramba_!most strange!--and yet one from\nwhich you should gather an excellent lesson.You are dealing with\nchildren here--children who have always been rocked in the cradle of\nthe Church.But--" looking archly at Jose, "do I offend?For, as I\ntold you on the boat a year ago, I do not think you are a good\npriest.""_Bien_," he added, "I will correct that.You are good--but not a priest, is it not so?""I have some views, Don Jorge, which differ radically from those of\nthe faith," Jose said cautiously."_Caramba!_ I should hope so!""But," interposed Jose, anxious to direct the conversation into other\nchannels, "may I ask how and where you have occupied yourself since I\nleft the boat at Badillo?"said Don Jorge, shaking his head, although his eyes\ntwinkled."I have wandered ever since--and am poorer now than when I\nstarted.I left our boat at Puerto Nacional, to go to Medellin; and\nfrom there to Remedios and Guamoco.But while in the river town I met\nanother _guaquero_--grave hunter, you know--who was preparing to go to\nHonda, to investigate the \'castles\' at that place.There is a strange\nlegend--you may have heard it--hanging over those rocks.It appears\nthat a lone hermit lived in one of the many caverns in the great\nlimestone deposits rising abruptly from the river near the town of\nHonda.Day after day, year after year,\nhe labored in his cave, extending it further into the hillside.People\nlaughed at him for tunneling in that barren rock, for gold has never\nbeen found anywhere in it.But the fellow paid them no attention; and\ngradually he was accepted as a harmless fanatic, and was left\nunmolested to dig his way into the hill as far as he would.No one knew how the fellow lived, for he held no human\nintercourse.Kind people often brought food and left it at the mouth\nof his cavern, but he would have none of it.They brought clothes, but\nthey rotted where they were left.At last some good soul planted a fig tree near the cave, hoping that\nthe fruit in time would prove acceptable to him.One day they found\nthe tree cut down._Bien_, time passed, and he was forgotten.One day\nsome men, passing the cave, found his body, pale and thin, with long,\nwhite hair, lying at the entrance.when they buried\nthe body they found it was that of a woman!"He paused to draw some leaves of tobacco from his wallet and roll a\nthick cigar.The sudden turn of his story drew an expression of\namazement from the priest."_Bien_," he resumed, "where the woman came from, and who she was,\nnever was learned.But of course some one must have\nsupplied her with food and clothes all these years.Perhaps she was\nsome grand dame, with a dramatic past, who had come there to escape\nthe world and do penance for her sins.What sorrow, what black tragedy\nthat cave concealed, no one may ever know!Nor am I at all interested\nin that.The point is, either she found gold there, or had a quantity\nof it that she brought with her--at least so I thought at the time.So, when the _guaquero_ at Puerto Nacional told me the story, nothing\nwould do but I must go with him to search the cave._Caramba!_ We\nwasted three full months prying around there--and had our labor for\nour pains!"He tilted his chair back and puffed savagely at his cigar."Well, then I got on the windy side of another legend, a wild tale of\nburied treasure in the vicinity of Mompox.Spent six months pawing the hot dirt around that old town.Fell in\nwith your estimable citizen, Don Felipe, who swindled me out of a\nhundred good _pesos oro_ on a fraudulent location and a forged map.Then I cursed him and the place and went up to Banco."Don Jorge went on:\n\n"Your genial friend Diego is back there.Told me about his trip to\nSimiti to see his little daughter.""What did he say about her, _amigo_?""Not much--only that he expected to send for her soon.You know,\nRosendo\'s daughter is living with him."But, Don Jorge," pursued Jose anxiously, "what think you, is the\nlittle Carmen Diego\'s child?""_Hombre!_ How should I know?"She does not look like him," asserted Jose, clinging to his note of\noptimism._Caramba_, but he looks like an imp\nfrom sheol!"Jose saw that little consolation was to be derived from Don Jorge as\nfar as Carmen was concerned."_Bien_," continued Don Jorge, whose present volubility was in\nstriking contrast to his reticence on the boat the year before, "I had\noccasion to come up to Bodega Central--another legend, if I must\nconfess it.And there Don Carlos Norosi directed me here.""Yes, no doubt it appears so to you, _Senor Padre_," replied Don\nJorge."And yet my business, that of treasure hunting, has in times\npast proved very lucrative.The Indian graves of Colombia have yielded\nenormous quantities of gold.The Spaniards opened many of them; and in\none, that of a famous chieftain, discovered down below us, near\nZaragoza, they found a solid gold pineapple, a marvelous piece of\nworkmanship, and of immense value.it never would have reached him if I had been there!"But," he resumed, "we have no idea of the amount of treasure that has\nbeen buried in various parts of Colombia.This country has been, and\nstill is, enormously rich in minerals--a veritable gold mine of\nitself.Daniel went to the bedroom.And since the time of the Spanish conquest it has been in a\nstate of almost constant turmoil.And, up to very recent times, whenever the people collected a bit of\ngold above their daily needs, they promptly banked it with good Mother\nEarth.Then, like as not, they got themselves killed in the wars, and\nthe treasure was left for some curious and greedy hunter like myself\nto dig up years after.The Royalists and Tories buried huge sums all\nover the country during the War of Independence.Why, it was only a\nyear or so ago that two men came over from Spain and went up the\nMagdalena river to Bucaramanga.They were close-mouthed fellows,\nwell-dressed, and evidently well-to-do.But they had nothing to say to\nanybody.The innkeeper pried around until he discovered that they\nspent much time in their room poring over maps and papers.Then they\nset off alone, with an outfit of mules and supplies to last several\nweeks._Bueno_, they came back at last with a box of good size, made\nof mahogany, and bound around with iron bands._Caramba!_ They did not\ntarry long, you may be sure.And I learned afterward that they sailed\naway safely from Cartagena, box and all, for sunny Spain, where, I\ndoubt not, they are now living in idleness and gentlemanly ease on\nwhat they found in the big coffer they dug up near that old Spanish\ncity."To him, cooped up for a year and more in the\nnarrow confines of Simiti, the ready flow of this man\'s conversation\nwas like a fountain of sparkling water to a thirsty traveler.He urged\nhim to go on, plying him with questions about his strange avocation."_Caramba_, but the old Indian chiefs were wise fellows!""They seemed to know that greedy vandals like myself would\nsome day poke around in their last resting places for the gold that\nwas always buried with them--possibly to pay their freight across the\ndark river.And so they dug their graves in the form of an L, in the\nextreme tip of which the royal carcasses were laid.In this way they\nhave deceived many a grave-hunter, who dug straight down without\nfinding the body, which was safely tucked away in the toe of the L. I\nhave gone back and reopened many a grave that I had abandoned as\nempty, and found His Royal Highness five or six feet to one side of\nthe straight shaft I had previously sunk.""I suppose," mused Jose, "that you now follow this work because of its\nfascination--for you must have found and laid aside much treasure in\nthe years that you have pursued it.""_ ejaculated the _guaquero_."I have been rich and poor,\nlike the rising and setting of the sun!What I find, I spend again\nhunting more.The man who has enough money\nnever knows it.And his greed for more--more that he needs not, and\ncannot possibly spend on himself--generally results, as in my case, in\nthe loss of what he already has.But there are reasons aside from the\nexcitement of the chase that keep me at it."He fell strangely silent, and Jose knew that there were aroused within\nhim memories that seared the tissues of the brain as they entered."_Amigo_," Don Jorge resumed."There are some things which I am trying to forget.This exciting and\ndangerous business of mine keeps my thought occupied.I care nothing\nnow for the treasure I may discover."Surely, good friend," replied Jose quickly; "and I ask pardon for\nrecalling those things to you.""_ said Don Jorge, with a gesture of deprecation.Then: "I told you on the boat that I had lost a wife and girl.I tell you this because I know you, too, have\ngrievances against her._Caramba!_ Yet I will tell you only a part.I\nlived in Maganguey, where my wife\'s brother kept a store and did an\nexcellent commission business.I was mining and hunting graves in the\nCauca region, sometimes going up the Magdalena, too, and working on\nboth sides of the river.Maganguey was a convenient place for me to\nlive, as it stands at the junction of the two great rivers.Besides,\nmy wife wished to remain near her own people._Bien_, we had a\ndaughter.And then, one day, the priest\ntold my wife that the girl was destined to a great future, and must\nenter a convent and consecrate herself to the Church._Caramba!_ I am\nnot a Catholic--was never one!My parents were patriots, and both took\npart in the great war that gave liberty to this country.But they were\nliberal in thought; and I was never confirmed to the Church._Bien_,\nthe priest made my life a hell--my wife became estranged from me--and\none day, returning from the Cauca, I found my house deserted.Wife and\ngirl and the child\'s nurse had gone down the river!"The man\'s face darkened, and hard lines drew around his mouth."They had taken my money chest, some thousands of pesos.He laughed at me, and--_Caramba_!I struck him such a blow\nbetween his pig eyes that he lay senseless for hours!"Jose glanced at the broad shoulders and the great knots of muscle on\nthe man\'s arms.He was of medium height, but with a frame of iron."_Bien, Senor Padre_, I, too, fled wild and raving from Maganguey that\nnight, and plunged into the jungle.Months later I drifted down the\nriver, as far as Mompox.And there one day I chanced upon old\nMarcelena, the child\'s nurse.Like a _cayman_ I seized her and dragged\nher into an alley.She confessed that my wife and girl were living\nthere--the wife had become housekeeper for a young priest--the girl\nwas in the convent._Caramba!_ I hurled the woman to the ground and\nturned my back upon the city!"Jose\'s interest in the all too common recital received a sudden\nstimulus."Your daughter\'s name, Don Jorge, was--"\n\n"Maria, _Senor Padre_.""And--she would now be, how old, perhaps?""Fair--complexion light, like her mother\'s.Maria was a beautiful\nchild--and good as she was beautiful.""But--the child\'s nurse remained with her?"The woman was\nold and ugly--but she loved the child.""Did you not inquire for them when you were in Mompox a few months\nago?""I made slight inquiry through the clerk in the office of the\nAlcalde.I did not intend to--but I could not help it._Caramba!_ He\nmade further inquiry, but said only that he was told they had long\nsince gone down to Cartagena, and nothing had been heard from them."The gates of memory\'s great reservoir opened at the touch of this\nman\'s story, and Jose again lived through that moonlit night in\nCartagena, when the little victim of Wenceslas breathed out her life\nof sorrow and shame in his arms.He heard again the sobs of Marcelena\nand the simple-minded Catalina.He saw again the figure of the\ncompassionate Christ in the smoke that drifted past the window.And\nnow the father of that wronged girl sat before him, wrapped in the\ntatters of a shredded happiness!Should he say\nthat he had cared for this man\'s little grandson since his advent into\nthis sense of existence that mortals call life?For there could be no\ndoubt now that the little Maria was his daughter."Don Jorge," he said, "you have suffered much.And yet--"\n\n"_Na_, Padre, there is nothing to do.Were I to find my family I could\nonly slay them and the priests who came between us!""But, Don Jorge," cried Jose in horror, "you surely meditate no such\nvengeance as that!""_Senor Padre_," he returned coldly, "I am\nSpanish.The blood of the old cavaliers flows in my veins.I have been\nbetrayed, trapped, fooled, and my honored name has been foully soiled._Caramba!_\nThe priest of Maganguey who poured the first drop of poison into my\nwife\'s too willing ears--_Bien_, I have said enough!""_Hombre!_ You don\'t mean--"\n\n"I mean, _Senor Padre_, that I drifted down the river, unseen, to\nMaganguey one night."_Na_, Padre, not God, but Satan!Don Jorge leaned forward and laid a hand\nupon his knee."My friend," he said evenly, "you are young--how old,\nmay I ask?"_Bien_, you have much to learn.I took to you on\nthe boat because I knew you had made a mess of things, and it was not\nentirely your fault.You are no more in\nthe Church than I am."I--I have--work here, senor," he replied."True," said Don Jorge, "a chance to do much for these poor people--if\nthe odds are not too strong against you.But--are you working for them\nalone?Or--does Diego\'s child figure in the case?No offense, I assure\nyou--I have reason to ask."The man looked squarely into his own,\nand the priest found no deception in their black depths."I--senor, she cannot be Diego\'s child--and I--I would save her!""_Bien_," he said, "to-morrow I leave for\nSan Lucas.After the evening meal the _guaquero_ spread his _petate_ upon the\nfloor and disposed himself for the night.He stubbornly refused to\naccept the priest\'s bed."_ he muttered, after he had lain\nquiet for some time, "why does not the Church permit its clergy to\nmarry, like civilized beings!Do you know, _Senor Padre_, I once met a\nwoman in Bogota and held some discussion with her on this topic.She\nsaid, as between a priest who had children, and a married minister,\nshe would infinitely prefer the priest, because, as she put it, no\nmatter how dissolute the priest, the sacraments from his hands would\nstill retain their validity--but never from those of a married\nminister!_Caramba!_ what can you do against such bigotry and awful\nnarrowness, such dense ignorance!The following morning, before sunrise, Don Jorge and his boatmen were\non the lake, leaving Jose to meditate on the vivid experiences of the\npast few days, their strange mental origin, and the lesson which they\nbrought.CHAPTER 22\n\n\n"Padre dear," said Carmen, "you know the question that we put under\nthe altar of the old church?Well, God answered it, didn\'t He?""I--why, I had forgotten it, child.You asked Him to tell\nus why the people thought they had to die, did you not?"Why, He told us that they were frightened to death, you know."They paid the\npenalty of death for believing that Feliz Gomez had slept on a bed\nwhere a man had died of the plague.They died because they--"\n\n"Because they didn\'t know that God was everywhere, Padre dear,"\ninterrupted Carmen.And yet," he\nadded sadly, "how are we going to make them know that He is\neverywhere?""Why, Padre dear, by showing them in our talk and our actions that we\nknow it--by proving it, you know, just as we prove our problems in\nalgebra.""Yes, poor Feliz, and Amado, and Guillermo died because they sinned,"\nhe mused."They broke the first Commandment by believing that there\nwas another power than God.And that sin brought its inevitable wage,\ndeath.They\'missed the mark,\' and sank into the oblivion of their\nfalse beliefs.that I could keep my own mentality free from\nthese same carnal beliefs, and so be a true missionary to suffering\nhumanity!But you, Carmen, you are going to be such a missionary.And\nI believe," he muttered through his set teeth, "that I am appointed to\nshield the girl until God is ready to send her forth!But what, oh,\nwhat will she do when she meets that world which lies beyond her\nlittle Simiti?""The deposit will not last much\nlonger," he said to Jose, shaking his head dubiously."And then--"\n\n"Why, then we will find another, Rosendo," replied the priest\noptimistically."_ exclaimed the old man, starting for the trail.The day after Don Jorge\'s departure the Alcalde returned.He stole\nshamefacedly through the streets and barricaded himself in his house.He cruelly abused his\nlong-suffering spouse, and ended by striking her across the face.After which he sat down and laboriously penned a long letter to Padre\nDiego, in which the names of Jose and Carmen figured plentifully.For Don Jorge had met the Alcalde in Juncal, and had roundly jeered\nhim for his cowardly flight.He cited Jose and Rosendo as examples of\nvalor, and pointed out that the Alcalde greatly resembled a captain\nwho fled at the smell of gunpowder.Don Mario swelled with indignation\nand shame.His spleen worked particularly against Rosendo and the\npriest.Come what might, it was time Diego and his superiors in\nCartagena knew what was going on in the parish of Simiti!A few days later an unctuous letter came to Jose from Diego,\nrequesting that Carmen be sent to him at once, as he now desired to\nplace her in a convent and thus supplement the religious education\nwhich he was sure Jose had so well begun in her.The priest had\nscarcely read the letter when Don Mario appeared at the parish house."_Bien, Padre_," he began smoothly, but without concealing the malice\nwhich lurked beneath his oily words, "Padre Diego sends for the little\nCarmen, and bids me arrange to have her conveyed at once to Banco.I\nthink Juan will take her down, is it not so?""No, senor," he said in a voice\nthat trembled with agitation, "it is not so!""_ exclaimed Don Mario, swelling with suppressed rage."You\nrefuse to give Diego his own child?""No, _senor_, but I refuse to give him a child that is not his.""_Caramba!_ but she is--he has the proofs!And I shall send her to him\nthis day!"The Alcalde shrilled forth his rage like a ruffled parrot.Jose seized\nhim by the shoulders and, turning him swiftly about, pushed him out\ninto the road.He then entered the rear door of Rosendo\'s house and\nbade Dona Maria keep the child close to her.A few minutes later Fernando Perez appeared at Jose\'s door.He was\nmunicipal clerk, secretary, and constable of Simiti, all in one.He\nsaluted the priest gravely, and demanded the body of the child Carmen,\nto be returned to her proper father.What could he do against the established\nauthority?"_Bien, Padre_," said Fernando, after delivering his message, "the\nhour is too late to send her down the river to-day.But deliver her to\nme, and she shall go down at daybreak.""Listen," Jose pleaded desperately, "Fernando, leave her here\nto-night--this is sudden, you must acknowledge--she must have time to\ntake leave of Dona Maria--and--"\n\n"_Senor Padre_, the Alcalde\'s order is that she go with me now.Scarce knowing what he did, he\nquickly stepped back through the rear door, and going to Rosendo\'s\nhouse, seized a large _machete_, with which he returned to face the\nconstable."Look you, Fernando," he cried, holding the weapon menacingly aloft,\n"if you lay a hand on that girl, I will scatter your brains through\nyonder _plaza_!""_ muttered the constable, falling back."_Bien_," he\nhastily added, "I will make this report to the Alcalde!"But he hastily arose and went into Rosendo\'s\nhouse.he cried excitedly, "leave Carmen with me, and do\nyou hurry through the town and see if Juan is here, and if Lazaro\nOrtiz has returned from the _hacienda_.Bid them come to me at once,\nand bring their _machetes_!"Jose seized his _machete_ firmly in\none hand, and with the other drew Carmen to him.the child asked, her eyes big with wonder.I wish you wouldn\'t always go around thinking\nthat two and two are seven!""Carmen, child--you do not understand--you are too young, and as yet\nyou have had no experience with--with the world!"I do _not_ trust you, Padre," she said sadly."I can\'t trust anybody\nwho always sees things that are not so.""Carmen--you are in danger--and you do not comprehend--" cried the\ndesperate man."I am _not_ in danger--and I _do_ understand--a great deal better than\nyou do, Padre.People who are afraid\ndie of the plague!"The irony of her words sank into his soul."No, senor," the lad replied."She is searching for you--have you your _machete_?""Yes, Padre, I have just come back from the island, where I was\ncutting wood."He went to the door and looked eagerly down the street.he\nexclaimed with relief, "here come Dona Maria and Lazaro!Now,\nfriends," he began, when they were assembled before him, "grave danger\nthreatens--"\n\n"Padre!"he cried, "go at once to the Boque trail!Let no one pass\nthat way with Carmen, if your life be the penalty!If either of you see her, call loudly, and I will come!Dona\nMaria, start through the town!*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe afternoon dragged its interminable length across the valley.Jose\nwearily entered his house and threw himself upon a chair.He had not\ndared call at the Alcalde\'s house, for fear he might do that official\nviolence.But he had seen Fernando in the street, and had avoided him.Then, of a sudden, a thought came to him from out the darkness.He\nsprang to his feet and hurried off toward the shales.There, beneath\nthe stunted _algarroba_ tree, sat the child.He rushed to her and clasped her in his arms."Padre," she replied, when she could get her breath, "I had to come\nout here and try to know for you the things you ought to know for\nyourself."He said nothing; but, holding her hand tightly, he led her back to the\nhouse.That evening Jose sent for Don Mario, the constable, and Juan and\nLazaro.Assembling them before him in his living room, he talked with\nthem long and earnestly."_Compadres_," he said, "this week we have passed through a sad\nexperience, and the dark angel has robbed us of three of our beloved\nfriends.Is it your wish that death again visit us?"The Alcalde scowled darkly at\nthe priest beneath his heavy brows.Jose continued:\n\n"_Bien_, it is planned to seize the little Carmen by force, and send\nher down the river to Padre Diego--"\n\n_"Dios y diablo!The Alcalde shrank back in his chair."Padre Diego sends for her by\nletter--is it not so, Don Mario?"Juan wheeled about and stared menacingly at the\nbulky official."Now, friends," Jose pursued, "it has not been shown that Carmen\nbelongs to Diego--in fact, all things point to the conclusion that she\nis not his child.My wish is to be just to all concerned.But shall we\nlet the child go to him, knowing what manner of man he is, until it is\nproven beyond all doubt that he is her father?""And I am of the opinion that the majority of our citizens would\nsupport us in the contention."Every man in Simiti, Padre," replied Lazaro earnestly."Don Mario," said Jose, turning to the Alcalde, "until it is\nestablished that Diego has a parent\'s claim to the girl, Juan and\nLazaro and I will protect her with our lives.Is it not so, _amigos_?""_Hombre!_ Let me see a hand laid upon her!"I\nknow you to be q good man--not like Padre Diego.I know not what claim\nhe may have on the girl, but this I say: I will follow and support you\nuntil it is shown me that you are in the wrong."Then, to the town officials:\n\n"_Bien, amigos_, we will let the matter rest thus, shall we not?If harm comes to the child, the death\nangel will again stalk through this town, and--" he looked hard at Don\nMario, whilst that official visibly shrank in size--"_Bien_," he\nconcluded, "a sharp watch will be kept over the child.We will submit\nto proofs--but to nothing less.cried Don Mario, at last finding his voice."If\nDiego has the Bishop back of him, he will force us to deliver the\ngirl--or the Bishop will have the government soldiers sent here!I can\nask for them--and if necessary I will!"Don Mario,\nseeing that his words had taken effect, quickly followed up the\nadvantage."Now you, Juan and Lazaro, do you think the little whelp\nworth that?"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Juan leaped across the\nfloor and fell upon him.Jose seized the lad and, with Fernando\'s\nhelp, tore him loose.Lazaro held his _machete_ aloft, ready to\nstrike.Jose\'s voice rang out sharply:\n\n"Hold, men!Juan, do you stay here\nwith me!"The lad faced the Alcalde and shook his fist."_Bien_," he sputtered,\n"send for the soldiers, fat dog that you are!But when I see them\ncrossing the lake, I will come first to your house and cut open that\nbig belly!"shrilled the Alcalde, shaking with rage."I will cut off the hand that is laid on Juan!"And for\nGod\'s sake think twice before you make any further move!"Don Mario and his constable departed in sullen silence.Jose let\nLazaro out through the rear door, while he bade Juan pass the night in\nthe parish house.A consultation was held with Dona Maria, and it was\narranged that Carmen should sleep in the room with Jose, with Juan\nlying before the door, until Rosendo should return from the mountains.Then Jose sat down and wrote to the Bishop.*       *       *       *       *\n\nNo reply came from Cartagena until Rosendo returned at the end of the\nmonth.Meanwhile, Jose had never for a moment permitted Carmen to\nleave his side.The child chafed under the limitation; but Jose and\nDona Maria were firm.Juan lived with the priest; and Lazaro lurked\nabout the parish house like a shadow.The Alcalde and his constable\nremained discreetly aloof.But with Rosendo\'s return came letters from both Wenceslas and Diego.The latter had laid aside his unction, and now made a curt and\nperemptory demand upon Jose for the child.The letter from Wenceslas\nwas noncommittal, stating only that he was quite uninformed of Diego\'s\nclaim, but that an investigation should be made.Jose wondered if he\nhad blundered in laying the case before him."_ ejaculated Rosendo, when he heard Jose\'s story.And now the Bishop has the matter in hand!_Caramba!_ We\nshall lose her yet!"And, Padre," he added, "the deposit is played out.And, now that we shall have none to send to the Bishop\neach month, Carmen\'s fate is settled--unless we go away.He hung his head\nand sat in gloomy dejection.For more than a year Rosendo had panned the isolated alluvial deposit,\nand on his regular monthly returns to Simiti he and the priest had\nsent from thirty to ninety _pesos_ gold to Wenceslas.To this Jose\nsometimes added small amounts collected from the people of Simiti,\nwhich they had gratuitously given him for Masses and for the support\nof the parish.Wenceslas, knowing the feeble strength of the parish,\nwas surprised, but discreet; and though he continually urged Jose to\ngreater efforts, and held out the allurements of "indulgences and\nspecial dispensations," he made no inquiries regarding the source of\nthe monthly contributions.For many days following, Rosendo and the priest went about as in a\nthick, black cloud."Rosendo," said Jose at length, "go back to the\nmountains and search again.Have we any reason\nto doubt Him now?""And leave Carmen here, exposed to the danger that always hangs over\nher?I would not go back now even if the deposit were\nnot worked out!Jose knew it would be futile to urge him.Carmen came to the priest that same day."Padre, I heard you and padre\nRosendo talking this morning."Why, child--there seems to be a need just at present," he replied\nlightly."But we might--well, we might send another of your questions\nto God.she cried delightedly, turning at once and hurrying away\nfor pencil and paper."Now," she panted, seating herself at the table."Let us see; we want\nHim to give us _pesos_, don\'t we?""Well, you know, Padre dear," she replied seriously, "we can\'t ask for\ntoo much--for we already have everything, haven\'t we?After all, we\ncan only ask to see what we really already have."Say \'yes,\' Padre dear," she pleaded, looking up appealingly at him\nstaring silently at her.Oh, if she could only impart to him even a\nlittle of her abundant faith!"Well, here it is," she said, holding out the paper.He took it and read--"Dear, dear God: Padre Jose needs _pesos_--lots\nof them."And now," she continued, "shall we put it under the altar of the old\nchurch?"He smiled; but immediately assumed an expression of great seriousness."Why not in the church here, the one we are using?"But--no, we will go where we went before," she concluded firmly.Taking matches and a piece of candle, he set off\nwith the girl in a circuitous route for the hill, which they gained\nunobserved.Within the musty old church he struck a light, and they\nclimbed over the _debris_ and to the rear of the crumbling altar."Here is my other question that He\nanswered!She drew the old paper from beneath the adobe brick."Let us put this question in a new place," she said."Look,\nup there, where the bricks have fallen out," pointing to the part of\nthe altar that had crumbled away.His thought was far\noff, even in Cartagena, where sat the powers that must be held quiet\nif his cherished plans were not to fail.He reached out and grasped\none of the projecting bricks to steady himself.As he did so, the\nbrick, which was loose, gave way with him, and he fell, almost across\nCarmen, followed by a shower of rubbish, as another portion of the old\naltar fell out."_ he ejaculated, picking himself up."What good luck that\nthe candle was not extinguished!And now, senorita, are you willing\nthat we should bury this important question here on the floor; or must\nI again try to put it in the altar itself?""Up there," insisted the child, laughing and still pointing above.He rose and looked about, searching for a convenient place to deposit\nthe paper.Then something attracted his attention, something buried in\nthe altar, but now exposed by the falling out of the fresh portion.It\nwas metal, and it glittered in the feeble candle light.He reached in\nand hastily scraped away more of the hard mud.Then, trembling with\nsuppressed excitement, he pulled out another brick.Clearly, it was a\nbox that had been buried in there--who knows when?He gave the candle\nto Carmen and bade her stand up close.Then with both hands he\ncarefully removed the adjacent bricks until the entire box was in\nview."A box to put our question in,\nPadre!"muttered the excited priest,\nstraining and tugging away at it."Now--" He gave a final pull.A crash of falling bricks\nfollowed; the candle was extinguished; and both he and the child were\nprecipitated to the floor.called the priest, choking with dust, "are you hurt?""No, Padre dear," came the laughing answer through the darkness."But\nI\'m pretty full of dust.It lay near, a small, wooden coffer,\nbound about with two narrow bands of steel.He dragged it out and bore\nit down the aisle to the door, followed by Carmen.He dusted it off and examined it carefully in the fast fading light.It was some twelve inches square by three deep, well made of mahogany,\nand secured by a small, iron padlock.On the top there was a crest of\narms and the letters, "I de R," burned into the wood.Night had closed in, and the priest and girl made their way hurriedly\nback home by way of the lake, to avoid being seen.Under his cassock\nJose carried the box, so heavy that it chafed the skin from his hip as\nthey stumbled along."Carmen, say nothing--but tell your padre Rosendo to come to me at\nonce!"With the doors secured, and Carmen and Dona Maria standing guard\noutside to apprise them of danger, Jose and Rosendo covertly examined\nthe discovery.pondered Rosendo, studying the box.Then--"_Caramba!_\nPadre--_Caramba!_ It is _Ignacio de Rincon!_ _Hombre!_ And the\ncrest--it is his!I have seen it before--years and years ago!_Caramba!_ _Caramba!_" The old man danced about like a child.he kept exclaiming, his eyes\nbig as saucers.Then, hastening out to get his iron bar, he returned\nand with a blow broke the rusty padlock.Tearing open the hinged\ncover, he fell back with a loud cry.Before their strained gaze, packed carefully in sawdust, lay several\nbars of yellow metal.Rosendo took them out with trembling hands and\nlaid them upon the floor._Caramba!--_\n\n"Hold these, Padre!"hurrying out and returning with a pair of\nhomemade wooden balances.Again and again he carefully weighed the\nbars.It seemed to Jose that the old man\nwasted hours arriving at a satisfactory result."Padre," he finally announced in tones which he strove vainly to\ncontrol, "there cannot be less than six thousand _pesos oro_ here!""Six thousand _pesos_--twenty-four thousand\nfrancs!The trembling old man replaced the bars and carried them to Jose\'s\nbed.The priest opened the door and called to Carmen."What was in the old box, Padre?"she asked happily, bounding into the\nroom.Daniel travelled to the garden.He stooped and picked her up, almost crushing her in his arms."The\nanswer to your question, _chiquita_.\'Before they call I will answer:\nand while they are yet speaking, I will hear.\'"CHAPTER 23\n\n\nWhen Jose awoke the next morning he quickly put his hand under his\npillow.He\ndrew it forth and raised the cover.The yellow bars glittered in the\nmorning rays sifting through the overhanging thatch at the window.He\npassed his hand gently across them.His heart leaped within him as he hastily threw on his scant\nattire and went out into the balsamic air of the tropical morning.Rosendo had gone to the village of Boque, starting before sun-up, so\nDona Maria announced.Some sudden impulse had seized him, and he had\nset out forthwith, not stopping to discuss the motive with his\nfaithful consort.Jose concluded his _desayuno_, and then summoned\nCarmen to the parish house for the day\'s lessons.She came with a song\non her lips."Don\'t stop, _chiquita_!Sing it again--it is beautiful; and my soul\ndrinks it in like heavenly dew!"he cried, as the child danced up to\nhim and threw her plump arms about his neck.She turned about and sat down on the dusty threshold and repeated the\nlittle song.The glittering sunlight streamed through her rich curls\nlike stringers of wire gold.Cucumbra came fawning to her and nestled\nat her little bare feet, caressing them at frequent intervals with his\nrough tongue.Cantar-las-horas approached with dignified tread, and,\nstopping before his adored little mistress, cocked his head to one\nside and listened attentively, his beady eyes blinking in the dazzling\nlight.Had\neither of her parents been so gifted?And yet, it was\nonly the voicing of a soul of stainless purity--a conscience clear as\nthe light that gilded her curls--a trust, a faith, a knowledge of\nimmanent good, that manifested daily, hourly, in a tide of happiness\nwhose far verge melted into the shore of eternity.As he sat with\nclosed eyes the adobe hut, with its dirt floor and shabby furnishings,\nexpanded into a castle, hung with richest tapestries, rarest pictures,\nand glittering with plate of gold.The familiar odors of garlic and\nsaffron, which penetrated from the primitive kitchen of Dona Maria,\nwere transmuted into delicate perfumes.The sun drew nearer, and\nsuffused him with its glittering flood.The girl became a white-robed\nvision, and her song a benediction, voicing "Glory to God in the\nhighest, and on earth peace among men of good will."The song ended, and left the thought with him: "To men of good will?"Yes, to men of God\'s will--the will that is good--to men of sound\nmind--that mind which was in Christ Jesus--the mind that knows no\nevil!"_Chiquita_," the priest said gently, when the girl returned to him."Your question was quickly answered yesterday, was it not?""It was answered, Padre, before we asked\nit.God has the answers to all questions that could ever be asked.We\nwould always know the answers if we thought the way He does.""But--tell me, _chiquita_, do you think He put that little box up\nthere in the altar purposely for us?""No, Padre--I guess it was hidden there by some man, long ago, who was\nafraid he would lose it.And since he was afraid he would lose it,\nwhy--he did, for now we have it.""Yes, the thing that he greatly feared came upon him.But what is your\nidea regarding the way we happened to find it?"God leads to everything good, Padre dear," was the simple response.But, in this particular case--would we have been led to\nthe little box if you had not asked your question of God?"People are always led right when they think right.""And so thinking right was the cause of this discovery, was it?"he\npursued, relentlessly probing her thought to its depths."Why--yes, Padre--of course.We had to have money--you said so, you\nknow.Daniel went back to the hallway.And you told me to ask for lots of _pesos_.Well, we both knew\nthat God had already given us more _pesos_ than we could ever know\nwhat to do with--He always does.He just can\'t help giving Himself to\neverybody.And He gave Himself to us--why, we have always had Him!We\nare _in_ Him, you know.And when anybody just knows that--why, he sees\nnothing but good everywhere, and he always has all that he needs.""All that he wants, you mean, _chiquita_?""No, Padre, not all that he wants.You might\nwant all the gold in the world--but you wouldn\'t need it.""No, that would be only a selfish, human want.But--you still think we were led right to the little box, do you?""I know it, Padre dear," she replied emphatically."When we think\ngood, we see good.It is just as sure as\ngetting the right answers to my problems in algebra when I think right\nabout them.""And thinking right about them means using the right rule, does it\nnot?"If I didn\'t use the right rule--why, what sort of\nanswers would I get?But still," vigorously pursuing the subject,\n"you don\'t think we happened upon the little box just by good luck?""Padre," she shook her curls insistently, "things never happen,\n_never_!"Yes, there surely does seem to be a definite law of cause and effect.But you did not think gold yesterday, _chiquita_.""Oh, Padre dear, what a bother you are!No, I didn\'t think gold\nyesterday.And that is\ngold and everything else that we need.And it wasn\'t\njust because I thought good yesterday, but because I think good every\nday, that I saw the gold.It was because we needed it, and God had\nalready given us all that we needed.And I knew that it just _had_ to\ncome.Then, because we really needed it, and knew that\nit was right and that it must come--well, it did.Her\nlittle face was very serious as she looked up appealingly into his."Yes, _chiquita_, yes, I see.I just wanted to know how you would\nexplain it.It becomes clearer to me every day that there are no such\nthings as miracles--never were!Christ Jesus _never_ performed\nmiracles, if by that we mean that he set aside God\'s laws for the\nbenefit of mankind.But he acted in perfect accord with those\nlaws--and no wonder the results seemed miraculous to dull-witted human\nminds, who had always seen only their coarse, material thought\nexternalized in material laws and objects, in chance, mixed good and\nevil, and a God of human characteristics!""Yes--I--guess so, Padre dear--only, I don\'t understand your big\nwords.""Ah, _chiquita_, you understand far, far better than I do!Why, I am\nlearning it all from you!And Jose had learned by this time, too, that between merely\nrecognizing righteousness as right-thinking, and actually practicing\nit--putting it to the test so as to "prove" God--there is a vast\ndifference.Things cannot be "thought" into existence, nor evils\n"thought" away--the stumbling block of the mere tyro in the study of\nmental cause and effect.A vast development in spirituality must\nprecede those "signs following" before mankind shall again do the\nworks of the Master.Jose knew this; and he bowed in humble\nsubmission, praying for daily light.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAt dusk Rosendo returned."_Bien_, Padre, I have it now, I think!"he\ncried excitedly, pacing back and forth in the little room.Come, while we eat I will tell you!"The little group gathered about the table, while Rosendo unfolded his\ntheory."I went to Boque this morning to talk with Dona Lucia.She is very\naged, the oldest inhabitant in these parts._Bien_, I knew that she\nhad known Don Ignacio, although she was not his slave.Her story\nbrought back to me also the things my father had often told me about\nDon Ignacio\'s last trip to Simiti.Putting all these things together,\nI think I now know how the little box came to be hidden in the altar\nof the old church."The old man\'s eyes sparkled with happiness, while his auditors drew\ncloser about him to drink in his dramatic recital.For Rosendo, like a\ntrue Latin, reveled in a wonder-tale.And his recitals were always\naccompanied by profuse gesticulation and wonderful facial expressions\nand much rolling of the eyes."_Bien_," he continued, "it was this way.Don Ignacio\'s possessions in\nGuamoco were enormous, and in the then prosperous city of Simiti he\nhad stores and warehouses and much property.When the War of\nIndependence neared its end, and he saw that the Royalist cause was\nlost, he made a last and flying trip to Simiti, going up the Magdalena\nriver from Cartagena in his own _champan_, propelled by some of his\nstill faithful slaves."_Bien_, he found that one of his foremen had just returned from the\nmountains with the final clean-up from La Libertad _arrastras_.These\nhad been abandoned, for most of the slaves had deserted, or gone to\nfight the Spaniards.But the foreman, who was not a slave, but a\nfaithful employe, had cleaned up the _arrastras_ and hidden the\namalgam until he could find a favorable opportunity to come down to\nSimiti with it."Now, when Don Ignacio arrived here, he found the town practically\ndeserted.So he and the foreman retorted the amalgam and melted the\ngold into bars.But, just as they had completed their task, a\nmessenger came flying to town and reported that a body of Royalist\nsoldiers were at Badillo, and that they had learned that Simiti was\nthe _bodega_ of the rich Guamoco district, and were preparing to come\nover and sack the town.They were fleeing down the river to the coast,\nto get away to Spain as soon as possible, but had put off at Badillo\nto come over here.Fortunately, they had become very intoxicated, and\ntheir expedition was for that reason delayed."_Bueno_, at the news the foreman dropped everything and fled for his\nlife.A few people gathered with the priest in the Rincon church, the\none you are using now, Padre.The priest of the other old church on\nthe hill fled._Caramba_, but he was a coward--and he got well paid\nfor it, too!"Don Ignacio\'s _champan_ was at Badillo, and he had come across to\nSimiti by canoe._Bien_, he dared not take this gold back with him;\nand so he thought of hiding it in one of the churches, for that is\nalways a sacred place.There were people in his own church, and so he\nhurried to the one on the hill.Evidently, as he looked about in the\ndeserted building for a place to hide the bars, he saw that some of\nthe bricks could easily be removed from the rear of the altar.A\ncouple of hours sufficed to do the work of secreting the box.Then he\nfled across the shales to the town of Boque, where he got a canoe to\ntake him down to the Magdalena; and there he waited until he saw the\nsoldiers come across and enter the _cano_.Don Nicolas, son of Dona Lucia, was his boatman, and he says that he\nremained with your grandfather at that place over night, and that\nthere they received the report that the Royalists had been terribly\nwhipped in the battle--the battle of--_Caramba_!I forget--"\n\n"Of Ayacucho," suggested Jose."_Bien_, there was nothing for the poor\nman to do but hasten down the river to Cartagena as fast as possible,\nfor he knew not what might have befallen his family.He did not dare\ngo back to Simiti then for the box.And so the gold was left in the\naltar.""Now I understand what he meant by that\nnote in his old diary, which we had in my father\'s house, in Spain!Arriving in Cartagena he went at once to the Department of\nMines and tore out all the pages of the register that contained\ndescriptions of his mineral properties.He intended some day to return\nto Guamoco and again locate them.And meantime, he protected himself\nby destroying all the registered locations.It was easy for him to do\nthis, influential as he was in Cartagena.And doubtless at that stormy\ntime the office of the Department of Mines was deserted.This note,\nRosendo, I have read in his old diary, many times, but never knew to\nwhat it referred.""_Bueno_, the soldiers sacked Simiti\nand slaughtered all the people they could find.Then they set fire to\nthe town, and left."But now for the old church and the picture of the Virgin that was\nlost during the terrible storm when the priest fell dead.We will have\nto guess that later, when peace had been restored, the priest of the\nold church in prying around the altar discovered the loose bricks and\nthe box behind them._Bueno_, the night of the awful storm he had gone\nsecretly to the church to remove the box.I remember that my father\nsaid the priest had arranged for my father to take him down to Bodega\nCentral the very next day.You see, he was going to flee with the\ngold, the rogue!_Bien_, while he was in the church taking out the\nloose bricks, that storm broke--and, from what I remember, it was\nterrible!The heavens were ablaze with lightning; the thunder roared\nlike cannon; and the lake rose right out of its bed!_Caramba!_ The\ndoor of the church crashed open, and the wind whistled in and blew out\nthe candles on the altar.The wind also tore loose a beautiful picture\nof the Virgin that was hanging near the altar.The picture was blown\nout of its frame and swept off to the hills, or into the lake.It was\nnever seen again, although the frame was found just outside the door.Perhaps it was the extinguishing of the candles and the falling of the\npicture that frightened the old priest so terribly.At any rate he ran\nfrom the church to his house, and when he reached his door he fell\ndead of apoplexy."_Bueno_, after that you could never get any of the Simiti people to\nenter the church again.They closed the doors and left it, just as it\nwas, for they thought the curse of God had fallen upon it because it\nhad been erected by the enemies of the Rincon family, whose patron\nsaint was the blessed Virgin herself.Well, the old altar began to\ncrumble, and parts of it fell away from time to time.And when the\npeople heard the bricks falling they said it was the bad angel that\nthe Virgin had locked in there--the angel of Satan that had\nextinguished the candles on the altar that night of the storm._Caramba!_ And I believed it, too!I am a fool, Padre, a fool!""We are all fools, Rosendo, when we yield ourselves to superstition\nand false belief," said Jose solemnly."But you have worked out a very\ningenious story, and I doubt not you have come very near to accounting\nin the right way for the presence of the little box in the altar.But\nnow, _amigo_, come with me to my house."It is this, Rosendo," he said, when they were alone."We now have\ngold, and the way has been providentially opened.Carmen is in great\ndanger here.What say you, shall we take her and leave Simiti?""Padre," he said at length, "you are right.It would be best for her\nif we could get her away.But--you would have to leave the country.I\nsee now that neither she nor you would be safe anywhere in Colombia if\nyou left Simiti.""And I am sure that no country\noffers the asylum that America does--the America of the north.I\nhave never been there, _amigo_; but of all countries I learn that it\nis the most tolerant in matters religious.And it offers the\ngreatest opportunities to one, like Carmen, just entering upon life.And, Rosendo, prepare yourself and Dona Maria at\nonce, for we had best start without delay.""No, Padre," he said slowly.I could\nnot go to the North with you; nor could Maria."exclaimed the priest impatiently, "why?""_Bien_, Padre, we are old.And we know not the language of those up\nthere.We could not adapt ourselves to their ways of\nlife--no, not at our age.You tell me they have cold, ice, snow, up there."_Bien_, Padre, do you go, and take the girl.Bring her up to be a\npower for good in that great land.We--Maria and I--will remain in\nSimiti.It is not permitted that we should ever leave.This has always\nbeen our home, and here we will die.""No, Padre, we could not make so great a change.Anywhere in Colombia\nwould be but little different from Simiti.But up north--in that great\ncountry where they do those wonderful things you have told me\nabout--no, Padre, Maria and I could not make so great a change."But, Padre," he continued, "what will you do--leave the Church?Or\nwill you still be a priest up there?"In the great joy which the\ndiscovery of the gold had stimulated, and in the thought of the\npossibilities opened by it, he had given no heed to his status\nrespecting the Church.Yet, if he remained in the Church, he could not\nmake this transfer without the approval of the Vatican.And that, he\nwell knew, could not be obtained.No, if he went, he must leave behind\nall ecclesiastical ties.And with them, doubtless, the ties which\nstill bound him to his distant mother and the family whose honored\nname he bore.It was not so easy a matter to take the girl and leave\nSimiti, now that he gave the project further consideration.And yet he could not abandon the idea, however great his present sense\nof disappointment.He would cling to it as an ideal, some day to be\nrealized, and to be worked up to as rapidly as might be, without\nexciting suspicion, and without abruptly severing the ties which, on\nserious reflection, he found he was not morally strong enough as yet\nto break."_Bien_, Rosendo," he concluded in chastened tones."We will think it\nover, and try to devise ways to accomplish the greatest good for the\nchild."The way will be shown us some time,\nPadre!""And while we wait, we will keep our eyes open,\nno?"Yes, Jose would keep his eyes open and his heart receptive.After\nall, as he meditated the situation in the quiet of his little cottage\nthat evening, he was not sorry that circumstances kept him longer in\nSimiti.For he had long been meditating a plan, and the distraction\nincident upon a complete change of environment certainly would delay,\nif not entirely defeat, its consummation.He had planned to\ntranslate his Testament anew, in the light of various works on\nBible criticism which the explorer had mentioned, and which the\npossession of the newly discovered gold now made attainable.He had\nwith him his Greek lexicon.He would now, in the freedom from\ninterruption which Simiti could and probably would afford for the\nensuing few months, give himself up to his consecrated desire to\nextract from the sacred writings the spiritual meaning crystallized\nwithin them.The vivid experiences which had fallen to him in\nSimiti had resulted in the evolution of ideas--radically at variance\nwith the world\'s materialistic thought, it is true--which he was\nlearning to look upon as demonstrable truths.The Bible had slowly\ntaken on a new meaning to him, a meaning far different from that\nset forth in the clumsy, awkward phrases and expressions into which\nthe translators so frequently poured the wine of the spirit, and\nwhich, literally interpreted, have resulted in such violent\ncontroversies, such puerile ideas of God and His thought toward man,\nand such religious hatred and bigotry, bloodshed, suffering, and\nmaterial stagnation throughout the so-called Christian era.He would\napproach the Gospels, not as books of almost undecipherable\nmystery, not as the biography of the blessed Virgin, but as\ncontaining the highest human interpretation of truth and its relation\nto mankind."I seek knowledge," he repeated aloud, as he paced back and forth\nthrough his little living room at night; "but it is not a knowledge\nof Goethe, of Kant, or Shakespeare; it is not a knowledge of the\npoets, the scientists, the philosophers, all whom the world holds\ngreatest in the realm of thought; it is a knowledge of Thee, my\nGod, to know whom is life eternal!Men think they can know Homer,\nPlato, Confucius--and so they can.But they think they can _not_\nknow Thee!And yet Thou art nearer to us than the air we breathe, for\nThou art Life!What is there out in the world among the multifold\ninterests of mankind that can equal in importance a demonstrable\nknowledge of Thee?Not the unproven theories and opinions, the\nso-called \'authority\' of the ancient Fathers, good men though they\nmay have been; not modern pseudo-science, half-truths and relative\nfacts, saturated with materialism and founded on speculation and\nhypothesis; but real knowledge, a knowledge of Thee that is as\ndemonstrable as the simplest rule in mathematics!that men\nshould be so mesmerized by their own beliefs as to say Thou canst\nnot be known.for the burden which such thinkers as Spencer\nhave laid upon the shoulders of stumbling mankind.For God _can_ be\nknown, and proven--else is Jesus responsible for the most cruel lie\never perpetrated upon the ignorant, suffering world!"And so, putting aside a portion of his gold--his by right of\ninheritance as well as discovery--for the future purchase of such\nbooks and aids as he might require, Jose set his house in order and\nthen plunged into such a search of the Scriptures as rendered him\noblivious to all but the immediate interests of Carmen and her\nfoster-parents.The great world again narrowed into the rock-bound\nconfines of little Simiti.Each rushing morn that shot its fiery glow\nthrough the lofty treetops sank quickly into the hush of noon, while\nthe dust lay thick, white, and hot on the slumbering streets of the\nancient town; each setting sun burned with dreamy radiance through the\nafternoon haze that drew its filmy veil across the seething valley;\neach night died into a stillness, lonely and awful.Nature changed her\ngarb with monotonous regularity; the drowsing children of this tropic\nregion passed their days in dull torpidity; Jose saw nothing of it\nall.At times a villager would bring a tale of grievance to pour into\nhis ears--perhaps a jaguar had pounced upon his dog on his little\n_finca_ across the lake, or a huge snake had lured a suckling pig into\nits cavernous maw.At times a credulous woman would stop before his\nopen door to dilate upon the thick worms that hung upon the leaves of\nthe _algarrobas_ and dropped their wool-like fibers upon the natives\nas they passed below, causing intermittent fevers.Perhaps an anxious\nmother would seek him for advice regarding her little son, who had\neaten too much dirt, and was suffering from the common "_jipitera_,"\nthat made his poor little abdomen protrude so uncomfortably.Again,\nRosendo might steal in for a few moments\' mysterious, whispered talk\nabout buried treasure, or the fables of El Dorado and Parime.Jose had\ntime for them all, though as he listened his thought hovered ever\nabout the green verge of Galilee.By his side worked Carmen, delving assiduously into the mysteries\nof mathematics and the modern languages.When the day\'s work closed\nfor them both, he often asked her to sing to him.And then, leaning\nback with closed eyes, he would yield himself to the soft dreams\nwhich her sweet voice called up from his soul\'s unfathomed depths.Often they walked together by the lake on a clear night; and on\nthese little excursions, during which they were never beyond\nRosendo\'s watchful eye, Jose reveled in the girl\'s airy gaiety and\nthe spontaneous flow of her sparkling thought.He called her his\ndomestic sunbeam; but in his serious moments--and they were\nmany--he studied her with a wistful earnestness, while he sought to\nimbibe her great trust, her fearlessness, her unswerving loyalty to\nthe Christ-principle of immanent Good.He would never permit\nrestraint to be imposed upon her, even by Rosendo or his good wife.She knew not what it was to be checked in the freest manifestation\nof her natural character.But there was little occasion for\nrestraint, for Carmen dwelt ever in the consciousness of a spiritual\nuniverse, and to it paid faithful tribute.She saw and knew only\nfrom a spiritual basis; and she reaped the rewards incident thereto.His life and hers were such as fools might label madness, a\ncolorless, vegetative existence, devoid of even the elemental\nthings that make mundane existence worth the while.But the\nappraisal of fools is their own folly.Jose knew that the torrid\ndays which drew their monotonous length over the little town were\nwitnessing a development in both himself and the child that some day\nwould bear richest fruit.So far from being educated to distrust\nspiritual power, as are the children of this world, Carmen was\ngrowing up to know no other.Instead of the preponderance of her\nbelief and confidence being directed to the material, she was\ndeveloping the consciousness that the so-called evidence of the\nphysical senses is but mortal thought, the suppositional opposite of\nthe thought of the infinite God who says to mankind: "For I know the\nthoughts that I think toward you, thoughts of peace and not of\nevil, to give you an expected end."Jose knew that his method of\neducation was revolutionary.But he also knew that it was not\nwholly his; that the child had really taken this course herself,\nas if led thereto by a power beyond them both.And so he watched her, and sought to learn from her as from Christ\'s\nown loving and obedient disciple.It was because of his obedience to\nGod that Jesus was able to "prove" Him in the mighty works which we\ncall miracles.He said, "If any man will do His will, he shall know of\nthe doctrine, whether it be of God."And Carmen\ndid do His will; she kept the very first Commandment; she walked by\nfaith, and not by the sight of the human senses.She had been called\nan "_hada_," a witch, by the dull-witted folk of Simiti; and some day\nit would be told that she had a devil.But the Master had borne the\nsame ignominy.And so has every pioneer in Truth, who has dared to lay\nthe axe at the roots of undemonstrable orthodox belief and entrenched\nhuman error.Jose often trembled for the child when he thought of the probable\nreception that awaited her in the world without, in case she ever\nleft Simiti.Would her supreme confidence in good ever be weakened by\nan opposite belief in evil?Would her glorious faith ever be\nneutralized or counterbalanced by faith in a power opposed to God?And sometimes in the fits of abstraction resulting from\nthese thoughts, the girl would steal up to him and softly whisper,\n"Why, Padre, are you trying to make two and two equal seven?"Then he\nwould laugh with her, and remember how from her algebraic work she had\nlooked up one day and exclaimed, "Padre--why, all evil can be reduced\nto a common denominator, too--_and it is zero_!"As recreation from the task of retranslating his Greek Testament, Jose\noften read to Carmen portions from the various books of the Bible, or\ntold her the old sacred stories that children so love to hear.Daniel travelled to the bathroom.But\nCarmen\'s incisive thought cut deep into them, and Jose generally found\nhimself hanging upon the naive interpretations of this young girl.When, after reading aloud the two opposing accounts of the Creation,\nas given in the first and second chapters of Genesis, she asked, "But,\nPadre, why did God change His mind after He made people and gave them\ndominion over everything?"Jose was obliged to say that God had not\nmade a mistake, and then gone back afterward to rectify it; that the\naccount of the Creation, as given in Genesis, was not His, but was a\nrecord of the dawning upon the human thought of the idea of the\nspiritual Creation; that the "mist" which went up from the earth was\nsuppositional error; and that the record of the Creation which follows\nafter this was only the human mind\'s interpretation of the real,\nspiritual Creation, that Creation which is the ever unfolding of\ninfinite Mind\'s numberless, perfect ideas.The book of Genesis has\nbeen a fetish to human minds; and not until the limitations imposed by\nits literal interpretation were in a measure removed did the human\nmentality begin to rise and expand.And when, reading from Isaiah, the\ngrandest of the ancient prophets, the ringing words, "Cease ye from\nman, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be\naccounted of?"the child asked him if that did not refer to the very\nkind of people with whom they had daily intercourse, he had been\nobliged to say that it did, and that that sort of man was far, very\nfar, from being the man of God\'s own creating."The mist, child, which is mentioned in the second chapter of Genesis,\nis said to have gone up from the ground.That is, it went up from\nmatter.And so it is typical of materialism, from which all evil\ncomes.The material is the direct opposite of the spiritual.Every bit\nof evil that men think they can see, or know, or do, comes as\ntestimony of the five material senses.These might well be called the\n\'ground\' senses.In the book of Genesis, you will notice that the\naccount of the real comes first; then follows the account of its\nopposite, the unreal man of dust.""The plus sign is followed by a minus\nsign, isn\'t it?And the man made of dust is the real man with a minus\nsign before him.""The man of dust is the human mind\'s interpretation of the spiritual\nman, dear child," returned Jose."All human beings are interpretations\nby the mortal, or human, mind of infinite Mind, God, and His spiritual\nCreation.The interpretation is made in the human mind, and remains\nthere.The human mind does not see these interpretations outside of\nitself--it does not see real men, and houses, and trees, outside of\nitself--but it sees its mental interpretations of God, which it calls\nmen, and houses, and trees, and so on.These things are what we might\ncall _mental concepts_.They are the man and the creation spoken of in\nthe second chapter of Genesis after the mist went up from matter, from\nthe ground, from materialism, resulting in the testimony of the\nphysical senses.""But, Padre, they are not real--these mental concepts?"They are formed in mentalities that are\nthemselves wrong interpretations of the infinite Mentality, called\nGod.They are made up\nof false thoughts, false opinions, beliefs of power opposed to God,\nbeliefs in evil, in sickness, disaster, loss, and death.They are the\nresults of educated and inherited and attached beliefs.They are\nlargely made up of fear-beliefs.The human mentalities see these\nvarious beliefs combined in what it calls men and women, houses,\nanimals, trees, and so on, all through the material so-called\ncreation.It is this wrong interpretation that has caused all the\nsuffering and sorrow in the world.And it is this false stuff that the\ngood man Jesus finally said he had overcome.""How did he do it, Padre?""By knowing its nothingness, and by knowing the Allness of his Father,\ninfinite Mind.He called this false stuff a lie about God.And he\novercame that lie by knowing the truth--just as you overcome the\nthought that you cannot solve your algebraic problems by knowing the\ntruth that will and does solve them.""But, Padre, you said once that Jesus was the best man that ever\nlived.That is, the human minds all about him saw their\nmental concepts of him as a man.But he was a human concept that most\nclearly represented God\'s idea of Himself.Mortal, human minds are\nlike window-panes, _chiquita_.When a window-pane is very dirty, very\nmuch covered with matter, only a little light can get through it.Some\nhuman minds are cleaner, less material, than others, and they let more\nlight through.Jesus was the cleanest mind that was ever with us.He\nkept letting more and more light--Truth--through himself, until at\nlast all the matter, even the matter composing the material concept\nthat people called his earthly body, dissolved in the strong light,\nand the people saw him no more."And--Padre, don\'t we have to do that way, too?"We must, every one of us, do exactly as Jesus\ndid.We must wash ourselves clean--wash off the dirty beliefs of power\napart from God; we must wash off the beliefs of evil as a power,\ncreated in opposition to Him, or permitted by Him to exist and to use\nHis children; we must wash off beliefs of matter as real and created\nby Him.We must know that matter and all evil, all that decays and\npasses away, all discord and disease, everything that comes as\ntestimony of the five physical senses, is but a part of the lie about\nHim, the stuff that has the minus sign before it, making it less than\nnothing.We must know that it is the suppositional opposite of the\nreal--it is an illusion, seeming to exist, yet evaporating when we try\nto define it or put a finger on it, for it has no rule or principle by\nwhich it was created and by which it continues to exist.No, Jose assured himself, the Gospels are not "loose, exaggerated,\ninaccurate, credulous narratives."They are the story of the clearest\ntransparency to truth that was ever known to mortals as a human being.They preserve the life-giving words of him whose mission it was to\nshow mankind the way out of error by giving them truth.They contain\nthe rule given by the great Mathematician, who taught mankind how to\nsolve their life-problems.They tell the world plainly that there\nseems to exist a lie about God; that every real idea of the infinite\nMind seems to have its suppositional opposite in a material illusion.They tell us plainly that resisting these illusions with truth renders\nthem nugatory.They tell us clearly that the man Jesus was so filled\nwith truth that he proved the nothingness of the lie about God by\ndoing those deeds that seemed marvelous in the eyes of men, and yet\nwhich he said we could and should do ourselves.And we must do them,\nif we would throw off the mesmerism of the lie.The human concept of\nman and the universe must dissolve in the light of the truth that\ncomes through us as transparencies.And it were well if we set about\nwashing away the dirt of materialism, that the light may shine through\nmore abundantly.Jesus did not say that his great deeds were accomplished contrary to\nlaw, but that they fulfilled the law of God.Ignorance of\nspiritual law permits the belief in its opposite, material law, or\nlaws of matter.False, human beliefs, opinions, and theories, material\nspeculations and superstitions, parade before the human mind as laws.Jesus swept them all aside by knowing that their supposed power lay\nonly in human acceptance.The human mind is mesmerized by its own\nfalse thought.Even Paul at times felt its mesmerism and exclaimed:\n"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with\nme."The very idea of good stirs up its opposite in the human\nconsciousness.But Paul rose above it and saw its nothingness.Then\nhe cried: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made\nme free from the law of sin and death."He recognized the spiritual\nlaw that Jesus employed; and with it he overcame the mesmerism of\nthe lie."To be a Christian, then," said Jose, "means not merely taking the\nname of Christ, and, while morally opposing sin, succumbing to every\nform of mesmerism that the lie about God exerts.It means recognizing the nature of God and His Creation,\nincluding Man, to be wholly spiritual--and the nature of the material\ncreation and mankind as their opposite, as mental concepts, existing\nas false interpretations of the spiritual Universe and Man, and as\nhaving their place only in the false human consciousness, which itself\nis a mental activity concerned only with false thought, the\nsuppositional opposite of God\'s thought.It means taking this Truth,\nthis spiritual law, as we would take a mathematical rule or principle,\nand with it overcoming sin, sickness, discord of every name and\nnature, even to death itself.What, oh, what have so-called Christians\nbeen doing these nearly two thousand years, that they have not ere\nthis worked out their salvation as Jesus directed them to do?they have been mesmerized--simply mesmerized by the lie.The\nmillennium should have come long, long ago.It would come to-day if\nthe world would obey Jesus.But it will not come until it does obey\nhim."Day after day, week after week, month after month, Jose delved and\ntoiled, studied and pondered.The books which he ordered through the\nEmpresa Alemania, and for which for some two months he waited in\ntrembling anticipation and fear lest they be lost in transit, finally\narrived.When Juan brought them up from Bodega Central, Jose could\nhave wept for joy.Except for the very few letters he had received at\nrare intervals, these were the only messages that had penetrated the\nisolation of Simiti from the outside world in the two long years of\nhis exile.They afforded\nhis first introduction to that fearlessly critical thought regarding\nthings religious which has swept across the world like a tidal wave,\nand washed away so many of the bulwarks of superstition and ignorance\nbred of fear of the unknown and supposedly unknowable.And yet they were not really his first introduction to that\nthought, for, as he pored over these books, his heart expanded\nwith gratitude to the brusque explorer whom he had met in Cartagena,\nthat genial, odd medley of blunt honesty, unquibbling candor, and\nhatred of dissimulation, whose ridicule of the religious fetishism\nof the human mentality tore up the last root of educated orthodox\nbelief that remained struggling for life in the altered soil of his\nmind.But, though they tore down with ruthless hand, _these books did not\nreconstruct_.He could understand why the trembling heart, searching wearily for\ntruth, turned always from such as they with sinking hope.They were\nviolently iconoclastic--they up-rooted--they overthrew--they swept\naside with unsparing hand--but they robbed the starving mortal of his\nonce cherished beliefs--they snatched the stale and feebly nourishing\nbread from his mouth, and gave nothing in return.They emptied his\nheart, and left it starving.What did it boot to tell a man that the\northodox dream of eternal bliss beyond the gates of death was but a\nhoax, if no substitute be offered?Why point out the fallacies, the\npuerile conceptions, the worse than childish thought expressed in the\nreligious creeds of men, if they were not to be replaced by\nlife-sustaining truth?If the demolition of cherished beliefs be not\nfollowed by reconstruction upon a sure foundation of demonstrable\ntruth, then is the resulting state of mind worse than before, for the\ntrusting, though deceived, soul has no recourse but to fall into the\nagnosticism of despair, or the black atheism of positive negation."Happily for me," he sighed, as he closed his books at length, "that\nCarmen entered my empty life in time with the truth that she hourly\ndemonstrates!"CHAPTER 24\n\n\nDays melted into weeks, and these in turn into months.Simiti, drab\nand shabby, a crumbling and abandoned relique of ancient Spanish pride\nand arrogance, drowsed undisturbed in the ardent embrace of the\ntropical sun.Don Jorge returned, unsuccessful, from his long quest in\nthe San Lucas mountains, and departed again down the Magdalena river."It is a marvelous country up there," he told Jose."I do not wonder\nthat it has given rise to legends.I felt myself in a land of\nenchantment while I was roaming those quiet mountains.When, after\ndays of steady traveling, I would chance upon a little group of\nnatives hidden away in some dense thicket, it seemed to me that they\nmust be fairies, not real.I came upon the old trail, Padre, the\n_Camino Real_, now sunken and overgrown, which the Spaniards used.It used to lead down to Cartagena."Ah, Padre, what quartz veins I saw in that country!Gold\nwill be discovered there without measure some day!This map which Don Carlos gave me is much in error.Jose regretfully saw\nhim depart, for he had grown to love this ruggedly honest soul.Meantime, Don Mario sulked in his house; nor during the intervening\nyear would he hold anything more than the most formal intercourse with\nthe priest.Events move with\nterrible deliberation in these tropic lands, and men\'s minds are heavy\nand lethargic.Jose assumed that Don Mario had failed in the support\nupon which he had counted; or else Diego\'s interest in Carmen was\ndormant, perhaps utterly passed.Each succeeding day of quiet\nincreased his confidence, while he rounded out month after month in\nthis sequestered vale on the far confines of civilization, and the\ngirl attained her twelfth year.Moreover, as he noted with marveling,\noften incredulous, mental gaze her swift, unhindered progress, the\nrapid unfolding of her rich nature, and the increasing development of\na spirituality which seemed to raise her daily farther above the plane\non which he dwelt, he began to regard the uninterrupted culmination of\nhis plans for her as reasonably assured, if not altogether certain.Juan continued his frequent trips down to Bodega Central as general\nmessenger and transportation agent for his fellow-townsmen, meanwhile\nadoring Carmen from a distance of respectful decorum.Rosendo and\nLazaro, relaxing somewhat their vigilance over the girl, labored\ndaily on the little _hacienda_ across the lake.The dull-witted\nfolk, keeping to their dismally pretentious mud houses during the\npulsing heat of day, and singing their weird, moaning laments in the\nquiet which reigned over this maculate hollow at night, followed\nundeviatingly the monotonous routine of an existence which had no\nother aim than the indulgence of the most primitive material wants."Ah, Padre," Rosendo would say of them, "they are so easy!They love\nidleness; they like not labor.They fish, they play the guitar, they\ngather fruits.Padre, it is sad, is\nit not?"Aye, thought the priest, doubly sad in its mute answer to the\nheartlessly selfish query of Cain.No one, not even the Church, was\nthe keeper of these benighted brothers.He alone had constituted\nhimself their shepherd.And as they learned to love him, to confide\ntheir simple wants and childish hopes to him, he came to realize the\nimmense ascendency which the priests of Colombia possess over the\nsimple understanding of the people.An ascendency hereditary and\ndominant, capable of utmost good, but expressed in the fettering of\ninitiative and action, in the suppression of ambition, and the\nquenching of every impulse toward independence of thought.Sandra journeyed to the office.How he\nlonged to lift them up from the drag of their mental encompassment!Yet how helpless he was to afford them the needed lustration of soul\nwhich alone could accomplish it!"I can do little more than try to set them a standard of thought,"\nhe would muse, as he looked out from the altar over the camellia-like\nfaces of his adult children when he conducted his simple Sunday\nservices."I can only strive to point out the better things of\nthis life--to tell them of the wonders of invention, of art, of\ncivilization--I can only relate to them tales of romance and\nachievement, and beautiful stories--and try to omit in the recital all\nreference to the evil methods, aims, and motives which have manifested\nin those dark crimes staining the records of history.The world\ncalls them historical incident and fact.I must call them \'the mist\nthat went up from the ground and watered the face of the earth.\'"But Jose had progressed during his years in Simiti.It had been\nhard--only he could know how hard!--to adapt himself to the narrow\nenvironment in which he dwelt.It had been hard to conform to these\nodd ways and strange usages.But he now knew that the people\'s\nreserve and shyness at first was due to their natural suspicion of\nhim.For days, even weeks, he had known that he was being weighed and\nwatched.It is true, the dull staring of the natives of this unkempt town had\nlong continued to throw him into fits of prolonged nervousness.They\nhad not meant to offend, of course.But at hardly any hour of the day or night could he look up\nfrom his work without seeing dark, inquisitive faces peering in\nthrough the latticed window or the open door at him, watchful of the\nminutest detail of his activity.And he\nhad grown used to their thoughtless intrusion upon him at any hour.He\nhad learned, too, not to pale with nausea when, as was their wont of\nmany centuries, the dwellers in this uncouth town relentlessly pursued\ntheir custom of expectorating upon his floor immediately they entered\nand stood before him.He had accustomed himself to the hourly\nintrusion of the scavenger pigs and starving dogs in his house.And he\ncould now endure without aching nerves the awful singing, the maudlin\nwails, the thin, piercing, falsetto howls which rose almost nightly\nabout him in the sacred name of music.For these were children with\nwhom he dwelt.And he was trying to show them that they were children\nof God.Already Jose had\nbeen obliged to supplement his oral instruction with texts purchased\nfor her from abroad.Her grasp of the English language was his daily\nwonder.After two years of study she spoke it readily.She loved it,\nand insisted that her conversations with him should be conducted\nwholly in it.French and German likewise had been taken up; and her\nknowledge of her own Castilian tongue had been enriched by the few\nbooks which he had been able to secure for her from Spain.Jose\'s anomalous position in Simiti had ceased to cause him worry.What mattered it, now that he had endeared himself to its people, and\nwas progressing undisturbed in the training of Carmen?And he, in\nturn, knew that upon his observance of them depended his tenure of the\nparish.And he wanted to remain among them, to lead them, if possible, at\nleast a little way along what he was daily seeing to be the only path\nout of the corroding beliefs of the human mind.He knew that his\npeople\'s growth would be slow--how slow might not his own be, too!Who\ncould say how unutterably slow would be their united march heavenward!And yet, the human mind was expanding with wonderful rapidity in\nthese last days.What acceleration had it not acquired since that\ndistant era of the Old Stone Man, when through a hundred thousand\nyears of darkness the only observable progress was a little greater\nskill in the shaping of his crude flint weapons!To Padre Diego\'s one or two subsequent curt demands that Carmen be\nsent to him, Jose had given no heed.And perhaps Diego, absorbed in\nhis political activities as the confidential agent of Wenceslas, would\nhave been content to let his claim upon the child lapse, after many\nmonths of quiet, had not Don Jorge inadvertently set the current of\nthe man\'s thought again in her direction.For Don Jorge was making frequent trips along the Magdalena river.It\nwas essential to his business to visit the various riverine towns and\nto mingle freely with all grades of people, that he might run down\nrumors or draw from the inhabitants information which might result in\nvaluable clues anent buried treasure.Returning one day to Simiti from\nsuch a trip, he regaled Jose with the spirited recital of his\nexperience on a steamboat which had become stranded on a river bar."_Bien_," he concluded, "the old tub at last broke loose.Then we saw\nthat its engines were out of commission; and so the captain let her\ndrift down to Banco, where we docked.I was forced, not altogether\nagainst my will, to put up with Padre Diego.But I had much amusement at his expense when I twitted him about his\ndaughter Carmen, and his silly efforts to get possession of her!"he cried, "why can\nyou not let sleeping dogs alone?Diego is not the man to be bearded\nlike that!Would that you had kept away from the subject!And what did\nyou say to him about the girl?"I only told him how beautiful she was, and how large\nfor her few years._Bien_, I think I said she was the most beautiful\nand well-formed girl I had ever seen.But was there anything wrong in\ntelling the truth, _amigo_?""No," replied Jose bitterly, as he turned away; "you meant no harm.But, knowing the man\'s brutal nature, and his assumed claim on the\ngirl, why could you not have foreseen possible misfortune to her in\ndwelling thus on her physical beauty?_Hombre_, it is too bad!""_Na_, _amigo_," said Don Jorge soothingly, "nothing can come of it.But when Don Jorge again set out for\nthe mountains he left the priest\'s heart filled with apprehension.A few weeks later came what Jose had been awaiting, another demand\nupon him for the girl.Failure to comply with it, said Diego\'s letter,\nmeant the placing of the case in the hands of the civil and\necclesiastical authorities for action.Rosendo\'s face grew hard when he read the note."There is a way,\nPadre.Let my woman take the girl and go up the Boque river to Rosa\nMaria, the clearing of Don Nicolas.It is a wild region, where tapirs\nand deer roam, and where hardly a man has set foot for centuries.The\npeople of Boque will keep our secret, and she can remain hidden there\nuntil--"\n\n"No, Rosendo, that will not do," replied Jose, shaking his head in\nperplexity."The girl is developing rapidly, and such a course would\nresult in a mental check that might spell infinite harm.She and Dona\nMaria would die to live by themselves up there in that lonely region."Then do you go too, Padre," suggested Rosendo."No, _amigo_, for that would cause search to be instituted by the\nBishop, and we certainly would be discovered.But, to take her\nand flee the country--and the Church--how can I yet?He shook his head dolefully, while his thoughts flew\nback to Seville and the proud mother there."_Bien_, Padre, let us increase our contributions to Don Wenceslas.Let us send him from now on not less than one hundred _pesos oro_ each\nmonth.Will not that keep him quiet, no matter what Diego says?""At any rate, we will try it."They still\nhad some three thousand _pesos_ gold left.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"Padre," said Rosendo, some days later, as they sat together in the\nparish house, "what do you think Diego wants of the girl?""I think, Rosendo--" he began.But could even a human\nmind touch such depths of depravity?And yet--"I think," he continued\nslowly, "that Diego, having seen her, and now speculating on her\nfuture beauty of face and form--I think he means to place her in a\nconvent, with the view of holding her as a ready substitute for the\nwoman who now lives with him--"\n\n"_Dios_!And, if I mistake not, Diego also would like to\nrepay the score he has against you, for driving him from Simiti and\nholding the threat of death over him these many years.He can most\nreadily do this by getting Carmen away from you--as he did the other\ndaughter, is it not so?"His face was strained with\nfearful anxiety."Padre," he said in a low voice, "I shall end this\nmatter at once.I go to Banco to-morrow to kill Diego.""Why--Rosendo, it would mean your own death, or lifelong\nimprisonment!""I\nhave nothing that is not hers, even to my life.Gladly would I give it\nfor her.Let me die, or spend my remaining days in the prison, if that\nwill save her.Such a price for her safety would be low."While he was speaking, Fernando, the town constable, entered.He\nsaluted the men gravely, and drew from his pocket a document to which\nwas attached the Alcalde\'s official seal."Senores," he said with much dignity, as if the majesty of his little\noffice weighed upon him, "I am commanded by Senor, the Alcalde, to\nexercise the authority reposing in him and place Don Rosendo Ariza\nunder arrest.You will at once accompany me to the _carcel_," he\nadded, going up to the astonished Rosendo and laying a hand upon his\nshoulder.cried the old man, stepping\nback."_Bien_, _amigo_, I do not find it my duty to tell you.The Senor\nAlcalde hands me the document and commands me to execute it.As for\nthe cause--_Bien_, you must ask him.""Come," said Jose, the first to recover from his astonishment, "let us\ngo to him at once."He at any rate had now an opportunity to confront\nDon Mario and learn what plans the man had been devising these many\nmonths.The Alcalde received the men in his little _patio_, scowling and\nmenacing.He offered them no greeting when they confronted him."Don Mario," asked Jose in a trembling voice, "why have you put this\nindignity upon our friend, Rosendo?"Ask, rather, _Senor Padre_," replied the Alcalde, full of wrath,\n"what alone saves you from the same indignity.Only that you are a\npriest, _Senor Padre_, _nada mas_!His arrest is ordered by Padre\nDiego.""And why, if I may beg the favor?"pursued Jose, though he well knew\nthe sordid motive.Why lay the hands of the law upon those who deprive a\nsuffering father of his child!_Bien_, _Fernando_," turning to the\nconstable, "you have done well.Take your prisoner to the _carcel_.""No, Don Mario, I will not go to\nthe jail!I will--"\n\n"_Caramba!_" shouted the Alcalde, his face purple."I set your trial\nfor to-morrow, in the early morning.But this night you will spend in\nthe jail!_Hombre!_ I will see if I am not Alcalde here!And look you,\n_Senor Padre_, if there is any disturbance, I will send for the\ngovernment soldiers!Then they will take Rosendo to the prison in\nCartagena!Jose knew that, if Diego had the support of the Bishop, this was no\nidle threat."What shall I\ndo, Padre?""It is best that you go to the jail to-night, Rosendo," said Jose with\nsinking heart."But, Don Mario," turning menacingly to the Alcalde,\n"mark you, his trial takes place in the morning, and he shall be\njudged, not by you alone, but by his fellow-townsmen!""Have I not said so, senor?"returned Don Mario curtly, with a note of\ndeep contempt in his voice.As in most small Spanish towns, the jail was a rude adobe hut, with no\nfurnishings, save the wooden stocks into which the feet of the hapless\nprisoners were secured.Thus confined, the luckless wight who chanced\nto feel the law\'s heavy hand might sit in a torturing position for\ndays, cruelly tormented at night by ravenous mosquitoes, and wholly\ndependent upon the charity of the townsfolk for his daily rations,\nunless he have friends or family to supply his needs.In the present\ninstance Don Mario took the extra precaution of setting a guard over\nhis important prisoner.Jose, benumbed by the shock and bewildered by the sudden precipitation\nof events, accompanied Rosendo to the jail and mutely watched the\nprocedure as Fernando secured the old man\'s bare feet in the rude\nstocks.And yet, despite the situation, he could not repress a sense\nof the ridiculous, as his thought dwelt momentarily on the little\n_opera bouffe_ which these child-like people were so continually\nenacting in their attempts at self-government.But it was a play that\nat times approached dangerously near to the tragic.The passions of\nthis Latin offshoot were strong, if their minds were dull and\nlethargic, and when aroused were capable of the most despicable, as\nwell as the most grandly heroic deeds.And in the present instance,\nwhen the fleeting sense of the absurd passed, Jose knew that he was\nfacing a crisis.Something told him that resistance now would be\nuseless.True, Rosendo might have opposed arrest with violence, and\nperhaps have escaped.But that would have accomplished nothing for\nCarmen, the pivot upon which events were turning.Jose had reasoned\nthat it were better to let the Alcalde play his hand first, in the\nsmall hope that as the cards fell he might more than match his\nopponent\'s strength with his own."_Na_, Padre, do not worry," said Rosendo reassuringly."It is for her\nsake; and we shall have to know, as she does, that everything will\ncome out right.My friends will set me free to-morrow, when the trial\ntakes place.And then"--he drew the priest down to him and whispered\nlow--"we will leave Simiti and take to the mountains."Arriving at Rosendo\'s house, he\nsaw the little living room crowded with sympathetic friends who had\ncome to condole with Dona Maria.That placid woman, however, had not\nlost in any degree her wonted calm, even though her companions held\nforth with much impassioned declamation against the indignity which\nhad been heaped upon her worthy consort.She was not with her foster-mother, nor did his inquiry reveal her\nwhereabouts.He smiled sadly, as he thought of her out on the shales,\nher customary refuge when storms broke.He started in search of her;\nbut as he passed through the _plaza_ Manuela Cortez met him."Padre,"\nshe exclaimed, "is the little Carmen to go to jail, too?""Manuela--why do you say that?"he asked\nhurriedly, his heart starting to beat like a trip-hammer."Because, Padre, I saw the constable, Fernando, take her into Don\nMario\'s house some time ago."Jose uttered an exclamation and started for the house of the Alcalde.Don Mario stood at the door, his huge bulk denying the priest\nadmission."Carmen--you have her here?"Fernando, who had been sitting just within the door, rose and came to\nhis chief\'s side.Fernando stepped\noutside and took his arm.The Alcalde\'s unlovely face expanded in a\nsinister leer."It is permissible to place even a priest in the\nstocks, if he becomes _loco_," he said significantly.Fernando spoke quickly:\n\n"It was necessary to take the girl in custody, too, Padre.But do not\nworry; she is safe.""But--you have no right to take her--"\n\n"There, _Senor Padre_, calm yourself.What right had you to separate\nher from her father?"And, Don Mario, you have no\nauthority but his--"\n\n"You mistake, _Senor Padre_," calmly interrupted the Alcalde.he muttered, scarce hearing\nhis own words."The Bishop\'s, _Senor Padre_," answered Don Mario, with a cruel grin.But--the old man--"\n\n"_Na_, _Senor Padre_, but the Bishop is fairly young, you know.That\nis, the new one--"\n\n"The new one!""To be sure, _Senor Padre_, the new Bishop--formerly Senor Don\nWenceslas Ortiz."Jose beat the air feebly as his hand sought his damp brow."_Bien_, _Senor Padre_," put in Fernando gently, pitying the priest\'s\nagony.The old Bishop of Cartagena died suddenly some days ago, and Don\nWenceslas at once received the temporary appointment, until the\nvacancy can be permanently filled.There is talk of making Cartagena\nan archbishopric, and so a new bishop will not be appointed until that\nquestion is settled.Meanwhile, Don Wenceslas administers the affairs\nof the Church there.""And he--he--" stammered the stunned priest."To be sure, _Senor Padre_," interrupted Don Mario, laughing aloud;\n"the good Don Wenceslas no doubt has learned of the beautiful Carmen,\nand he cannot permit her to waste her loveliness in so dreary a place\nas Simiti.And so he summons her to Cartagena, in care of his agent,\nPadre Diego, who awaits the girl now in Banco to conduct her safely\ndown the river.At least, this is what Padre Diego writes me._Bien_,\nit is the making of the girl, to be so favored by His Grace!"Jose staggered and would have fallen, had not Fernando supported him.But as he went he spitefully hurled\nback:\n\n"_Bien_, _Senor Padre_, whom have you to blame but yourself?You keep\na child from her suffering father--you give all your time to her,\nneglecting the other poor children of your parish--you send Rosendo\ninto the mountains to search for La Libertad--you break your\nagreement with me, for you long ago said that we should work\ntogether--is it not so?You find gold in the mountains, but you do\nnot tell me._Na_, you work against me--you oppose my authority as\nAlcalde--_Bien_, you opposed even the authority of the good\nBishop--may he rest with the Saints!You have not made a good priest\nfor Simiti, _Senor Padre_--_na_, you have made a very bad one!And\nnow you wonder that the good Don Wenceslas takes the girl from you,\nto bring her up in the right way.if it is not already too\nlate to save her from your bad teachings!"His voice steadily rose\nwhile he talked, and ended in a shrill pipe.Jose made as if to reach him; but Fernando held him back.The Alcalde\ngot quickly within the house and secured the door."Go now to your\nhome, Padre," urged Fernando; "else I shall call help and put you in\nthe stocks, too!"shouted\nJose desperately, struggling to gain the Alcalde\'s door.cried Fernando, holding to the frenzied man."The little Carmen--she is not in there!"Then where is she, Fernando?--for God\'s sake tell\nme!"Great beads of perspiration stood\nupon his face, and tears rolled down his drawn cheeks."_Bien_, Padre," he said gently;\n"come away.I give you my word that the girl is not in the house of\nthe Alcalde.But I am not permitted to say where she is.""Then I will search every house in Simiti!""_Na_, Padre, you would not find her.He took Jose\'s arm again and led him, blindly stumbling, to the parish\nhouse.By this time the little town was agog with excitement.People ran from\nhouse to house, or gathered on the street corners, discussing the\nevent."_Caramba!_" shrilled one wrinkled beldame, "but Simiti was very quiet\nuntil the _Cura_ came!""_Na_, senora," cried another, "say, rather, until that wicked little\nhada was brought here by Rosendo!""_Cierto_, she is an _hada_!"put in a third; "she cured Juanita of\ngoitre by her charms!I myself saw her come from\nthe old church on the hill one day!_Bien_, what was she doing?I say,\nshe was talking with the bad angel which the blessed Virgin has locked\nin there!""Yes, and I have seen her coming from the cemetery.She talks with the\nbuzzards that roost on the old wall, and they are full of evil\nspirits!""And she brought the plague two years ago--who knows?"But it was not the real plague, anyway.""_Bueno_, and that proves that she caused it, no?""_Cierto_, _senora_, she cast a spell on the town!"Jose sat in his little house like one in a dream.Dona Maria had gone to the jail to see Rosendo.Juan had\nreturned that morning to Bodega Central, and Lazaro was at work on the\nplantation across the lake.Jose thought bitterly that the time had\nbeen singularly well chosen for the _coup_.Don Mario\'s last words\nburned through his tired brain like live coals.In a sense the Alcalde\nwas right.He had been selfishly absorbed in the girl.But he alone,\nexcepting Rosendo, had any adequate appreciation of the girl\'s real\nnature.To the stagnant wits of Simiti she was one of them, but with\nsingular characteristics which caused the more superstitious and less\nintelligent to look upon her as an uncanny creature, possessed of\noccult powers.Moreover, Jose had duped Don Mario with assurances of cooeperation.He\nhad allowed him to believe that Rosendo was searching for La Libertad,\nand that he should participate in the discovery, if made.Had his\ncourse been wholly wise, after all?it was all to save an innocent child from the blackest\nof fates!If he had been stronger himself, this never could have\nhappened.Or, perhaps, if he had not allowed himself to be lulled to\nsleep by a fancied security bred of those long months of quiet, he\nmight have been awake and alert to meet the enemy when he returned to\nthe attack.the devil had left him for a season, and Jose had\nlaid down "the shield of faith," while he lost himself in the\nintellectual content which the study of the new books purchased with\nhis ancestral gold had afforded.But evil sleeps not; and with a\npersistency that were admirable in a better cause, it returned with\nunbated vigor at the moment the priest was off his guard.*       *       *       *       *\n\nDawn broke upon a sleepless night for Jose.The Alcalde had sent word\nthat Fernando must remain with the priest, and that no visits would be\npermitted to Rosendo in the jail.Jose had heard nothing from Carmen,\nand, though often during the long night he sought to know, as she\nwould, that God\'s protection rested upon her; and though he sought\nfeebly to prove the immanence of good by knowing no evil, the morning\nfound him drawn and haggard, with corroding fear gnawing his desolate\nheart.Fernando remained mute; and Dona Maria could only learn that\nthe constable had been seen leading the girl into Don Mario\'s house\nshortly after Rosendo\'s arrest.At an early hour the people, buzzing with excitement, assembled for\nthe trial, which was held in the town hall, a long, empty adobe house\nof but a single room, with dirt floor, and a few rough benches.The\nAlcalde occupied a broken chair at one end of the room.The trial\nitself was of the simplest order: any person might voice his opinion;\nand the final verdict was left to the people.In a shaking voice, his frame tremulous with nervous agitation,\nRosendo recounted the birth of the child at Badillo, and the manner of\nher coming into his family.He told of Diego\'s appointment to Simiti,\nand of the loss of his own daughter.Waxing more and more energetic as\nhis recital drew out, he denounced Diego as the prince of liars, and\nas worthy of the violent end which he was certain to meet if ever that\nrenegade priest should venture near enough for him to lay his hands\nupon him.The little locket was produced, and all present commented on\nthe probable identity of the girl\'s parents.Many affected to detect a\nresemblance to Diego in the blurred photograph of the man.Don Mario swore loudly that it could be no other.Diego had often talked to him, sorrowfully, and in terms of deepest\naffection, about the beautiful woman whose love he had won, but whom\nhis vows of celibacy prevented from making his lawful wife.The\nAlcalde\'s recital was dramatic to a degree, and at its close several\nexcitedly attempted to address the multitude at the same time.Oratory flowed on an ever rising tide, accompanied by much violent\ngesticulation and expectoration by way of emphasis.At length it was\nagreed that Diego had been, in times past, a bad man, but that the\nverbal proofs which he had given the Alcalde were undoubtedly valid,\ninasmuch as the Bishop stood behind them--and Don Mario assured the\npeople that they were most certainly vouched for by His Grace.The day\nwas almost carried when the eloquent Alcalde, in glowing rhetoric,\npainted the splendid future awaiting the girl, under the patronage of\nthe Bishop.How cruel to retain her in dreary little Simiti, even\nthough Diego\'s claim still remained somewhat obscure, when His Grace,\nlearning of her talents, had summoned her to Cartagena to be educated\nin the convent for a glorious future of service to God!Ah, that a\nlike beautiful career awaited all the children of Simiti!Jose at length forced himself before the people and begged them to\nlisten to him.But, when he opened his mouth, the words stumbled and\nhalted.To tell these people that he was\nstriving to educate the girl away from them was impossible.To say\nthat he was trying to save her from the Church would be fatal.And to\nreiterate that Diego\'s claim was a fabrication, added nothing of value\nto the evidence, for what did he know of the child\'s parentage?He\nfeebly begged them to wait until Diego\'s claim had been either\ncorroborated or annulled.But no; they had the Bishop\'s corroboration,\nand that sufficed.cried Don Mario, interrupting the\npriest in a loud voice, "if we oppose the Bishop, then will he send\nthe government soldiers to us--and you know what--"\n\n"_Cielo_, yes!"The case now\nrested with her God.The people drew apart in little groups to discuss the matter.Don\nMario\'s beady eyes searched them, until he was certain of the way the\ntide was flowing."_Bueno_, _amigos y amigas_," he began with immense dignity; "what say\nyou if we sum up the case as follows: The proofs have the support of\nthe Bishop, and show that the girl is the daughter of Padre Diego.Rosendo is guilty of having kept her from her own father, and for that\nhe should be severely punished.Let him be confined in the jail for\nsix months, and be forced to pay to us a fine of one thousand _pesos\noro_--"\n\n"_Caramba_!but he has no such sum," cried the people with mouths\nagape."_Bien_, I say he can get it!"retorted the Alcalde, looking meaningly\nat Jose."And he should pay it for depriving the child of a father\'s\nlove and the religious instruction which he would have given her!""Will you not remember that more than that amount is due Rosendo for\nthe care of the child?The whimsical, fickle people broke into excited exclamations."_Cierto!_"\n\n"The _Cura_ is right!""Let Rosendo pay no fine--he has no gold, anyway!"The Alcalde saw that he had gone a bit too far."_Bueno_, then," he\namended."We will cancel both the fine and Padre Diego\'s debt to\nRosendo, and the sentence shall be reduced to--what say you all?""A month in the jail, Don Mario, no more," suggested one.An exclamation of approval from the crowd drowned the protest which\nJose sought vainly to voice.Rosendo rose quickly; but Fernando and\nothers seized him."_Bien_, it is approved," bawled the Alcalde, waving his thick arms."Take the prisoner to the _carcel_, _Senor Policia_," turning to the\nconstable."And the girl, Senor the Alcalde--when will you send her to her\nfather?""Yes, Don Mario, she must be taken to Padre Diego at once," piped a\nwoman\'s shrill voice."_Bien_," shouted the Alcalde, following his words with a long, coarse\nlaugh, "I was wise enough to know what you would decide, and sent the\ngirl down the river last night!"CHAPTER 25\n\n\nThe candles and smoky oil lamps of Banco threw a fitful shimmer out\nupon the great river, casting huge, spectral shadows across its muddy,\nswirling waters, and seeming rather to intensify the blackness that\nlay thick and menacing upon its restless bosom.Rivermen who follow\ntheir hazardous calling along the Magdalena do not lightly risk the\ndangers of travel by night in their native canoes, when at any moment\na false stroke, a sudden crash against a tossing forest tree, and a\ncry through the inky blackness, might sound to the straining ears of\nhushed listeners on the distant banks the elements of another of the\nmighty river\'s grim nocturnal tragedies.But on the night following the trial of Rosendo in distant Simiti a\ncanoe stole like a thing ashamed through the heavy shadows along the\nriver\'s margin, and poked its blunt nose into the ooze at the upper\nedge of the town.Its two scantily clad _bogas_, steaming with\nperspiration and flecked with mud from the charged waters, sprang\nlightly from the frail craft and quickly made it fast to one of the\nlong stilts upon which a ramshackle frame house rested.Then they\nassisted the third occupant of the canoe, a girl, to alight; and\ntogether they wended their way up the slippery bank and toward the\ntown above."_Caramba_, _compadre_!"ejaculated one of the men, stumbling into a\ndeep rut, "it is well you know where we go.but I travel no\nmore on the river by night.And, _compadre_, we had best ask Padre\nDiego to offer a candle to the Virgin for our safe arrival, no?"Don Diego has much\ninfluence with virgins.""_Bien, amigo_, what would you?You are well paid; and besides, you\nscore against that baby-faced priest, Jose, who drove you out of\nSimiti because you were not married to your woman.You cannot\ncomplain, _compadre_.""_Caramba!_ I have yet to see the color of the _pesos_.I do not much\ntrust your Padre Diego.""_Na, amigo_, a bit of rum will put new life into your soaked gizzard._Cierto_, this trip down the river was a taste of purgatory; but you\nknow we may as well get used to it here, for when we _pobres_ are dead\nwho will buy Masses to get us out?""_Caramba!_" muttered the other sullenly, as he stumbled on through\nthe darkness, "but if we have no money the priests will let us burn\nforever!"The girl went along with the men silently and without complaint, even\nwhen her bare feet slipped into the deep ruts in the trail, or were\npainfully bruised and cut by the sharp stones and bits of wood that\nlay in the narrow path.The man addressed as Julio\nassisted her to her feet.The other broke into a torrent of profane\nabuse."_Na, Ricardo,_" interrupted Julio, "hold your foolish tongue and let\nthe girl alone!You and I have cursed all the way from Simiti, but she\nhas made no complaint._Caramba_, I wish I were well\nout of this business!"A few minutes later they struck one of the main thoroughfares.Then\nthe men stopped to draw on their cotton shirts and trousers before\nentering the town.The road was better here, and they made rapid\nprogress.The night was far spent, and the streets were deserted.In\nthe main portion of the town ancient Spanish lamps, hanging\nuncertainly in their sconces against old colonial houses, threw a\nfeeble light into the darkness.Before one of the better of these\nhouses Julio and the girl were halted by their companion."_Bien_," he said, "it is here that the holy servant of God lives._Caramba_, but may his _garrafon_ be full!"They entered the open door and mounted the stone steps.On the floor\nabove they paused in the rotunda, and Ricardo called loudly.A side\ndoor opened and a young woman appeared, holding a lighted candle\naloft."_El Senor Padre, senorita\nAna?_" he said, bowing low."You will do us the favor to announce our\narrival, no?"The woman stared uncomprehendingly at the odd trio."The Padre is not\nhere," she finally said."_Dios y diablo!_" cried Ricardo, forgetting his courtesy."But we\nhave risked our skins to bring him the brat, and he not here to\nreceive and reward us!_Caramba!_"\n\n"But--Ricardo, he is out with friends to-night--he may return at any\nmoment.She stepped\nforward, holding the candle so that its light fell full upon her face.As she did this the girl darted toward her and threw herself into the\nwoman\'s arms.she cried, her voice breaking with emotion, "Anita--I am\nCarmen!The little Carmen,\nmy father\'s--"\n\n"Yes, Anita, I am padre Rosendo\'s Carmen--and yours!"Ana clasped the girl in her arms.What brings\nyou here, of all places?""As you may see, senorita, it is\nwe who have brought her here, at the command of her father, Padre\nDiego."And, since you say he is not in, we must wait until he\nreturns."Carmen clung to her, while\nRicardo stood looking at them, with a foolish leer on his face.Julio\ndrew back into the shadow of the wall."_Bien, senorita_," said Ricardo, stepping up to the child and\nattempting to take her arm, "we will be held to account for the girl,\nand we must not lose her._Caramba!_ For then would the good Padre\ndamn us forever!"Julio emerged swiftly from the shadow and\nlaid a restraining hand on Ricardo.The woman tore Carmen from his\ngrasp and thrust the girl behind herself."_Cierto_, friend Ricardo,\nwe are all responsible for her," she said quickly."But you are tired\nand hungry--is it not so?Let me take you to the _cocina_, where you\nwill find roast pig and a bit of red rum.""_Caramba!_ my throat is like the ashes\nof purgatory!""Come, then," said the woman, holding Carmen tightly by the hand and\nleading the way down the steps to the kitchen below.Arriving there,\nshe lighted an oil lamp and hurriedly set out food and a large\n_garrafon_ of Jamaica rum."There, _compadre_, is a part of your reward.And we will now wait\nuntil Padre Diego arrives, is it not so?"While the men ate and drank voraciously, interpolating their actions\nat frequent intervals with bits of vivid comment on their river trip,\nthe woman cast many anxious glances toward the steps leading to the\nfloor above.From time to time she replenished Ricardo\'s glass, and\nurged him to drink.Physical exhaustion\nand short rations while on the river had prepared him for just what\nthe woman most desired to accomplish, and as glass after glass of the\nfiery liquor burned its way down his throat, she saw his scant wit\nfading, until at last it deserted him completely, and he sank into a\ndrunken torpor.Then, motioning to Julio, who had consumed less of the\nrum, she seized the senseless Ricardo by the feet, and together they\ndragged him out into the _patio_ and threw him under a _platano_\ntree."But, senorita--" began Julio in remonstrance, as thoughts of Diego\'s\nwrath filtered through his befuddled brain."Not a word, _hombre_!""If you lay a\nhand upon this child my knife shall find your heart!""How much did Padre Diego say he would give you?""Three _pesos oro_--and rations," replied the man thickly."Wait here, then, and I will bring you the money."Still retaining Carmen\'s hand, she mounted the steps, listening\ncautiously for the tread of her master.Reaching the rotunda above,\nshe drew Carmen into the room from which she had emerged before, and,\nbidding her conceal herself if Diego should arrive, took her wallet\nand hastily descended to where the weaving Julio waited."There, _amigo_," she said hurriedly, handing him the money."Now do\nyou go--at once!And do not remain in Banco, or Padre Diego will\nsurely make you trouble.She\npointed to the door; and Julio, impressed with a sense of his danger,\nlost no time in making his exit.Returning to Carmen, the woman seated herself and drew the girl to\nher.she cried, trembling, as her eyes searched the\ngirl."I do not know, Anita dear," murmured the girl, nestling close to the\nwoman and twining an arm about her neck; "except that day before\nyesterday the Alcalde put padre Rosendo into the jail--"\n\n"Into the jail!"And then, when I was going to see him, Fernando ran\nout of Don Mario\'s house and told me I must go in and see the Alcalde.Julio Gomez and this man Ricardo were there talking with Don Mario in\nthe _patio_.Then they threw a _ruana_ over me and carried me out\nthrough the _patio_ and around by the old church to the Boque trail.When we got to the trail they made me walk with them to the Inanea\nriver, where they put me into a canoe.They paddled fast, down to the\nBoque river; then to the Magdalena; and down here to Banco.They did\nnot stop at all, except when steamboats went by--oh, Anita, I never\nsaw a steamboat before!But Padre\nJose had often told me about them.And when the big boats passed us\nthey made me lie down in the canoe, and they put the _ruana_ over me\nand told me if I made any noise they would throw me into the river.But I knew if I just kept still and knew--really _knew_--that God\nwould take care of me, why, He would.And, you see, He did, for He\nbrought me to you."A tired sigh escaped her lips as she laid her head\non the woman\'s shoulder."But--oh, _Santa Maria_!"moaned the woman, "you are not safe here!John journeyed to the garden.What can I do?--what can I do?""Well, Anita dear, you can know that God is here, can\'t you?I knew\nthat all the way down the river.And, oh, I am so glad to see you!Why, just think, it is eight years since you used to play with me!And\nnow we will go back to Simiti, will we not, Anita?""Pray to the Virgin to help us, child!You may have influence with\nher--I have none, for my soul is lost!""Why, Anita dear, that is not true!You and I are both God\'s children,\nand He is right here with us.All we have to do is to know it--just\nreally _know_ it.""But, tell me, quick--Diego may be here any moment--why did he send\nRicardo for you?""Anita dear, Padre Diego says I am his\nchild.""Yes--his daughter--that he is my father.But--is it really so,\nAnita?""_Madre de Dios!_" cried the woman.He\nsaw you in Simiti when he was last there--and you are now a\nbeautiful--No, child, you are not his daughter!The wretch lies--he is\na sink of lies!"Why, no, Anita dear, he is not a beast--we must love him, for he is\nGod\'s child, too," said Carmen, patting the woman\'s wet cheek with her\nsoft hand."_Carita_, he\nis Satan himself!"I don\'t mean that what you think you see is God\'s child, Anita dear;\nbut that what you think you see stands for God\'s child, and isn\'t\nreal.And if we know that, why, we will see the real child of God--the\nreal man--and not what you call a beast."Carmen\nlooked about the room."Oh, Anita," she exclaimed, "what a beautiful\nplace, and what beautiful things you have!"She rubbed the tile floor\nwith her bare foot."Why, Anita dear, it is just like the palaces\nPadre Jose has told me about!"She walked around the room, touching\nthe various toilet articles on the dresser, passing her hands\ncarefully over the upholstered chairs, and uttering exclamations of\nwonder and delight.The woman looked up with a wan smile."_Chiquita_, they are nothing.They are all cheap trinkets--nothing compared with what there is in\nthe big world beyond us.You poor dear, you have lived all your life\nin miserable little Simiti, and you haven\'t the slightest idea of what\nthere is in the world!""But, Anita dear, Simiti is beautiful," the girl protested.You have seen only this poor room, and you think it wonderful.I have\nbeen to Barranquilla and Cartagena with Padre Diego, and have seen\nhouses a thousand times more beautiful than this.And yet, even those\nare nothing to what there is in the world outside."Carmen went to the bed and passed her hand over the white counterpane."Anita--why, is this--is this your--"\n\n"Yes, _chiquita_, it is my bed.You have never seen a real bed, poor\nlittle thing.""But--" the child\'s eyes were wide with wonder--"it is so soft--you\nsink way into it--oh, so soft--like the heron\'s feathers!I didn\'t\nsleep at all in the canoe--and I am so tired."cried the woman, springing up and clasping the\ngirl in her arms.When he returns, he may come\nright up here!_Santa Maria_, help me!--what shall I do?""Anita--let me sleep in your bed--it is so soft--but--" looking down\ndubiously at her muddy feet.The woman\'s face had set in grim determination.She went to the dresser and took out a small stiletto, which she\nquickly concealed in the bosom of her dress."Get right in, just as you\nare!I will take care of Diego, if he comes!_Santa Maria_, I will--"\n\n"Anita dear," murmured the girl, sinking down between the white\nsheets, "you and I will just _know_ that God is everywhere, and\nthat He will take care of us, and of Padre Diego too."With a sigh\nof contentment the child closed her eyes."Anita dear," she\nwhispered softly, "wasn\'t He good to bring me right to you?And\nto-morrow we will go back to Simiti--and to padre Rosendo--and Padre\nJose--and--and Cantar-las-horas--you haven\'t seen him for such a long\ntime--such a long--long--Anita dear, I--love--you--"\n\nThe child dropped asleep, just as a heavy step fell outside the door.Ana sprang up and extinguished the lamp, then went quickly out into\nthe rotunda.Padre Diego was standing on the top step, puffing and\nweaving unsteadily.The woman hurried to him and passed an arm about\nhis waist.she exclaimed in a tone of feigned solicitation."I feared you\nhad met with an accident!My heart beats like the patter of rain!Why\ndo you stay out so late and cause me worry?"The bloated face of the man leered like a Jack-o\'-lantern."Spiritual\nretreat, my love--spiritual retreat," he muttered thickly."Imbibing\nthe spirits, you know."The woman gave him a look of inexpressible disgust."But you are home\nsafe, at any rate," she said in a fawning voice; "and my fear is\nquieted.Come now, and I will help you into bed.she\ncried, as he lurched toward the door of the room where Carmen lay; "in\nyour own room to-night!"He swayed to and fro before her, as she stood with her back against\nthe door."_Nombre de Dios_!"he muttered, "but you grow daily more unkind to\nyour good Padre!_Bien_, it is well that I have a fresh little\nhousekeeper coming!"He made again as if to enter the room.The woman\nthrew her arms about his neck."Padre dear," she appealed, "have you ceased to love your Anita?She\nwould spend this night alone; and can you not favor her this once?"he croaked in peevish suspicion, "but I think you have a\nparamour in there._Bien_, I will go in and shrive his wicked soul!"cried the desperate woman, her hand\nstealing to the weapon concealed in her dress."Pepito came this\nevening with the case of _Oporto_ which you ordered long ago from\nSpain.I put it in your study, for I knew you would want to sample it\nthe moment you returned."he cried, turning upon her, "why do you not tell me\nimportant things as soon as I arrive?I marvel that you did not wait\nuntil morning to break this piece of heavenly news!_Bien_, come to\nthe study, and you shall open a bottle for me.but my throat\nis seared with Don Antonio\'s vile rum!My parched soul panteth for the\nwine of the gods that flows from sunny Spain!_Caramba_, woman, give\nyourself haste!"Suffering himself to be led by her, he staggered across the rotunda\nand into the room where long before he had entertained for a brief\nhour Don Jorge and the priest Jose.Ana quickly broke the neck of a\nbottle of the newly arrived wine and gave him a generous measure.murmured the besotted priest, sinking into a\nchair and sipping the beverage; "it is the nectar of Olympus--triple\ndistilled through tubes of sunlight and perfumed with sweet airs and\nthe smiles of voluptuous _houris_!Ah, Lord above, you are good to\nyour little Diego!Another sip, my lovely Ana--and bring me the\ncigarettes.And come, fat lass, do you sit beside me and twine your\ngraceful arms about my neck, while your soft breath kisses my old\ncheek!Ah, _Dios_, who would not be human!the good God may\nkeep His heaven, if He will but give me the earth!"Ana drew his head against her bosom and murmured hypocritical words of\nendearment in his ear, while she kept his glass full.Diego babbled\nlike a child.He nodded; struggled to keep awake; and at length fell\nasleep with his head on her shoulder.Then she arose, and, assured\nthat he would be long in his stupor, extinguished the light and\nhurried to her own room.The woman bent over her with the\nlighted candle and looked long and wistfully.she\nprayed, "if you will but save her, you may do what you will with me!"Tears flowed freely down her cheeks as she turned to the door and\nthrew the bolt.Coming back to the bed, she again bent over the\nsleeping girl._Dios mio_--and that beast, he has seen her, and he would--ah,\n_Dios_!"Going again to the dresser, she took from a drawer a sandalwood\nrosary.Then she returned to the bed and knelt beside the child."Blessed Virgin," she prayed, while her hot tears fell upon the beads,\n"I am lost--lost!Ah, I have not told my beads for many years--I\ncannot say them now!_Santa Virgen_, pray for me--pray for me--and if\nI kill him to-morrow, tell the blessed Saviour that I did it for the\nchild!Ah, _Santa Virgen_, how beautiful she is--how pure--what\nhair--she is from heaven--_Santa Virgen_, you will protect her?""_Madre de Dios_--she is so beautiful, so\npure--"\n\nCarmen moved slightly, and the woman rose hastily from her knees."Anita dear," murmured the child, "Jesus waked Lazarus--out of\nhis--sleep.she murmured when Carmen again\nslept, "I am too wicked to sleep with so pure an angel!--no, I can\nnot!She spread a light shawl upon the tile floor near the window and lay\ndown upon it, drawing a lace _mantilla_ over her face to protect it\nfrom the mosquitoes."_Santa Virgen_", she murmured repeatedly, "pray\nthe blessed Saviour to protect her to-morrow--pray for her, _Madre de\nDios_--pray for her!"*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe piercing shriek of a steamboat whistle roused the woman just as\nthe first harbingers of dawn spread over the river a crimson flush\nthat turned it into a stream of blood.Ana bent\nover her and left a kiss on her forehead.Then she stole out of the\nroom and into the study.Padre Diego lay sunk in his chair like a\nmonster toad.The woman threw him a look of utter loathing, and then\nhastily descended into the _patio_.Ricardo lay under the _platano_\ntree, sleeping heavily."Padre Diego sends\nyou this money, and bids you go.She held out a roll of _pesos_.The man, after much vigorous persuasion, got heavily to his feet."_Caramba, senorita_!""That last\n_tragito_--it was a bit too much, no?But--_Bien_, I would see the\ngood Padre.But, senorita, do me\nthe great favor to ask the good Padre to see me one little moment.He fumbled in his wallet and drew\nout an envelope.He--"\n\n"_Caramba_!"ejaculated the man loudly, as his senses returned."But I\nbelieve there is something wrong here!_Bien_, now I shall see the\nPadre!He pushed the woman aside and entered\nthe house.Ana started after him, and seized his arm.A scuffle ensued, and\nRicardo\'s voice was loud and shrill as they reached the stairs."Ricardo--anything you ask--double the\namount, if you will go!Leave the house--I will tell the Padre--I will\ngive him the letter--"\n\n"_Caramba_, but I will see him myself!"shouted the lightheaded\nRicardo."_Bien,\nenamorada_, is this the paramour whom you hid in your room last night?_Caramba_, you might have chosen a handsomer one!"Ana sank down with a moan and buried her face in her hands.Diego\nheavily descended the stairs."_Bien_, so it is you!"I do not know, Padre," cried the man excitedly."Senorita Ana, she\nmade me drunk last night.I brought the girl--I waited for you, but\nthe senorita--"\n\n"_Caramba_, I understand!"Ana had risen and was making for the stairs.Diego sprang to her and\nseized her by the wrist.With her free hand she drew the stiletto from\nher bosom and raised it to strike.Ricardo saw the movement, and threw\nhimself upon her.cried Diego, as Ricardo felled the woman and wrenched the\nweapon from her grasp."My pretty angel, you have the venom of a\nserpent!did you think to deceive your doting Padre?But--_Dios nos guarde_!"Carmen, awakened by the noise, had left her bed, and now stood at the\nhead of the stairs, looking with dilated eyes at the strange scene\nbeing enacted below.Ana lay on the ground, her eyes strained\ntoward the girl.Ricardo bent over her, awaiting his master\'s command.He knew now that she had forever lost her power over the priest.Diego\nstood like a statue, his eyes riveted upon Carmen.The girl looked\ndown upon them from the floor above with an expression of wonder, yet\nwithout fear.Diego was the first to find his voice.At last you come to your lonely padre!Wait for me, _hermosissima_!"screamed Ana in a\nvoice of horror.Ricardo clapped his hand heavily over her mouth.he panted, feasting his eyes upon her, while a thrill\npassed through his coarse frame."_Madre de Dios_, but you have grown\nbeautiful!Don Mario was right--you are surely the most voluptuous\nobject in human form that has ever crossed my path._Bien_, the\nblessed God is still good to his little Diego!"He started away with her, but was detained by the loud voice of\nRicardo."_Bien_, Padre, my pay!""_Cierto, hombre_!"But--a\nfather\'s joy--ah!_Bien_, come to me to-morrow--"\n\n"_Na, Senor Padre_, but to-day--now!I have risked my life--and I have\na wife and babes!"_Caramba_, ugly beast, but I will consign you to hell!There are more convenient seasons than this for your\nbusiness!"And, still holding tightly to the girl\'s hand, he led her\ninto the study.The woman turned upon Ricardo with the fury of a tiger."This will cost your life, for you have\nput into his dirty hands the soul of an angel, and he will damn it!If you had only taken the money I brought you--"\n\n"Demon-tongue, I will take it now!"He snatched the roll of bills from\nher hand and bolted through the door.With a low moan the woman sank\nto the ground, while oblivion drew its sable veil across her mind.Reaching the study, Diego pushed Carmen into the room and then\nfollowed, closing the door after him and throwing the iron bolt.Turning about, he stood with arms akimbo upon his bulging hips and\ngazed long and admiringly at the girl as she waited in expectant\nwonder before him.A smile of satisfaction and triumph slowly spread\nover his coarse features.Then it faded, and his heavy jowls and deep\nfurrows formed into an expression, sinister and ominous, through which\nlewdness, debauchery, and utter corruption looked out brazenly,\ndefiantly, into the fair, open countenance of the young girl before\nhim.A sense of weariness and dull pain then seemed to follow.He\nshook his heavy head and passed a hand across his brow, as if to brush\naside the confusion left by the previous night\'s potations.he muttered, falling heavily into a chair, "but had\nI known you were here, little rosebud, I should have tried to keep\nsober."He reached out to grasp her; but she eluded him and went\nquickly to the open window, where she stood looking down into the\nstreet below.The morning sunlight, streaming into the room, engulfed\nher in its golden flood and transmuted the child of earth into a\ncreature divinely radiant, despite the torn gown and stains of river\ntravel."_Bien, carisima_," the man wheedled in a small, caressing voice,\n"where is your greeting to your glad padre?he muttered,\nhis eyes roving over her full figure, "but the Virgin herself was\nnever more lovely!Come, daughter," he purred, extending his arms;\n"come to a father\'s heart that now, praise the Saints!shall ache no\nmore for its lost darling."The girl faced about and looked at him for a few moments.What her\nglance conveyed, the man was utterly incapable of understanding.Then\nshe drew up a chair that stood near the window, and sinking into it,\nburied her face in her hands."_Caramba_, my smile of heaven!chirped Diego,\naffecting surprise."Is it thus you celebrate your homecoming?Or are\nthese, perchance, fitting tears of joy?_Bien_, your padre\'s doting\nheart itself weeps that its years of loneliness are at last ended."He\nheld the sleeve of his gown to his eyes and sniffed affectedly."_Bien_, and what then?""I was just knowing," she answered slowly, "that I was not afraid--that\nGod was everywhere, even right here--and that He would not let any\nharm come to me."and you ask Him to protect you from your adoring father!He again held\nout his arms to her."I am not afraid--now," she answered softly."But--I do not think God\nwill let me come to you.If you were really my father, He would."The man\'s mouth gaped in astonishment.A fleeting sense of shame\nswept through his festering mind.Then the lustful meanness of his\ncorrupted soul welled up anew, and he laughed brutally.The idea\nwas delightfully novel; the girl beautifully audacious; the situation\npiquantly amusing.He would draw her out to his further enjoyment."So," he observed parenthetically, "I judge you are on quite familiar\nterms with God, eh?"The joke was excellent, and he roared with mirth.he\ncommented, reaching over and uncorking with shaking hand the bottle\nthat stood on the table.Then, filling a glass, "Suppose you thank Him\nfor sending his little Diego this estimable wine and your own charming\nself, eh?Whereat he guffawed loudly and\nslapped his bulging sides.The girl had already bowed her head again in her hands.Diego\'s beady eyes devoured the beautiful creature before him."_Bien_, little Passion flower," he\ninterrupted, "if you have conveyed to Him my infinite gratitude,\nperhaps He will now let you come to me, eh?""I have thanked\nHim, Padre--for you and for me," she said; "for you, that you really\nare His child, even if you don\'t know it; and for me that I know He\nalways hears me.That was what the good man Jesus said, you know, when\nhe waked Lazarus out of the death-sleep.And so I\nkept thanking Him all the way down the river."Diego\'s eyes bulged as if they would pop from his head, and his mouth\nfell open wide, but no sound issued therefrom.The girl went on\nquietly:\n\n"I was not afraid on the river, Padre.And I was not afraid to come in\nhere with you.I knew, just as the good man Jesus did at the tomb of\nLazarus, that God had heard me--He just couldn\'t be God if He hadn\'t,\nyou know.And then I remembered what the good man said about not\nresisting evil; for, you know, if we resist evil we make it real--and\nwe never, _never_ can overcome anything real, can we?So I resisted\nevil with good, just as Jesus told us to do.I just _knew_ that God\nwas everywhere, and that evil was unreal, and had no power at all.And\nso the _bogas_ didn\'t hurt me coming down the river.And you--you will\nnot either, Padre."Then, very seriously:\n\n"Padre, one reason why I was not afraid to come in here with you was\nthat I thought God might want to talk to you through me, and I could\nhelp you.The man settled back in his chair and stared stupidly at her.His face\nexpressed utter consternation, confusion, and total lack of\ncomprehension.Once he muttered under his breath, "_Caramba_!she is\nsurely an _hada_!"Absorbed in her\nmission, she went on earnestly:\n\n"You know, Padre, we are all channels through which God talks to\npeople--just like the _asequia_ out there in the street through which\nthe water flows.We are all channels for divine love--so Padre Jose\nsays."The priest sat before her like a huge pig, his little eyes blinking\ndully, and his great mouth still agape."We are never afraid of real things, Padre, you know; and so I\ncouldn\'t be afraid of the real \'you,\' for that is a child of God.And\nthe other \'you\' isn\'t real.But such thoughts are not really ours, you know, for they don\'t come\nfrom God.But," she laughed softly, "when I saw you coming up the\nsteps after me this morning--well, lots of fear-thoughts came to\nme--why, they just seemed to come pelting down on me like the rain.I turned right on them, just as I\'ve\nseen Cucumbra turn on a puppy that was nagging him, and I said, \'Here,\nnow, I know what you are; I know you don\'t come from God; and anything\nthat doesn\'t come from God isn\'t really anything at all!\'And so they\nstopped pelting me.The good man Jesus knew, didn\'t he?That\'s why he\nsaid so often, \'Be not afraid.\'"Her big eyes sparkled, and her\nface glowed with celestial light.Diego raised a heavy arm and,\ngroping for the bottle, eagerly drained another glass of wine."You think that wine makes you happy, don\'t you, Padre?"she observed,\nwatching him gulp down the heavy liquor.It just\ngives you what Padre Jose calls a false sense of happiness.And when\nthat false sense passes away--for everything unreal has just _got_ to\npass away--why, then you are more unhappy than you were before.he\nejaculated, "will you rein that runaway tongue!""No, Padre," she replied evenly, "for it is God who is talking to you.You ought to, for you are a priest.You ought to\nknow Him as well as the good man Jesus did.Padre, can you lay your\nhands on the sick babies and cure them?"The man squirmed uncomfortably for a moment, and then broke into\nanother brutal laugh.but we find it easier\nto raise new babies than to cure sick ones!do _hadas_ have such voluptuous bodies, such plump legs!_Madre de Dios_, girl, enough of your preaching!"No, Padre," she answered quietly, "I do not want to come to you.But\nI want to talk to you--"\n\n"_Dios y diablo_!with a Venus before\nme do you think I yearn for a sermon?Daniel went to the office.delay it, delay it--"\n\n"Padre," she interrupted, "you do not see _me._ You are looking only\nat your bad thoughts of me."His laugh resembled the snort of an animal."Yes, Padre--and they are _very_ bad thoughts, too--they don\'t come\nfrom God, and you are _so_ foolish to let them use you the way you do.And you know you see around\nyou only the thoughts that you have been thinking.Why don\'t you think\ngood thoughts, and so see only good things?""Can it be\nthat I don\'t see a plump little witch before me, but only my bad\nthoughts, eh?_Bien_, then," he\ncoaxed, "come to your poor, deluded padre and let him learn that you\nare only a thing of thought, and not the most enchanting little piece\nof flesh that ever caused a Saint to fall!"Her smile had fled, and in its place\nsadness and pity were written large upon her wistful face."Come, my little bundle of thought," he coaxed, holding out his fat,\nhairy arms."No, Padre," the girl answered firmly."_Na_, then, still afraid, eh?""No, Padre; to be afraid would mean that I didn\'t understand God."Then come to me and prove that you do understand Him, eh?"Are\nyou invoking curses on the bald pate of your desolate father?""No, Padre; I am thanking God all the time that He is here, and that\nHe will not let you hurt me."The man\'s lust-inflamed eyes narrowed and the expression on his evil\nface became more sinister.he growled, "will you come\nhither, or must I--"\n\n"No."She shook her head slowly, and her heavy curls glistened in the\nsunlight."No, Padre, God will not let me come to you."Panting and cursing softly, the man got slowly to his feet."_Madre de\nDios_!"he muttered; "then we will see if your God will let me come to\nyou!"Her lips moved rapidly, though no\nsound came from them.They were forming the words of the psalmist, "In\nGod have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto\nme."It was a verse Jose had taught her long since, when his own heart\nwas bursting with apprehension.She turned quickly as if to\nflee.He thrust out his hand and clutched her dress.The flimsy\ncalico, frayed and worn, tore its full length, and the gown fell to\nthe floor.Her white body\nglistened in the clear sunlight like a marble statue._"Por el amor de Dios_!"ejaculated the priest, straightening up and\nregarding her with dull, blinking eyes.Then, like a tiger pouncing\nupon a fawn, he seized the unresisting girl in his arms and staggered\nback to his chair.he exclaimed, holding her with one arm about her\nwaist, and with his free hand clumsily pouring another glass of wine.Bien_, pretty thought,\ndrink with me this thought of wine!"He laughed boisterously at his\ncrude wit, and forced the glass between her lips."I--am not afraid--I am not afraid," she whispered, drinking."It\ncannot hurt me--nor can you.he panted, setting down the glass and mopping his hot\nbrow, as he settled back into the chair again."You--do--not--love--me, Padre!""You have--only a wrong thought--of me--of love--of everything!""_Bien_--but you love me, pretty creature, is it not so?"he mocked,\nholding up her head and kissing her full on the mouth."I--I love the _real_ \'you\'--for that is God\'s image," she murmured,\nstruggling to hold her face away from his fetid breath."But--I do\nnot--love the way that image is--is translated--in your human mind!"he threw himself back and gave noisy vent to his\nrisibility.For the moment the girl seemed to forget that she was in the fell\nclutches of a demon incarnate.Her thought strayed back to little\nSimiti, to Cucumbra, to Cantar-las-horas, to--ah, was _he_ searching\nfor her now?And would he come?--\n\n"It was Padre Jose; he taught me," she whispered sadly.The curse of God blast him, the monkey-faced\n_mozo!You have a new master\nnow to give you a few needed lessons, _senorita mia_, and--"\n\n"Padre Diego!"her tense voice checked further expression of his low\nthought.You have no power to\nharm me, or to teach me anything!She gasped again as his clutch\ntightened about her.He\nroughly drew the girl up on his knees."To be sure He will protect\nyou, my _mariposa._ And He is using me as the channel, you see--just\nas you said a few moments ago, eh?"His rude laugh again echoed\nthrough the room."He is not--using you--at all!""Evil thoughts are--are\nusing you.And all--they can do--is to kill themselves--and you!"Is such a sad fate in store for me, my beautiful\n_hada_?"He chuckled and reached out again for the bottle."Another\nlittle thought of wine, my love.I must remember to tell Don Antonio of this!--_Maldita_!"Struggling to save its\ncontents, he relaxed his hold on Carmen.Like a flash she wormed her\nsupple body out under his arm, slid to the floor, and gained the\nwindow.shrilled Diego, aflame with\nwrath.when I lay these hands again on you--!"Struggling to his feet, he made for the girl.But at the first step\nthe light rug slid along the smooth tiles beneath his uncertain tread.He threw out an arm and sought to grasp the table.But as he did so,\nhis foot turned under him.With a\ngroan the heavy man sank to the floor.For a moment Carmen stood as if dazed.Then the\ngirl picked up her torn dress and approached him carefully."It was\nhis bad thoughts," she whispered; "he slipped on them; they threw him!I knew it--I just _knew_ it!"Passing to one side, she gained the door, threw back the bolt, and\nhurried out into the rotunda.Crouched on the floor, the stiletto\nclasped in her hand, sat Ana, her face drenched with tears, and her\nchest heaving.When she saw the girl she sprang to her feet.I could not save you;\nI could not break through the heavy door; but I can punish him!"She\nburst into a flood of tears and started into the room.cried the girl, throwing herself into the woman\'s arms.He did not hurt me--God would not let him!she whispered in awed tones,\n"did God strike him dead?""I don\'t know, Anita--but come!clinging to the woman\'s skirt;\n"Anita dear, do not go in there!The woman\'s eyes were wild, her hair loose and disheveled.she cried, "but we will make sure that the beast is dead before we\ngo!And if we leave this blade in his heart, it may be a warning to\nothers of his kind!"Your\nmurder-thoughts will kill you if you do!Listen--it is a\nsteamboat whistle!Oh, Anita--if it is going up the river--we can take\nit--"\n\nAna hesitated.He may--"\n\n"Yes, Anita, yes; leave him with God!""Come away, Anita--"\n\n"But where, child?"Why--why, my father would kill me!""No, Anita dear; he loves you; he prays for you; he wants you!It is right--it is just what God has planned, I know!Pin\nmy dress together, and then hurry!"Mechanically she descended the\nstairs and left the house, her hand tightly clasped by Carmen.Dully\nshe suffered herself to be led hurriedly to the river.A boat,\nup-bound, was just docking.The captain stood leaning over the rail\nand shouting his commands.murmured the weeping woman, hurrying up the gang\nplank with the child.She hastened past the astonished passengers to\nthe captain and drew him to one side."The child--" she gasped, "Rosendo Ariza\'s--of Simiti--leave her at\nBadillo--they will take her over--"\n\n"Wait, senora," interrupted the captain tenderly."Is it not time for\nyou to go home, too?"He laid a hand on her shoulder and looked down\ninto her streaming eyes.And, leading them\ndown the deck, he opened the door of a vacant cabin and bade them\nenter."You can tell me your story when we are under way," he said,\nsmiling as he closed the door."_Bien_," he muttered, his brow\nclouding as he strode off."I have been looking for this for some\ntime.But--the child--Ariza\'s--ah, the priest Diego!I think I\nsee--_Caramba_!A few minutes later the big boat, her two long funnels vomiting\ntorrents of smoke and sparks, thrust her huge wheel into the thick\nwaters and, swinging slowly out into mid-stream, turned her flat nose\ntoward the distant falls of Tequendama.In one of her aft cabins a\nwoman lay on a cot, weeping hysterically.Over her bent a girl, with a\nface such as the masters have sought in vain.The tenderly whispered\nwords might have been the lingering echo of those voiced in the little\nmoonlit death-chamber of Cartagena long agone."Anita dear, He is with us, right here.And He says, \'Anita, come!\'"CHAPTER 26\n\n\n"But, Padre dear, why are you so surprised that Padre Diego did not\nhurt me?I would have been much more surprised if he had.You are\nalways so astonished when evil doesn\'t happen--don\'t you ever look for\ngood?Why, I don\'t ever look for anything else!How could I when I\nknow that God is everywhere?""The sense of evil--it overwhelms\nme at times, _carita_--"\n\n"But, Padre dear, why don\'t you know right then that it is nothing?If\nyou did, it would fade away, and only good would overwhelm you."She\nnestled closer to the man and clasped her arms more tightly about his\nneck."Why, Padre," she resumed, "I was not a bit surprised when\nCaptain Julio came and told us we were near Bodega Central, and that\nhe could see you and Juan and Lazaro sitting on the steps of the\ninn.""Yes, _chiquita_, we were resting for a moment.If a down-river boat\ncame by we were going to take it.If not, we expected to go in the\ncanoe.""Padre dear, what did you intend to do in Banco?""Don\'t speak of it, child--we--"\n\n"Juan and Lazaro have knives."I?--_chiquita_--"\n\n"Padre dear, God never fights with knives.Anita had a knife; but God\nwouldn\'t let her use it.I don\'t\nknow what happened to Padre Diego, except that he fell over his wicked\nthoughts.You know, Padre dear, somewhere in the Bible you read to me\nthat \'With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to\nhelp us, and to fight our battles.\'I thought of that when Padre Diego\nhad his arm around me and held me so tight that I could hardly\nbreathe.It was only an arm of flesh, after, all, and it couldn\'t hold\nme.""_Bien_, Padre," interrupted Juan, coming up from the boat, "if we are\nto reach Simiti to-night we must start at once.""_Bueno_, then let us set out," returned Jose, rising.A muffled sob\nreached his ears.He turned to the woman huddled in the shadow of the\ndoor."Come, Ana," he said cheerily; "to-night you will again be home.""No, Padre--I do not go with you.In an instant Carmen\'s arms were around her."When padre\nRosendo sees us, you and me, why--"\n\n"_Carisima_!"The woman\'s tears flowed fast while she hugged the girl\nto her bosom."No--no--he would drive me from his house!I will get work in the _posada_, perhaps.Or Captain Julio\nwill take me to Honda on his next trip, and get me a place--"\n\n"Then we must ask him to get a place for us both," interrupted Carmen,\nsitting calmly down beside her."And think, Anita, how sad padre\nRosendo will be when he sees the men come back without us!"cried the sorrowing\nwoman, rising."You don\'t know what it is--"\n\n"Yes, I do, Anita," returned the girl quickly; "it is nothing--just\nzero--and you can\'t drown it!If it would do any good we would both\njump into the river--that is, if God told us to--wouldn\'t we?But it\ndoesn\'t help any to die, you know, for then we would have it all to do\nover again.""Ana," said Jose, laying a hand on the woman\'s shoulder, "you do not\nunderstand her--neither do I, wholly.But if she tells you to go with\nus to Simiti, why, I think I would go.He took her hand and led her, weeping, but no longer resisting, down\nto the canoe.Carmen followed, dancing like an animated sunbeam."What\nfun, oh, what fun!"she chirped, clapping her hands."And just as soon\nas we get home we will go right up to the _carcel_ and let padre\nRosendo out!""_Na, chiquita_," said Jose, shaking his head mournfully; "we have no\npower to do that.""Well, then, God has," returned the girl, nothing daunted.Juan pushed the heavily laden canoe from its mooring, and set its\ndirection toward Simiti.Silence drew over the little group, and the\nhours dragged while the boat crept slowly along the margin of the\ngreat river.The sun had passed its meridian when the little craft\nturned into the _cano._ To Jose the change brought a most grateful\nrelief.For, though his long residence in Simiti had somewhat inured\nhim to the intense heat of this low region, he had not yet learned to\nendure it with the careless indifference of the natives.Besides, his\nmind was filled with vivid memories of the horrors of his first river\ntrip.And he knew that every future experience on the water would be\ntinged by them.In the shaded _cano_ the sunlight, sifting through the interlocking\nbranches of ancient palms and _caobas_, mellowed and softened into a\nveil of yellow radiance that flecked the little stream with splashes\nof gold.Juan in the prow with the pole labored in silence.At times\nhe stopped just long enough to roll a huge cigar, and to feast his\nbright eyes upon the fair girl whom he silently adored.Lazaro, as\n_patron_, sat in the stern, saturnine and unimpassioned.The woman,\nexhausted by the recent mental strain, dozed throughout the journey.Carmen alone seemed alive to her environment.Every foot of advance\nunfolded to her new delights.She sang; she chirped; she mimicked the\nparrots; she chattered at the excited monkeys.It was with difficulty\nthat Jose could restrain her when her sharp eyes caught the glint of\nbrilliant Passion flowers and orchids of gorgeous hue clinging to the\ndripping trees.she exclaimed, "they are in us, you know.We see our thoughts of them--and lots of people wouldn\'t\nsee anything beautiful about them at all, just because their thoughts\nare not beautiful.Padre, we see--what you said to me once--we see our\ninterpretations of God\'s ideas, don\'t we?That is what I told Padre\nDiego.But--well, he will just _have_ to see some day, won\'t he, Padre\ndear?But now let us talk in English; you know, I haven\'t spoken it\nfor such a long time."What a rare interpretation of the\nmind divine was this child!But he wondered why one so pure and\nbeautiful should attract a mind so carnal as that of Diego.he mused, "it is again that law.Good always stirs up its\nsuppositional opposite.And the most abundant good and the greatest\npurity stir up the most carnal elements of the human mind.The greater the degree of good, the greater the seeming\ndegree of evil aroused.The perfect Christ stirred the hatred of a\nworld.Carmen arouses Diego simply because of her purity.Yet she\nknows that he can not harm her."His eyes met the girl\'s, and she answered his unspoken thought in the\ntongue which she was fast adopting."We _have_ to love him, you know,\nPadre dear."Oh, not the \'him\' that\nthe human mind looks at, but the real \'him,\' you know--the \'him\' that\nis God\'s image.And you know there just isn\'t any other \'him,\' now is\nthere?"murmured Jose, "if I could but keep my thought as\nstraight as she does!""But, Padre dear, your thought _is_ straight.You know, God\'s thought\nis the only thought there really is.Any other thought has the minus\nsign, and so it is zero.If we will always think of the real Padre\nDiego, and love that, why, the unreal one will fade away from our\nthought.""Do you suppose, _chiquita_, that if we love him we will make him\nrepent?"The child pondered the question for a moment.Then:\n\n"Padre, what did you tell me once about the word\'repent\'?""It comes from the Greek word \'_metanoia_.\'""Yes," she reflected; "but what did you say that--"\n\n"Oh, yes, I told you it meant a complete and radical change of\nthought."It was heaven to have this girl before him\nand to drink in the naive expressions of her active mind."Padre dear, when John the baptiser said, \'Repent, for the kingdom of\nheaven is at hand,\' did he mean to tell the people that they must have\na complete change of thought?""_Chiquita_," he answered, "I\nhave no doubt he meant just that.For you have taught me that there\ncan be no salvation without such a complete and radical change.""No," she said with quick emphasis; "for God is mind, you know.And\nHis thought is the only real thought there is or can be.The thoughts\nof mortals are the opposites of His thoughts, and so they are\nillusions, and, like all lies, must pass away.If people want to be\nimmortal, they must think as God thinks, for He is immortal.They must\nstop thinking that there is any power but God.They must stop letting\nin thoughts of sickness, of sin, of wickedness, and all those things\nthat in English you call \'discord.\'God says in the Bible, \'As the\nheavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts higher than your\nthoughts.\'And if we want to be\nlike Him we must think His thoughts."I see, _chiquita_--sometimes very clearly--and\nthen again I don\'t see," he said slowly.she insisted, getting up on her knees and facing him.And if you hold this thought always, why, it\nwill--it will be--"\n\n"Externalized; is that what you are trying to say?"Jesus said, \'As a man thinketh in his heart, so is\nhe.\'""But, Carmen--I-- What you say is doubtless true in essence--but I\nthink you have not grasped it all--there are so many gaps that your\nsimple little system of religion does not fill in--so many great\nquestions that you do not answer.I see, in part--and then, again, I\ndon\'t see at all.And when you were stolen away from Simiti I saw\nnothing but the evil--and it nearly killed me!"The man had always been an\nenigma to her.She could not understand a nature that soared into the\nspiritual empyrean one moment, and in the next fell floundering into\nthe bottomless pit of materialism.The undulating curve which\nmarked the development of the Rincon mind was to her a thing\nincomprehensible."Padre dear," she said at length, a little sadly."When you look at\nthe first chapter in the Bible and read there how God made everything,\nand man in His image, in the image of Mind, you see, and are very\nhappy.But when you go on to the second chapter and read how the Lord\nGod--not God, but the _Lord_ God--made a man of dirt, and how this\ndirt man listened to his false thoughts and fell, why, then you are\nunhappy.Can\'t you see that\none is a story of the real creation; and the other is the human mind\'s\ninterpretation of the creation--an interpretation made according to\nthe way the human mind thinks the creating _ought_ to have been in\nmatter?And the second chapter shows how\nfar the human mind can go--it shows how limited it is.The human mind\ncouldn\'t get any farther than that--couldn\'t make a man out of\nanything but dirt.And\nso it made a creation of its own.It couldn\'t understand God; and so\nit made a Lord God, just like itself.And if you see, can\'t you _stick_ to it and _live_ it, until all\nthe unreal passes away?""I will never cease to try,\n_chiquita_," he said."But we were talking about loving Diego, weren\'t\nwe?Yes, you are right, we must try to love him, for the good Jesus\nsaid we must love our enemies.""But, if we love everybody, then we haven\'t any enemies.You can\'t\nlove a real enemy--and so there aren\'t any real ones.We see in other\npeople only what is in our own thought.If we see evil as real, why,\nthen we will see bad men and women all around us, for we only look at\nour thoughts.But, if we look only at God\'s thoughts--Padre dear, I\ndidn\'t see anything but God\'s thought when Padre Diego had me in his\narms.I knew it wasn\'t real, but was just the human way of looking at\nthings.And I knew that love was the great principle of everything,\nand that it just couldn\'t fail, any more than the principle of algebra\ncould fail to solve my problems.Well," she concluded with a little\nsigh, "it didn\'t.""Dear little girl, you must be patient, very patient, with your\nblundering old Padre Jose.He is groping for the light--"\n\nIn an instant, throwing the canoe into imminent danger of upsetting,\nthe impulsive girl had hurled herself into his lap and clasped her\narms about his neck.Juan and Lazaro by a quick and skillful effort\nkept the craft upright.she cried, "I didn\'t mean to say a word that would\nmake you unhappy--Padre dear, I love you so!Padre, look at your\nlittle girl, and tell her that you love her!"he murmured, "I--I must\nnot--and--yet--_chiquita_--I adore you!"He buried his face in her\nshoulder.Juan made a wry mouth as he looked at the girl in the priest\'s arms.Then he suggested that a separation would more evenly balance the\nboat.Carmen laughed up at him, but slipped down into the keel and sat\nwith her head propped against Jose\'s knees."Padre dear," she said, looking up at him with twinkling eyes, "I\nheard Lazaro say a little while before we started that he had lived\nmany years in Simiti, and that it had always been very quiet until you\ncame.""_Ay de mi!_" sighed Jose."I can readily believe that the whole world\nwas quiet until I entered it.""But, Padre, perhaps you had to come into it to shake it up.""_Chiquita_," he said, "if ever you go out into it, with\nyour radical views regarding God and man; and if the stupid old world\nwill give ear to you, there will be such a shaking up as it has never\nexperienced since--"\n\n"Padre dear," she interrupted, "I am not going out into the world.I\nshall stay in Simiti--with you."He looked down at her, tenderly, wistfully.And then, while her words\nstill echoed through his mind, a great sigh escaped him.Dusk had closed in upon them when the canoe emerged into the quiet\nlake.Huge vampire bats, like demons incarnate, flouted their faces as\nthey paddled swiftly toward the distant town.Soft evening calls\ndrifted across the placid waters from the slumbering jungle.Carmen\'s\nrich voice mingled with them; and Juan and Lazaro, catching the\ninspiration, broke into a weird, uncanny boating song, such as is\nheard only among these simple folk.As they neared the town the song\nof the _bogas_ changed into a series of loud, yodelling halloos; and\nwhen the canoe grated upon the shaly beach, Dona Maria and a score of\nothers were there to welcome the returned travelers.At the sight of Ana, a murmur ran through the crowd."It is Anita, madre dear," Carmen quickly announced, as she struggled\nout of Dona Maria\'s arms and took the confused Ana by the hand.The light of recognition came into Dona Maria\'s eyes.Quietly, and\nwithout demonstration, she went to the shrinking woman and, taking the\ntear-stained face in her hands, impressed a kiss upon each cheek."_Bien_," she said in a low, tender voice, "we have waited long for\nyou, daughter.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe glow of dawn had scarce begun to creep timidly across the arch of\nheaven when Fernando knocked at the portal of Rosendo\'s house and\ndemanded the custody of Carmen."And now, Fernando," demanded the priest, "what new outrage is this?""_Na_, Padre, a thousand\npardons--but it is the order of the Alcalde, and I only obey.But--you\nmay knock me down," he added eagerly, "and then I can return to him\nand say that I could not take the girl, even by force!"The honest\nfellow, ashamed of his mission, hung his head.he cried, "what say the people of Simiti?"They would demand Rosendo\'s release, if\nthere were proof that the girl--"\n\n"Good, then!"Yes, the guard informed him this morning.The Alcalde, you know,\npermits no one to approach the prisoner.""And does he know that Ana is here?""The guard did not tell him, for fear of exciting the old man._Hombre!_ I think there is no one in town who would venture to tell\nRosendo that.""_Bien pues_, Fernando, I think the time has come!Go quietly back and\nsummon every one to a meeting in the town hall at once.Tell them--"\n\n"_Bien_, Padre, I shall know what to tell them.But," anxiously, "Don\nMario has the power to--"\n\n"And we have a greater power," quickly replied the priest, his thought\ndwelling on Carmen.An hour later the town hall was a babel of clacking tongues.Men,\nwomen and children hurried, chattering, to and fro, exchanging diverse\nviews and speculating eagerly on the probable outcome of the meeting.Jose stood before them, with Carmen\'s hand clasped tightly in his.Don\nMario, purple and trembling with rage, was perched upon a chair,\nvainly trying to get the ear of the people.In the midst of the hubbub a hush fell suddenly over the concourse.All heads turned, and all eyes fastened upon Ana, as she entered the\nroom and moved timidly toward Jose.The people fell back to make a\npassage for her.Her shoulders were bent, and her face was covered\nwith a black _mantilla_.Don Mario, as his glance fell upon her, again attempted to address the\nmultitude.A strong arm from behind\npushed him from the chair.His craven heart began to quake, and he\ncast anxious glances toward the single exit.Gently removing the _mantilla_ from the face of the woman, Jose turned\nher toward the people.he said in a loud, penetrating\nvoice, "behold the work of Diego!"He paused for the effect which he knew would be made upon this\nimpressionable people.Then, when the loud murmur had passed, he drew\nCarmen out before him and, pointing to her, said dramatically, "And\nshall we also throw this innocent child to the wolf?"Fists were shaken under the Alcalde\'s\nnose, and imprecations were hurled at him from all sides.Don Mario\ndrew his soiled handkerchief and mopped his steaming brow.Then his\nvoice broke out in a shriek: "The soldiers--this day I shall summon\nthem--it is a riot!""_Caramba!_ He speaks truth!"_Caramba!_ Let Diego have his child!""_\n\n"Who says it is not his?"Clasping Jose\'s arm to steady herself, she had turned to\nconfront the excited assembly.Then:\n\n"The priest Diego had a child--a girl.Her name--it was--Carmen."_Caramba!_ girl, how know you that?""I know, because I--was--its--mother!"Pandemonium burst upon the room at the woman\'s words.Don Mario\nstarted for the door, but found his way blocked.he shouted; "and this girl is one of them!""I have lived with him eight\nyears!I know from his own lips that I speak the truth!"We will write to the President at Bogota!"_Caramba!_ Such an Alcalde!""Let him send for the soldiers, if he wishes to die!"As a unit the fickle people streamed from the room and started for the\njail.Don Mario was borne along on the heaving tide.Jose and Carmen\nfollowed; but Ana fell back and returned to the house of Rosendo.The guard at the jail, seeing the concourse approaching, threw down\nhis _machete_ and fled.Rosendo\'s eyes were big with speculation,\nthough his heart beat apprehensively.The people jammed into the small\nhut until it swayed and threatened to collapse."The key to the lock--_Caramba_!Juan quickly produced a long iron bar, and with a few lusty efforts\nsprung the stocks.A dozen hands lifted the cramped Rosendo out and\nstood him upon his feet.Carmen squirmed through the crowd and threw\nherself into his arms.Then, with shouts and gesticulations, a triumphal procession quickly\nformed, and the bewildered and limping Rosendo was escorted down the\nmain street of the town and across the _plaza_ to his home.At the\ndoor of the house Jose turned and, holding up a hand, bade the people\nquietly disperse and leave the liberated man to enjoy undisturbed the\nsacred reunion with his family.With a parting shout, the people\nmelted quickly away, and quiet soon reigned again over the ancient\ntown."_Bien_, Padre," said Rosendo, pausing before his door to clasp anew\nthe priest\'s hand, "you have not told me what has caused this.Was it\nthe little Carmen--"\n\nHe stopped short.Glancing in at the door, his eyes had fallen upon\nAna.To Jose, hours seemed suddenly compressed into that tense\nmoment.Slowly Rosendo entered the house and advanced to the shrinking woman.Terror spread over her face, and she clutched her throat as the big\nman stalked toward her.Then, like a flash, Carmen darted in front of\nher and faced Rosendo."It is Anita, padre dear," she said, looking up into his set face, and\nclasping his hand in both of hers."_Bien_, outcast, is your lover with you, that I may strangle him,\ntoo?"cried Carmen, putting both her hands against him.snarled the angry man, still addressing the cowering\nwoman."Did you tire of him, that you now sneak home?as Ana rose and stood before him, "you come here that your illegal\nbrat may be born!he shouted, raising his clenched\nfist as if to strike her.Carmen turned swiftly and threw herself upon the woman.Looking over\nher shoulder, she addressed the raging man:\n\n"Padre Rosendo!He only lets you\nhave it, because He is good to you!Shame on you, for daring to drive\nAnita away--your own little girl!"Her voice rose shrill, and her\nwords cut deep into the old man\'s embittered heart."Shame on you, padre Rosendo!""If\nGod were like you He would drive you from the house, too!Are you so\nmuch better than the good Jesus that you can drive away a woman who\nsins?Are you better than the good father who was\nso glad to see his prodigal son?If God were to punish you for your\nsins, would He even let you live?Did He not set you free this very\nmorning?And do you now thank Him by driving your little girl from her\nown home?Do you know that it was Anita who made you free, and who\nbrought me here?And is this the way you\nthank Him?Then you will lose us both, for we will not stay with\nyou!"Jose stepped up and took Rosendo\'s arm.Carmen turned about and\ncontinued her scoriation:\n\n"Padre Rosendo, if the good, pure God was willing to use Anita to save\nme from Padre Diego and bring me back to you, are you so wicked and so\nungrateful that you throw His love back in His face?"_Caramba!_" cried Rosendo, tears bursting from his eyes."She has\nfouled my name--it was a good name, though my parents were slaves--it\nwas a good name--and she blackened it--she--"\n\n"Padre Rosendo, there are only two names that have never been\nblackened!Your human name is nothing--it is zero--it counts for\nfoolishness with God!You yourself are making your name blacker now\nthan Anita ever did!She repents, and comes to her father; and he is\nso much more wicked than she that he drives her out!--"\n\n"Enough, Carmen, child!""Come, Rosendo; go into the\nparish house!Then a smile lighted up her face, and she reached up\nand took Rosendo\'s hand.Together they passed silently out and into\nthe priest\'s house.Ana sank to the floor, where she buried her face in her hands and wept\nviolently."Wait, Ana," said Jose, tenderly stroking the unhappy woman\'s hair.And you shall remain here, where you\nbelong."Then Jose, wondering, went quietly to the door of\nhis house and looked in.Rosendo sat at the table, with Carmen on his\nknees."And, padre," the child was saying, "the good Jesus told the woman not\nto sin any more; and she went away happy.Padre, God has told Anita\nnot to sin any more--and she has come to us to be happy.We are going\nto make her so, aren\'t we?Padre Diego couldn\'t hurt me, you know, for\nGod wouldn\'t let him.And he hasn\'t hurt Anita--God wouldn\'t let him\nkeep her--wouldn\'t let her stay with him.And we\nhave got to be like Him--we _are_ like Him, really.But now we have\ngot to show it, to prove it, you know."Rosendo\'s head was bent over the girl.The\nchild went on with increased animation:\n\n"And, padre dear, God sends us Anita\'s little baby for us to love and\nprotect.Oh, padre, if the little one is a boy, can\'t we call it\nJose?""Yes, _chiquita_," Jose heard the old man murmur brokenly."And--padre, if it is a girl--what shall we call it?""We--we will call it--Carmencita,"\nhe whispered."Can\'t you see, padre, that God sends us\nAnita\'s baby so that Padre Diego shall not have it?And now let\'s go\nand tell her so, right away!"Jose slipped quickly back and stood beside the woman when Carmen and\nRosendo entered the room.The old man went directly to his daughter,\nand, taking her in his brawny arms, raised her from the floor and\nstrained her to his breast.Tears streamed down his swart cheeks, and\nthe words he would utter choked and hung in his throat."Padre," whispered the delighted child, "shall I tell her our names\nfor the baby?"Divine Love was there, and\nits dazzling effulgence blinded him.In the quiet of his own chamber\nhe sought to understand the marvelous goodness of God to them that\nserve Him.CHAPTER 27\n\n\nThe reversal of a life-current is not always effected suddenly, nor\namid the din of stirring events, nor yet in an environment that we\nourselves might choose as an appropriate setting.It comes in the\nfullness of time, and amid such scenes as the human mind which\nundergoes the transformation may see externalized within its own\nconsciousness by the working of the as yet dimly perceived laws of\nthought.Perhaps some one, skilled in the discernment of mental laws and their\nsubtle, irresistible working, might have predicted the fate which\novertook the man Jose, the fulsome details of which are herein being\nrecounted.Perhaps such a one might say in retrospect that the\nculmination of years of wrong thinking, of false beliefs closely\ncherished, of attachment to fear, to doubt, and to wrong concepts of\nGod, had been externalized at length in eddying the man upon this far\nverge of civilization, still clinging feebly to the tattered fragments\nof a blasted life.But it would have been a skilled prognostician,\nindeed, who could have foreseen the renewal of this wasted life in\nthat of the young girl, to whom during the past four years Jose de\nRincon had been transferring his own unrealized hopes and his vast\nlearning, but without the dross of inherited or attached beliefs, and\nwithout taint of his native vacillation and indecision of mind.For what he had been striving to fit her, he knew not.But in a\nvaguely outlined way he knew that he was being used as a tool to shape\nin some degree the mental development of this strange girl.Nor,\nindeed, as the years passed, did she continue to seem so strange to\nhim.On the contrary, he now thought it more marvelous by far that the\nworld, after nineteen centuries of Christianity, did not think and act\nmore as did this girl, whose religious instruction he knew to have\nbeen garnered at the invisible hand of God.That she must some day\nleave him, despite her present earnest protestations, he felt to be\ninevitable.And the thought pierced his soul like a lance.But he\ncould not be certain that with maturity she would wish to remain\nalways in the primitive environment in which she had been nurtured.Nor could he, even if she were willing, immolate her upon the barb of\nhis own selfishness.As for himself, the years had but seemed to increase the conviction\nthat he could never leave the Church, despite his anomalous position\nand despite his renewed life--unless, indeed, she herself cast him\nforth.Each tenderly hopeful letter from his proud, doting mother only\nadded to this conviction by emphasizing the obstacles opposing such a\ncourse.Her declining years were now spent among the mental pictures\nwhich she hourly drew upon the canvas of her imagination, pictures in\nwhich her beloved son, chastened and purified, had at length come into\nthe preferment which had always awaited loyal scions of the house of\nRincon.Hourly she saw the day draw nearer when he should be restored\nto her yearning arms.Each dawn threw its first rays upon his\nportrait, which hung where her waking eyes might open upon it.Each\nnight the shadow cast by the candle which always burned beneath it\nseemed to her eager sight to crown that fair head with a bishop\'s\nmitre--a cardinal\'s hat--aye, at times she even saw the triple crown\nof the Vicar of Christ resting upon those raven locks.If her own pen did not always correctly delineate her towering hopes,\nhis astute uncle did not fail to fill in whatever hiatus remained.And\nthe pressure of filial devotion and pride of race at times completely\nsmothered within him the voice of Truth which Carmen continually\nsounded, and made him resolve often that on the day when she should\nleave him he would bury his head in the lap of Mother Church and\nsubmit without further resistance to the sable veil of assumed\nauthority which he knew she would draw across his mind.Convincing as\nwere the proofs which had come to him of the existence of a great\ndemonstrable principle which the Christ had sought to make a dull\nworld recognize, nevertheless he had as yet failed to rise permanently\nabove the mesmerism of human belief, which whispered into his\nstraining ears that he must not strive to progress beyond his\nunderstanding, lest, in the attempt to gain too rapidly, he lose all.To sink into the arms of Mother Church and await the orderly\nrevelation of Truth were less dangerous now than a precipitate\nseverance of all ties and a launching forth into strange seas with an\nuntried compass.True, they\nreasoned, he had seemed to see the working of mental law in his own\nrestoration to health when he had first come to Simiti.He had seemed\nto see Rosendo likewise restored.But these instances, after all,\nmight have been casual.That Carmen had had aught to do with them, no\none could positively affirm.True, he had seen her protected in\ncertain unmistakable ways.But--others were likewise protected, even\nwhere there had been no thought of an immanent, sheltering God.True,\nthe incident of the epidemic in Simiti two years before had impressed\nupon him the serious consequences of fear, and the blighting results\nof false belief.But he could not hope\nsuddenly to empty his mentality of its content of human thought; nor\ndid wisdom advise the attempt.He had at first tried to rise too\nrapidly.His frequent backsliding frightened and warned him.Thus, while the days sped by, did the priest\'s thought ebb and flow.As morn broke, and the gallant sun drove the cowardly shadows of night\nacross the hills, his own courage rose, and he saw in Carmen the pure\nreflection of the Mind which was in Christ Jesus.As night fell, and\ndarkness slunk back again and held the field, so returned the legion\nof fears and doubts that battled for his soul.Back and forth in the\narena of his consciousness strove the combatants, while he rushed\nirresolutely to and fro, now bearing the banner of the powers of\nlight, now waving aloft, though with sinking heart, the black flag of\nthe carnal host.For a while after his arrival in Simiti he had seemed\nto rise rapidly into the consciousness of good as all-in-all.But the\nstrain which had been constantly upon him had prevented the full\nrecognition of all that Carmen saw, and each rise was followed by a\nfall that left him for long periods immersed in despair.Following the return of Carmen and the ripple of excitement which her\nabduction had spread over the wonted calm of Simiti, the old town\nsettled back again into its accustomed lethargy, and Jose and the girl\nresumed their interrupted work.From Ana it was learned that Diego had\nnot voiced the command of Wenceslas in demanding the girl; and when\nthis became known the people rose in a body to her support.Don Mario,\nthough he threatened loudly, knew in his heart he was beaten.He knew,\nlikewise, that any further hostile move on his part would result in a\ndemand by the people for his removal from office.He therefore retired\nsulking to the seclusion of his _patio_, where he sat down patiently\nto await the turn of events.Rosendo, his great heart softened toward his erring daughter, again\nrejoiced in the reunion of his broken family circle.But his soul\nburned within him as, day after day, he saw Ana move silently about\nlike a sorrow incarnate.At times, when perchance he would come upon\nher huddled in a corner and weeping quietly, he would turn away,\ncursing deeply and swearing fulsome vengeance upon the lecherous beast\nwho had wrought her ruin."Padre," he one day said to Jose, "I shall kill him--I know it.The\ngirl\'s suffering is breaking my heart.He is like an evil cloud\nhanging always over my family.I hate him, as the devil\nhates the light!And Jose offered\nno remonstrance, for the case lay not in his hands.Carmen again entered upon her interrupted studies with ardent\nenthusiasm.And her first demand was that she be allowed to plunge\ninto a searching study of the Bible."Padre," she exclaimed, "it is a\nwonderful book!Why--do the people in the world know what a book this\nis?For if they did, they would never be sick or unhappy again!"Here it is--the\nwhole thing!\'Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man\nhis _thoughts_.\'But--don\'t the people know what that means?""Well, _chiquita_, and what does it mean?""Why--the unrighteous man is the man who thinks wrong thoughts--thoughts\nof power opposed to God--thoughts of sin, of sickness, of accidents,\nand all sorts of evil things--beliefs that these things are real, and\nthat God made or caused them!""_Bien_, and you think the Bible speaks truth?"Why, it says right here that it is given\nby inspiration!That means that the men or women who wrote it thought\nGod\'s thoughts!""No, but that those who wrote it were--well, were cleaner window-panes\nthan other people--that they were so clean that the light shone\nthrough them better than it did through others.""And what do you think now about Jesus?""Why, as you once said, that he was the very cleanest window-pane of\nall!"From that hour the Bible was the girl\'s constant companion.Daily she\npored over it, delighted, enraptured.Jose marveled at her immediate\nspiritual grasp.Instead of the world\'s manner of looking upon it as\nonly a collection of beautiful promises and admonitions, she saw\nwithin it the statement of a principle that offered itself as a mighty\ntool with which to work out humanity\'s every-day problems here and\nnow.From the first she began to make out little lists of collated\nscriptural verses, so arranging them that she could read in them a\ncomplete expression of an idea of God.These she would bring to Jose\nand, perching herself upon his lap, would expound them, to her own\ngreat delight and the wonder of the man who listened."See, Padre," she said, holding up one of these lists, "it says that\n\'in that day\' whatever we ask of him will be given to us.Well, \'that\nday\' means when we have washed our window-panes clean, and the light\nshines through so clear that we can ask in His name.It means when we\nhave stopped saying that two and two are seven.""Which means," Jose interpolated, "asking in his character.""Yes," she replied, "for then we will be just like him.And then\nwhatever we ask \'believing\' will be given to us, for believing\'\nwill then be \'understanding,\' will it not?When we know--really\n_know_--that we have things, why--why, we have them, that\'s all!"She did not wait for his reply, but went on enthusiastically:\n\n"You know, Padre, in order to be like him we have got to\'seek first\nthe kingdom of God and His righteousness\'--His right-thinking.Well,\nJesus said the kingdom of God was within us.Of course it is, for it\nis all a question of right-thinking.When we think right, then our\nright thoughts will be--what you said--"\n\n"Externalized," he supplied.We will see them all around us, instead of seeing, as we do now,\na lot of jumbled-up thoughts of good and evil which we call people and\nthings.And then will be the time when\n\'God shall wipe away all tears.\'It is, as you say in English, \'up to\nus\' to bring this about.It is not for God to do it at all.Don\'t you\nsee that He has already done His part?He has made everything, and\n\'behold it was very good.\'Well, He doesn\'t have to do it all over\nagain, does He?But we have got to wash our windows clean and let\nin the light that comes from Him.That light comes from Him all the\ntime, just as the beams come from the sun, without ever stopping.We\nnever have to ask the sun to shine, do we?And neither do we have to\nask God to be good to us, nor tell Him what we think He ought to do\nfor us.We only have to _know_ that He is good, to us and to\neverything, all the time.""Yes, _chiquita_, we must be truly baptised.""That is what it means to be baptised, Padre--just washing our\nwindow-panes so clean that the light will come in.""And that light, little one, is truth.It certainly is a new way of\nlooking at it, at least, _chiquita_.""But, Padre, it is the _only_ way," she persisted."_Bien_, I would not say that you were mistaken, Carmen.""No, Padre, for we can prove it.And, look here," she continued,\nreferring to her list."If the kingdom of heaven is within us, then\neverything that comes to us in life comes from within, and not from\nwithout.And so, things never happen, do they?"I see," he replied seriously, "that from the mouths of babes and\nsucklings comes infinite wisdom.""Well, Padre dear, wisdom is God\'s light, and it comes through any one\nwho is clean.It doesn\'t make any difference how old or young that\nperson is."How can you say that, _chiquita_?""Why, Padre, is God old?""Well, the unreal \'we\' is already zero.Didn\'t you yourself say that\nthe human, mortal man was a product of false thought, thought that was\nthe opposite of God\'s thought, and so no thought at all?Didn\'t you\nsay that such thought was illusion--the lie about God and what He has\nmade?Then isn\'t the human \'we\' zero?""Well--but--_chiquita_, it is often hard for me to see anything but\nthis sort of \'we,\'" returned the man dejectedly.she entreated, "why will you not try to look at something\nelse than the human man?Look at God\'s man, the image of infinite\nmind.You have _got_ to do it, you know, some time.He\nsaid that every man would have to overcome.That means turning away\nfrom the thoughts that are externalized as sin and sickness and evil,\nand looking only at God\'s thoughts--and, what is more, _sticking to\nthem_!""Yes," dubiously, "I suppose we must some time overcome every belief\nin anything opposed to God.""Well, but need that make you unhappy?It is just because you still\ncling to the belief that there is other power than God that you get so\ndiscouraged and mixed up.Why, I would try\nit even if a whole mountain fell on me!"And Jose could but clasp the earnest girl in his arms and vow that he\nwould try again as never before.*       *       *       *       *\n\nMeantime, while Jose and his little student-teacher were delving into\nthe inexhaustible treasury of the Word; while the peaceful days came\ninto their lives and went out again almost unperceived, the priest\nDiego left the bed upon which he had been stretched for many weeks,\nand hobbled painfully about upon his scarcely mended ankle.While a\nprisoner upon his couch his days had been filled with torture.Try as\nhe might, he could not beat down the vision which constantly rose\nbefore him, that of the beautiful girl who had been all but his.He\ncursed; he raved; he vowed the foulest vengeance.And then he cried\npiteously, as he lay chained to his bed--cried for something that\nseemed to take human shape in her.He protested that he loved her;\nthat he adored her; that without her he was but a blasted cedar.Only Don\nAntonio was found low enough in thought to withstand the flow of foul\nlanguage which issued from the baffled Diego\'s thick lips while he\nmoved about in attendance upon the unhappy priest\'s needs.Then came from the acting-Bishop, Wenceslas, a mandate commissioning\nDiego upon a religio-political mission to the interior city of\nMedellin.The now recovered priest smiled grimly when he read it."Prepare yourself, _amigo_," he said, "for a work of the Lord.You accompany me as far as Badillo, where we\ndisembark for stinking Simiti.And, _amigo_, do you secure a\ntrustworthy companion.Meantime, my blessing\nand absolution."Then he sat down and despatched a long letter to Don Mario.CHAPTER 28\n\n\n"Rosendo," said Jose one morning shortly thereafter, as the old man\nentered the parish house for a little chat, "a Decree has been issued\nrecently by the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office whereby,\ninstead of the cloth scapulary which you are wearing, a medal may be\nsubstituted."_Cierto_, Padre--but," he hesitated, "is the new one just as--"\n\n"To be sure, _amigo_.But I\nhave arranged it to wear about the neck."Rosendo knelt reverently and crossed himself while Jose hung the new\nscapulary over his head."_Caramba!_" he\nexclaimed, rising, "but I believe this one will keep off more devils\nthan that old cloth thing you made for me!"admonished Jose, repressing a smile, "did I not bless\nthat one before the altar?""_Cierto_, Padre, and I beg a thousand pardons.It was the blessing,\nwasn\'t it?But this one," regarding it reverently,\n"this one--"\n\n"Oh, yes, this one," put in Jose, "carries the blessing of His Grace,\nacting-Bishop Wenceslas.""And a Bishop is always very holy, is he not, Padre?""It makes no difference who he is, for the office makes him holy, is\nit not so, Padre?""Oh, without doubt," returned Jose, his thought reverting to the\nlittle Maria and the babe which for four years he had been supporting\nin distant Cartagena."_Na_, Padre," remonstrated Rosendo, catching the insinuation, "we\nmust not speak ill of the Bishop, lest he be a Saint to-morrow!But,\nPadre," he went on, changing the topic, "I came to tell you that Don\nLuis has given me a contract to cut wood for him on the island._Hombre!_ I shall earn much money by its terms.I set\nout to-morrow morning before daybreak."The man\'s words aroused within him a faint suspicion.Don Luis and the Alcalde were boon companions.Jose wondered if in\nthis commission he could see the gloved hand of Don Mario.But he gave\nno hint of his thought to Rosendo.The next morning, long before sun-up, a mist lay thick over the\nvalley, so thick that Rosendo, as he made his way down to the lake,\nscarce could distinguish the road ahead of him.The dry season had\npassed, and the rains were now setting in.As he hurried along, the\nold man mused dubiously on the contract which Don Luis had made with\nhim.To cut wood in the rainy season!--but, after all, that was no\nconcern of his.And yet--why had Padre Jose grown suddenly quiet when\nhe learned of the contract yesterday?His bare feet fell softly upon\nthe shales, and he proceeded more cautiously as he neared the water\'s\nedge."_Hombre!_" he muttered, striving to penetrate the mist; "only a\n_loco_ ventures out on the lake in such weather!"He reached the boat, and placed in it the rope and axe which he had\nbrought.Then, still troubled in thought, he sat down on the edge of\nthe canoe and dropped into a puzzled meditation.But fishermen do not go out on the lake in dense\nfogs, he remembered.Then through the mist loomed the thick body of a man.Straining his\neyes, Rosendo recognized Padre Diego.With a bound the old man was upon his feet.His thick arm shot out\nlike a catapult; and his great fist, meeting Diego squarely upon the\ntemple, felled him like an ox.For a moment Rosendo stood over the prostrate priest, like a lion\nabove its prey.Then he reached into the canoe and drew out the axe.Holding it aloft, he stood an instant poised above the senseless man;\nthen with a mighty swing he whirled about and hurled it far out into\nthe lake.Incoherent\nmuttering issued from his trembling lips.He looked about in\nbewilderment.He took the rope from\nthe boat and quickly bound Diego hand and foot.This done, he picked\nup the unconscious priest and tossed him into the canoe as if he had\nbeen a billet of wood.Jumping in after him, he hastily pushed off\nfrom the shore and paddled vigorously in the direction of the island.Why he was doing this he had not the faintest idea.It was all the work of a few seconds; yet when his reason came again\nRosendo found himself far out in the thick fog, and his prisoner\nmoaning softly as consciousness slowly returned.The sense of\ndirection which these sons of the jungle possess is almost infallible,\nand despite the watery cloud which enveloped him, the old man held his\ncourse undeviatingly toward the distant isle, into the low, muddy\nshore of which his boat at length forced its way under the impulse of\nhis great arms.The island, a low patch a few acres in extent, lay far out in the lake\nlike a splotch of green paint on a plate of glass.Its densely wooded\nsurface, rising soft and oozy only a few feet above the water, was\ndestitute of human habitation, but afforded a paradise for swarms of\ncrawling and flying creatures, which now scattered in alarm at the\napproach of these early visitors coming so unexpectedly out of the\nheavy fog.When the canoe grounded, Rosendo sprang out and pulled it well up into\nthe mud.Then he lifted the priest out and staggered into the thick\nbrush, where he threw his burden heavily upon the ground.Leaving his\nprisoner for a moment, he seized his _machete_ and began to cut back\ninto the brush.Returning\nto the now conscious Diego, he grasped the rope which bound him and\ndragged him along the newly opened trail into a little clearing which\nlay beyond.There he propped him up against a huge cedar.As he did\nthis, Diego\'s mouth opened wide and a piercing scream issued.The cry echoed dismally across the desolate island.In an instant\nRosendo was upon him, with his knife clutched in his fist."Repeat\nthat, _cayman_," he cried furiously, "and this finds your wicked\nheart!"The craven Diego shook with fear; but he fell silent before the threat\nof the desperate man into whose hands he had so unwittingly fallen.Rosendo stepped back and stood before his captive, regarding him\nuncertainly.Diego\'s quick intuition did not fail to read the old\nman\'s perplexity; and his own hope revived accordingly.It was a\npretty trick, this of Rosendo\'s--but, after all, he would not dare too\nmuch.He even smiled unctuously\nat his captor."_Bien, amigo_," he said at length, "is this your customary reception\nto visitors in your village?_Caramba!_ but what will the good Bishop\nsay when he learns that you have thus mistreated his trusted agent?"His thought was confused, and\nit moved slowly.In the cries of the disturbed birds he seemed now to\nhear the warning voice of Carmen.In the watery vapor that rolled over\nhim he seemed to feel the touch of her soft, restraining hand."_Bien, compadre_," purred Diego, "would it not be well for you to\nloosen this bit of thread, that we may make our way back to the\nvillage?_Caramba!_ but it cuts sore--and I am soft, my friend, for I\nhave been ill.""What made you ill, _cayman_?"he\nshouted, drawing nearer to the shrinking Diego and shaking a great\nfist in his face._Caramba!_ I would that\nyour illness had carried you off and saved me the task of sending you\ndown to purgatory!""But--Rosendo--_caro amigo_,\nlet us reason together!Ah, _compadre_--loosen but a little this rope\nwhich cuts into my tender skin as your bitter words do into my soul!""_Na_, vulture, but you will drown more quickly thus!"retorted\nRosendo, his huge frame trembling with agitation.But the man before him was an ignorant _peon_.It was not the first time that he had set his own wit against\nanother\'s brute strength.The ever-present memory of the girl\nbecame more vivid."You see only your thoughts of me--and they are very bad!"Was he\nseeing now only his own bad thoughts?But she had said they were\nunreal.And this episode--_Hombre!_ he would not be afraid.His\nthought was vastly more powerful than that of a simple _peon_!"But, _amigo_," he resumed gently, "if you had wished to drown me, why\ndid you bring me here?But--ah, well, I have long been prepared to go.I have been sadly misunderstood--disbelieved--persecuted!Ah, friend\nRosendo, if you could know what I do--but--_Bien_, it is of no\nconsequence now.Come, then, good fellow, despatch me quickly!Diego ceased talking and began to murmur\nprayers.The wind was being taken from his\nsails.Diego noted the effect, and resumed his speech.His voice was\nlow and soft, and at times great tears rolled down his cheeks."Rosendo, friend, I wish to go.And yet, I grieve that you must tarnish yours with my\nblood.But," his eyes brightening and his tone becoming more\nanimated, "Rosendo, I will pray the blessed Virgin for you.When I am\nwith her in paradise I will ask her to beg the gentle Saviour to\nforgive you._Bien_, good friend, we shall all be together in heaven\nsome day."He started his orisons again, and soon was praying like a\nlocomotive: "_Ora pro nobis!Santa Maria, ora pro nobis!_"\n\nHe stopped and sighed gently."Rosendo--I must say this before I die--I came to Simiti to see you.I\nwas approaching the boat to hold converse with you.But, you struck\nme--there, _que importa_!And yet--it was about the gentle Ana, your\nbeautiful daughter--But, wait, Rosendo--God above!hear me through--"\n\nRosendo had started again toward him."Good friend, hear me first, then kill me quickly, for I much desire\nto go to my home above!"The impression must be\nmade upon Rosendo at once, or all was lost.The wily priest knew the\n_peon_ mind."_Bien_, good friend, you have misunderstood me.I--Rosendo--I--you will keep my secret, will you not?Bien, I have\nleft the Church.It was for good reasons that\nGod took me from the priesthood for other work in His field._Bien_,\nthe bonds of celibacy removed, behold!my first thought is for my\nbeautiful Ana.I would render\nlegitimate her unborn child.I would return to her the peace which she\nlost when we became so deeply enamored of each other.Rosendo, I have\ncome to Simiti to lay my life before you--to yield it to the mother of\nmy child--to offer it in future service as a recompense for the\nunhappiness which, the Virgin knows, I did not willingly bring upon\nher, or you!"Rosendo\'s head was now in a whirl.His eyes protruded, and his mouth\nwas agape."But--the little Carmen--" he muttered.friend," said Diego sadly, shaking his head, while he quickly\ngrasped the cue, "I have ceased my endeavors to make you believe that\nshe is my child._Caramba!_ I can only leave it to the blessed Virgin\nto restore her to me when we have both passed the portals of death.""_Caro amigo_," returned Diego gently, "in these last moments I see in\nher the beautiful image of her blessed mother, who was taken from me\nlong before I met and loved your Ana.I await now the reunion which death alone can effect.Drown me not, I pray you,\nbut rather open an artery and let me fall gently asleep here beneath\nthis noble tree."A light came into Rosendo\'s troubled eyes.A cunning smile lurked\nabout his mouth."_Bien pues_, it shall be as you wish, vulture," he replied in a tone\nwhich again struck terror to Diego\'s heart.He drew his knife and\napproached the horrified priest."_Caramba!_" shrieked Diego, shrinking back against the tree."_Hombre!_ you do not intend--"\n\n"Why not, vampire?"returned Rosendo, the sardonic smile spreading\nacross his grim features.But would\nyou go down to hell with murder on your soul?""_Cierto_, carrion!But you go down with a load of\nmurdered souls!""Rosendo--God!--it means hell for eternity to you!""To be sure, dog-meat," calmly replied Rosendo."But hell will be\nheaven to me as I sit forever and hourly remind you of the suffering\nAna and the beautiful Carmen, whom you tried to ruin!Wild thoughts flashed through\nhis mind with lightning speed.A last\nexpedient came to him.He fixed his beady eyes upon Rosendo and\nmuttered: "Coward!you bind a sick man and stick him like a\npig!""We give a deer, a tapir, a jaguar, a chance for its life.But you--coward, you are afraid of a sick man!"_Caramba!_" he cried, "what\nwould you?"He leaped to the sitting man and at a stroke severed his\nbonds."_Bien_, spew of the vampire!Diego extended his empty hands, palms up."_Caramba!_ take the knife!_Hombre!_ but I will kill you with my bare\nhands!"He threw the long knife to Diego, who stooped and picked it\nup.Stepping quickly back, holding the weapon firmly clenched before him,\nthe priest slowly circled Rosendo, as if looking for an opening.An\nevil smile played constantly over his heavy face, and his little eyes\nglittered like diamonds.Rosendo stood like a rock, his long arms\nhanging at his side.Then, with a shrill, taunting laugh, Diego turned suddenly and\nplunged into the newly-cut trail toward the lake.In an instant he was\nlost in the fog.For a moment Rosendo stood dumb with amazement.Diego had reached the canoe, leaped\nquickly in, and pushed off.He was\nleft a prisoner, without a boat, and with two miles of shrouded water\nstretching between him and the town!He had been tricked, outwitted; and the\nevil genius which for years had menaced his happiness was heading\nstraight toward the town, where his accomplice, Ricardo, awaited.What\nwould they do, now that he was out of the way?Great beads of water, distilled from his agony, burst through\nhis pores.The Juncal river lay off to the west, and at a much less\ndistance than Simiti.He might swim to it and secure a canoe at the\nvillage.But--the lake was alive with crocodiles!Chagrin and apprehension overwhelmed him, and he burst into a flood of\nbitter tears.He threw himself upon the ground, and tossed and moaned\nin despair.Nature--God himself--seemed to conspire with Diego.He drew the new medal scapulary\naround in front of him and kissed it, reverently crossing himself."_Santa Virgen_," he prayed, "help me--it is for the child!"Then,\ntaking between his teeth the knife which Diego had dropped, he rushed\ninto the water and struck out for the distant village of Juncal.*       *       *       *       *\n\nLate that afternoon, while the tropical rain was descending in\ntorrents, Rosendo staggered into the parish house, where Carmen and\nJose were absorbed in their work.he gasped, "_Loado sea\nDios!_" as his eyes fell upon the girl.Then he sank to the floor in\nutter exhaustion.cried Jose, bending over him in apprehension,\nwhile Carmen stood lost in wonder.cried Rosendo, raising himself up on his elbow.cried both Jose and the girl in astonishment.Instinctively Jose\'s arm went about the child.Rosendo dragged himself\nto a chair and sank limply into it."Then, Padre, he will come.Slowly the story came out, bit by bit."_Bien_, Padre," said Rosendo, concluding his dramatic and\ndisconnected recital, "I plowed through the water--_Caramba!_ I knew\nnot at what moment I should feel the jaws of a cayman seize upon me!_Bien_, I was then glad, for had I appeared in the village, all would\nhave said that I had murdered Diego!And so I struck out along the\ntrail that skirts the lake, and followed it around until I came here.And the rain--H_ombre_!it\nbeat me down--I fell again and again!And then, the fear that I was\ntoo late--_Ah, Dios_!But she is safe--_Caramba_!"But, Rosendo," said Jose anxiously, "where can Diego--"\n\n"He is here, _Caramba_!but I shall set out at\nonce and search every house!And he shall do well if he escape this\ntime!"But dusk was falling; and the old man, his strength sapped, listened\nnot unwillingly to Jose\'s better counsel.With the coming of night the\nrain ceased, and the clouds rolled up and slipped down behind the\nmountains, leaving the moon riding in splendor across the infinite\nblue.Then Jose, leaving Carmen with Rosendo, walked to and fro\nthrough the streets of the old town, listening and watching.He\nwandered down to the lake.He climbed the hill where stood the second\nchurch.He thought he caught the gleam of a light within the old\nedifice.Their voices sounded\nghostly to his straining ears."But, friend Ricardo, he set out before dawn, and is not yet returned.I fear he has either abandoned us, or has walked into our good\nRosendo\'s jaws.""It is\nmore likely that he and Don Mario lie pickled in rum under the palms\nof the Alcalde\'s _patio_!"He hurried down through the main street\nand past the house of Don Mario.The door stood open, and he could see\nthe portly figure of the official outlined against the back wall.It\nwas evident that Diego was not there.He returned in perplexity to his\nhouse and sat far into the night, musing on the strange incident.With the coming of the new day Rosendo appeared with fresh suggestions."_Bien_, Padre," he said, "there is nothing to do now but take the girl\nand flee to the Boque river and to the _hacienda_ of Don Nicolas.""_Caramba!_" he muttered, "but this is a mystery!"Your canoe, Don Rosendo--as I started out\non the lake to fish I saw it, far in the distance.Did it break away from its\nmooring, think you?"The latter replied quickly: "That is the most\nreasonable supposition, Juan.But Rosendo is very grateful to you for\nsecuring it again."When the lad had gone, Rosendo sat with bowed head, deeply perplexed."The pole and paddle, Padre, were left on the island.He--the boat--it must\nhave drifted long.Or--"\n\nHe stopped and scratched his head."Padre," he said, looking up\nsuddenly with an expression of awe upon his face, "do you suppose--do\nyou think that the Virgin--that she--made him fall from the canoe into\nthe lake--and that a _cayman_ ate him?_Ca-ram-ba!_"\n\nJose did not vouchsafe a reply.But his heart leaped with a great\nhope.Rosendo, wrapped in profound meditation, wandered back to his\nhouse, his head bent, and his hands clasped tightly behind his back.CHAPTER 29\n\n\nThe rainy season dragged its reeking length through the Simiti valley\nwith fearful deliberation.Jose thought that he should never again see\nthe sun.Great clouds of heavy vapor\nrolled incessantly upward from the dripping jungle.The rain fell in\ncloud-bursts, and the narrow streets of the old town ran like streams\nin a freshet.Then, one day, Rosendo abruptly announced, "Padre, the rains are\nbreaking.And the little Carmen is fourteen\nyears old to-day."And\nCarmen was no longer a child.Youth ripens quickly into maturity in\nthese tropic lands.The past year had sped like a meteor across an\nevening sky, leaving a train of mingled light and darkness.Of Diego\'s\nfate Jose had learned nothing.Ricardo and his companion had\ndisappeared without causing even a ripple of comment in Simiti.But he often eyed Jose and\nRosendo malignantly through the wooden grill at his window, and once\nhe ordered Fernando to stop Rosendo and ply him with many and pointed\nquestions.The old man was noncommittal, but he left a dark suspicion,\nwhich was transmitted to the receptive mind of the Alcalde.Acting-Bishop Wenceslas likewise was growing apprehensive as the weeks\nwent by, and both Jose and Don Mario were the recipients of letters of\ninquiry from him regarding the whereabouts of the priest Diego.In the\ncourse of time came other letters from Cartagena, and at length an\norder for a most scrutinizing search to be made for the Bishop\'s\nconfidential agent.Rosendo\'s oft-repeated testimony revealed nothing.The citizens of Simiti had not seen the man.The Alcalde had nothing\nbut his suspicions to offer.And these might have fallen harmlessly\nupon the acting-Bishop\'s well occupied thought, had it not been for\nthe complicating influence of certain other events.The first of these\nwas the exhaustion of the gold which Jose and Carmen had discovered in\nthe old church.The other was the outbreak of the religio-political\nrevolution which Diego had predicted some six years before, and which,\nin these latter days, Don Jorge, on his infrequent journeys through\nSimiti had repeatedly announced as inevitable and imminent.Their\ncombined effect was such as to wrest Carmen away from Jose, and to set\nin a new direction the currents of their lives.For some time past Jose had patched with growing anxiety the\nshrinking of his gold supply, and had striven to lessen the monthly\ncontributions to Cartagena, meanwhile trying to know that the need\nnow looming daily larger before him would be met.He had not voiced\nhis apprehension to Carmen.But he and Rosendo had discussed the\nsituation long and earnestly, and had at length resolved that the\nlatter should again return to Guamoco to wash the Tigui sands.The old man sighed, but he uttered no protest.Yet each day Jose\nthought he grew quieter.And each day, too, he seemed to become more\ntender of his sad-faced daughter, Ana, and of the little grandson who\nhad come into his humble home only a few weeks before.He delayed his\npreparations for specious reasons which Jose knew cost him much effort\nto invent.He told his rosary often before the\nchurch altar, and with tears in his eyes.And at night he would come\nto Jose and beg him to read from the Bible and explain what he thought\nthe Saviour had really meant to convey to the humble fishermen of\nGalilee.But at last the day arrived when he had\nnothing to send to Cartagena beyond the mere pittance which the poor\nmembers of his little parish contributed.Then came a letter from Wenceslas,\nrequesting an explanation.And then it was that Jose realized that in\nhis excess of zeal he had fallen into his own trap.For, having\nestablished the custom of remitting a certain amount to the Bishop\neach month, he must not resent now the implication of dishonesty when\nthe remittances fell off, or ceased altogether."_Bien_, Padre," said the latter slowly, "the time has come.In the days that followed, Jose could frame no satisfactory reply to\nWenceslas, and so the latter wrote to the Alcalde.Don Mario eagerly\nseized the proffered opportunity to ingratiate himself into\necclesiastical favor.Rosendo was again in the hills, he wrote, and\nwith supplies not purchased from him.Nor had he been given even a\nhint of Rosendo\'s mission, whether it be to search again for La\nLibertad, or not.There could be no doubt, he explained in great\ndetail, of Jose\'s connivance with Rosendo, and of his unauthorized\nconduct in the matter of educating the girl, Carmen, who, he made no\ndoubt, was the daughter of Padre Diego--now, alas!probably cold in\ndeath at the violent hands of the girl\'s foster-father, and with the\npriest Jose\'s full approbation.The letter cost the portly Don Mario\nmany a day of arduous labor; but it brought its reward in another\ninquiry from Cartagena, and this time a request for specific details\nregarding Carmen.He dropped his customary well-oiled\nmanner, and carried his head with the air of a conqueror.His thick\nlips became regnant, imperious.He treated his compatriots with\nsupercilious disdain.And to Jose he would scarce vouchsafe even a\ncold nod as they passed in the street.Again he penned a long missive\nto Cartagena, in which he dilated at wearisome length upon the\nextraordinary beauty of the girl, as well as her unusual mental\nqualities.He urged immediate action, and suggested that Carmen be\nsent to the convent in Mompox.*       *       *       *       *\n\nWenceslas mused long over the Alcalde\'s letters.Then he sent for a young clerical agent of the See, who\nwas starting on a mission to Bogota, and requested that he stop off a\nday at Badillo and go to Simiti to report on conditions in that\nparish.Incidentally, also, to gather what data he might as to the\nfamily of one Rosendo Ariza.In due course of time the agent made his report.The parish of Simiti\nstood in need of a new _Cura_, he said.And the girl--he found no\nwords to describe or explain her.The Church had\nneed of prompt action, however, to secure her.To that end, he advised\nher immediate removal to Cartagena.Aside from the girl, to whom he found his\nthought reverting oftener than he could wish in that particular hour\nof stress, his interest in Simiti did not extend beyond its\npossibilities as a further contributor to the funds he was so greatly\nneeding for the furtherance of his complex political plans.As to the\nAlcalde--here was a possibility of another sort.And at the same time warned\nagainst precipitate action, lest he scatter Rosendo\'s family into\nflight, and the graceful bird now dwelling in the rude nest escape the\nsharp talons awaiting her."Send a message to Francisco, our Legate,\nwho is now in Bogota.Bid him on his return journey stop again at\nSimiti.We require a full report on the character of the Alcalde of\nthat town."*       *       *       *       *\n\nMeantime, Jose did not permit his mental torture to interfere\nwith Carmen\'s education.For six years now that had progressed\nsteadily.Wonderful, he thought--and yet not\nwholly attributable to his peculiar mode of tutelage.For, after\nall, his work had been little more than the holding of her mind\nunwarped, that her instinctive sense of logic might reach those\ntruthful conclusions which it was bound to attain if guided safely\npast the tortuous shifts of human speculation and undemonstrable\ntheory.To his great joy, these six years had confirmed a belief\nwhich he had held ever since the troublous days of his youth,\nnamely, that, as a recent writer has said, "adolescent understanding\nis along straight lines, and leaps where the adult can only\nlaboriously creep."There had been no awful hold of early teaching\nto loosen and throw off; there were no old landmarks in her mind\nto remove; no tenacious, clinging effect of early associations to\nneutralize.And, perhaps most important of all, the child had seemed\nto enter the world utterly devoid of fear, and with a congenital\nfaith, amounting to absolute knowledge, in the immanence of an\nomnipotent God of love.This, added to her eagerness and mental\nreceptivity, had made his task one of constant rejoicing in the\nrealization of his most extravagant dreams for her.As a linguist, Carmen had become accomplished.And it was only a matter of practice to give her a similar\ngrasp of French, Italian, and German.As for other instruction,\nsuch knowledge of the outside world as he had deemed wise to give her\nin these six years had been seized upon with avidity and as\nquickly assimilated.But he often speculated curiously--sometimes\ndubiously--upon the great surprises in store for her should she ever\nleave her native village.And yet, as often as such thought recurred\nto him he would try to choke it back, to bar his mind against it, lest\nthe pull at his heartstrings snap them asunder.Often as he watched her expanding so rapidly into womanhood and\nexhibiting such graces of manner, such amiability of disposition,\nsuch selfless regard for others, combined with a physical beauty\nsuch as he thought he had never before gazed upon, a great yearning\nwould clutch his soul, and a lump would rise in his throat.And\nwhen, as was so often the case, her arms flew impulsively about his\nneck and she whispered words of tender endearment in his ear, a\nfierce determination would seize him, and he would clutch her to\nhimself with such vehemence as to make her gasp for breath.That she\nmight marry he knew to be a possibility.But the idea pierced his\nsoul as with a sword, and he thought that to see her in the arms of\nanother, even the man of her choice, must excite him to murder.One\nday, shortly after her fourteenth birthday, she came to him and,\nperching herself as was her wont upon his knees, and twining her arms\nabout his neck, said, with traces of embarrassment, "Padre dear,\nJuan--he asked me to-day to marry him."She--marry a peon of Simiti!To\nbe sure, Juan had often reminded him of the request he had made for\nher hand long ago.But Jose had not considered the likelihood of the\nlad\'s taking his question directly to her.And the girl--\n\n"And what did you reply?""Padre dear--I told him that--" She stopped abruptly."Well, _chiquita_; you told him--what?"He held her back from him and looked\nsquarely into her wide eyes."You told him, _chiquita_--"\n\n"That--well, Padre dear, I told him that--that I might never marry.""And do you think, little girl, that you will always hold\nto that resolution?""Yes, Padre, unless--"\n\n"Well, _chiquita_, unless--"\n\n"Unless you marry, too, Padre," she said, dropping her eyes.But--what has that to do with it,\ngirl?""Well--oh, Padre dear--can\'t you see?For then I would marry--" She\nburied her face in his shoulder."Yes, _chiquita_," he said, dully wondering.It was the first expression of the kind that had ever come from her\nlips.The Goddess of Fortune had\nsuddenly thrown her most precious jewel into his lap.Joy welled up in\nflood tides from unknown depths within.Minutes passed, and the two sat very quiet."Padre," she whispered, "you don\'t say anything.And you will not always be a priest--not always," shaking her\nbeautiful curls with suggestive emphasis.The people called her an\n_hada_.And then he knew that\nshe never moved except in response to a beckoning hand that still,\nafter all these years, remained invisible to him."_Chiquita_," he said in low response, "I fear--I fear that can never\nbe.And even if--ah, _chiquita_, I am so much older than you, little\ngirl--almost seventeen years!""You do not want to marry me, even if you could, Padre?"she queried,\nlooking wistfully into his eyes, while her own grew moist.he cried wildly, "you little\nknow--you little know!But--child, we must not talk of these things!"But, Padre dear," she pleaded, "just say that you _do_ love me that\nway--just say it--your little girl wants to hear it."She, pleading that he would say he loved her!He silently prayed that his tortured soul might burst\nand let his wasted life ebb into oblivion while his pent-up misery\npoured out."I love you--love\nyou--love you!"Some day, Padre dear," she\nmurmured softly, "you will stop thinking that two and two are seven.She sank back in his arms and nestled close to him, as if she longed\nto enter his empty heart and fill the great void with her measureless\nlove."And, Padre dear," she whispered, "your little girl will wait for\nyou--yes, she will wait."*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was some days later that Rosendo, after returning almost empty\nhanded from the hills, came to Jose and said, "Padre, I have sold my\n_hacienda_ to Don Luis.I need the money to purchase supplies and to\nget the papers through for some denouncements which I have made in\nGuamoco.I knew that Don Mario would put through no papers for me, and\nso I have asked Lazaro to make the transaction and to deliver the\ntitles to me when the final papers arrive.I have a blank here to be\nfilled out with the name and description of a mineral property.I--what would be a good name for a mine, Padre?""Why do you ask that, Rosendo?""Because, Padre, I want a foreign name--one not known, here."There is a city, a great city, that I have often\nheard about, up in the States," he said finally.He took up the little atlas which he had received long since with\nother books from abroad."Look," he said, "it is called Chicago.Call\nyour property the Chicago mine, Rosendo.It is a name unknown down\nhere, and there can no confusion arise because of it.""_Caramba!_" Rosendo muttered, trying to twist his tongue around the\nword, "it is certain that no one else will use that name in Guamoco!But that makes my title still more secure, no?""But, Rosendo," said Jose, when the full significance of the old man\'s\nannouncement had finally penetrated, "you have sold your _finca_!And\nto acquire title to property that you can never sell or work!And the\nsword that hangs above us may fall any day!""_Bien_, Padre, it is for her sake that I have done it.But, if the titles\nshould come from Cartagena during my absence--and, Padre, if anything\nshould happen to me--for the love of the Virgin do not let them out of\nyour hands!Yet Rosendo departed not on the morrow.He remained to mingle his\ntears with those of the sorrowing Ana.For the woman, whose heart had\nbeen lighter since the arrival of her babe, had come to the priest\nthat day to have the child christened.And so, before the sun might\nfill the _plaza_ with its ardent midday heat, Rosendo and his family\nrepaired to the church.There before the altar Jose baptised the\nlittle one and gave it his own name, thus triumphantly ushering the\npagan babe into the Christian Catholic world.The child cried at the\ntouch of the baptismal water."Now," commented Rosendo, "the devil has gone out of him, driven out\nby the holy water."But, as Jose leaned over the babe and looked into its dark eyes, his\nhand stopped, and his heart stood still.He raised his head and bent a\nlook of inquiry upon the mother.She returned the look with one that\nmutely voiced a stifled fear and confirmed his own.He took a candle from the altar and passed it before the child\'s\neyes._Santa Virgen!_ Do not tell me--_Dios mio_!"The\nmother\'s voice rose to a wail, as she snatched her babe away.Dona Maria stood mute; but Jose as\nhe looked at her divined her thought and read therein a full knowledge\nof the awful fact that she had never voiced to the heart-broken\nmother.Ana, what ails the\nchild?"Carmen crowded close to the weeping Ana."The babe, Rosendo," she said quietly, "was born--blind."CHAPTER 30\n\n\nThe "revolutionist" of Latin America is generally only the disgruntled\npolitician.His revolution is seldom more than a violent squabble\namong greedy spoilsmen for control of the loose-jointed administration.But the great Mosquera Revolution which burst into flame in New\nGranada in 1861 was fed with fuel of a different nature.It\ndemonstrated, if demonstration were necessary, that the Treaty of\nWestphalia did not write _finis_ to the history of bloodshed in the\nname of Christ; that it had but banked the fires of religious\nanimosity, until the furnace should be transferred from the Old World to\nthe New, where the breath of liberty would again fan them into\nvigorous activity.The Mosquera War tore asunder Church and State; but left unhappy\nColombia prone and bleeding.It externalized a mighty protest of\nenlightenment against Rome\'s dictates in temporal affairs.And, as has\nbefore happened when that irresistible potentiality, the people, has\nbeen stirred into action, the Church was disestablished, its property\nconfiscated, and its meddling, parasitical clergy disenfranchised.But then, too, as almost invariably occurs when the masses find that\nthey have parted with cherished prejudices and effete customs, and\nhave adopted ideas so radical as to lift them a degree higher in the\nscale of progress, they wavered.The holy sacrament of marriage was\ndebased to a civil ceremony.Education was endangered by taking it out\nof the hands of the pious clergy.Texts unauthorized by Holy Church\nwere being adopted.The alarm\nspread, fanned by the watchful agents of Rome.And twenty years of incessant internecine warfare followed.And when\nit was seen that Roman Catholicism was therein again declared to be\nthe national religion of the Republic of Colombia; when it was noted\nthat the clergy, obedient to a foreign master, were to be readmitted\nto participation in government affairs; when it was understood that a\nnational press-censorship was to be established, dominated by Holy\nChurch; and when, in view of this, the great religio-political\nopponent was seen laying down her weapons and extending her arms in\ndubious benediction over the exhausted people, the masses yielded--and\nthere was great rejoicing on the banks of the Tiber over the\nprodigal\'s return.When Wenceslas Ortiz was placed in temporary control of the See of\nCartagena he shrewdly urged the Church party to make at least a\npretense of disbanding as a political organization.The provinces\nof Cundinamarca and Panama were again in a state of ferment.Congress, sitting in Bogota, had before it for consideration a\nmeasure vesting in the President the power to interfere in certain\nstates or provinces whenever, in his opinion, the conservation of\npublic order necessitated such action.That this measure would be\npassed, Wenceslas could not be sure.But that, once adopted, it would\nprecipitate the unhappy country again into a sanguinary war, he\nthought he knew to a certainty.He had faced this same question six\nyears before, when a similar measure was before Congress.But then,\nwith a strong Church party, and believing the passage of the law to be\ncertain, he had yielded to the counsel of hot-headed leaders in\nCartagena, and approved the inauguration of hostilities.Congress dropped the measure like a\nhot plate.The demands of the "revolutionists" were quickly met by the\nfederal government.The _causae belli_ evaporated.And Wenceslas\nretired in chagrin to the solitude of his study, to bite his nails and\nwonder dubiously if his party were strong enough to insure his\nappointment to the See of Cartagena in the event of the then aged\noccupant\'s demise.It was this hasty judgment of Wenceslas and his political associates\nwhich had delayed further consideration of the objectionable measure\nfor six years.But the interim had seen his party enormously\nstrengthened, himself in control of the See, and his preparations\ncompleted for turning the revolt, whenever it should come, to his own\ngreat advantage.He had succeeded in holding the Church party aloof\nfrom actual participation in politics during the present crisis.And\nhe was now keeping it in constant readiness to throw its tremendous\ninfluence to whichever side should offer the greatest inducements.Congress dallied; and then prepared\nto adjourn.Wenceslas received a code message from his agent in Bogota\nthat the measure would be laid on the table.At the same time came a\nsharp <DW8> from New York.The funds had been provided to finance the\nimpending revolution.Had the Church party exaggerated its influence upon\nCongress?"_Santa Virgen!_" he muttered, as he paced\nangrily back and forth in his study.A\ncurse--"\n\nHe stopped still.In the midst of his imprecations an idea occurred to\nhim.He went to his _escritorio_ and drew out the Legate\'s recent\nreport."Ah," he mused, "that pig-headed Alcalde.Then he summoned his secretary and dictated telegrams to Bogota and\nNew York, and a long letter to the Alcalde of Simiti.These finished,\nhe called a young acolyte in waiting."Take a message to the Governor," he commanded."Say to His Excellency\nthat I shall, call upon him at three this afternoon, to discuss\nmatters of gravest import."Dismissing his secretary, he leaned back\nin his chair and dropped into a profound revery.Shortly before the hour which he had set for conference with the\nDepartmental Governor, Wenceslas rose and went to his _escritorio_,\nfrom which he took a paper-bound book._Bien_, I was correct in my surmise that I should some day have use\nfor this little volume.But--_Bien_, I think\nit will do--I think it will do."A smile played over his handsome, imperious face.Then he snapped the\nbook shut and took up his hat.At the door he hesitated a moment, with\nhis hand on the knob."If the Alcalde were not such a fool, it would be impossible," he\nmused."But--the combination--the isolation of Simiti--the imbecility\nof Don Mario--the predicament of our little Jose--_Hombre_!it is a\nrare situation, and it will work.It _must_ work--_cielo_!With the\npig-headed Alcalde seizing government arms to suppress the Church\nparty as represented by the foolish Jose, and with the President\nsending federal troops to quell the disturbance, the anticlericals\nwill rise in a body throughout the country.Then Congress will hastily\npass the measure to support the President, the Church party will swing\ninto line with the Government--and the revolution will be on.Simiti\nprovides the setting and the fuel; I, the torch.I will cable again to\nAmes when I leave the Governor."He swung the door open and went\nbriskly out.*       *       *       *       *\n\n"Padre, I am crushed."He and Jose were sitting out in the\ngathering dusk before the parish house on the evening of the day that\nAna\'s babe had been christened.The old man\'s head was sunk upon his\nbreast, and he rocked back and forth groaning aloud."We must be brave, Rosendo," returned Jose tenderly."We have gone\nthrough much, you and I, since I came to Simiti.But--we have believed\nit to be in a good cause."But, Padre, after it all, to have her babe come into the world blind!Padre, it is the last thing\nthat I can endure.I cannot return now to\nGuamoco."Rosendo," said Jose, drawing his chair closer to the old man, and\nlaying a hand on his, "we have fought long and hard.But, if I mistake\nnot, the greatest struggle is yet to come.The greatest demand upon\nyour strength and mine is still to be made.""This: Juan returned from Bodega Central\nthis evening.He reports that several large boxes are there, consigned\nto Don Mario, and bearing the government stamp.He found one of them\nslightly broken, and he peered within.Jose went on:\n\n"I did not intend to tell you this until morning.But it is right that\nyou should hear it now, that your courage may rise in the face of\ndanger.The federal government is sending arms to\nSimiti to establish a base here at the outlet of the Guamoco region,\nand well hidden from the Magdalena river.This town is to become a\nmilitary depot, unless I mistake the signs.And danger no longer\nthreatens, but is at our door."Rosendo rose slowly and drew himself up to his full\nheight."There is no question about it, Rosendo," replied Jose gravely."And I\nhave no reason to doubt the truth of Diego\'s prophecy, that this time\nit will be one to be reckoned with.""Take her into the hills, Rosendo.Jose\'s thought was dwelling on his last talk with the girl.Again he\nfelt her soft arms about his neck, and her warm breath against his\ncheek.He felt her kiss, and heard again her words, the sweetest, he\nthought, that had ever echoed in mortal ears.And then he thought of\nhis mother, of his office, of the thousand obstacles that loomed huge\nand insurmountable between him and Carmen.He passed a hand across his\nbrow and sighed heavily.I welcome, not\nonly the opportunity for service which this war may bring, but\nlikewise the hope of--death.If I could but know that she were\nsafe--"\n\n"_Caramba_!Think you she would leave you here, Padre?Did\nRosendo\'s words convey aught to the priest that he did not already\nknow?"But--Rosendo, I shall not go," he returned bitterly."Then neither do we, Padre," replied Rosendo, sitting again."The\nchild, Carmen--she--Padre, she loves you with a love that is not of\nthe earth."*       *       *       *       *\n\nMorning found the old man\'s conviction still unshaken.Jose sought the\nquiet of his cottage to reflect.But his meditations were interrupted\nby Carmen."Padre," she began, sparkling like a mountain rill in the sunlight as\nshe seated herself before him."Pepito--Anita\'s babe--he is not blind,\nyou know."Her head bobbed vigorously, as was her wont when she sought\nto give emphasis to her dramatic statements.Jose smiled, and resigned himself to the inevitable."And, Padre, have you been thankful that he isn\'t?"You know, Padre Diego thought he couldn\'t see the reality.He\nlooked always at his bad thoughts.And so the not seeing, and the\nseeing of only bad things, were both--externalized, and the babe came\nto us without sight.John went to the office.That is, without what the human mind calls sight.And now," she went on excitedly, "you and I have just _got_ to know\nthat it isn\'t so!And I have\nthanked Him all morning that this is so, and that you and I see it."Well--I suppose so," replied Jose abstractedly, his thought still\noccupied with the danger that hung over the little town.There isn\'t any\'suppose\' about it!The eye is made _by_ the\nsight.It thinks that sight\ndepends upon the optic nerve, and upon the fleshly eye.It is the sight that externalizes the\'meaty\' eye.You see, the\nsight is within, not without.God is all-seeing; and so,\nsight is eternal.But what he saw was the\nbeautiful, animated girl before him.And the thought that he must some\nday be separated from her was eating his heart like a canker."Well, then," went on the girl, without waiting for his reply, "if a\nmortal\'s mental concept of sight is poor, why, he will manifest poor\neyes.If the thought-concept were right, the manifestation would be\nright."By that I\nsuppose you mean, _chiquita_, that the babe\'s thought, or concept, of\nsight was all wrong, and so he came into the world blind.""Not at all, Padre," she quickly replied."The babe had nothing to do\nwith it, except to seem to manifest the wrong thoughts of its father,\nor mother, or both.Or perhaps it manifests just simply bad thoughts,\nwithout the bad thoughts belonging to anybody.For, you know, we none\nof us really _have_ such thoughts.They are just a part of the one big lie about God.""Surely; the real babe is a child of God, and sees.""But the human babe doesn\'t see," he retorted."But," she replied, "what you call the human babe is only your mental\nconcept of the babe.And you see that mental concept as a blind one.See only God\'s child,\nwith perfect sight.And, Padre, after a while _you will see that babe\nseeing things, just as we do_!she exclaimed, as he sat looking fixedly at\nher."Don\'t you see that if you have the right thought about the babe,\nand hold to it, and put out every thought that says it is blind, why,\nyour right thought will be externalized in a mental concept of a babe\nthat sees?Don\'t you know that that is exactly what Jesus did?He\ndidn\'t affect the real man at all.But he did change the mental\nconcepts which we call human beings.And we can do the same, if we\nonly know it, and follow him, and spiritualize our thought, as he did,\nby putting out and keeping out every thought that we know does not\ncome from God, and that is, therefore, only a part of the lie about\nHim.Here is a case where we have got to quit thinking that two and\ntwo are seven.It is God\'s business to make our\nconcepts right.And we will see these,\nright concepts if we will put out the wrong ones!"he queried lamely, wholly at a loss for any other answer."Well, Padre, I am not a bit afraid.I don\'t see a blind babe at all,\nbecause there just can\'t be any."In other words, you don\'t intend to allow yourself to be deceived by\nappearances?""Blindness is only an\nappearance.But it doesn\'t appear to God, It appears only to the human\nmind--which isn\'t any mind at all!And the appearance can be made to\ndisappear, if we know the truth and stick to it.For any appearance of\na human body is a mental concept, that\'s all.""Yes, a thing of _wrong_ thought.But all wrong thought is subject\nto God\'s right thought.We\'ve proved that, haven\'t we, lots of\ntimes?Well, this wrong thought about a babe that is blind can be\nchanged--made to disappear--just as any lie can be made to disappear\nwhen we know the truth.And so you and I are not going to be afraid,\nare we?I told Anita this morning not to worry, but to just _know_\nall the time that her babe did see, no matter what the appearance\nwas.And she smiled at me, Padre, she smiled.And I know that she\ntrusts, and is going to work with you and me."had he done aught of late but work against her\nby his constant harboring of fears, of doubts, and his distrust of\nspiritual power?"Padre," she resumed, "I want you to promise me that every day you\nwill thank God that the babe really sees.And that you will turn right\non every thought of blindness and know that it is a part of the lie\nabout God, and put it right out of your mind."But--child--if my mind tells me that the babe is blind, how can I--"\n\n"I don\'t care what your mind tells you about the babe!You are to\nlisten to what God tells you, not your human mind!Does God tell you\nthat the babe is blind?"Why, no, _chiquita_, He--"\n\n"Listen, Padre," she interrupted again, drawing closer to him."Is God\ngood, or bad, or both?""He is good, _chiquita_, all good.""And we have long since proved by actual reasoning and demonstration\nthat He is mind, and so infinite mind, no?""Well, an infinite mind has all power.And an infinite, all-powerful\nmind that is all good could not possibly create anything bad, or sick,\nor discordant--now could He?"But--the five physical\nsenses tell us differently."And yet, we know that the five physical senses _do not tell us\ntruth_!We know that when the human mind thinks it is receiving\nreports about things through the five physical senses it is doing\nnothing more than looking at its own thoughts."The thoughts of an infinite and good mind must be like that mind, all\ngood, no?Well, then, thoughts of discord, disease, blindness, and\ndeath--do they come from the infinite, good mind?"Well, _chiquita mia_, that is just the sticking point.But the mighty question is, where _do_ those thoughts come\nfrom?I am quite as ready as you to admit that discord, sin, evil,\ndeath, and all the whole list of human ills and woes come from these\nbad thoughts held in the human mind and so externalized.I believe\nthat the human man really sees, feels, hears, smells, and tastes these\nthoughts--that the functioning of the physical senses is wholly\nmental--takes place in mind, in thought only.That is, that the human\nmind thinks it sees, feels, hears; but that the whole process is\nmental, and that it is but regarding its thoughts, instead of actually\nregarding and cognizing objects outside of itself."Isn\'t that just what I am\ntrying to tell you?""But--and here is the great obstacle--we differentiate between good\nand bad thoughts.We agree that a fountain can not send forth sweet\nand bitter waters at the same time.And so, good and bad thoughts do\nnot come from the infinite mind that we call God.Answer that, _chiquita_, and my problems will all be\nsolved."She looked at him in perplexity for some time.It seemed to her\nthat she never would understand him.But, with a little sigh of\nresignation, she replied:\n\n"Padre, you answered that question yourself, long ago.You worked it\nall out three or four years ago.You let\nthe false testimony of the physical senses mesmerize you again.Instead of sticking to the thoughts that you knew to be good, and\nholding to them, in spite of the pelting you got from the others, you\nhave looked first at the good, and then at the bad, and then believed\nthem all to be real, and all to be powerful.Sandra went back to the hallway.And so you got miserably\nmixed up.And the result is that you don\'t know where you stand.Or, you think you don\'t; for that thought, too, is a bad one, and\nhas no power at all, excepting the power that you seem willing--and\nglad--to give it."He knew in his heart that she was\nright.He had not clung to the good, despite the roars of Satan.He\nhad not "resisted unto blood."Far from it; he had fallen, almost\ninvariably, at the first shower of the adversary\'s darts.And now, was\nhe not trying, desperately, to show her that Ana\'s babe was blind,\nhopelessly so?Was he not fighting on evil\'s side, and vigorously,\nthough with shame suffusing his face, waving aloft the banner of\nerror?"The trouble with you, Padre," the girl resumed, after some moments of\nreflection, "is that you--you see everything--well, you see everything\nas a person, or a thing.""You mean that I always associate thought with personality?"But you have got to learn to deal with thoughts and ideas\nby themselves, apart from any person or thing.You have got to learn\nto deal with facts and their opposites entirely apart from places, or\nthings, or people.Now if I say that Life is eternal, I have stated a\nmental thing.Its opposite, that is, the opposite of\nLife, is death.That being so, Life is the reality, and death is the unreality.Very\nwell, what makes death seem real?It is just because the false thought\nof death comes into the human mind, and is held there as a reality, as\nsomething that has _got_ to happen.And that strong belief becomes\nexternalized in what mortals call death.Is there a\nperson in the whole world who doesn\'t think that some time he has got\nto die?But now suppose every person held the belief that\ndeath was an illusion, a part of the big lie about God, just as Jesus\nsaid it was.Well, wouldn\'t we get rid of death in a hurry?And is there a person in the whole world who wouldn\'t say\nthat Anita\'s babe was blind?They would look at the human\nthought of blindness, instead of God\'s real idea of sight, and so they\nwould make and keep the babe blind.Don\'t you understand me, Padre\ndear?I know you do, for you really see as God sees!"Her eyes glistened, and her whole body seemed\nto radiate the light of knowledge divine.Then she went hurriedly on:\n\n"Padre, everything is mental.You know that, for you told me so, long\nsince.Well, that being so, we have got to face the truth that every\nmental fact seems to have an opposite, or a lot of opposites, also\nseemingly mental.Infinite mind is the\ninfinite fact.The so-called opposite of this infinite fact is the\nhuman mind, the many so-called minds of mankind--_a kind of man._ But\neverything is still mental.Now, an illusion, or a lie, does not\n_really_ exist.If I tell you that two and two are seven, that lie\ndoes not exist.Is it in what we call my mind, or yours?Even if\nyou say you believe it, that doesn\'t make it real.Nor does it show\nthat it has real existence in your mind.But--if you\nhold it, and cling to it--allow it to stay with you and influence\nyou--why, Padre dear, everything in your whole life will be changed!"Let me take your pencil--and a piece of paper.Look now," drawing a\nline down through the paper."On one side, Padre, is the infinite\nmind, God, and all His thoughts and ideas, all good, perfect and\neternal.On the other side is the lie about it all.That is still\nmental; but it is illusion, falsity.It includes all sin, all\nsickness, all murder, all evil, accidents, loss, failure, bad\nambitions, and death.These are all parts of the big lie about\nGod--His unreal opposite.These are the so-called thoughts that come\nto the human mind.The human\nmind looks at them, tastes them, feels them, holds them; and then they\nbecome its beliefs.After a while the human mind looks at nothing but\nthese beliefs.And, finally, it comes to\nbelieve that God made them and sent them to His children.Isn\'t it\nawful, Padre!And aren\'t you glad that you know about it?And aren\'t\nyou going to learn how to keep the good on one side of that line and\nthe illusion on the other?"It seemed to Jose a thing incredible that these words were coming from\na girl of fifteen.And yet he knew that at the same tender age he was\nas deeply serious as she--but with this difference: he was then\ntenaciously clinging to the thoughts that she was now utterly\nrepudiating as unreal and non-existent."Padre dear," the girl resumed, "everything is mental."Well," he replied reflectively, "at least our comprehension of it is\nwholly mental.""Why--it is all inside--it is all in our thought!Padre, when Hernando\nplays on that old pipe of his, where is the music?"But, _chiquita_, we don\'t seem to have it in our thought until we\nseem to see him playing on the pipe, do we?""No, we don\'t," she replied.It is just because\nthe human mind believes that everything, even music, must come from\nmatter--must have a--"\n\n"Must have a material origin?And men even believe that life itself has a material origin; and\nso they have wasted centuries trying to find it in the body.They\ndon\'t seem to want to know that God is life.""Then, _chiquita_, you do not believe that matter is real?""There is no matter outside of us, or around us, Padre," she said in\nreply."The human mind looks at its thoughts and seems to see them out\naround it as things made of matter.But, after all, it only sees its\nthoughts.""Then I suppose that the externalization of our thought in our\nconsciousness constitutes what we call space, does it not?""It must, Padre," she answered.Then:\n\n"_Chiquita_, how do you know me?What do you see that you call\'me\'?""Why, Padre, I see you as God does--at least, I try always to see you\nthat way?""And that is the way Jesus always\nsaw people."But, does He see me as I see myself?""You do not see yourself, Padre," was her reply."You see only the\nthoughts that you call yourself.Thoughts of mind and body and all\nthose things that go to form a human being.""Well--yes, I must agree with you there; for, though God certainly\nknows me, He cannot know me as I think I know myself, sinful and\ndiscordant.""He knows the real \'you,\' Padre dear.He\nknows that the unreal \'you,\' the \'you\' that you think you know, is\nillusion.If He knew the human, mortal \'you\' as real, He would have to\nknow evil."No, for the Bible says He is of eyes too pure to behold evil.""Well, Padre, why don\'t you try to be like Him?"But the girl needed not that he should answer her question.She knew\nwhy he had failed, for "without faith it is impossible to please him:\nfor he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a\nrewarder of them that diligently seek him."She knew that Jose\'s\nstruggle to overcome evil had been futile, because he had first\nmade evil real.She knew that the difficulty he had experienced in\nkeeping his thought straight was because he persisted in looking at\nboth the good and the evil.Lot\'s wife, in the Bible allegory, had\nturned back to look at things material and had been transformed into\na pillar of salt.Jose had turned again and again to his materialistic\nthoughts; and had been turned each time to salt tears.She knew that\nhe gave up readily, that he yielded easily to evil\'s strongest\ntool, discouragement, and fell back into self-condemnation, whereby he\nonly rendered still more real to himself the evil which he was\nstriving to overcome.She knew that the only obstacle that he was\nwrestling with in his upward progress was the universal belief in a\npower other than God, good, which is so firmly fixed in the human\nconsciousness.But she likewise knew that this hindrance was but a\nfalse conviction, and that it could and would be overcome."Padre," she reflected, looking up at him in great seriousness, "if a\nlie had an origin, it would be true, wouldn\'t it?"He regarded her attentively, but without replying."But Jesus said that Satan was the father of lies.And Satan, since he\nis the father of lies, must himself be a lie.You see, Padre, we can\ngo right back to the very first chapter in the Bible.First comes the\naccount of the real creation.Then comes the account as the human\nmind looks at it.But that comes after the\'mist\' had gone up from\nthe ground, from dirt, from matter.That mist was\nerror, the opposite of Good.It was\nthe human mind and all human thought, the opposite of the infinite\nMind, God, and His thought.So every bit\nof evil that you can possibly think of comes from the material,\nphysical senses.Evil is always a mist, hiding the good.The physical universe, the universe of matter, is the way the\nhuman mind sees its thoughts of the spiritual universe that was\ncreated by God.The human mind is just a bundle of these false\nthoughts; and you yourself have said that the human consciousness\nwas a \'thought-activity, concerned with the activity of false\nthought.\'The human mind is the lie about the infinite mind.It\nhas no principle, and nothing to stand on.The minute you turn the\ntruth upon it, why, it vanishes.""Well, then, _chiquita_, why don\'t people turn the truth upon it\neverywhere?""Because they are mesmerized by the error, Padre.They sit looking at\nthese false thoughts and believing them true.Padre, all disease, all\nevil, comes from the false thought in the human mind.It is that\nthought externalized in the human consciousness.And when the human\nmind turns from them, and puts them out, and lets the true thoughts\nin, why--why, _then we will raise the dead_!""But, _chiquita_, the human body--if it has died--"\n\n"Padre," she interrupted, "the human body and human mind are one and\nthe same.The body that you think you see is\nbut your thought of a body, and _is in your so-called human mind_!""And so would you if you read your Bible\nin the right way.Why--I had never seen a Bible until you gave me\nyours.I didn\'t know what a book it was!And to think that it has been\nin the world for thousands of years, and yet people still kill one\nanother, still get sick, and still die!"But, _chiquita_, people are too busy to devote time to demonstrating\nthe truths of the Bible," he offered."Why--busy making money--busy socially--busy having a good time--busy\naccumulating things that--that they must go away and leave to somebody\nelse!""They are like the people Jesus spoke of, too\nbusy with things that are of no account to see the things that\nare--that are--"\n\n"That are priceless, _chiquita_--that are the most vital of all things\nto sinful, suffering mankind," he supplied.These hours\nwith Carmen had become doubly precious to him of late.Perhaps he felt\na presentiment that the net about him and his loved ones was drawing\nrapidly tighter.Perhaps he saw the hour swiftly approaching, even at\nhand, when these moments of spiritual intercourse would be rudely\nterminated.And perhaps he saw the clouds lowering ever darker above\nthem, and knew that in the blackness which was soon to fall the girl\nwould leave him and be swept out into the great world of human\nthoughts and events, to meet, alone with her God, the fiercest\nelements, the subtlest wiles, of the carnal mind.As for himself--he\nwas in the hands of that same God."_Chiquita_," he said, "you do not\nfind mistakes in the Bible?For, out in the big world where I came\nfrom, there are many, very many, who say that it is a book of\ninconsistencies, of gross inaccuracies, and that its statements are\ndirectly opposed to the so-called natural sciences.They say that it\ndoesn\'t even relate historical events accurately.But, after all,\nthe Bible is just the record of the unfoldment in the human\nconsciousness of the concept of God.Why cavil at it when it\ncontains, as we must see, a revelation of the full formula for\nsalvation, which, as you say, is right-thinking."And it even tells us what to think about.Paul said, you\nknow, that we should think about whatsoever things are true, honest,\njust, pure, lovely, and of good report.Well, he told us that there\nwas no law--not even any human law--against those things.And don\'t\nyou know, he wrote about bringing into captivity every thought to\nChrist?"Just what you have been telling me, I guess, _chiquita_: that every\nthought must be measured by the Christ-principle.And if it doesn\'t\nconform to that standard, it must be rejected."He did die daily to evil,\nto all evil thought--"\n\n"And to the testimony of the physical senses, think you?"For, in proving God to be real, he had to prove the\nreports of the five physical senses to be only human beliefs.""You are right, _chiquita_.He must have known that the corporeal\nsenses were the only source from which evil came.He must have known\nthat unless God testified in regard to things, any other testimony was\nbut carnal belief.This must be so, for God, being infinite mind, is\nalso infinite intelligence.He knows all things, and knows them\naright--not as the human mind thinks it knows them, twisted and\ndeformed, but right."And can\'t you\n_stick_ to it, and prove it?""_Chiquita_," he answered, shaking his head again, his words still\nvoicing a lingering note of doubt, "it may be--the \'I\' that I call\nmyself may be entirely human, unreal, mortal.I make no doubt it is,\nfor it seems filled to the brim with discordant thoughts.she cried, with a trace of exasperation."Empty yourself\nof the wrong thoughts--shut the door against them--don\'t let them in\nany more!Then when the\nmortal part fades away, why, the good will be left.Mary journeyed to the kitchen.And it will be the\nright \'you.\'""But how shall I empty myself, and then fill myself again?"cried the girl, springing from her chair and stamping her\nfoot with each word to give it emphasis."It is love, love, love,\nnothing but love!Forget yourself, and love everything and everybody,\nthe real things and the real bodies!Love God, and good, and good\nthoughts!Turn from the bad and the unreal--forget it!Why--"\n\n"Wait, _chiquita_," he interrupted."A great war is threatening our\ncountry at this very minute.Shall I turn from it and let come what\nmay?"But you can know that war comes only from the\nhuman mind; that it is bad thought externalized; and that God is\npeace, and is infinitely greater than such bad thought; and He will\ntake care of you--if you will let Him!"By sitting back and folding my hands and\nsaying, Here am I, Lord, protect me--"\n\n"Oh, Padre dear, you make me ashamed of your foolish thought--which\nisn\'t your thought at all, but just thought that seems to be calling\nitself \'you.\'Jesus said, He that believeth on me, the works that I do\nshall he do likewise.But that did not mean sitting back with folded\nhands.It meant _understanding_ him; and knowing that there is no\npower apart from the Christ-principle; and using that principle, using\nit every moment, _hard_; and with it overcoming every thought that\ndoesn\'t come from God, every thought of the human mind, whether it is\ncalled war, or sickness, or death!""Then evil can be thought away, _chiquita_?"He knew not why he\npursued her so relentlessly."No, Padre," she replied with a gentle patience that smote him.But it can be destroyed in the human mind.And when you have\novercome the habit of thinking the wrong way, evil will disappear.That is what Jesus tried to make the people\nsee."Yet he had not put it to the proof.He had gone\nthrough life, worrying himself loose from one human belief, only to\nbec']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The conversation between Mary and Padre is about spirituality and overcoming evil thoughts. They discuss how to empty oneself of wrong thoughts and fill oneself with love, and how to use the Christ-principle to overcome every thought that doesn't come from God. There is no mention of John in the conversation.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Had the ornamentation of these been\ncarried up to the springing of the vault, they would have been\nunexceptionable; as it is, with all their richness, their effect is\nunmeaning.Externally, the appearance is in outline not unlike that of Sta.Maria\ndei Fiori; the apse is rich, varied, and picturesque, and the central\ndome (excepting the details) similar, though on a smaller scale, to what\nI believe to have been the original design of the Florentine church.The\nnave is nearly as flat as at Florence, the clerestory not being visible;\nbut the forest of pinnacles and flying buttresses and the richness of\nthe ornamentation go far to hide that defect.The façade was left\nunfinished, as was so often the case with the great churches of Italy.Pellegrini was afterwards employed to finish it, and a model of his\ndesign is still preserved.It is fortunate that his plan was not carried\nout.The façade was finished, as we now see it, from the designs of\nAmati, by order of Napoleon.It is commonplace, as might be expected\nfrom its age, but inoffensive.The doorways are part of Pellegrini’s\ndesign, and the Mediæval forms being placed over those of the\ncinque-cento, produce a strangely incongruous effect.For the west front\nseveral original designs are still preserved.One of these, with two\nsmall square towers at the angles, as at Vercelli and elsewhere, was no\ndoubt the Italian design.509) is preserved\nby Bassi:[314] had this been executed, the façade would have been about\none-third (viz.Had the height of\nthe towers been in the same proportion, they would have been the tallest\nin the world.In that case the effect here, as at Cologne, would have\nbeen to shorten and overpower the rest of the building to a painful\nextent.A design midway between the two, with spires rising to the same\nheight as the central one, or about 360 ft., would perhaps have the\nhappiest effect.At any rate, the want of some such features is greatly\nfelt in the building as it stands.The Certosa, near Pavia, was commenced about the same date (1396) as the\ncathedral at Milan.It is seldom that we find two buildings in the\nMiddle Ages so close to one another in date and locality, and yet so\ndissimilar.There is no instance of such an occurrence on this side of\nthe Alps, till modern times; and it shows that in those days the\nItalians were nearly as devoid of any distinct principles of\narchitecture as we have since become.View of the Certosa, near Pavia.The great difference between Pavia and Milan is that the former shows no\ntrace of foreign influence.Petronio, and\nby no means so complete or consistent in design.Nothing, in fact, can\nbe more painful than the disproportion of the parts, the bad drawing of\nthe details, the malformation of the vaults, and the meanness of the\nwindows; though all these defects are completely hidden by the most\ngorgeous colouring, and by furniture of such richness as to be almost\nunrivalled.So attractive are these two features to the majority of\nspectators, and so easily understood, that nine visitors out of ten are\ndelighted with the Certosa, and entirely forget its miserable\narchitecture in the richness and brilliancy of its decorations.Externally the architecture is better than in the interior.From its\nproximity to Pavia, it retains its beautiful old galleries under the\nroof.Its circular apses, with their galleries, give to this church, for\nthe age to which it belongs, a peculiar character, harmonising well with\nthe circular-headed form, which nearly all the windows and openings\npresent.Even in the interior there are far more circular than pointed\narches.The most beautiful and wonderful part of the building is the façade.This was begun in 1473, and is one of the best specimens in Italy of the\nRenaissance style.It would hardly, therefore, be appropriate to mention\nit here, were it not that the dome over the intersection of the nave and\ntransepts is of the same age and style, but reproduces so exactly\n(except in details) what we fancy the Mediæval Italian Gothic dome to\nhave been, that it may be considered as a feature of the earlier ages.502, it will be seen how like it is to that of\nChiaravalle in outline.It is less tall, however, and, if translated\ninto the details of the great church at Florence, would fit perfectly on\nthe basement there prepared for such a feature.Like many other churches in Northern Italy, the principal parts of the\nCertosa are built in brick, and the ornamental details executed in\nterra-cotta.Some of the latter, especially in the cloisters, are as\nbeautiful as any executed in stone in any part of Italy during the\nMiddle Ages; and their perfect preservation shows how suitable is the\nmaterial for such purposes.It may not be appropriate for large details\nor monumental purposes, but for the minor parts and smaller details,\nwhen used as the Italians in the Middle Ages used it, terra-cotta is as\nlegitimate as any material anywhere used for building purposes; and in\nsituations like the alluvial plains of the Po, where stone is with\ndifficulty obtainable, its employment was not only judicious but most\nfortunate in its results.It would be a tedious and unprofitable task to attempt to particularise\nall the churches which were erected in this style in Italy, as hardly\none of them possesses a single title to admiration beyond the very\nvulgar one of size.To this Santa Croce, at Florence, adds its\nassociation with the great men who lie buried beneath it, and Sta.Maria\nNovella can plead the circumstance—exceptional in that city—of\npossessing a façade;[315] but neither of these has anything to redeem\nits innate ugliness in the eyes of an architect.There are two great churches of this period at Venice, the San Giovanni\ne Paolo (1246-1420) and the Frari (1250); they are large and richly\nornamented fabrics, but are both entirely destitute of architectural\nmerit.(From Hope’s ‘Architecture.’)\nScale 50 ft.A much more beautiful building is the cathedral at Como, the details of\nwhich are so elegant and so unobtrusively used as in great measure to\nmake up for the bad arrangement and awkward form of the whole.In design\nit is, however, inferior to that of the Duomo at Ferrara (Woodcut No.The latter does not display the richness of the façades of Siena\nor Orvieto, nor the elegance of that last named; but among the few\nItalian façades which exist, it stands pre-eminent for sober propriety\nof design and the good proportions of all its parts.The repose caused\nby the solidity of the lower portions, and the gradual increase of\nornament and lightness as we ascend, all combine to render it harmonious\nand pleasing.It is true it wants the aspiring character and bold relief\nof Northern façades; but these do not belong to the style, and it must\nsuffice if we meet in this style with a moderate amount of variety,\nundisturbed by any very prominent instances of bad taste.The true type of an Italian façade is well illustrated in the view of\nSt.Francesco at Brescia (Woodcut No.512), which may be considered the\ngerm of all that followed.Whether the church had three aisles or five,\nthe true Italian façade in the age of pointed architecture was always a\nmodification or extension of this idea, though introduced with more or\nless Gothic feeling according to the circumstances of its erection.At Florence there is a house or warehouse, converted into a church,—Or\n(horreum) San Michele, which has attracted a good deal of attention, but\nmore on account of its curious ornaments than for beauty of design—which\nlatter it does not, and indeed can hardly be expected to, possess.Maria della Spina at Pisa owes its celebrity to\nthe richness of its niches and canopies, and to the sculpture which they\ncontain.In this the Italians were always at home, and probably always\nsurpassed the Northern nations.It was far otherwise with architecture,\nproperly so called.This, in the age of the pointed style, was in Italy\nso cold and unmeaning, that we do not wonder at the readiness with which\nthe Italians returned to the classical models.They are to be forgiven\nin this, but we cannot so easily forgive _our_ forefathers, who\nabandoned a style far more beautiful than that of Italy to copy one\nwhich they had themselves infinitely surpassed; and this only because\nthe Italians, unable either to comSprehend or imitate the true\nprinciples of pointed art, were forced to abandon its practice.Unfortunately for us, they had in this respect in that age sufficient\ninfluence to set the fashion to all Europe.(From Street’s\n‘Brick and Marble in the Middle Ages.’)]\n\nOf late work in Dalmatia the most remarkable is the Cathedral of\nSebenico (described in Mr.Jackson’s work), built entirely in stone and\nmarble, and without any brick or timber in its construction.It is a\ncruciform building, covered over by a waggon-vault of stone, visible\nboth inside and outside.It was commenced from the design of Messer\nAmbrosia, a Venetian architect, in 1435, to whom may be attributed the\nnave and aisles up to the string-course above nave arches.The work was\ncontinued after 1441 by another architect, Messer Giorgio, also from\nVenice, who died in 1475, leaving the building still incomplete.The\nstyle of the work is late Venetian Gothic, influenced in its later\nportions by the Renaissance revival.The cloisters of the Badia at\nCurzola, and of the Dominican and Franciscan convents at Ragusa, are\nalso beautiful specimens of late Italian Gothic.----------------------------\n\n          LONDON: PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS LIMITED,\n                   STAMFORD STREET AND CHARING CROSS.Footnote 1:\n\n  The first volume was published in 1865;

but in that case the architecture was sacrificed to the\n  sister art of painting, and is not the less bad in itself because it\n  enabled that art to display its charms with so much brilliancy.Footnote 13:\n\n  The numbers in the table must be taken only as approximative, except\n  2, 4, 6, and 7, which are borrowed from Gwilt’s ‘Public Buildings of\n  London.’\n\nFootnote 14:\n\n  The Isis-headed or Typhonian capitals cannot be quoted as an exception\n  to this rule: they are affixes, and never appear to be doing the work\n  of the pillar.Footnote 15:\n\n  See woodcuts further on.Footnote 16:\n\n  Max Müller, who is the _facile princeps_ of the linguistic school in\n  this country—in an inaugural lecture which he delivered when, it was\n  understood, he was appointed to a chair in the Strasburg\n  University—gave up all that has hitherto been contended for by his\n  followers.He admitted that language, though an invaluable aid, did\n  not suffice for the purposes of the investigation, and that the\n  results obtained by its means were not always to be depended upon.Footnote 17:\n\n  The term “Persistent Varieties” has recently been introduced, instead\n  of “race,” in ethnological nomenclature, and, if scientific accuracy\n  is aimed at, is no doubt an improvement.It is an advantage to have a\n  term which does not even in appearance prejudge any of the questions\n  between the monogenists and polygenists, and leaves undecided all the\n  questions how the variations of mankind arose.But it sounds pedantic;\n  and “race” may be understood as meaning the same thing.Footnote 18:\n\n  The whole of this subject has been carefully gone into by the Author\n  in a work entitled ‘Rude Stone Monuments’ published in 1872, to which\n  the reader is referred.Footnote 19:\n\n  All round the shores of the Mediterranean are found the traces of an\n  art which has hitherto been a stumbling-block to antiquarians.Egyptian cartouches and ornaments in Assyria, which are not Egyptian;\n  sarcophagi at Tyre, of Egyptian form, but with Phœnician inscriptions,\n  and made for Tyrian kings; Greek ornaments in Syria, which are not\n  Greek; Roman frescoes or ornaments, and architectural details at\n  Carthage, and all over Northern Africa, which however are not Roman.In short, a copying art something like our own, imitating everything,\n  understanding nothing.Franks for the\n  suggestion that all this art may be Phœnician, in other words,\n  Semitic, and I believe he is right.Footnote 20:\n\n  Had there been no Pelasgi in Greece, there probably would have been no\n  Architecture of the Grecian period.Footnote 21:\n\n  The derivation of the two words Heathen and Pagan seems to indicate\n  the relative importance of these two terms very much in the degree it\n  is here wished to express.Heathen is generally understood to be\n  derived from ἔθνος, a nation or people; and Pagan from _Pagus,\n  Pagani_, a village, or villagers.Both are used here not as terms of\n  reproach, but as indicative of their being non-Christian, which is\n  what it is wished to express, and was the original intention of the\n  term.Footnote 22:\n\n  ‘Rude Stone Monuments,’ 1 vol.Footnote 23:\n\n  The above scheme of Egyptian Chronology was published by me in the\n  ‘True Principles of Beauty in Art,’ in 1849;

They are certainly indigenous, and borrowed from some\n  older type, whether exactly what is represented here is not clear, it\n  must be confessed.It is offered as a suggestion, the reason for which\n  will be given when we come to speak of Buddhist or Saracenic\n  architecture.Footnote 73:\n\n  Rich gives its dimensions: On the north, 600 feet; south, 657; east,\n  546; and west, 408.But it is so ruinous that only an average guess\n  can be made at its original dimensions.George Smith, in the\n  ‘Athenæum’ of February 1876, wrote a letter giving an account of a\n  tablet of the Temple of Belus at Babylon he had deciphered, which\n  constitutes the only description found giving the dimensions thereof.The bottom stage was 300 feet square and 110 feet high, the second,\n  with raking sides, 260 feet square and 60 feet high, the third 200\n  feet square and 20 feet high, the fourth, fifth, and sixth each 20\n  feet high and 170, 140, and 110 feet respectively.The top stage,\n  which was the sanctuary, was 80 × 70 feet and 50 feet high, the whole\n  height being thus 300 feet, the same as the width of the base.W.\n  R. Lethaby, in his work on ‘Architecture, Mysticism, and Myth,’ gives\n  as a frontispiece a restoration according to these dimensions, the\n  appearance of which is more impressive and probably approaches more\n  closely to the actual proportions of a ziggurat than any previously\n  published, excepting that at Khorsabad, with which in general\n  proportion it coincides.—ED.]Footnote 74:\n\n  Strabo, xvi.Footnote 75:\n\n  There is a slight discrepancy in the measures owing to the absence of\n  fractions in the calculation.Footnote 76:\n\n  Loftus, ‘Chaldæa and Babylonia,’ p.Footnote 77:\n\n  This chapter and that next following may be regarded as, in all\n  essential respects an abridgment or condensation of the information\n  contained in a work published by the author in 1851, entitled, ‘The\n  Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ the only real difference\n  being that the more perfect decipherment of the inscriptions since\n  that work was published has caused some of the palaces and buildings\n  to be ascribed to different kings and dynasties from those to whom\n  they were then assigned, and proved their dates to be more modern than\n  was suspected, for the oldest at least.The order of their succession,\n  however, remains the same, and so consequently do all the\n  architectural inferences drawn from it.Those readers who may desire\n  further information on the subject are referred to the work alluded\n  to.Footnote 78:\n\n  Published in 1862, in the ‘Athenæum’ journal, No.Footnote 79:\n\n  This plan, with all the particulars here mentioned, are taken from\n  Layard’s work, which is the only authority on the subject, so that it\n  is not necessary to refer to him on every point.The plan is reduced\n  to the usual scale of 100 ft.to 1 inch, for easy comparison with the\n  dimensions of all the other edifices quoted throughout this work.Footnote 80:\n\n  The whole of the information regarding Khorsabad is taken from M.\n  Botta’s great work on the subject, and its continuation, ‘Ninive et\n  l’Assyrie,’ by M. Victor Place.Footnote 81:\n\n  These particulars are all borrowed from M. Place’s great work, ‘Ninive\n  et l’Assyrie,’ folio.Footnote 82:\n\n  Space will not admit of my entering into all the reasons for this\n  restoration here.If any one wishes for further information on the\n  subject, I must refer him to my ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis\n  Restored,’ published in 1851.Nothing has occurred during the\n  twenty-three years that have elapsed since that work was published\n  that has at all shaken my views of the correctness of the data on\n  which these restorations were based.On the contrary, every subsequent\n  research has served only more and more to convince me of their general\n  correctness, and I cannot now suggest any improvement even in details.[It should be noted that the author’s theory as to the covering over\n  of the Assyrian halls with a flat roof carried on columns has never\n  been accepted by foreign archæologists, and no trace has ever been\n  found of the foundations which would be required to carry such\n  columns.M. Place, who conducted the excavations at Khorsabad, and\n  Messrs.Perrot & Chipiez, who, among others, have devoted much time\n  and research to the subject, are of opinion that the halls were\n  vaulted.It would be difficult now to determine the possibility of\n  building vaults of thirty feet span in crude or unburnt brick, because\n  we have no means of testing the resistance to crushing which such\n  bricks might afford.The brick voussoirs found by M. Place in the\n  arches of the town gates had been prepared in special moulds, and so\n  completely dried that liquid clay had been used to cement them\n  together.In some of the large halls, far away from the walls, and in\n  some cases in the centre of the rooms, huge blocks of hard clay were\n  found with their lower surface curved and covered with a layer of\n  stucco; these masses were sometimes many metres long, one to two\n  metres wide, nearly a metre thick.According to M. Place they formed\n  part of a barrel vault covering the halls, and their size would\n  account for the immense thickness of the walls constructed to carry\n  them and resist their thrust, as well as for the peculiar shape of the\n  halls; that is, their length as compared with their breadth.The\n  sculptured slabs would seem to have been carved to be seen by a high\n  side-light, which suggests openings of some kind, just above the\n  springing of the vault, and above the flat roof of the smaller halls\n  round.—ED.]Footnote 83:\n\n  These gateways are extremely interesting to the Biblical student,\n  inasmuch as they are the only examples which enable us to understand\n  the gateways of the Temple at Jerusalem as described by Ezekiel.Their\n  dimensions are nearly the same, but the arrangement of the side\n  chambers and of gates generally are almost identical.These gates had\n  been built 100 years at least before Ezekiel wrote.Footnote 84:\n\n  Layard’s excavations here furnish us with what has not been found or\n  has been overlooked elsewhere, _e.g._, a ramp or winding staircase\n  leading to the upper storey (‘Nineveh and Babylon,’ 461).As explained\n  above, I believe the tops of the walls, which are equal to the floor\n  space below, formed such a storey.This ramp at Koyunjik would just\n  suffice to lead to them, and goes far to prove the theory.If it was\n  similarly situated at Khorsabad it would be in the part fallen away.Footnote 85:\n\n  [This assumption is speculative, no trace of such dwarf columns having\n  been found; to raise a solid wall thirteen feet thick to carry a\n  gallery seems unlikely.—ED.]Footnote 86:\n\n  This façade, as I read it, is identical with the one I erected at the\n  Crystal Palace as a representation of an Assyrian façade, long before\n  this slab was exhumed.Footnote 87:\n\n  See Rawlinson, ‘Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.Footnote 88:\n\n  It is called tomb by Strabo, lib.xvi., and Diodorus, xvii.112, 3;\n  temple, Herodotus, i.Footnote 89:\n\n  Texier shows columns on the fourth side.Weld Blundell in 1892 found a column with fluted base and Doric\n  capital, but it did not apparently belong to the palace.Footnote 91:\n\n  [It follows from what has already been pointed out in a note\n  respecting the roofs of the Assyrian palaces; if, as is contended by\n  French archæologists, the great halls were vaulted, Mr.Fergusson’s\n  theory respecting the origin of the Persian columns partly falls to\n  the ground; in that case it would seem more probable that the Persians\n  owed their columnar architecture to prototypes of wooden posts,\n  covered with metal plates, such as are described as existing in the\n  Median palaces of Ecbatana, where Cyrus, the first Persian monarch,\n  passed so many years of his life.—ED.]Footnote 92:\n\n  The woodcuts in this chapter, except the restorations, are taken from\n  Flandin and Coste’s ‘Voyage en Perse,’ except where the contrary is\n  mentioned.Footnote 93:\n\n  It is curious that neither Ker Porter, nor Texier, nor Flandin and\n  Coste, though measuring this building on the spot, could make out its\n  plan.Yet nothing can well be more certain, once it is pointed out.Footnote 94:\n\n  ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ p.[The prayer platform or talar represented on the tomb of Darius is\n  extremely unlike any constructional feature such as an upper storey,\n  and may have been placed there only to give dignity and importance to\n  the figure of the king: the hall of the Palace of Darius could easily\n  have been lighted by clerestory windows over the roofs of the smaller\n  chambers on each side.—ED.]Footnote 95:\n\n  It is very strange that this similarity, like the plan of the square\n  halls, should hitherto have escaped observation.Had any one looked at\n  the matter as a whole we should have been spared some restorations\n  which are too absurd even to merit exposure.[The restorations referred to are those in which the columns of the\n  Great Hall and of the porticoes are shown as isolated features\n  standing on the platforms.The authors of these designs would appear\n  to have been misled by Messrs.Flandin and Coste’s plan, in which the\n  drains are shown as if they ran under the line of the wall proposed by\n  Mr.Fergusson, the enclosing wall of the Great Hall.Weld\n  Blundell’s researches (1891), however, have shown that the main drain\n  really lies under the hall, and between the enclosure wall and the\n  first row of columns, and that the vertical rain-water shafts which\n  were built into the wall communicated direct with this main drain.These shafts, cut in stone, in some cases rise above the level of the\n  platform, which show that they were not intended to carry off the\n  surface water from the platform.Weld Blundell discovered also the\n  traces of the foundation of walls at the angles where shown by Mr.It would seem that in course of time the platforms have\n  become coated with so hard and uniform a covering as to suggest its\n  being the natural surface; when once broken through, however, the\n  evidences of foundations of various walls are abundant.—ED.]Footnote 96:\n\n  M. Dieulafoy’s work on the Acropolis of Susa has just (1893) appeared,\n  but, so far as the palace is concerned, his discoveries do not add\n  much to our knowledge.He appears to have arrived at the conclusion\n  that the great hall (which in plan resembles that of the palace of\n  Xerxes—Woodcut 94) was not enclosed on the south side, but was left\n  open to the court in the same way as the great reception halls of the\n  later Parthian and Sassanian kings at Al Hadhr, Firouzabad, and\n  Ctesiphon.Footnote 97:\n\n  It is now generally considered that these two buildings were tombs;\n  the projecting bosses, as shown on woodcut, are in reality sinkings,\n  and were probably decorative only.—ED.Footnote 98:\n\n  M. Dieulafoy claims to have traced the plan of a temple at Susa which\n  consisted of a sanctuary the roof of which was supported by four\n  columns, with a portico-in-antis in front, and a large open court,\n  measuring about 50 ft.by 40 ft., in the middle of which was placed\n  the fire-altar.The whole building was enclosed with a corridor or\n  passage, with entrances so arranged that no one could see inside the\n  temple from without.—ED.Flinders Petrie’s latest excavations at Medum have resulted in the\n  discovery of small brick arches over a passage in the sepulchral pit\n  of Rahotep of the 4th dynasty.Footnote 100:\n\n  Wilkinson’s ‘Egypt and Thebes,’ pp.Footnote 101:\n\n  ‘Manners and Customs of the Egyptians,’ vol.Footnote 102:\n\n  1 Kings vii.Josephus, B.

Renan (Mission de Phœnicie, Paris 1864)\n  to be of Phœnician origin, who remarks generally on their work:\n  “Phœnician tombs are generally excavated in the solid rock; their\n  architecture is the carved rock without columns; they obtained all\n  they could out of the solid rock, leaving it as they found it, with\n  more or less attempt to make it graceful; the fact that it was worked\n  before being transported suggests that as it left the quarry so it\n  remained, no sound of hammer or saw being heard during its erection.”\n  There is another tomb at Marathos also attributed to the Phœnicians,\n  which is partly cut out of the rock and partially built in large\n  blocks of masonry.Footnote 121:\n\n  In reality the monument stands exactly over the centre of the rock-cut\n  sepulchre.The section-line must, therefore, be understood to be\n  carried back about 10 feet from the face of the monument.Footnote 122:\n\n  Josephus, Ant.Footnote 123:\n\n  Beule’s excavations have proved that the outer gate of the Acropolis\n  was in front, not at the side, as here shown.‘Acropole d’Athènes.’\n  Paris, vol.Footnote 124:\n\n  For details of this see Bötticher, ‘Baumkultus der Hellenen.’ Berlin,\n  1856.Footnote 125:\n\n  Pausanias, ix.Footnote 126:\n\n  It appears that on the back of the stones laid in horizontal courses\n  were others of great size piled on the top.Footnote 127:\n\n  The same scroll exists at New Grange in Ireland, in the Island of Gozo\n  near Malta, and generally wherever chambered tumuli are found.Footnote 128:\n\n  A cast of these is to be found in the South Kensington Museum.Footnote 129:\n\n  These antæ (parastades) or responds were destined in the first case to\n  protect the angles of the wall, and in the second case to support the\n  beams carried by them and the columns between, the sun-dried brick\n  wall being not to be relied on; in the later Greek temples the walls\n  were built in stone and marble, and the parastades became therefore no\n  longer constructional necessities, being retained only as decorative\n  features, of which so many others are found in the style.Footnote 130:\n\n  Pausanias, vi.Footnote 131:\n\n  The dimensions are 94 feet by 45, covering consequently only 4230\n  feet.Footnote 132:\n\n  This refers only to the columns and antæ; the lower portion of the\n  walls, 3 feet 6 inches high, were in stone; above this clay bricks\n  were employed in building the walls, and it was to the disintegration\n  of these that we owe the preservation of the Hermes of Praxiteles,\n  which was found embedded in a thick layer of clay.At first it was\n  thought that this clay had been washed down from the neighbouring\n  <DW72>s of the hill of Kronos.Footnote 133:\n\n  M.

Thacher Clarke, who directed the American expedition in 1881, is\n  now occupied with a monograph on the subject, and a report by him was\n  published in 1882.Footnote 134:\n\n  A proto-Ionic capital of early date was found in 1882 on the summit of\n  Mount Chigri, in the Troad, by Mr.J. Thacher Clarke, and is described\n  in the American Journal of Archæology, Baltimore.Another\n  example ascribed to Phœnician artists was found at Trapeza in Cyprus,\n  and is now in the Louvre; both are of the same type as that which is\n  represented in the ivory carvings from the north-western palace of\n  Nimroud, now in the British Museum, so that the Asiatic origin of the\n  order is thus confirmed.Footnote 135:\n\n  Pausanias, viii.Footnote 137:\n\n  [The earliest example in stone at Benihasan is of less diameter than\n  the columns at Kalabscheh, so that it is difficult to draw this\n  distinction; we have already shown also (p.115 note) that wooden\n  shafts of the twelfth dynasty have been found at Kahun, and this and\n  the existence of the base proves their wooden origin.If therefore the\n  Greek Doric column was derived originally from Egypt, as Mr.Fergusson\n  believed, then its earlier wooden parentage must be accepted.Further\n  evidence on this subject however has been afforded by the discoveries\n  at Olympia, and the references in consequence made to Greek authors;\n  all these show without doubt that the columns of the temple of Hera\n  were originally in wood, and were gradually replaced by stone.The\n  theory that the pillars in Egypt or early Greece were built in\n  brickwork or rubble masonry is not borne out by the discoveries at\n  Tiryns, for the walls of the palace there, in rubble and clay mortar,\n  were of such weak construction that posts of timber were required to\n  carry the epistyle or beam, either isolated as columns or built up\n  against the wall as antæ.Fergusson’s theory that a pillar, originally copied from the\n  wooden post, is slenderer at first, and gradually departs from the\n  wood form as the style advances, is borne out by the evidence of the\n  Egypt lotus column; this, as found in the rock-cut tombs of Benihasan,\n  is of very small diameter, and quite unequal to carry the weight of\n  any stone superstructure; whereas afterwards in the temples at Thebes\n  it assumes a proportion nearer that of the earliest Greek Doric\n  example at Corinth.—ED.]Footnote 138:\n\n  These facts have all been fully elucidated by Mr.Penrose in his\n  beautiful work containing the results of his researches on the\n  Parthenon and other temples of Greece, published by the Dilettanti\n  Society.Footnote 139:\n\n  For measurements we depend on Penrose, ‘Principles of Athenian\n  Architecture,’ &c., fol.; and Cockerell, ‘The Temples of Egina and\n  Bassæ,’ Lond.The details of the system were first publicly\n  announced by Watkiss Lloyd, in a paper read to the Institute of\n  British Architects in 1859; afterwards in an appendix to Mr.Cockerell’s work, and in several minor publications.Footnote 140:\n\n  The pyramid-building kings of Lower Egypt seem to have had some\n  distinct ideas of a system of definite proportions in architectural\n  building, and to have put it into practice in the pyramid, and\n  possibly elsewhere, but it has not yet been sought for in the other\n  buildings of that age.At times I cannot help suspecting more affinity to have existed\n  between the inhabitants of Lower Egypt and those of Greece than is at\n  first sight apparent.Footnote 141:\n\n  It was called Zoophorus (_life_ or _figure bearer_).Footnote 142:\n\n  [The reasons which induced the late Mr.Fergusson to suggest an\n  “opaion,” or clerestory, were fully set forth in the ‘True Principles\n  of Beauty in Art,’ in 1849.A paper on the same subject was\n  communicated by him to the Royal Institute of British Architects in\n  1861, and published in their “Transactions” for that year.Since his\n  death, however, Mr.Penrose’s discovery that the Temple of Jupiter\n  Olympius at Athens was really octastyle has thrown a new light on the\n  question of hypæthral temples; and, as Dr.Dorpfield remarks in his\n  essay on the “Hypæthral Temple” (communicated to the R. I. B. A. on\n  Dec.19): “The words of Vitruvius have now received quite another\n  interpretation, through the excavation of the Olympieion at Athens, to\n  that which they have had up to the present.The most important proof\n  of the hypæthral lighting of the temples of antiquity has now turned\n  into a proof against the same;” and he concludes his arguments by\n  stating: “After it has been shown by the excavations that the\n  Olympieion at Athens is the sole example of a great hypæthral temple\n  mentioned by Vitruvius, we can answer this much-vexed question of the\n  lighting of the temples of antiquity in this way—that a few great\n  dipteral hypæthral temples existed, but that the Greek and Roman\n  temples had as a rule no light from above, and were only lighted from\n  the door.”—ED.]Footnote 143:\n\n  See Woodcuts Nos.Footnote 144:\n\n  Vitruvius, lib.Footnote 145:\n\n  Boeckh, Corpus Inscript.Footnote 146:\n\n  Attica, xxvi.Footnote 147:\n\n  Historia, viii, 41.Footnote 148:\n\n  Among the many attempts made to restore the interior of this temple,\n  the last and most elaborate is that by the late E. Beulé, ‘Acropole\n  d’Athènes,’ 1854, vol.; but it is also one of the worst.Indeed it is quite painful to see how the author twists his\n  authorities to meet a preconceived theory.Without going into it,\n  there is one objection which seems fatal to the whole.Like most antiquaries when in difficulties for lighting Greek temples,\n  he takes off the roof and makes the Temple of Pandrosus an open\n  courtyard, in which he plants the olive.This is so opposed to the\n  whole spirit of Greek art as to be inadmissible on general grounds,\n  but in this instance it introduces the further absurdity that the\n  Greeks opened three windows in the west wall of the temple to light\n  this courtyard which was already open to the sky!The mode of lighting\n  a temple by vertical windows is so exceptional that it would not have\n  been introduced here had any other means existed of lighting the\n  interior, and consequently the combination shown by M. Beulé seems\n  simply impossible.Footnote 149:\n\n  “Universo Templo longitudo est ccccxxv.Columnæ\n  centum viginti septem a singulis regibus factæ, lx.pedum altitudine:\n  ex iis xxxvi.cælatæ, una a Scopa.”—H.Wood places two in the pronaos and two in the posticum, thus\n  reducing the depth of the opisthodomus; beyond the pronaos he places a\n  vestibule and omits the staircases as shown on plan 159.Fergusson returned to the subject again, and published in the\n  Transactions of the Institute (session 1882-83) a revised plan, to\n  which we refer our readers.—ED.]Footnote 151:\n\n  The finial ornament is triangular in plan, and there are three scrolls\n  on the roof with mortices in them, showing that something must have\n  stood on them to support the projecting angles.Dolphins and various\n  other objects have been suggested.My own conviction is that they were\n  winged genii, most probably in bronze, and gilt like the neckings of\n  the capitals.Dorpfield is of opinion that in the Greek theatres of the best\n  period there was no proscenium, or raised stage, and that the actors\n  played their parts in the orchestra on the same level as the chorus.Professor Middleton also points out that in the earliest Greek\n  theatres built in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C.the orchestra was a\n  complete circle, the space being gradually diminished by the bringing\n  forward of the stage.—ED.]Footnote 153:\n\n  It will not be necessary to enter here into all the details of this\n  restoration.They will be found in a separate work published by me on\n  the subject, to which the reader is referred.[The student should also\n  refer to the restoration suggested by M. Pullan in the work published\n  by him and Sir Charles Newton (‘Discoveries at Halicarnassus, 1862’).In the arrangement and design of the podium it accords better with\n  other examples of Greek tombs than Mr.The three columns\n  as shown at the angle of Mr.Fergusson’s peristyle would be quite\n  repugnant to any student of Greek architecture.—ED.]Footnote 155:\n\n  The figures given in the text are all Greek feet: the difference\n  between them and English feet, being only 1¼ per cent., is hardly\n  perceptible in these dimensions, without descending to minute\n  fractions, and disturbing the comparison with Pliny’s text.Footnote 156:\n\n  The circumstance of Asoka, the Buddhist king of India B.C.She reached up and, breaking off one\nof the heavy-scented flowers, placed it in the bosom of her black dress.Sidney and K. Le Moyne were dining together.The novelty of the\nexperience had made her eyes shine like stars.She saw only the magnolia\ntree shaped like a heart, the terrace edged with low shrubbery, and\nbeyond the faint gleam that was the river.For her the dish-washing\nclatter of the kitchen was stilled, the noises from the bar were lost in\nthe ripple of the river; the scent of the grass killed the odor of stale\nbeer that wafted out through the open windows.The unshaded glare of the\nlights behind her in the house was eclipsed by the crescent edge of the\nrising moon.Sidney was experiencing the rare treat of\nafter-dinner coffee.Le Moyne, grave and contained, sat across from her.To give so much\npleasure, and so easily!No wonder the\nboy was mad about her.Another table was being brought; they were not to\nbe alone.But, what roused him in violent resentment only appealed to\nSidney\'s curiosity."A box of candy against a good cigar, they are a stolid married couple."If they loll back and watch the kitchen door, I win.If\nthey lean forward, elbows on the table, and talk, you get the candy."Sidney, who had been leaning forward, talking eagerly over the table,\nsuddenly straightened and flushed.Although the tapping of her heels was\ndulled by the grass, although she had exchanged her cap for the black\nhat, Sidney knew her at once.Was it possible--but of\ncourse not!The book of rules stated explicitly that such things were\nforbidden."Don\'t turn around," she said swiftly."It is the Miss Harrison I told\nyou about.Carlotta\'s eyes were blinded for a moment by the glare of the house\nlights.She dropped into her chair, with a flash of resentment at the\nproximity of the other table.Then she sat up, her eyes on Le Moyne\'s grave profile turned toward the\nvalley.Lucky for her that Wilson had stopped in the bar, that Sidney\'s\ninstinctive good manners forbade her staring, that only the edge of the\nsummer moon shone through the trees.She went white and clutched the\nedge of the table, with her eyes closed.She was always seeing him even in\nher dreams.K. Le\nMoyne, quite unconscious of her presence, looked down into the valley.Wilson appeared on the wooden porch above the terrace, and stood, his\neyes searching the half light for her.If he came down to her, the man\nat the next table might turn, would see her--\n\nShe rose and went swiftly back toward the hotel.All the gayety was\ngone out of the evening for her, but she forced a lightness she did not\nfeel:--\n\n"It is so dark and depressing out there--it makes me sad.""Surely you do not want to dine in the house?"The prospect of the glaring lights and soiled\nlinen of the dining-room jarred on his aesthetic sense.He wanted a\nsetting for himself, for the girl.But\nwhen, in the full light of the moon, he saw the purplish shadows under\nher eyes, he forgot his resentment.He leaned over and ran his and\ncaressingly along her bare forearm."Your wish is my law--to-night," he said softly.After all, the evening was a disappointment to him.The spontaneity had\ngone out of it, for some reason.The girl who had thrilled to his glance\nthose two mornings in his office, whose somber eyes had met his fire for\nfire, across the operating-room, was not playing up.She sat back in her\nchair, eating little, starting at every step.Her eyes, which by every\nrule of the game should have been gazing into his, were fixed on the\noilcloth-covered passage outside the door."I think, after all, you are frightened!""A little danger adds to the zest of things.You know what Nietzsche\nsays about that."Then, with an effort: "What does he say?""Two things are wanted by the true man--danger and play.Therefore he\nseeketh woman as the most dangerous of toys.""Women are dangerous only when you think of them as toys.When a man\nfinds that a woman can reason,--do anything but feel,--he regards her\nas a menace.But the reasoning woman is really less dangerous than the\nother sort."To talk careful abstractions like\nthis, with beneath each abstraction its concealed personal application,\nto talk of woman and look in her eyes, to discuss new philosophies with\ntheir freedoms, to discard old creeds and old moralities--that was\nhis game.She challenged his philosophy and gave him a chance to\ndefend it.With the conviction, as their meal went on, that Le Moyne and\nhis companion must surely have gone, she gained ease.It was only by wild driving that she got back to the hospital by ten\no\'clock.Wilson left her at the corner, well content with himself.He had had the\nrest he needed in congenial company.Even if she talked, there was nothing to tell.But\nhe felt confident that she would not talk.As he drove up the Street, he glanced across at the Page house.Sidney\nwas there on the doorstep, talking to a tall man who stood below and\nlooked up at her.Sidney was a\nmighty pretty girl.He was sorry he had\nnot kissed Carlotta good-night.He rather thought, now he looked back,\nshe had expected it.As he got out of his car at the curb, a young man who had been standing\nin the shadow of the tree-box moved quickly away.CHAPTER VIII\n\n\nSidney entered the hospital as a probationer early in August.Christine\nwas to be married in September to Palmer Howe, and, with Harriet and K.\nin the house, she felt that she could safely leave her mother.The balcony outside the parlor was already under way.On the night\nbefore she went away, Sidney took chairs out there and sat with her\nmother until the dew drove Anna to the lamp in the sewing-room and her\n"Daily Thoughts" reading.Sidney sat alone and viewed her world from this new and pleasant\nangle.She could see the garden and the whitewashed fence with its\nmorning-glories, and at the same time, by turning her head, view the\nWilson house across the Street.K. Le Moyne was upstairs in his room.She could hear him tramping up and\ndown, and catch, occasionally, the bitter-sweet odor of his old brier\npipe.All the small loose ends of her life were gathered up--except Joe.She\nwould have liked to get that clear, too.She wanted him to know how she\nfelt about it all: that she liked him as much as ever, that she did not\nwant to hurt him.But she wanted to make it clear, too, that she knew\nnow that she would never marry him.She thought she would never marry;\nbut, if she did, it would be a man doing a man\'s work in the world.Her\neyes turned wistfully to the house across the Street.\'s lamp still burned overhead, but his restless tramping about had\nceased.He must be reading--he read a great deal.A neighborhood cat came stealthily across the Street, and stared\nup at the little balcony with green-glowing eyes."Come on, Bill Taft," she said."Reginald is gone, so you are welcome.Joe Drummond, passing the house for the fourth time that evening, heard\nher voice, and hesitated uncertainly on the pavement."It\'s late; I\'d better get home.""You\'re not very kind to me, Joe."Isn\'t the kindest thing I can do\nto keep out of your way?""Not if you are hating me all the time.""Then why haven\'t you been to see me?If I have done anything--" Her\nvoice was a-tingle with virtue and outraged friendship."You haven\'t done anything but--show me where I get off."He sat down on the edge of the balcony and stared out blankly."If that\'s the way you feel about it--"\n\n"I\'m not blaming you.I was a fool to think you\'d ever care about me.I\ndon\'t know that I feel so bad--about the thing.I\'ve been around seeing\nsome other girls, and I notice they\'re glad to see me, and treat me\nright, too."There was boyish bravado in his voice."But what makes me\nsick is to have everyone saying you\'ve jilted me.""Well, we look at it in different ways; that\'s all.Then suddenly all his carefully conserved indifference fled.He bent\nforward quickly and, catching her hand, held it against his lips.The cat, finding no active antagonism, sprang up on the balcony and\nrubbed against the boy\'s quivering shoulders; a breath of air stroked\nthe morning-glory vine like the touch of a friendly hand.Sidney,\nfacing for the first time the enigma of love and despair sat, rather\nfrightened, in her chair.Daniel went back to the garden.If it wasn\'t for the folks, I\'d jump in the\nriver.I lied when I said I\'d been to see other girls."No girl\'s worth what I\'ve been going through," he retorted bitterly.I don\'t eat; I don\'t sleep--I\'m afraid\nsometimes of the way I feel.When I saw you at the White Springs with\nthat roomer chap--"\n\n"Ah!"If I\'d had a gun I\'d have killed him.I thought--" So far, out of sheer\npity, she had left her hand in his.But he made a clutch at his self-respect.He was acting like a crazy\nboy, and he was a man, all of twenty-two!"You\'ll be\nseeing him every day, I suppose."I shall also be seeing twenty or thirty other doctors, and\na hundred or so men patients, not to mention visitors."No," he said heavily, "I\'m not.If it\'s got to be someone, Sidney, I\'d\nrather have it the roomer upstairs than Wilson.There\'s a lot of talk\nabout Wilson.""It isn\'t necessary to malign my friends.""I thought perhaps, since you are going away, you would let me keep\nReginald."One would think I was about to die!I set Reginald free that day in the\ncountry.You\'ll come to see me now and then, won\'t you?""If I do, do you think you may change your mind?""I\'ve got to fight this out alone, and the less I see of you the\nbetter."If I see him playing any of his tricks around\nyou--well, he\'d better look out!"That, as it turned out, was Joe\'s farewell.He gave her a long look, blinked, and walked rapidly out\nto the Street.Some of the dignity of his retreat was lost by the fact\nthat the cat followed him, close at his heels.If this was love, she did not want\nit--this strange compound of suspicion and despair, injured pride and\nthreats.John went back to the bathroom.Lovers in fiction were of two classes--the accepted ones, who\nloved and trusted, and the rejected ones, who took themselves away in\ndespair, but at least took themselves away.The thought of a future\nwith Joe always around a corner, watching her, obsessed her.She even shed a tear or two, very surreptitiously;\nand then, being human and much upset, and the cat startling her by its\nsudden return and selfish advances, she shooed it off the veranda and\nset an imaginary dog after it.Whereupon, feeling somewhat better, she\nwent in and locked the balcony window and proceeded upstairs.There was a movement inside, the sound of a book put down."I may not see you in the morning.From the sounds, she judged that he was putting on his shabby gray\ncoat.The next moment he had opened the door and stepped out into the\ncorridor.I started downstairs a while ago, but you had a\nvisitor."He knows now that I--that I shall not marry him.""I believe you think I should have married him.""I am only putting myself in his place and realizing--When do you\nleave?"Then, hurriedly:--\n\n"I got a little present for you--nothing much, but your mother was quite\nwilling.He went back into his room, and returned with a small box."With all sorts of good luck," he said, and placed it in her hands.Because, if you would rather have something else--"\n\nShe opened the box with excited fingers.Ticking away on its satin bed\nwas a small gold watch."You\'ll need it, you see," he explained nervously, "It wasn\'t\nextravagant under the circumstances.Your mother\'s watch, which you had\nintended to take, had no second-hand.You\'ll need a second-hand to take\npulses, you know.""A watch," said Sidney, eyes on it."A dear little watch, to pin on and\nnot put in a pocket."I was afraid you might think it presumptuous," he said."I haven\'t any\nright, of course.I thought of flowers--but they fade and what have you?You said that, you know, about Joe\'s roses.And then, your mother said\nyou wouldn\'t be offended--"\n\n"Don\'t apologize for making me so happy!"After that she must pin it on, and slip in to stand before his mirror\nand inspect the result.It gave Le Moyne a queer thrill to see her there\nin the room among his books and his pipes.It make him a little sick,\ntoo, in view of to-morrow and the thousand-odd to-morrows when she would\nnot be there."I\'ve kept you up shamefully,\'" she said at last, "and you get up so\nearly.I shall write you a note from the hospital, delivering a little\nlecture on extravagance--because how can I now, with this joy shining on\nme?And about how to keep Katie in order about your socks, and all sorts\nof things.She had moved to the door, and he followed her, stooping a little to\npass under the low chandelier."Good-bye--and God bless you."She went out, and he closed the door softly behind her.CHAPTER IX\n\n\nSidney never forgot her early impressions of the hospital, although they\nwere chaotic enough at first.There were uniformed young women\ncoming and going, efficient, cool-eyed, low of voice.There were\nmedicine-closets with orderly rows of labeled bottles, linen-rooms with\ngreat stacks of sheets and towels, long vistas of shining floors and\nlines of beds.There were brisk internes with duck clothes and brass\nbuttons, who eyed her with friendly, patronizing glances.There were\nbandages and dressings, and great white screens behind which were played\nlittle or big dramas, baths or deaths, as the case might be.And over\nall brooded the mysterious authority of the superintendent of the\ntraining-school, dubbed the Head, for short.Twelve hours a day, from seven to seven, with the off-duty intermission,\nSidney labored at tasks which revolted her soul.She swept and\ndusted the wards, cleaned closets, folded sheets and towels, rolled\nbandages--did everything but nurse the sick, which was what she had come\nto do.She sat on the edge of her narrow white\nbed and soaked her aching feet in hot water and witch hazel, and\npracticed taking pulses on her own slender wrist, with K.Out of all the long, hot days, two periods stood out clearly, to be\nwaited for and cherished.One was when, early in the afternoon, with\nthe ward in spotless order, the shades drawn against the August sun, the\ntables covered with their red covers, and the only sound the drone of\nthe bandage-machine as Sidney steadily turned it, Dr.Max passed the\ndoor on his way to the surgical ward beyond, and gave her a cheery\ngreeting.At these times Sidney\'s heart beat almost in time with the\nticking of the little watch.The other hour was at twilight, when, work over for the day, the night\nnurse, with her rubber-soled shoes and tired eyes and jangling keys,\nhaving reported and received the night orders, the nurses gathered in\ntheir small parlor for prayers.It was months before Sidney got over the\nexaltation of that twilight hour, and never did it cease to bring her\nhealing and peace.In a way, it crystallized for her what the day\'s work\nmeant: charity and its sister, service, the promise of rest and peace.Into the little parlor filed the nurses, and knelt, folding their tired\nhands."The Lord is my shepherd," read the Head out of her worn Bible; "I shall\nnot want."And the nurses: "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth\nme beside the still waters."And so on through the psalm to the assurance at the end, "And I will\ndwell in the house of the Lord forever."Now and then there was a death\nbehind one of the white screens.It caused little change in the routine\nof the ward.A nurse stayed behind the screen, and her work was done by\nthe others.When everything was over, the time was recorded exactly on\nthe record, and the body was taken away.At first it seemed to Sidney that she could not stand this nearness to\ndeath.She thought the nurses hard because they took it quietly.Then\nshe found that it was only stoicism, resignation, that they had learned.These things must be, and the work must go on.Some such patient detachment must be that of the\nangels who keep the Great Record.On her first Sunday half-holiday she was free in the morning, and went\nto church with her mother, going back to the hospital after the service.So it was two weeks before she saw Le Moyne again.Even then, it was\nonly for a short time.Christine and Palmer Howe came in to see her, and\nto inspect the balcony, now finished.But Sidney and Le Moyne had a few words together first.She was\na trifle subdued, with a puzzled look in her blue eyes.Her mouth was\ntender, as always, but he thought it drooped.There was a new atmosphere\nof wistfulness about the girl that made his heart ache.They were alone in the little parlor with its brown lamp and blue silk\nshade, and its small nude Eve--which Anna kept because it had been a\ngift from her husband, but retired behind a photograph of the minister,\nso that only the head and a bare arm holding the apple appeared above\nthe reverend gentleman.K. never smoked in the parlor, but by sheer force of habit he held the\npipe in his teeth.Aunt Harriet, who left you her love,\nhas had the complete order for the Lorenz trousseau.She and I have\npicked out a stunning design for the wedding dress.I thought I\'d ask\nyou about the veil.Do you like this new\nfashion of draping the veil from behind the coiffure in the back--"\n\nSidney had been sitting on the edge of her chair, staring."There," she said--"I knew it!They\'re making an\nold woman of you already.""Miss Lorenz likes the new method, but my personal preference is for the\nold way, with the bride\'s face covered.""Katie has a new prescription--recipe--for bread.It has more bread and\nfewer air-holes.One cake of yeast--"\n\nSidney sprang to her feet."Because you rent a room in\nthis house is no reason why you should give up your personality and\nyour--intelligence.But Katie has\nmade bread without masculine assistance for a good many years, and if\nChristine can\'t decide about her own veil she\'d better not get married.Mother says you water the flowers every evening, and lock up the house\nbefore you go to bed.I--I never meant you to adopt the family!"K. removed his pipe and gazed earnestly into the bowl."Bill Taft has had kittens under the porch," he said."And the\ngroceryman has been sending short weight.We\'ve bought scales now, and\nweigh everything.""Dear child, I am doing these things because I like to do them.For--for\nsome time I\'ve been floating, and now I\'ve got a home.Every time I\nlock up the windows at night, or cut a picture out of a magazine as a\nsuggestion to your Aunt Harriet, it\'s an anchor to windward."Sidney gazed helplessly at his imperturbable face.He seemed older than\nshe had recalled him: the hair over his ears was almost white.That was Palmer Howe\'s age, and Palmer seemed like a\nboy.But he held himself more erect than he had in the first days of his\noccupancy of the second-floor front."And now," he said cheerfully, "what about yourself?You\'ve lost a lot\nof illusions, of course, but perhaps you\'ve gained ideals."Life," observed Sidney, with the wisdom of two weeks out in the world,\n"life is a terrible thing, K. We think we\'ve got it, and--it\'s got us.""When I think of how simple I used to think it all was!One grew up and\ngot married, and--and perhaps had children.And when one got very\nold, one died.Lately, I\'ve been seeing that life really consists of\nexceptions--children who don\'t grow up, and grown-ups who die before\nthey are old.And"--this took an effort, but she looked at him\nsquarely--"and people who have children, but are not married."All knowledge that is worth while hurts in the getting."Sidney got up and wandered around the room, touching its little familiar\nobjects with tender hands.There was this curious\nelement in his love for her, that when he was with her it took on the\nguise of friendship and deceived even himself.It was only in the lonely\nhours that it took on truth, became a hopeless yearning for the touch of\nher hand or a glance from her clear eyes.Sidney, having picked up the minister\'s picture, replaced it absently,\nso that Eve stood revealed in all her pre-apple innocence."There is something else," she said absently."I cannot talk it over\nwith mother.There is a girl in the ward--"\n\n"A patient?"She has had typhoid, but she is a little\nbetter."At first I couldn\'t bear to go near her.I shivered when I had to\nstraighten her bed.I--I\'m being very frank, but I\'ve got to talk this\nout with someone.I worried a lot about it, because, although at first I\nhated her, now I don\'t.She looked at K. defiantly, but there was no disapproval in his eyes.She\'ll be able to\ngo out soon.Don\'t you think something ought to be done to keep her\nfrom--going back?"She was so young to face all this;\nand yet, since face it she must, how much better to have her do it\nsquarely."Does she want to change her mode of life?"She\ncares a great deal for some man.The other day I propped her up in bed\nand gave her a newspaper, and after a while I found the paper on the\nfloor, and she was crying.The other patients avoid her, and it was\nsome time before I noticed it.The next day she told me that the man\nwas going to marry some one else.\'He wouldn\'t marry me, of course,\' she\nsaid; \'but he might have told me.\'"Le Moyne did his best, that afternoon in the little parlor, to provide\nSidney with a philosophy to carry her through her training.He told her\nthat certain responsibilities were hers, but that she could not reform\nthe world.Broad charity, tenderness, and healing were her province."Help them all you can," he finished, feeling inadequate and hopelessly\ndidactic."Cure them; send them out with a smile; and--leave the rest to\nthe Almighty."Sidney was resigned, but not content.Newly facing the evil of the\nworld, she was a rampant reformer at once.Only the arrival of Christine\nand her fiance saved his philosophy from complete rout.He had time for\na question between the ring of the bell and Katie\'s deliberate progress\nfrom the kitchen to the front door.He stops at the door of the ward and speaks to me.It\nmakes me quite distinguished, for a probationer.Usually, you know, the\nstaff never even see the probationers.""I think he is very wonderful," said Sidney valiantly.Christine Lorenz, while not large, seemed to fill the little room.Her\nvoice, which was frequent and penetrating, her smile, which was wide\nand showed very white teeth that were a trifle large for beauty, her\nall-embracing good nature, dominated the entire lower floor.K., who had\nmet her before, retired into silence and a corner.Young Howe smoked a\ncigarette in the hall.said Christine, and put her cheek against Sidney\'s.Palmer gives you a month to tire of it\nall; but I said--"\n\n"I take that back," Palmer spoke indolently from the corridor."There\nis the look of willing martyrdom in her face.I\'ve\nbrought some nuts for him.""Reginald is back in the woods again.""Now, look here," he said solemnly."When we arranged about these rooms,\nthere were certain properties that went with them--the lady next door\nwho plays Paderewski\'s \'Minuet\' six hours a day, and K. here, and\nReginald.If you must take something to the woods, why not the minuet\nperson?"Howe was a good-looking man, thin, smooth-shaven, aggressively well\ndressed.This Sunday afternoon, in a cutaway coat and high hat, with\nan English malacca stick, he was just a little out of the picture.The\nStreet said that he was "wild," and that to get into the Country Club\nset Christine was losing more than she was gaining.Christine had stepped out on the balcony, and was speaking to K. just\ninside."It\'s rather a queer way to live, of course," she said."But Palmer is a\npauper, practically.We are going to take our meals at home for a while.You see, certain things that we want we can\'t have if we take a house--a\ncar, for instance.We\'ll need one for running out to the Country Club to\ndinner.Of course, unless father gives me one for a wedding present, it\nwill be a cheap one.And we\'re getting the Rosenfeld boy to drive it.He\'s crazy about machinery, and he\'ll come for practically nothing."K. had never known a married couple to take two rooms and go to the\nbride\'s mother\'s for meals in order to keep a car.Also, certain sophistries of his former world about a cheap\nchauffeur being costly in the end rose in his mind and were carefully\nsuppressed."You\'ll find a car a great comfort, I\'m sure," he said politely.She liked his graying hair\nand steady eyes, and insisted on considering his shabbiness a pose.She\nwas conscious that she made a pretty picture in the French window, and\npreened herself like a bright bird."You\'ll come out with us now and then, I hope.""Isn\'t it odd to think that we are going to be practically one family!"He caught the flash of Christine\'s smile, and smiled back.Christine was\nglad she had decided to take the rooms, glad that K. lived there.This\nthing of marriage being the end of all things was absurd.A married\nwoman should have men friends; they kept her up.She would take him to\nthe Country Club.Across the Street, the Rosenfeld boy had stopped by Dr.Wilson\'s car,\nand was eyeing it with the cool, appraising glance of the street\nboy whose sole knowledge of machinery has been acquired from the\nclothes-washer at home.Joe Drummond, eyes carefully ahead, went up the\nStreet.McKee\'s, stood in the doorway and fanned herself\nwith her apron.Max Wilson came out of the house and got into his car.For a minute, perhaps, all the actors, save Carlotta and Dr.It was that bete noir of the playwright, an ensemble; K. Le\nMoyne and Sidney, Palmer Howe, Christine, Tillie, the younger Wilson,\nJoe, even young Rosenfeld, all within speaking distance, almost touching\ndistance, gathered within and about the little house on a side street\nwhich K. at first grimly and now tenderly called "home."CHAPTER X\n\n\nOn Monday morning, shortly after the McKee prolonged breakfast was over,\na small man of perhaps fifty, with iron-gray hair and a sparse goatee,\nmade his way along the Street.He moved with the air of one having a\ndefinite destination but a by no means definite reception.As he walked along he eyed with a professional glance the ailanthus and\nmaple trees which, with an occasional poplar, lined the Street.McKee\'s boarding-house he stopped.Owing to a slight change\nin the grade of the street, the McKee house had no stoop, but one flat\ndoorstep.Thus it was possible to ring the doorbell from the pavement,\nand this the stranger did.It gave him a curious appearance of being\nready to cut and run if things were unfavorable.She recognized him at once, but no smile met the nervous one\nthat formed itself on the stranger\'s face."Oh, it\'s you, is it?""I was thinking, as I came along," he said, "that you and the neighbors\nhad better get after these here caterpillars."If you want to see Tillie, she\'s busy.""I only want to say how-d \'ye-do.A certain doggedness took the place of his tentative smile."I\'ll say it to myself, I guess.I don\'t want any unpleasantness, but\nI\'ve come a good ways to see her and I\'ll hang around until I do."McKee knew herself routed, and retreated to the kitchen."You\'re wanted out front," she said.Only, my advice to you is, don\'t be a fool."The hands with which she tied a white apron\nover her gingham one were shaking.Her visitor had accepted the open door as permission to enter and was\nstanding in the hall.He went rather white himself when he saw Tillie coming toward him down\nthe hall.He knew that for Tillie this visit would mean that he was\nfree--and he was not free.Sheer terror of his errand filled him."Well, here I am, Tillie."said poor Tillie, with the\nquestion in her eyes."I was passing through, and I just thought I\'d call around and tell\nyou--My God, Tillie, I\'m glad to see you!"She made no reply, but opened the door into the cool and, shaded little\nparlor.He followed her in and closed the door behind him.Playing with paper dolls--that\'s the latest."Tillie sat down suddenly on one of the stiff chairs.Her lips were as\nwhite as her face."I thought, when I saw you--"\n\n"I was afraid you\'d think that."Tillie\'s hands twisted nervously in her lap.Schwitter\'s eyes were fixed on the window, which looked back on the\nMcKee yard."That spiraea back there\'s not looking very good.If you\'ll save the\ncigar butts around here and put them in water, and spray it, you\'ll kill\nthe lice.""I don\'t know why you come around bothering me," she said dully."I\'ve\nbeen getting along all right; now you come and upset everything."Schwitter rose and took a step toward her."Well, I\'ll tell you why I came.I ain\'t getting any\nyounger, am I?Time\'s going on, and I\'m wanting you all the time.What\'ve I got out of life, anyhow?"What\'s that got to do with me?""You\'re lonely, too, ain\'t you?"And, anyhow, there\'s always a crowd\nhere.""You can be lonely in a crowd, and I guess--is there any one around here\nyou like better than me?""We can talk our heads off and\nnot get anywhere.You\'ve got a wife living, and, unless you intend to do\naway with her, I guess that\'s all there is to it."Haven\'t you got a right to be happy?"She was quick of wit, and she read his tone as well as his words."You get out of here--and get out quick!"She had jumped to her feet; but he only looked at her with understanding\neyes."That\'s the way I thought of it at first.Maybe I\'ve\njust got used to the idea, but it doesn\'t seem so bad to me now.Here\nare you, drudging for other people when you ought to have a place all\nyour own--and not gettin\' younger any more than I am.Here\'s both of us\nlonely.I\'d be a good husband to you, Till--because, whatever it\'d be in\nlaw, I\'d be your husband before God."Tillie cowered against the door, her eyes on his.Here before her,\nembodied in this man, stood all that she had wanted and never had.He\nmeant a home, tenderness, children, perhaps.He turned away from the\nlook in her eyes and stared out of the front window."Them poplars out there ought to be taken away," he said heavily.Tillie found her voice at last:--\n\n"I couldn\'t do it, Mr."Perhaps, if you got used to the idea--"\n\n"What\'s that to do with the right and wrong of it?"It seems to\nme that the Lord would make an exception of us if He knew the\ncircumstances.Perhaps, after you get used to the idea--What I thought\nwas like this.I\'ve got a little farm about seven miles from the city\nlimits, and the tenant on it says that nearly every Sunday somebody\nmotors out from town and wants a chicken-and-waffle supper.There ain\'t\nmuch in the nursery business anymore.These landscape fellows buy their\nstuff direct, and the middleman\'s out.I\'ve got a good orchard, and\nthere\'s a spring, so I could put running water in the house.I\'d be good\nto you, Tillie,--I swear it."Don\'t a man respect a woman that\'s got courage enough to give up\neverything for him?"Tillie was crying softly into her apron.He put a work-hardened hand on\nher head."It isn\'t as if I\'d run around after women," he said."You\'re the only\none, since Maggie--" He drew a long breath."I\'ll give you time to think\nit over.Suppose I stop in to-morrow morning.It doesn\'t commit you to\nanything to talk it over."There had been no passion in the interview, and there was none in\nthe touch of his hand.He was not young, and the tragic loneliness of\napproaching old age confronted him.He was trying to solve his problem\nand Tillie\'s, and what he had found was no solution, but a compromise."To-morrow morning, then," he said quietly, and went out the door.All that hot August morning Tillie worked in a daze.McKee watched\nher and said nothing.She interpreted the girl\'s white face and set lips\nas the result of having had to dismiss Schwitter again, and looked for\ntime to bring peace, as it had done before.Le Moyne came late to his midday meal.For once, the mental anaesthesia\nof endless figures had failed him.On his way home he had drawn his\nsmall savings from the bank, and mailed them, in cash and registered, to\na back street in the slums of a distant city.He had done this before,\nand always with a feeling of exaltation, as if, for a time at least,\nthe burden he carried was lightened.But to-day he experienced no\ncompensatory relief.Life was dull and stale to him, effort ineffectual.At thirty a man should look back with tenderness, forward with hope.K.\nLe Moyne dared not look back, and had no desire to look ahead into empty\nyears.Although he ate little, the dining-room was empty when he finished.Usually he had some cheerful banter for Tillie, to which she responded\nin kind.But, what with the heat and with heaviness of spirit, he did\nnot notice her depression until he rose."Why, you\'re not sick, are you, Tillie?"If I send you two tickets to a\nroof garden where there\'s a variety show, can\'t you take a friend and go\nto-night?""Thanks; I guess I\'ll not go out."Then, unexpectedly, she bent her head against a chair-back and fell to\nsilent crying.Then:--\n\n"Now--tell me about it.""I\'m just worried; that\'s all.""Let\'s see if we can\'t fix up the worries."Then I\'m the person to tell it to.I--I\'m pretty much a lost soul\nmyself."He put an arm over her shoulders and drew her up, facing him."Suppose we go into the parlor and talk it out.I\'ll bet things are not\nas bad as you imagine."But when, in the parlor that had seen Mr.Schwitter\'s strange proposal\nof the morning, Tillie poured out her story, K."The wicked part is that I want to go with him," she finished."I keep\nthinking about being out in the country, and him coming into supper, and\neverything nice for him and me cleaned up and waiting--O my God!I\'ve\nalways been a good woman until now.""I--I understand a great deal better than you think I do.The only thing is--"\n\n"Go on."You might go on and be very happy.And as for the--for his wife, it\nwon\'t do her any harm.But when they come, and you cannot give\nthem a name--don\'t you see?God forbid that\nI--But no happiness is built on a foundation of wrong.It\'s been tried\nbefore, Tillie, and it doesn\'t pan out."He was conscious of a feeling of failure when he left her at last.She\nhad acquiesced in what he said, knew he was right, and even promised\nto talk to him again before making a decision one way or the other.But\nagainst his abstractions of conduct and morality there was pleading in\nTillie the hungry mother-heart; law and creed and early training were\nfighting against the strongest instinct of the race.CHAPTER XI\n\n\nThe hot August days dragged on.Merciless sunlight beat in through the\nslatted shutters of ward windows.At night, from the roof to which the\nnurses retired after prayers for a breath of air, lower surrounding\nroofs were seen to be covered with sleepers.Children dozed precariously\non the edge of eternity; men and women sprawled in the grotesque\npostures of sleep.There was a sort of feverish irritability in the air.Even the nurses,\nstoically unmindful of bodily discomfort, spoke curtly or not at all.Miss Dana, in Sidney\'s ward, went down with a low fever, and for a day\nor so Sidney and Miss Grange got along as best they could.Sidney worked\nlike two or more, performed marvels of bed-making, learned to give\nalcohol baths for fever with the maximum of result and the minimum\nof time, even made rounds with a member of the staff and came through\ncreditably.Ed Wilson had sent a woman patient into the ward, and his visits\nwere the breath of life to the girl.Some of them will\ntry to take it out of you.It\'s been hot, and of course it\'s troublesome to tell\nme everything.I--I think they\'re all very kind."He reached out a square, competent hand, and put it over hers."We miss you in the Street," he said."It\'s all sort of dead there since\nyou left.Joe Drummond doesn\'t moon up and down any more, for one thing.What was wrong between you and Joe, Sidney?""I didn\'t want to marry him; that\'s all."Then, seeing her face:--\n\n"But you\'re right, of course.Don\'t marry anyone unless you can\'t live\nwithout him.That\'s been my motto, and here I am, still single."During the lonely times when Max was at college and in Europe, he had\nwatched her grow from a child to a young girl.He did not suspect for\na moment that in that secret heart of hers he sat newly enthroned, in\na glow of white light, as Max\'s brother; that the mere thought that\nhe lived in Max\'s house (it was, of course Max\'s house to her), sat at\nMax\'s breakfast table, could see him whenever he wished, made the touch\nof his hand on hers a benediction and a caress.Sidney finished folding linen and went back to the ward.Almost every bed had its visitor beside it; but\nSidney, running an eye over the ward, found the girl of whom she had\nspoken to Le Moyne quite alone.She was propped up in bed, reading; but\nat each new step in the corridor hope would spring into her eyes and die\nagain.If these people would only get out and let me read\nin peace--Say, sit down and talk to me, won\'t you?It beats the mischief\nthe way your friends forget you when you\'re laid up in a place like\nthis.""People can\'t always come at visiting hours."A girl I knew was sick here last year, and it wasn\'t too hot for me to\ntrot in twice a week with a bunch of flowers for her.Do you think she\'s\nbeen here once?Then, suddenly:--\n\n"You know that man I told you about the other day?""It was a shock to me, that\'s all.I didn\'t want you to think I\'d break\nmy heart over any fellow.All I meant was, I wished he\'d let me know."They looked unnaturally large and somber in\nher face.Her hair had been cut short, and her nightgown, open at the\nneck, showed her thin throat and prominent clavicles."You\'re from the city, aren\'t you, Miss Page?""You told me the street, but I\'ve forgotten it."Sidney repeated the name of the Street, and slipped a fresh pillow under\nthe girl\'s head."The evening paper says there\'s a girl going to be married on your\nstreet."A friend of mine is going to be married.I--I don\'t remember the man\'s name."I suppose you\'ll be going to that wedding?""If I ever get time to have a dress made, I\'ll surely go."Toward six o\'clock the next morning, the night nurse was making out her\nreports.On one record, which said at the top, "Grace Irving, age 19,"\nand an address which, to the initiated, told all her story, the night\nnurse wrote:--\n\n"Did not sleep at all during night.Face set and eyes staring, but\ncomplains of no pain.Carlotta Harrison, back from her vacation, reported for duty the next\nmorning, and was assigned to E ward, which was Sidney\'s.She gave Sidney\na curt little nod, and proceeded to change the entire routine with the\nthoroughness of a Central American revolutionary president.Sidney, who\nhad yet to learn that with some people authority can only assert itself\nby change, found herself confused, at sea, half resentful.Once she ventured a protest:--\n\n"I\'ve been taught to do it that way, Miss Harrison.If my method is\nwrong, show me what you want, and I\'ll do my best.""I am not responsible for what you have been taught.And you will not\nspeak back when you are spoken to."Small as the incident was, it marked a change in Sidney\'s position\nin the ward.She got the worst off-duty of the day, or none.Small\nhumiliations were hers: late meals, disagreeable duties, endless and\noften unnecessary tasks.Even Miss Grange, now reduced to second place,\nremonstrated with her senior."I think a certain amount of severity is good for a probationer," she\nsaid, "but you are brutal, Miss Harrison."She\'s going to be one of the best nurses in\nthe house."Wilson\'s pet\nprobationer, that I don\'t always say \'please\' when I ask her to change a\nbed or take a temperature."Miss Grange was not lacking in keenness.She died not go to the Head,\nwhich is unethical under any circumstances; but gradually there spread\nthrough the training-school a story that Carlotta Harrison was jealous\nof the new Page girl, Dr.Things were still highly\nunpleasant in the ward, but they grew much better when Sidney was off\nduty.She was asked to join a small class that was studying French at\nnight.As ignorant of the cause of her popularity as of the reason of\nher persecution, she went steadily on her way.For the first time, she was facing problems and\ndemanding an answer.Why must there be Grace Irvings in the world?Why\nmust the healthy babies of the obstetric ward go out to the slums and\ncome back, in months or years, crippled for the great fight by the\nhandicap of their environment, rickety, tuberculous, twisted?Why need\nthe huge mills feed the hospitals daily with injured men?And there were other things that she thought of.Every night, on her\nknees in the nurses\' parlor at prayers, she promised, if she were\naccepted as a nurse, to try never to become calloused, never to regard\nher patients as "cases," never to allow the cleanliness and routine of\nher ward to delay a cup of water to the thirsty, or her arms to a sick\nchild.On the whole, the world was good, she found.And, of all the good things\nin it, the best was service.True, there were hot days and restless\nnights, weary feet, and now and then a heartache.But to offset these there was the sound of Dr.Max\'s step\nin the corridor, and his smiling nod from the door; there was a "God\nbless you" now and then for the comfort she gave; there were wonderful\nnights on the roof under the stars, until K.While Sidney watched the stars from her hospital roof, while all around\nher the slum children, on other roofs, fought for the very breath of\nlife, others who knew and loved her watched the stars, too.K. was\nhaving his own troubles in those days.Late at night, when Anna and\nHarriet had retired, he sat on the balcony and thought of many things.He had noticed that her lips were rather blue,\nand had called in Dr.Anna was not to\nbe told, or Sidney."Sidney can\'t help any," said Harriet, "and for Heaven\'s sake let her\nhave her chance.If you tell her anything at all, she\'ll have Sidney here, waiting on her\nhand and foot."And Le Moyne, fearful of urging too much because his own heart was\ncrying out to have the girl back, assented.The boy did not seem to get over the\nthing the way he should.Now and then Le Moyne, resuming his old habit\nof wearying himself into sleep, would walk out into the country.On one\nsuch night he had overtaken Joe, tramping along with his head down.Joe had not wanted his company, had plainly sulked."I\'ll not talk," he said; "but, since we\'re going the same way, we might\nas well walk together."But after a time Joe had talked, after all.It was not much at first--a\nfeverish complaint about the heat, and that if there was trouble in\nMexico he thought he\'d go."Wait until fall, if you\'re thinking of it," K. advised."This is tepid\ncompared with what you\'ll get down there.""I\'ve got to get away from here."Since the scene at the White Springs Hotel,\nboth knew that no explanation was necessary."It isn\'t so much that I mind her turning me down," Joe said, after a\nsilence."A girl can\'t marry all the men who want her.But I don\'t\nlike this hospital idea.Sometimes"--he turned bloodshot eyes on Le Moyne--"I think she went\nbecause she was crazy about somebody there.""She went because she wanted to be useful."For almost twenty minutes they tramped on without speech.They had made\na circle, and the lights of the city were close again.K. stopped and\nput a kindly hand on Joe\'s shoulder."A man\'s got to stand up under a thing like this, you know.I mean, it\nmustn\'t be a knockout."I\'ll tell you what\'s\neating me up," he exploded.Don\'t talk to me about her\ngoing to the hospital to be useful.She\'s crazy about him, and he\'s as\ncrooked as a dog\'s hind leg."He felt immeasurably old beside Joe\'s boyish blustering--old and rather\nhelpless.Some of these days I\'ll get something on him.Then\nshe\'ll know what to think of her hero!""That\'s not quite square, is it?"Joe had left him then, wheeling abruptly off into the shadows.K. had\ngone home alone, rather uneasy.There seemed to be mischief in the very\nair.CHAPTER XII\n\n\nTillie was gone.Oddly enough, the last person to see her before she left was Harriet\nKennedy.Schwitter\'s visit, Harriet\'s \nmaid had announced a visitor.She had taken expensive rooms\nin a good location, and furnished them with the assistance of a decor\nstore.Then she arranged with a New York house to sell her models on\ncommission.Her short excursion to New York had marked for Harriet the beginning of\na new heaven and a new earth.Here, at last, she found people speaking\nher own language.She ventured a suggestion to a manufacturer, and found\nit greeted, not, after the manner of the Street, with scorn, but with\napproval and some surprise."About once in ten years," said Mr.Arthurs, "we have a woman from out\nof town bring us a suggestion that is both novel and practical.When we\nfind people like that, we watch them.They climb, madame,--climb."Harriet\'s climbing was not so rapid as to make her dizzy; but business\nwas coming.The first time she made a price of seventy-five dollars\nfor an evening gown, she went out immediately after and took a drink of\nwater.She began to learn little quips of the feminine mind: that a woman who\ncan pay seventy-five will pay double that sum; that it is not considered\ngood form to show surprise at a dressmaker\'s prices, no matter how high\nthey may be; that long mirrors and artificial light help sales--no woman\nover thirty but was grateful for her pink-and-gray room with its soft\nlights.She took a lesson\nfrom the New York modistes, and wore trailing black gowns.She strapped\nher thin figure into the best corset she could get, and had her black\nhair marcelled and dressed high.And, because she was a lady by birth\nand instinct, the result was not incongruous, but refined and rather\nimpressive.She took her business home with her at night, lay awake scheming, and\nwakened at dawn to find fresh color combinations in the early sky.She\nwakened early because she kept her head tied up in a towel, so that her\nhair need be done only three times a week.That and the corset were the\npenalties she paid.Her high-heeled shoes were a torment, too; but in\nthe work-room she kicked them off.To this new Harriet, then, came Tillie in her distress.Tillie was\nrather overwhelmed at first.The Street had always considered Harriet\n"proud."But Tillie\'s urgency was great, her methods direct.While she worked at the fingers of\nher silk gloves, what Harriet took for nervousness was pure abstraction."It\'s very nice of you to come to see me.Tillie surveyed the rooms, and Harriet caught her first full view of her\nface.If you have had any words--"\n\n"It\'s not that.I\'d like to talk to you, if you don\'t\nmind.""I\'m up against something, and I can\'t seem to make up my mind.Last\nnight I said to myself, \'I\'ve got to talk to some woman who\'s not\nmarried, like me, and not as young as she used to be.McKee: she\'s a widow, and wouldn\'t understand.\'"Harriet\'s voice was a trifle sharp as she replied.She never lied about\nher age, but she preferred to forget it."I wish you\'d tell me what you\'re getting at.""It ain\'t the sort of thing to come to too sudden.You and I can pretend all we like, Miss Harriet; but we\'re not getting\nall out of life that the Lord meant us to have.You\'ve got them wax\nfigures instead of children, and I have mealers."A little spot of color came into Harriet\'s cheek.Regardless of the corset, she bent forward.Ten years more at the most, and I\'m through.Can\'t get around the tables as I used to.Why, yesterday I\nput sugar into Mr.Le Moyne\'s coffee--well, never mind about that.Now\nI\'ve got a chance to get a home, with a good man to look after me--I\nlike him pretty well, and he thinks a lot of me.""No\'m," said Tillie; "that\'s it."The gray curtains with their pink cording swung gently in the open\nwindows.From the work-room came the distant hum of a sewing-machine and\nthe sound of voices.Harriet sat with her hands in her lap and listened\nwhile Tillie poured out her story.She told it\nall, consistently and with unconscious pathos: her little room under the\nroof at Mrs.McKee\'s, and the house in the country; her loneliness,\nand the loneliness of the man; even the faint stirrings of potential\nmotherhood, her empty arms, her advancing age--all this she knit into\nthe fabric of her story and laid at Harriet\'s feet, as the ancients put\ntheir questions to their gods.Too much that Tillie poured out to her found\nan echo in her own breast.What was this thing she was striving for but\na substitute for the real things of life--love and tenderness, children,\na home of her own?Quite suddenly she loathed the gray carpet on the\nfloor, the pink chairs, the shaded lamps.Tillie was no longer the\nwaitress at a cheap boarding-house.She loomed large, potential,\ncourageous, a woman who held life in her hands."She thinks any woman\'s a fool to take up with a man.""You\'re giving me a terrible responsibility, Tillie, if you\'re asking my\nadvice."I\'m asking what you\'d do if it happened to you.Suppose you had\nno people that cared anything about you, nobody to disgrace, and all\nyour life nobody had really cared anything about you.And then a chance\nlike this came along."I don\'t know," said poor Harriet."It seems to me--I\'m afraid I\'d be\ntempted.It does seem as if a woman had the right to be happy, even\nif--"\n\nHer own words frightened her.It was as if some hidden self, and not\nshe, had spoken.She hastened to point out the other side of the matter,\nthe insecurity of it, the disgrace.Like K., she insisted that no right\ncan be built out of a wrong.Tillie sat and smoothed her gloves.At\nlast, when Harriet paused in sheer panic, the girl rose."I know how you feel, and I don\'t want you to take the responsibility of\nadvising me," she said quietly."I guess my mind was made up anyhow.But\nbefore I did it I just wanted to be sure that a decent woman would think\nthe way I do about it."And so, for a time, Tillie went out of the life of the Street as she\nwent out of Harriet\'s handsome rooms, quietly, unobtrusively, with calm\npurpose in her eyes.The Lorenz house was being\npainted for Christine\'s wedding.Johnny Rosenfeld, not perhaps of the\nStreet itself, but certainly pertaining to it, was learning to drive\nPalmer Howe\'s new car, in mingled agony and bliss.He walked along the\nStreet, not "right foot, left foot," but "brake foot, clutch foot," and\ntook to calling off the vintage of passing cars."So-and-So 1910,"\nhe would say, with contempt in his voice.He spent more than he could\nafford on a large streamer, meant to be fastened across the rear of the\nautomobile, which said, "Excuse our dust," and was inconsolable when\nPalmer refused to let him use it.K. had yielded to Anna\'s insistence, and was boarding as well as\nrooming at the Page house.The Street, rather snobbish to its occasional\nfloating population, was accepting and liking him.It found him tender,\ninfinitely human.And in return he found that this seemingly empty eddy\ninto which he had drifted was teeming with life.He busied himself with\nsmall things, and found his outlook gradually less tinged with despair.When he found himself inclined to rail, he organized a baseball\nclub, and sent down to everlasting defeat the Linburgs, consisting of\ncash-boys from Linden and Hofburg\'s department store.The Rosenfelds adored him, with the single exception of the head of\nthe family.The elder Rosenfeld having been "sent up," it was K. who\ndiscovered that by having him consigned to the workhouse his family\nwould receive from the county some sixty-five cents a day for his labor.As this was exactly sixty-five cents a day more than he was worth to\nthem free, Mrs.Rosenfeld voiced the pious hope that he be kept there\nforever.K. made no further attempt to avoid Max Wilson.Some day they would meet\nface to face.He hoped, when it happened, they two might be alone; that\nwas all.Even had he not been bound by his promise to Sidney, flight\nwould have been foolish.The world was a small place, and, one way and\nanother, he had known many people.Wherever he went, there would be the\nsame chance.Other things being equal,--the eddy\nand all that it meant--, he would not willingly take himself out of his\nsmall share of Sidney\'s life.She was never to know what she meant to him, of course.He had scourged\nhis heart until it no longer shone in his eyes when he looked at her.But he was very human--not at all meek.There were plenty of days when\nhis philosophy lay in the dust and savage dogs of jealousy tore at it;\nmore than one evening when he threw himself face downward on the bed\nand lay without moving for hours.And of these periods of despair he was\nalways heartily ashamed the next day.The meeting with Max Wilson took place early in September, and under\nbetter circumstances than he could have hoped for.Sidney had come home for her weekly visit, and her mother\'s condition\nhad alarmed her for the first time.When Le Moyne came home at six\no\'clock, he found her waiting for him in the hall."I am just a little frightened, K.," she said."Do you think mother is\nlooking quite well?""She has felt the heat, of course.The summer--I often think--"\n\n"Her lips are blue!"She put her hands on his arm and looked up at him with appeal and\nsomething of terror in her face.Thus cornered, he had to acknowledge that Anna had been out of sorts.It\'s tragic and absurd that I should be\ncaring for other people, when my own mother--"\n\nShe dropped her head on his arm, and he saw that she was crying.If he\nmade a gesture to draw her to him, she never knew it."I\'m much braver than this in the hospital.K. was sorely tempted to tell her the truth and bring her back to the\nlittle house: to their old evenings together, to seeing the younger\nWilson, not as the white god of the operating-room and the hospital, but\nas the dandy of the Street and the neighbor of her childhood--back even\nto Joe.But, with Anna\'s precarious health and Harriet\'s increasing engrossment\nin her business, he felt it more and more necessary that Sidney go on\nwith her training.And there was another\npoint: it had been decided that Anna was not to know her condition.If\nshe was not worried she might live for years.There was no surer way to\nmake her suspect it than by bringing Sidney home.She insisted on coming downstairs, and\neven sat with them on the balcony until the stars came out, talking\nof Christine\'s trousseau, and, rather fretfully, of what she would do\nwithout the parlors."You shall have your own boudoir upstairs," said Sidney valiantly."Katie can carry your tray up there.We are going to make the\nsewing-room into your private sitting-room, and I shall nail the\nmachine-top down."When K. insisted on carrying her upstairs, she went in\na flutter.she said, when he had placed her on her bed."How can a clerk, bending over a ledger, be so muscular?When I have\ncallers, will it be all right for Katie to show them upstairs?"She dropped asleep before the doctor came; and when, at something after\neight, the door of the Wilson house slammed and a figure crossed the\nstreet, it was not Ed at all, but the surgeon.Sidney had been talking rather more frankly than usual.Lately there\nhad been a reserve about her.K., listening intently that night, read\nbetween words a story of small persecutions and jealousies.But the girl\nminimized them, after her way."It\'s always hard for probationers," she said."I often think Miss\nHarrison is trying my mettle."And now that Miss Gregg has said she will accept\nme, it\'s really all over.The other nurses are wonderful--so kind and so\nhelpful.I hope I shall look well in my cap."A thousand contingencies\nflashed through his mind.Sidney might grow to like her and bring her to\nthe house.Sidney might insist on the thing she always spoke of--that he\nvisit the hospital; and he would meet her, face to face.He could have\ndepended on a man to keep his secret.This girl with her somber eyes and\nher threat to pay him out for what had happened to her--she meant danger\nof a sort that no man could fight."Soon," said Sidney, through the warm darkness, "I shall have a cap,\nand be always forgetting it and putting my hat on over it--the new ones\nalways do.One of the girls slept in hers the other night!They are\ntulle, you know, and quite stiff, and it was the most erratic-looking\nthing the next day!"It was then that the door across the street closed.Sidney did not\nhear it, but K. bent forward.There was a part of his brain always\nautomatically on watch."I shall get my operating-room training, too," she went on."That is\nthe real romance of the hospital.A--a surgeon is a sort of hero in\na hospital.There was a lot of\nexcitement to-day.Even the probationers\' table was talking about it.The figure across the Street was lighting a cigarette.Perhaps, after\nall--\n\n"Something tremendously difficult--I don\'t know what.Edwardes invented it, or whatever they\ncall it.They took a picture of the operating-room for the article.The photographer had to put on operating clothes and wrap the camera in\nsterilized towels.It was the most thrilling thing, they say--"\n\nHer voice died away as her eyes followed K.\'s.Max, cigarette in\nhand, was coming across, under the ailanthus tree.He hesitated on the\npavement, his eyes searching the shadowy balcony."My brother is not at home, so I came over.How select you are, with\nyour balcony!"K. had risen and pushed back his chair.Here in the darkness he could hold the situation for a moment.If he\ncould get Sidney into the house, the rest would not matter.Luckily, the\nbalcony was very dark.Le Moyne, and he knows who you are very\nwell, indeed."Didn\'t the Street beat the Linburgs\nthe other day?And I believe the Rosenfelds are in receipt of sixty-five\ncents a day and considerable peace and quiet through you, Mr.You\'re the most popular man on the Street."Wilson is here to see\nyour mother--"\n\n"Going," said Sidney.Wilson is a very great person, K., so be\npolite to him."Max had roused at the sound of Le Moyne\'s voice, not to suspicion,\nof course, but to memory.Without any apparent reason, he was back in\nBerlin, tramping the country roads, and beside him--\n\n"Wonderful night!""The mind\'s a curious thing, isn\'t it.In the\ninstant since Miss Page went through that window I\'ve been to Berlin and\nback!K. struck a match with his steady hands.Now that the thing had come, he\nwas glad to face it.In the flare, his quiet profile glowed against the\nnight."Perhaps my voice took you back to Berlin."Blackness had descended on them again, except\nfor the dull glow of K.The neighbors next door have a bad habit of sitting just inside the\ncurtains."Sidney will be back in a moment.I\'ll talk to you, if you\'ll\nsit still."I\'ve been here--in the city, I mean--for a year.Don\'t\nforget it--Le Moyne.I\'ve got a position in the gas office, clerical.I have reason to think I\'m going to be moved\nup.That will be twenty, maybe twenty-two."Wilson stirred, but he found no adequate words.Only a part of what K.\nsaid got to him.For a moment he was back in a famous clinic, and this\nman across from him--it was not believable!"It\'s not hard work, and it\'s safe.If I make a mistake there\'s no life\nhanging on it.Once I made a blunder, a month or two ago.It cost me three dollars out of my own pocket.Wilson\'s voice showed that he was more than incredulous; he was\nprofoundly moved.When a year\nwent by--the Titanic had gone down, and nobody knew but what you were on\nit--we gave up.I--in June we put up a tablet for you at the college.I\nwent down for the--for the services.""Let it stay," said K. quietly."I\'m dead as far as the college goes,\nanyhow.And, for Heaven\'s sake,\ndon\'t be sorry for me.I\'m more contented than I\'ve been for a long\ntime."The wonder in Wilson\'s voice was giving way to irritation.Why, good Heavens, man, I did your\noperation to-day, and I\'ve been blowing about it ever since."When that\nhappened I gave up.All a man in our profession has is a certain method,\nknowledge--call it what you like,--and faith in himself.I lost my\nself-confidence; that\'s all.For about a year I was\ndamned sorry for myself."If every surgeon gave up because he lost cases--I\'ve just told you I\ndid your operation to-day.There was just a chance for the man, and I\ntook my courage in my hands and tried it.K. rose rather wearily and emptied his pipe over the balcony rail.Pipe in hand, he stood staring out at the ailanthus tree with its crown\nof stars.Instead of the Street with its quiet houses, he saw the men\nhe had known and worked with and taught, his friends who spoke his\nlanguage, who had loved him, many of them, gathered about a bronze\ntablet set in a wall of the old college; he saw their earnest faces and\ngrave eyes.He heard--\n\nHe heard the soft rustle of Sidney\'s dress as she came into the little\nroom behind them.CHAPTER XIII\n\n\nA few days after Wilson\'s recognition of K., two most exciting things\nhappened to Sidney.One was that Christine asked her to be maid of honor\nat her wedding.She was accepted, and\ngiven her cap.Because she could not get home that night, and because the little house\nhad no telephone, she wrote the news to her mother and sent a note to Le\nMoyne:\n\nDEAR K.,--I am accepted, and IT is on my head at this minute.I am as\nconscious of it as if it were a halo, and as if I had done something to\ndeserve it, instead of just hoping that someday I shall.I am writing\nthis on the bureau, so that when I lift my eyes I may see It.I am\nafraid just now I am thinking more of the cap than of what it means.Very soon I shall slip down and show it to the ward.I shall go to the door when the night nurse is busy somewhere, and\nturn all around and let them see it, without saying a word.You have been very good to me, dear K. It is you who have made possible\nthis happiness of mine to-night.I am promising myself to be very good,\nand not so vain, and to love my enemies--, although I have none now.Miss Harrison has just congratulated me most kindly, and I am sure poor\nJoe has both forgiven and forgotten.K. found the note on the hall table when he got home that night, and\ncarried it upstairs to read.Whatever faint hope he might have had that\nher youth would prevent her acceptance he knew now was over.With the\nletter in his hand, he sat by his table and looked ahead into the empty\nyears.But more and more the life of the hospital would engross her.He\nsurmised, too, very shrewdly, that, had he ever had a hope that she\nmight come to care for him, his very presence in the little house\nmilitated against him.There was none of the illusion of separation;\nhe was always there, like Katie.When she opened the door, she called\n"Mother" from the hall.If Anna did not answer, she called him, in much\nthe same voice.He had built a wall of philosophy that had withstood even Wilson\'s\nrecognition and protest.But enduring philosophy comes only with time;\nand he was young.Now and then all his defenses crumbled before a\npassion that, when he dared to face it, shook him by its very strength.And that day all his stoicism went down before Sidney\'s letter.Its very\nfrankness and affection hurt--not that he did not want her affection;\nbut he craved so much more.He threw himself face down on the bed, with\nthe paper crushed in his hand.Sidney\'s letter was not the only one he received that day.When, in\nresponse to Katie\'s summons, he rose heavily and prepared for dinner, he\nfound an unopened envelope on the table.It was from Max Wilson:--\n\nDEAR LE MOYNE,--I have been going around in a sort of haze all day.The\nfact that I only heard your voice and scarcely saw you last night has\nmade the whole thing even more unreal.I have a feeling of delicacy about trying to see you again so soon.I\'m\nbound to respect your seclusion.But there are some things that have got\nto be discussed.You said last night that things were "different" with you.Do you know any man in our\nprofession who has not?And, for fear you think I do not know what I am\ntalking about, the thing was threshed out at the State Society when the\nquestion of the tablet came up.Old Barnes got up and said: "Gentlemen,\nall of us live more or less in glass houses.Let him who is without\nguilt among us throw the first stone!"I took my little car and drove around the\ncountry roads, and the farther I went the more outrageous your position\nbecame.I\'m not going to write any rot about the world needing men like\nyou, although it\'s true enough.You working in\na gas office, while old O\'Hara bungles and hacks, and I struggle along\non what I learned from you!It takes courage to step down from the pinnacle you stood on.So it\'s\nnot cowardice that has set you down here.The first, and best, is for you to go back.No one has taken your place, because no one could do the work.But if\nthat\'s out of the question,--and only you know that, for only you know\nthe facts,--the next best thing is this, and in all humility I make the\nsuggestion.Take the State exams under your present name, and when you\'ve got your\ncertificate, come in with me.I\'ll be getting a\ndamn sight more than I give.It is a curious fact that a man who is absolutely untrustworthy about\nwomen is often the soul of honor to other men.The younger Wilson,\ntaking his pleasures lightly and not too discriminatingly, was making an\noffer that meant his ultimate eclipse, and doing it cheerfully, with his\neyes open.It was like Max to make such an offer, like him to make it\nas if he were asking a favor and not conferring one.But the offer left\nhim untempted.He had weighed himself in the balance, and found himself\nwanting.No tablet on the college wall could change that.And when,\nlate that night, Wilson found him on the balcony and added appeal to\nargument, the situation remained unchanged.He realized its hopelessness\nwhen K. lapsed into whimsical humor."I\'m not absolutely useless where I am, you know, Max," he said."I\'ve\nraised three tomato plants and a family of kittens this summer, helped\nto plan a trousseau, assisted in selecting wall-paper for the room just\ninside,--did you notice it?--and developed a boy pitcher with a ball\nthat twists around the bat like a Colles fracture around a splint!""If you\'re going to be humorous--"\n\n"My dear fellow," said K. quietly, "if I had no sense of humor, I should\ngo upstairs to-night, turn on the gas, and make a stertorous entrance\ninto eternity.By the way, that\'s something I forgot!"Among my other activities, I wired the parlor for\nelectric light.The bride-to-be expects some electroliers as wedding\ngifts, and--"\n\nWilson rose and flung his cigarette into the grass.K. rose with him, and all the suppressed feeling of the interview was\ncrowded into his last few words."I\'m not as ungrateful as you think, Max," he said."I--you\'ve helped\na lot.I\'m as well off as I deserve to be, and\nbetter.Wilson\'s unexpected magnanimity put K. in a curious position--left him,\nas it were, with a divided allegiance.Sidney\'s frank infatuation for\nthe young surgeon was growing.And where before\nhe might have felt justified in going to the length of warning her, now\nhis hands were tied.More than once he had\ntaken Sidney back to the hospital in his car.Le Moyne, handicapped at\nevery turn, found himself facing two alternatives, one but little better\nthan the other.The affair might run a legitimate course, ending in\nmarriage--a year of happiness for her, and then what marriage with\nMax, as he knew him, would inevitably mean: wanderings away, remorseful\nreturns to her, infidelities, misery.Or, it might be less serious but\nalmost equally unhappy for her.Max might throw caution to the winds,\npursue her for a time,--K. had seen him do this,--and then, growing\ntired, change to some new attraction.In either case, he could only wait\nand watch, eating his heart out during the long evenings when Anna read\nher "Daily Thoughts" upstairs and he sat alone with his pipe on the\nbalcony.Sidney went on night duty shortly after her acceptance.All of her\norderly young life had been divided into two parts: day, when one\nplayed or worked, and night, when one slept.Now she was compelled to\na readjustment: one worked in the night and slept in the day.At the end of her first night report Sidney\nadded what she could remember of a little verse of Stevenson\'s.She\nadded it to the end of her general report, which was to the effect that\neverything had been quiet during the night except the neighborhood."And does it not seem hard to you,\n      When all the sky is clear and blue,\n      And I should like so much to play,\n      To have to go to bed by day?"The day assistant happened on the report, and was quite scandalized."If the night nurses are to spend their time making up poetry," she\nsaid crossly, "we\'d better change this hospital into a young ladies\'\nseminary.If she wants to complain about the noise in the street, she\nshould do so in proper form.""I don\'t think she made it up," said the Head, trying not to smile."I\'ve heard something like it somewhere, and, what with the heat and the\nnoise of traffic, I don\'t see how any of them get any sleep."But, because discipline must be observed, she wrote on the slip the\nassistant carried around: "Please submit night reports in prose."She tumbled into her low bed at nine o\'clock\nin the morning, those days, with her splendid hair neatly braided down\nher back and her prayers said, and immediately her active young mind\nfilled with images--Christine\'s wedding, Dr.Max passing the door of her\nold ward and she not there, Joe--even Tillie, whose story was now the\nsensation of the Street.A few months before she would not have cared\nto think of Tillie.She would have retired her into the land of\nthings-one-must-forget.But the Street\'s conventions were not holding\nSidney\'s thoughts now.She puzzled over Tillie a great deal, and over\nGrace and her kind.On her first night on duty, a girl had been brought in from the Avenue.She had taken a poison--nobody knew just what.When the internes had\ntried to find out, she had only said: "What\'s the use?"Sidney kept asking herself, "Why?"those mornings when she could not get\nto sleep.People were kind--men were kind, really,--and yet, for some\nreason or other, those things had to be.After a time Sidney would doze fitfully.But by three o\'clock she was\nalways up and dressing.Lack of\nsleep wrote hollows around her eyes and killed some of her bright color.Between three and four o\'clock in the morning she was overwhelmed on\nduty by a perfect madness of sleep.There was a penalty for sleeping on\nduty.The old night watchman had a way of slipping up on one nodding.The night nurses wished they might fasten a bell on him!Luckily, at four came early-morning temperatures; that roused her.And\nafter that came the clatter of early milk-wagons and the rose hues of\ndawn over the roofs.Twice in the night, once at supper and again toward\ndawn, she drank strong black coffee.But after a week or two her nerves\nwere stretched taut as a string.Her station was in a small room close to her three wards.But she sat\nvery little, as a matter of fact.Her responsibility was heavy on her;\nshe made frequent rounds.The late summer nights were fitful, feverish;\nthe darkened wards stretched away like caverns from the dim light near\nthe door.And from out of these caverns came petulant voices, uneasy\nmovements, the banging of a cup on a bedside, which was the signal of\nthirst.To them, perhaps just\na little weary with time and much service, the banging cup meant not so\nmuch thirst as annoyance."Don\'t jump like that, child; they\'re not parched, you know.""But if you have a fever and are thirsty--"\n\n"Thirsty nothing!"Then," Sidney would say, rising resolutely, "they are going to see me."Gradually the older girls saw that she would not save herself.They\nliked her very much, and they, too, had started in with willing feet\nand tender hands; but the thousand and one demands of their service\nhad drained them dry.They were efficient, cool-headed, quick-thinking\nmachines, doing their best, of course, but differing from Sidney in that\ntheir service was of the mind, while hers was of the heart.To them,\npain was a thing to be recorded on a report; to Sidney, it was written\non the tablets of her soul.Carlotta Harrison went on night duty at the same time--her last night\nservice, as it was Sidney\'s first.She had\ncharge of the three wards on the floor just below Sidney, and of the\nward into which all emergency cases were taken.It was a difficult\nservice, perhaps the most difficult in the house.Scarcely a night went\nby without its patrol or ambulance case.Ordinarily, the emergency ward\nhad its own night nurse.Belated\nvacations and illness had depleted the training-school.Carlotta, given\ndouble duty, merely shrugged her shoulders."I\'ve always had things pretty hard here," she commented briefly."When I go out, I\'ll either be competent enough to run a whole hospital\nsinglehanded, or I\'ll be carried out feet first."Sidney was glad to have her so near.She knew her better than she knew\nthe other nurses.Small emergencies were constantly arising and finding\nher at a loss.Once at least every night, Miss Harrison would hear a\nsoft hiss from the back staircase that connected the two floors, and,\ngoing out, would see Sidney\'s flushed face and slightly crooked cap\nbending over the stair-rail."I\'m dreadfully sorry to bother you," she would say, "but So-and-So\nwon\'t have a fever bath"; or, "I\'ve a woman here who refuses her\nmedicine."Then would follow rapid questions and equally rapid answers.Much as Carlotta disliked and feared the girl overhead, it never\noccurred to her to refuse her assistance.Perhaps the angels who keep\nthe great record will put that to her credit.Sidney saw her first death shortly after she went on night duty.It was\nthe most terrible experience of all her life; and yet, as death goes, it\nwas quiet enough.So gradual was it that Sidney, with K.\'s little watch\nin hand, was not sure exactly when it happened.The light was very dim\nbehind the little screen.One moment the sheet was quivering slightly\nunder the struggle for breath, the next it was still.That life, so potential, so tremendous a\nthing, could end so ignominiously, that the long battle should terminate\nalways in this capitulation--it seemed to her that she could not stand\nit.Added to all her other new problems of living was this one of dying.She made mistakes, of course, which the kindly nurses forgot to\nreport--basins left about, errors on her records.She rinsed her\nthermometer in hot water one night, and startled an interne by sending\nhim word that Mary McGuire\'s temperature was a hundred and ten degrees.She let a delirious patient escape from the ward another night and go\nairily down the fire-escape before she discovered what had happened!Then she distinguished herself by flying down the iron staircase and\nbringing the runaway back single-handed.For Christine\'s wedding the Street threw off its drab attire and assumed\na wedding garment.In the beginning it was incredulous about some of the\ndetails."An awning from the house door to the curbstone, and a policeman!"Rosenfeld, who was finding steady employment at the Lorenz\nhouse."And another awning at the church, with a red carpet!"Rosenfeld had arrived home and was making up arrears of rest and\nrecreation."Why do they ask \'em if they don\'t trust \'em?"But the mention of the policemen had been unfortunate.It recalled to\nhim many things that were better forgotten.He rose and scowled at his\nwife."You tell Johnny something for me," he snarled."You tell him when he\nsees his father walking down street, and he sittin\' up there alone on\nthat automobile, I want him to stop and pick me up when I hail him.Me\nwalking, while my son swells around in a car!"You let me hear of him road-housin\', and\nI\'ll kill him!"The wedding was to be at five o\'clock.This, in itself, defied all\ntraditions of the Street, which was either married in the very early\nmorning at the Catholic church or at eight o\'clock in the evening at\nthe Presbyterian.There was something reckless about five o\'clock.It had a queer feeling that perhaps such a\nmarriage was not quite legal.The question of what to wear became, for the men, an earnest one.Ed\nresurrected an old black frock-coat and had a "V" of black cambric set\nin the vest.Jenkins, the grocer, rented a cutaway, and bought a\nnew Panama to wear with it.The deaf-and-dumb book agent who boarded at\nMcKees\', and who, by reason of his affliction, was calmly ignorant of\nthe excitement around him, wore a borrowed dress-suit, and considered\nhimself to the end of his days the only properly attired man in the\nchurch.The younger Wilson was to be one of the ushers.When the newspapers came\nout with the published list and this was discovered, as well as that\nSidney was the maid of honor, there was a distinct quiver through the\nhospital training-school.A probationer was authorized to find out\nparticulars.It was the day of the wedding then, and Sidney, who had\nnot been to bed at all, was sitting in a sunny window in the Dormitory\nAnnex, drying her hair."I--I just wonder," she said, "if you would let some of the girls come\nin to see you when you\'re dressed?""It\'s awfully thrilling, isn\'t it?"Are you going to walk down the aisle with him?"They had a rehearsal last night, but of course I was not\nthere.The probationer had been instructed to find out other things; so she set\nto work with a fan at Sidney\'s hair."He\'s awfully good-looking, isn\'t he?"She was not ignorant of the methods of the school.If\nthis girl was pumping her--\n\n"I\'ll have to think that over," she said, with a glint of mischief in\nher eyes."When you know a person terribly well, you hardly know whether\nhe\'s good-looking or not.""I suppose," said the probationer, running the long strands of Sidney\'s\nhair through her fingers, "that when you are at home you see him often."Sidney got off the window-sill, and, taking the probationer smilingly by\nthe shoulders, faced her toward the door."You go back to the girls," she said, "and tell them to come in and see\nme when I am dressed, and tell them this: I don\'t know whether I am to\nwalk down the aisle with Dr.She shoved the probationer out into the hall and locked the door behind\nher.That message in its entirety reached Carlotta Harrison.Sidney must be very sure\nof herself.She, too, had not slept during the day.When the probationer who\nhad brought her the report had gone out, she lay in her long white\nnight-gown, hands clasped under her head, and stared at the vault-like\nceiling of her little room.She saw there Sidney in her white dress going down the aisle of the\nchurch; she saw the group around the altar; and, as surely as she lay\nthere, she knew that Max Wilson\'s eyes would be, not on the bride, but\non the girl who stood beside her.The curious thing was that Carlotta felt that she could stop the wedding\nif she wanted to.She\'d happened on a bit of information--many a wedding\nhad been stopped for less.It rather obsessed her to think of stopping\nthe wedding, so that Sidney and Max would not walk down the aisle\ntogether.There came, at last, an hour before the wedding, a lull in the feverish\nactivities of the previous month.In the Lorenz\nkitchen, piles of plates, <DW64> waiters, ice-cream freezers, and Mrs.In the attic, in the center of a\nsheet, before a toilet-table which had been carried upstairs for her\nbenefit, sat, on this her day of days, the bride.All the second story\nhad been prepared for guests and presents.Florists were still busy in the room below.Bridesmaids were clustered\non the little staircase, bending over at each new ring of the bell and\ncalling reports to Christine through the closed door:--\n\n"Another wooden box, Christine.What will you\never do with them all?"Here\'s another of the neighbors who wants to see how you\nlook.Do say you can\'t have any visitors now."Christine sat alone in the center of her sheet.The bridesmaids had been\nsternly forbidden to come into her room."I haven\'t had a chance to think for a month," she said."And I\'ve got\nsome things I\'ve got to think out."But, when Sidney came, she sent for her.Sidney found her sitting on a\nstiff chair, in her wedding gown, with her veil spread out on a small\nstand.And, after Sidney had kissed her:--\n\n"I\'ve a good mind not to do it.""You\'re tired and nervous, that\'s all."But that isn\'t what\'s wrong with me.Throw that veil\nsome place and sit down."Christine was undoubtedly rouged, a very delicate touch.Sidney thought\nbrides should be rather pale.But under her eyes were lines that Sidney\nhad never seen there before."I\'m not going to be foolish, Sidney.I\'ll go through with it, of\ncourse.It would put mamma in her grave if I made a scene now.""Palmer gave his bachelor dinner at the Country Club last night.Somebody called father up to-day and\nsaid that Palmer had emptied a bottle of wine into the piano.He hasn\'t\nbeen here to-day."And as for the other--perhaps it wasn\'t Palmer who did\nit."Three months before, perhaps, Sidney could not have comforted her; but\nthree months had made a change in Sidney.The complacent sophistries\nof her girlhood no longer answered for truth.She put her arms around\nChristine\'s shoulders.John went to the bedroom."A man who drinks is a broken reed," said Christine."That\'s what I\'m\ngoing to marry and lean on the rest of my life--a broken reed.She got up quickly, and, trailing her long satin train across the floor,\nbolted the door.Then from inside her corsage she brought out and held\nto Sidney a letter.It was very short; Sidney read it at a glance:--\n\nAsk your future husband if he knows a girl at 213 ---- Avenue.Three months before, the Avenue would have meant nothing to Sidney.Christine, more sophisticated, had always known.Quite suddenly Sidney knew who the girl at 213 ---- Avenue was.The\npaper she held in her hand was hospital paper with the heading torn off.The whole sordid story lay before her: Grace Irving, with her thin face\nand cropped hair, and the newspaper on the floor of the ward beside her!One of the bridesmaids thumped violently on the door outside."Another electric lamp," she called excitedly through the door."You see," Christine said drearily."I have received another electric\nlamp, and Palmer is downstairs!I\'ve got to go through with it, I\nsuppose.The only difference between me and other brides is that I know\nwhat I\'m getting."It\'s too late to do anything else.I am not going to give this\nneighborhood anything to talk about."She picked up her veil and set the coronet on her head.Sidney stood\nwith the letter in her hands.\'s answers to her hot question\nhad been this:--\n\n"There is no sense in looking back unless it helps us to look ahead.What your little girl of the ward has been is not so important as what\nshe is going to be.""Even granting this to be true," she said to Christine slowly,--"and it\nmay only be malicious after all, Christine,--it\'s surely over and done\nwith.It\'s not Palmer\'s past that concerns you now; it\'s his future with\nyou, isn\'t it?"A band of duchesse lace rose\nlike a coronet from her soft hair, and from it, sweeping to the end of\nher train, fell fold after fold of soft tulle.She arranged the coronet\ncarefully with small pearl-topped pins.Then she rose and put her hands\non Sidney\'s shoulders."The simple truth is," she said quietly, "that I might hold Palmer if\nI cared--terribly.It\'s my pride\nthat\'s hurt, nothing else."And thus did Christine Lorenz go down to her wedding.Sidney stood for a moment, her eyes on the letter she held.Already, in\nher new philosophy, she had learned many strange things.One of them was\nthis: that women like Grace Irving did not betray their lovers; that the\ncode of the underworld was "death to the squealer"; that one played the\ngame, and won or lost, and if he lost, took his medicine.Somebody else in the hospital who knew her story, of course.Before going downstairs, Sidney placed the letter in a saucer and set\nfire to it with a match.Some of the radiance had died out of her eyes.The alley, however, was\nrather confused by certain things.For instance, it regarded the awning\nas essentially for the carriage guests, and showed a tendency to duck\nin under the side when no one was looking.Rosenfeld absolutely\nrefused to take the usher\'s arm which was offered her, and said she\nguessed she was able to walk up alone.Johnny Rosenfeld came, as befitted his position, in a complete\nchauffeur\'s outfit of leather cap and leggings, with the shield that was\nhis State license pinned over his heart.The Street came decorously, albeit with a degree of uncertainty as to\nsupper.Should they put something on the stove before they left, in case\nonly ice cream and cake were served at the house?Or was it just as well\nto trust to luck, and, if the Lorenz supper proved inadequate, to sit\ndown to a cold snack when they got home?To K., sitting in the back of the church between Harriet and Anna, the\nwedding was Sidney--Sidney only.He watched her first steps down the\naisle, saw her chin go up as she gained poise and confidence, watched\nthe swinging of her young figure in its gauzy white as she passed him\nand went forward past the long rows of craning necks.Afterward he could\nnot remember the wedding party at all.The service for him was Sidney,\nrather awed and very serious, beside the altar.It was Sidney who came\ndown the aisle to the triumphant strains of the wedding march, Sidney\nwith Max beside her!On his right sat Harriet, having reached the first pinnacle of her\nnew career.They were more than\nthat--they were triumphant.Sitting there, she cast comprehensive eyes\nover the church, filled with potential brides.To Harriet, then, that October afternoon was a future of endless lace\nand chiffon, the joy of creation, triumph eclipsing triumph.But to\nAnna, watching the ceremony with blurred eyes and ineffectual bluish\nlips, was coming her hour.Sitting back in the pew, with her hands\nfolded over her prayer-book, she said a little prayer for her straight\nyoung daughter, facing out from the altar with clear, unafraid eyes.As Sidney and Max drew near the door, Joe Drummond, who had been\nstanding at the back of the church, turned quickly and went out.He\nstumbled, rather, as if he could not see.CHAPTER XIV\n\n\nThe supper at the White Springs Hotel had not been the last supper\nCarlotta Harrison and Max Wilson had taken together.Carlotta had\nselected for her vacation a small town within easy motoring distance of\nthe city, and two or three times during her two weeks off duty Wilson\nhad gone out to see her.For once that he could see Sidney, he saw Carlotta twice.She knew quite well the kind of man with whom she was dealing--that he\nwould pay as little as possible.But she knew, too, that, let him want a\nthing enough, he would pay any price for it, even marriage.The very ardor in her face was in her favor.She would put the thing\nthrough, and show those puling nurses, with their pious eyes and evening\nprayers, a thing or two.During that entire vacation he never saw her in anything more elaborate\nthan the simplest of white dresses modestly open at the throat, sleeves\nrolled up to show her satiny arms.There were no other boarders at the\nlittle farmhouse.She sat for hours in the summer evenings in the square\nyard filled with apple trees that bordered the highway, carefully\nposed over a book, but with her keen eyes always on the road.She read\nBrowning, Emerson, Swinburne.Once he found her with a book that she\nhastily concealed.He insisted on seeing it, and secured it.Confronted with it, she blushed and dropped her\neyes.His delighted vanity found in it the most insidious of compliments, as\nshe had intended."I feel such an idiot when I am with you," she said."I wanted to know a\nlittle more about the things you do."That put their relationship on a new and advanced basis.Thereafter\nhe occasionally talked surgery instead of sentiment.His work, a sealed book to his women before,\nlay open to her.Now and then their professional discussions ended in something\ndifferent.I can talk\nshop with you without either shocking or nauseating you.You are the\nmost intelligent woman I know--and one of the prettiest."He had stopped the machine on the crest of a hill for the ostensible\npurpose of admiring the view."As long as you talk shop," she said, "I feel that there is nothing\nwrong in our being together; but when you say the other thing--"\n\n"Is it wrong to tell a pretty woman you admire her?"He twisted himself around in the seat and sat looking at her."The loveliest mouth in the world!"She had expected it for at least a week, but her surprise was well done.Well done also was her silence during the homeward ride.No, she was not angry, she said.It was only that he had set her\nthinking.When she got out of the car, she bade him good-night and\ngood-bye.After that nothing could have kept him away, and she knew it."Man demands both danger and play; therefore he selects woman as the\nmost dangerous of toys."A spice of danger had entered into their\nrelationship.He motored out to the farm the next day, to be told that Miss Harrison\nhad gone for a long walk and had not said when she would be back.Every man likes to think that\nhe is a bit of a devil.Max settled his tie, and, leaving his\ncar outside the whitewashed fence, departed blithely on foot in the\ndirection Carlotta had taken.He found her, face down, under a tree,\nlooking pale and worn and bearing all the evidence of a severe mental\nstruggle.She rose in confusion when she heard his step, and retreated a\nfoot or two, with her hands out before her.I--I have got to\nhave a little time alone.He knew it was play-acting, but rather liked it; and, because he was\nquite as skillful as she was, he struck a match on the trunk of the tree\nand lighted a cigarette before he answered."I was afraid of this," he said, playing up.I am not really a villain, Carlotta."It was the first time he had used her name."Sit down and let us talk things over."She sat down at a safe distance, and looked across the little clearing\nto him with the somber eyes that were her great asset."You can afford to be very calm," she said, "because this is only play\nto you; I know it.I\'m a good listener and\nnot--unattractive.But what is play for you is not necessarily play for\nme.For the first time, he found himself believing in her sincerity.If she cried--he was at\nthe mercy of any woman who cried.This sort of thing cannot go on, Dr.She did cry then--real tears; and he went over beside her and took her\nin his arms.You make me feel like\na scoundrel, and I\'ve only been taking a little bit of happiness.Max, and kissed her again on the lips.The one element Carlotta had left out of her calculations was herself.She had known the man, had taken the situation at its proper value.Daniel moved to the bathroom.But\nshe had left out this important factor in the equation,--that factor\nwhich in every relationship between man and woman determines the\nequation,--the woman.Into her calculating ambition had come a new and destroying element.She\nwho, like K. in his little room on the Street, had put aside love and\nthe things thereof, found that it would not be put aside.By the end of\nher short vacation Carlotta Harrison was wildly in love with the younger\nWilson.They continued to meet, not as often as before, but once a week,\nperhaps.The meetings were full of danger now; and if for the girl they\nlost by this quality, they gained attraction for the man.She was shrewd\nenough to realize her own situation.She\ncared, and he did not.It was all a game now, not hers.All women are intuitive; women in love are dangerously so.As well as\nshe knew that his passion for her was not the real thing, so also she\nrealized that there was growing up in his heart something akin to the\nreal thing for Sidney Page.Suspicion became certainty after a talk\nthey had over the supper table at a country road-house the day after\nChristine\'s wedding."How was the wedding--tiresome?"There\'s always something thrilling to me in a man tying\nhimself up for life to one woman."That\'s not exactly the Law and the Prophets, is it?"To think of selecting out of all the world one woman,\nand electing to spend the rest of one\'s days with her!Although--"\n\nHis eyes looked past Carlotta into distance."Sidney Page was one of the bridesmaids," he said irrelevantly."She was\nlovelier than the bride.""Pretty, but stupid," said Carlotta.I\'ve really tried to\nteach her things, but--you know--" She shrugged her shoulders.If there was a twinkle in his eye, he\nveiled it discreetly.But, once again in the machine, he bent over and\nput his cheek against hers.You\'re jealous," he said exultantly.Nevertheless, although he might smile, the image of Sidney lay very\nclose to his heart those autumn days.Sidney came off night duty the middle of November.The night duty had\nbeen a time of comparative peace to Carlotta.Max could bring Sidney back to the hospital in his car.Sidney\'s half-days at home were occasions for agonies of jealousy on\nCarlotta\'s part.On such an occasion, a month after the wedding, she\ncould not contain herself.She pleaded her old excuse of headache, and\ntook the trolley to a point near the end of the Street.After twilight\nfell, she slowly walked the length of the Street.Christine and Palmer\nhad not returned from their wedding journey.The November evening was\nnot cold, and on the little balcony sat Sidney and Dr.K. was\nthere, too, had she only known it, sitting back in the shadow and saying\nlittle, his steady eyes on Sidney\'s profile.She went on down the Street in a frenzy\nof jealous anger.After that two ideas ran concurrent in Carlotta\'s mind: one was to get\nSidney out of the way, the other was to make Wilson propose to her.In\nher heart she knew that on the first depended the second.A week later she made the same frantic excursion, but with a different\nresult.Sidney was not in sight, or Wilson.But standing on the wooden\ndoorstep of the little house was Le Moyne.The ailanthus trees were\nbare at that time, throwing gaunt arms upward to the November sky.The\nstreet-lamp, which in the summer left the doorstep in the shadow, now\nshone through the branches and threw into strong relief Le Moyne\'s tall\nfigure and set face.She went on, startled, her busy brain scheming anew.It was the first time\nshe had known that K. lived in the Page house.It gave her a sense of\nuncertainty and deadly fear.She made her first friendly overture of many days to Sidney the\nfollowing day.They met in the locker-room in the basement where the\nstreet clothing for the ward patients was kept.Here, rolled in bundles\nand ticketed, side by side lay the heterogeneous garments in which\nthe patients had met accident or illness.Rags and tidiness, filth and\ncleanliness, lay almost touching.Far away on the other side of the white-washed basement, men were\nunloading gleaming cans of milk.Floods of sunlight came down the\ncellar-way, touching their white coats and turning the cans to silver.Everywhere was the religion of the hospital, which is order.Sidney, harking back from recent slights to the staircase conversation\nof her night duty, smiled at Carlotta cheerfully."Grace Irving is going out to-day.When one remembers how ill she was and how we thought she could not\nlive, it\'s rather a triumph, isn\'t it?"Sidney examined with some dismay the elaborate negligee garments in her\nhand."She can\'t go out in those; I shall have to lend her something."A\nlittle of the light died out of her face."She\'s had a hard fight, and\nshe has won," she said."But when I think of what she\'s probably going\nback to--"\n\nCarlotta shrugged her shoulders."It\'s all in the day\'s work," she observed indifferently."You can take\nthem up into the kitchen and give them steady work paring potatoes, or\nput them in the laundry ironing.She drew a package from the locker and looked at it ruefully."Well, what do you know about this?Here\'s a woman who came in in a\nnightgown and pair of slippers.And now she wants to go out in half an\nhour!"She turned, on her way out of the locker-room, and shot a quick glance\nat Sidney."I happened to be on your street the other night," she said."You live\nacross the street from Wilsons\', don\'t you?""I thought so; I had heard you speak of the house.Your--your brother\nwas standing on the steps."It isn\'t really\nright to call him a roomer; he\'s one of the family now."\'s name had struck an always responsive chord in Sidney.The two girls\nwent toward the elevator together.With a very little encouragement,\nSidney talked of K. She was pleased at Miss Harrison\'s friendly tone,\nglad that things were all right between them again.At her floor, she\nput a timid hand on the girl\'s arm."I was afraid I had offended you or displeased you," she said."I\'m so\nglad it isn\'t so."Things were not going any too well with K. True, he had received his\npromotion at the office, and with this present affluence of twenty-two\ndollars a week he was able to do several things.Rosenfeld now\nwashed and ironed one day a week at the little house, so that Katie\nmight have more time to look after Anna.He had increased also the\namount of money that he periodically sent East.The thing that rankled and filled him with a sense\nof failure was Max Wilson\'s attitude.It was not unfriendly; it was,\nindeed, consistently respectful, almost reverential.But he clearly\nconsidered Le Moyne\'s position absurd.There was no true comradeship between the two men; but there was\nbeginning to be constant association, and lately a certain amount of\nfriction.Wilson began to bring all his problems to Le Moyne.There were long\nconsultations in that small upper room.Perhaps more than one man or\nwoman who did not know of K.\'s existence owed his life to him that fall.Cases began to come in to him\nfrom the surrounding towns.To his own daring was added a new and\nremarkable technique.But Le Moyne, who had found resignation if not\ncontent, was once again in touch with the work he loved.There were\ntimes when, having thrashed a case out together and outlined the next\nday\'s work for Max, he would walk for hours into the night out over the\nhills, fighting his battle.The longing was on him to be in the thick\nof things again.The thought of the gas office and its deadly round\nsickened him.It was on one of his long walks that K. found Tillie.It was December then, gray and raw, with a wet snow that changed to\nrain as it fell.The country roads were ankle-deep with mud, the wayside\npaths thick with sodden leaves.The dreariness of the countryside that\nSaturday afternoon suited his mood.He had ridden to the end of the\nstreet-car line, and started his walk from there.As was his custom, he\nwore no overcoat, but a short sweater under his coat.Somewhere along\nthe road he had picked up a mongrel dog, and, as if in sheer desire for\nhuman society, it trotted companionably at his heels.Seven miles from the end of the car line he found a road-house, and\nstopped in for a glass of Scotch.The dog\nwent in with him, and stood looking up into his face.It was as if he\nsubmitted, but wondered why this indoors, with the scents of the road\nahead and the trails of rabbits over the fields.The house was set in a valley at the foot of two hills.Through the mist\nof the December afternoon, it had loomed pleasantly before him.The door\nwas ajar, and he stepped into a little hall covered with ingrain carpet.To the right was the dining-room, the table covered with a white cloth,\nand in its exact center an uncompromising bunch of dried flowers.To the\nleft, the typical parlor of such places.It might have been the parlor\nof the White Springs Hotel in duplicate, plush self-rocker and all.Over\neverything was silence and a pervading smell of fresh varnish.The house\nwas aggressive with new paint--the sagging old floors shone with it, the\ndoors gleamed.called K.\n\nThere were slow footsteps upstairs, the closing of a bureau drawer,\nthe rustle of a woman\'s dress coming down the stairs.K., standing\nuncertainly on a carpet oasis that was the center of the parlor varnish,\nstripped off his sweater.he said to the unseen female on the\nstaircase.She put a hand against the\ndoorframe to steady herself.Tillie surely, but a new Tillie!With her\nhair loosened around her face, a fresh blue chintz dress open at the\nthroat, a black velvet bow on her breast, here was a Tillie fuller,\ninfinitely more attractive, than he had remembered her.But she did not\nsmile at him.There was something about her eyes not unlike the dog\'s\nexpression, submissive, but questioning."Well, you\'ve found me, Mr.And, when he held out his hand,\nsmiling: "I just had to do it, Mr.You look mighty fine and--happy, Tillie."Schwitter\'s gone to the postoffice.Will you have a cup of tea, or will you have something else?"The instinct of the Street was still strong in Tillie.The Street did\nnot approve of "something else.""Scotch-and-soda," said Le Moyne."And shall I buy a ticket for you to\npunch?"He was sorry he had made the blunder.Evidently the Street and all that pertained was a sore subject.It was for this that she had exchanged\nthe virginal integrity of her life at Mrs.McKee\'s--for this wind-swept\nlittle house, tidily ugly, infinitely lonely.There were two crayon\nenlargements over the mantel.The\nother was the paper-doll wife.K. wondered what curious instinct of\nself-abnegation had caused Tillie to leave the wife there undisturbed.Back of its position of honor he saw the girl\'s realization of her own\nsituation.On a wooden shelf, exactly between the two pictures, was\nanother vase of dried flowers.Tillie brought the Scotch, already mixed, in a tall glass.K. would\nhave preferred to mix it himself, but the Scotch was good."You gave me a turn at first," said Tillie."But I am right glad to see\nyou, Mr.Now that the roads are bad, nobody comes very much.Until now, K. and Tillie, when they met, had met conversationally on the\ncommon ground of food.They no longer had that, and between them both\nlay like a barrier their last conversation.More attractive it certainly was,\nbut happy?There was a wistfulness about Tillie\'s mouth that set him\nwondering."He\'s about the best man on earth.He\'s never said a cross word to\nme--even at first, when I was panicky and scared at every sound.""I burned a lot of victuals when I first came, running off and hiding\nwhen I heard people around the place.It used to seem to me that what\nI\'d done was written on my face.Tillie glanced up at the two pictures over the mantel."Sometimes it is--when he comes in tired, and I\'ve a chicken ready or\nsome fried ham and eggs for his supper, and I see him begin to look\nrested.He lights his pipe, and many an evening he helps me with the\ndishes."I wouldn\'t go back to where I was, but I am not happy, Mr.This place is his, and he\'d like a boy to come into it\nwhen he\'s gone.if I did have one; what would it be?"\'s eyes followed hers to the picture and the everlastings underneath."And she--there isn\'t any prospect of her--?"There was no solution to Tillie\'s problem.Le Moyne, standing on the\nhearth and looking down at her, realized that, after all, Tillie must\nwork out her own salvation.They talked far into the growing twilight of the afternoon.Tillie was\nhungry for news of the Street: must know of Christine\'s wedding, of\nHarriet, of Sidney in her hospital.And when he had told her all, she\nsat silent, rolling her handkerchief in her fingers.Then:--\n\n"Take the four of us," she said suddenly,--"Christine Lorenz and Sidney\nPage and Miss Harriet and me,--and which one would you have picked to\ngo wrong like this?I guess, from the looks of things, most folks would\nhave thought it would be the Lorenz girl.They\'d have picked Harriet\nKennedy for the hospital, and me for the dressmaking, and it would have\nbeen Sidney Page that got married and had an automobile.She looked up at K. shrewdly.They didn\'t know me, and I\nheard them talking.They said Sidney Page was going to marry Dr.As she\nstood before him she looked up into his face."If you like her as well as I think you do, Mr.Le Moyne, you won\'t let\nhim get her.""I am afraid that\'s not up to me, is it?What would I do with a wife,\nTillie?"I guess, in the\nlong run, that would count more than money."That was what K. took home with him after his encounter with Tillie.He\npondered it on his way back to the street-car, as he struggled against\nthe wind.Wagon-tracks along the road were\nfilled with water and had begun to freeze.The rain had turned to a\ndriving sleet that cut his face.Halfway to the trolley line, the dog\nturned off into a by-road.The dog stared after\nhim, one foot raised.Once again his eyes were like Tillie\'s, as she had\nwaved good-bye from the porch.His head sunk on his breast, K. covered miles of road with his long,\nswinging pace, and fought his battle.Was Tillie right, after all, and\nhad he been wrong?Why should he efface himself, if it meant Sidney\'s\nunhappiness?Why not accept Wilson\'s offer and start over again?Then\nif things went well--the temptation was strong that stormy afternoon.He\nput it from him at last, because of the conviction that whatever he did\nwould make no change in Sidney\'s ultimate decision.If she cared enough\nfor Wilson, she would marry him.CHAPTER XV\n\n\nPalmer and Christine returned from their wedding trip the day K.\ndiscovered Tillie.Anna Page made much of the arrival, insisted on\ndinner for them that night at the little house, must help Christine\nunpack her trunks and arrange her wedding gifts about the apartment.She\nwas brighter than she had been for days, more interested.The wonders of\nthe trousseau filled her with admiration and a sort of jealous envy for\nSidney, who could have none of these things.In a pathetic sort of way,\nshe mothered Christine in lieu of her own daughter.And it was her quick eye that discerned something wrong.Under her excitement was an undercurrent of reserve.Anna, rich in maternity if in nothing else, felt it, and in reply to\nsome speech of Christine\'s that struck her as hard, not quite fitting,\nshe gave her a gentle admonishing."Married life takes a little adjusting, my dear," she said."After we\nhave lived to ourselves for a number of years, it is not easy to live\nfor some one else."Christine straightened from the tea-table she was arranging.But why should the woman do all the adjusting?""Men are more set," said poor Anna, who had never been set in anything\nin her life."It is harder for them to give in.And, of course, Palmer\nis older, and his habits--"\n\n"The less said about Palmer\'s habits the better," flashed Christine."I\nappear to have married a bunch of habits."She gave over her unpacking, and sat down listlessly by the fire, while\nAnna moved about, busy with the small activities that delighted her.Six weeks of Palmer\'s society in unlimited amounts had bored Christine\nto distraction.She sat with folded hands and looked into a future that\nseemed to include nothing but Palmer: Palmer asleep with his mouth open;\nPalmer shaving before breakfast, and irritable until he had had his\ncoffee; Palmer yawning over the newspaper.And there was a darker side to the picture than that.There was a vision\nof Palmer slipping quietly into his room and falling into the heavy\nsleep, not of drunkenness perhaps, but of drink.She knew now that it would happen again and again, as long as he\nlived.The letter she had received on\nher wedding day was burned into her brain.There would be that in the\nfuture too, probably.She was making a brave clutch\nat happiness.But that afternoon of the first day at home she was\nterrified.She was glad when Anna went and left her alone by her fire.But when she heard a step in the hall, she opened the door herself.She\nhad determined to meet Palmer with a smile.Tears brought nothing;\nshe had learned that already."Daughters of joy," they called girls like the one on the Avenue.She waited while, with his back to her, he\nshook himself like a great dog.He smiled down at her, his kindly eyes lighting."It\'s good to be home and to see you again.Won\'t you come in to my\nfire?""All the more reason why you should come," she cried gayly, and held the\ndoor wide.The little parlor was cheerful with fire and soft lamps, bright with\nsilver vases full of flowers.K. stepped inside and took a critical\nsurvey of the room."Between us we have made a pretty good job of this, I\nwith the paper and the wiring, and you with your pretty furnishings and\nyour pretty self."Christine saw his approval, and was\nhappier than she had been for weeks.She put on the thousand little airs\nand graces that were a part of her--held her chin high, looked up at\nhim with the little appealing glances that she had found were wasted on\nPalmer.She lighted the spirit-lamp to make tea, drew out the best chair\nfor him, and patted a cushion with her well-cared-for hands."And see, here\'s a footstool.""I am ridiculously fond of being babied," said K., and quite basked in\nhis new atmosphere of well-being.This was better than his empty room\nupstairs, than tramping along country roads, than his own thoughts."Do\ntell me all the scandal of the Street.""There has been no scandal since you went away," said K. And, because\neach was glad not to be left to his own thoughts, they laughed at this\nbit of unconscious humor."Seriously," said Le Moyne, "we have been very quiet.I have had my\nsalary raised and am now rejoicing in twenty-two dollars a week.Just when I had all my ideas fixed for\nfifteen, I get twenty-two and have to reassemble them."It is very disagreeable when one\'s income becomes a burden," said\nChristine gravely.She was finding in Le Moyne something that she needed just then--a\nsolidity, a sort of dependability, that had nothing to do with\nheaviness.She felt that here was a man she could trust, almost confide\nin.She liked his long hands, his shabby but well-cut clothes, his fine\nprofile with its strong chin.She left off her little affectations,--a\ntribute to his own lack of them,--and sat back in her chair, watching\nthe fire.When K. chose, he could talk well.The Howes had been to Bermuda on\ntheir wedding trip.He knew Bermuda; that gave them a common ground.As for K., he frankly enjoyed\nthe little visit--drew himself at last with regret out of his chair."You\'ve been very nice to ask me in, Mrs."I hope you\nwill allow me to come again.But, of course, you are going to be very\ngay."It seemed to Christine she would never be gay again.She did not\nwant him to go away.The sound of his deep voice gave her a sense of\nsecurity.She liked the clasp of the hand he held out to her, when at\nlast he made a move toward the door.Howe I am sorry he missed our little party," said Le Moyne.As he closed the door behind him, there was a new light in Christine\'s\neyes.Things were not right, but, after all, they were not hopeless.One\nmight still have friends, big and strong, steady of eye and voice.When\nPalmer came home, the smile she gave him was not forced.The day\'s exertion had been bad for Anna.Le Moyne found her on the\ncouch in the transformed sewing-room, and gave her a quick glance of\napprehension.She was propped up high with pillows, with a bottle of\naromatic ammonia beside her."Just--short of breath," she panted.Sidney--is\ncoming home--to supper; and--the others--Palmer and--"\n\nThat was as far as she got.K., watch in hand, found her pulse thin,\nstringy, irregular.He had been prepared for some such emergency, and he\nhurried into his room for amyl-nitrate.When he came back she was almost\nunconscious.He broke the capsule\nin a towel, and held it over her face.After a time the spasm relaxed,\nbut her condition remained alarming.Harriet, who had come home by that time, sat by the couch and held her\nsister\'s hand.Only once in the next hour or so did she speak.Harriet was too wretched to\nnotice the professional manner in which K. set to work over Anna."I\'ve been a very hard sister to her," she said."If you can pull her\nthrough, I\'ll try to make up for it."Christine sat on the stairs outside, frightened and helpless.They had\nsent for Sidney; but the little house had no telephone, and the message\nwas slow in getting off.Ed came panting up the stairs and into the room."Well, this is sad, Harriet," said Dr."Why in the name of Heaven,\nwhen I wasn\'t around, didn\'t you get another doctor.If she had had some\namyl-nitrate--"\n\n"I gave her some nitrate of amyl," said K. quietly."There was really no\ntime to send for anybody.She almost went under at half-past five."Max had kept his word, and even Dr.He\ngave a quick glance at this tall young man who spoke so quietly of what\nhe had done for the sick woman, and went on with his work.Sidney arrived a little after six, and from that moment the confusion in\nthe sick-room was at an end.She moved Christine from the stairs,\nwhere Katie on her numerous errands must crawl over her; set Harriet to\nwarming her mother\'s bed and getting it ready; opened windows, brought\norder and quiet.And then, with death in her eyes, she took up her\nposition beside her mother.This was no time for weeping; that would\ncome later.Once she turned to K., standing watchfully beside her."I think you have known this for a long time," she said.And, when he\ndid not answer: "Why did you let me stay away from her?It would have\nbeen such a little time!""We were trying to do our best for both of you," he replied.It came as a cry from the depths of the\ngirl\'s new experience."She has had so little of life," she said, over and over."After all, Sidney," he said, "the Street IS life: the world is only\nmany streets.She had love and content, and she\nhad you."Anna died a little after midnight, a quiet passing, so that only Sidney\nand the two men knew when she went away.During all that long evening she had sat looking back over years of\nsmall unkindnesses.The thorn of Anna\'s inefficiency had always rankled\nin her flesh.She had been hard, uncompromising, thwarted.Once he thought she was fainting, and\nwent to her.Do you think you could get them all out of the room and\nlet me have her alone for just a few minutes?"He cleared the room, and took up his vigil outside the door.And, as he\nstood there, he thought of what he had said to Sidney about the Street.Here in this very house were death and\nseparation; Harriet\'s starved life; Christine and Palmer beginning a\nlong and doubtful future together; himself, a failure, and an impostor.When he opened the door again, Sidney was standing by her mother\'s bed.He went to her, and she turned and put her head against his shoulder\nlike a tired child."Take me away, K.," she said pitifully.And, with his arm around her, he led her out of the room.Outside of her small immediate circle Anna\'s death was hardly felt.Harriet carried back to her\nbusiness a heaviness of spirit that made it difficult to bear with\nthe small irritations of her day.Perhaps Anna\'s incapacity, which had\nalways annoyed her, had been physical.She must have had her trouble a\nlongtime.She remembered other women of the Street who had crept through\ninefficient days, and had at last laid down their burdens and closed\ntheir mild eyes, to the lasting astonishment of their families.What did\nthey think about, these women, as they pottered about?Did they resent\nthe impatience that met their lagging movements, the indifference\nthat would not see how they were failing?Hot tears fell on Harriet\'s\nfashion-book as it lay on her knee.Not only for Anna--for Anna\'s\nprototypes everywhere.On Sidney--and in less measure, of course, on K.--fell the real brunt of\nthe disaster.Sidney kept up well until after the funeral, but went down\nthe next day with a low fever.Ed said, and sternly forbade the hospital\nagain until Christmas.Morning and evening K. stopped at her door and\ninquired for her, and morning and evening came Sidney\'s reply:--\n\n"Much better.But the days dragged on and she did not get about.Downstairs, Christine and Palmer had entered on the round of midwinter\ngayeties.Palmer\'s "crowd" was a lively one.There were dinners\nand dances, week-end excursions to country-houses.The Street grew\naccustomed to seeing automobiles stop before the little house at all\nhours of the night.Johnny Rosenfeld, driving Palmer\'s car, took to\nfalling asleep at the wheel in broad daylight, and voiced his discontent\nto his mother."You never know where you are with them guys," he said briefly."We\nstart out for half an hour\'s run in the evening, and get home with the\nmilk-wagons.And the more some of them have had to drink, the more they\nwant to drive the machine.If I get a chance, I\'m going to beat it while\nthe wind\'s my way."But, talk as he might, in Johnny Rosenfeld\'s loyal heart there was no\nthought of desertion.Palmer had given him a man\'s job, and he would\nstick by it, no matter what came.There were some things that Johnny Rosenfeld did not tell his mother.There were evenings when the Howe car was filled, not with Christine\nand her friends, but with women of a different world; evenings when the\ndestination was not a country estate, but a road-house; evenings when\nJohnny Rosenfeld, ousted from the driver\'s seat by some drunken youth,\nwould hold tight to the swinging car and say such fragments of prayers\nas he could remember.Johnny Rosenfeld, who had started life with few\nillusions, was in danger of losing such as he had.One such night Christine put in, lying wakefully in her bed, while the\nclock on the mantel tolled hour after hour into the night.Palmer did\nnot come home at all.He sent a note from the office in the morning:\n\n"I hope you are not worried, darling.The car broke down near the\nCountry Club last night, and there was nothing to do but to spend the\nnight there.I would have sent you word, but I did not want to rouse\nyou.What do you say to the theater to-night and supper afterward?"She telephoned the Country Club that morning,\nand found that Palmer had not been there.But, although she knew now\nthat he was deceiving her, as he always had deceived her, as probably\nhe always would, she hesitated to confront him with what she knew.She\nshrank, as many a woman has shrunk before, from confronting him with his\nlie.But the second time it happened, she was roused.It was almost Christmas\nthen, and Sidney was well on the way to recovery, thinner and very\nwhite, but going slowly up and down the staircase on K.\'s arm, and\nsitting with Harriet and K. at the dinner table.She was begging to be\nback on duty for Christmas, and K. felt that he would have to give her\nup soon.At three o\'clock one morning Sidney roused from a light sleep to hear a\nrapping on her door.She carried a\ncandle, and before she spoke she looked at Sidney\'s watch on the bedside\ntable."I hoped my clock was wrong," she said."I am sorry to waken you,\nSidney, but I don\'t know what to do."Sidney had lighted the gas and was throwing on her dressing-gown."When he went out did he say--"\n\n"He said nothing.Sidney, I am going home in the\nmorning.""You don\'t mean that, do you?""Don\'t I look as if I mean it?How much of this sort of thing is a woman\nsupposed to endure?"These things always seem terrible in the\nmiddle of the night, but by morning--"\n\nChristine whirled on her.You remember the letter I got on my wedding\nday?""Believe it or not," said Christine doggedly, "that\'s exactly what has\nhappened.I got something out of that little rat of a Rosenfeld boy, and\nthe rest I know because I know Palmer.The hospital had taught Sidney one thing: that it took many people to\nmake a world, and that out of these some were inevitably vicious.But\nvice had remained for her a clear abstraction.There were such people,\nand because one was in the world for service one cared for them.Even\nthe Saviour had been kind to the woman of the streets.But here abruptly Sidney found the great injustice of the world--that\nbecause of this vice the good suffer more than the wicked."It makes me hate all the men in the world.Palmer cares for you, and yet he can do a thing like this!"Christine was pacing nervously up and down the room.Mere companionship\nhad soothed her.She was now, on the surface at least, less excited than\nSidney."They are not all like Palmer, thank Heaven," she said.My father is one, and your K., here in the house, is\nanother."At four o\'clock in the morning Palmer Howe came home.Christine met\nhim in the lower hall.She\nconfronted him in her straight white gown and waited for him to speak."I am sorry to be so late, Chris," he said."The fact is, I am all in.I\nwas driving the car out Seven Mile Run.We blew out a tire and the thing\nturned over."Christine noticed then that his right arm was hanging inert by his side.CHAPTER XVI\n\n\nYoung Howe had been firmly resolved to give up all his bachelor habits\nwith his wedding day.In his indolent, rather selfish way, he was much\nin love with his wife.But with the inevitable misunderstandings of the first months of\nmarriage had come a desire to be appreciated once again at his face\nvalue.Grace had taken him, not for what he was, but for what he seemed\nto be.She knew him now--all his small\nindolences, his affectations, his weaknesses.Later on, like other\nwomen since the world began, she would learn to dissemble, to affect to\nbelieve him what he was not.And so, back to Grace six weeks after his wedding day came Palmer\nHowe, not with a suggestion to renew the old relationship, but for\ncomradeship.Christine sulked--he wanted good cheer; Christine was intolerant--he\nwanted tolerance; she disapproved of him and showed her disapproval--he\nwanted approval.He wanted life to be comfortable and cheerful, without\nrecriminations, a little work and much play, a drink when one was\nthirsty.Distorted though it was, and founded on a wrong basis, perhaps,\ndeep in his heart Palmer\'s only longing was for happiness; but this\nhappiness must be of an active sort--not content, which is passive, but\nenjoyment.No taxi working its head\noff for us.Just a little run over the country roads, eh?"It was the afternoon of the day before Christine\'s night visit to\nSidney.The office had been closed, owing to a death, and Palmer was in\npossession of a holiday."We\'ll go out to the Climbing Rose and have\nsupper.""That\'s not true, Grace, and you know it."The roads are frozen hard; an hour\'s run\ninto the country will bring your color back."Go and ride with your wife," said the girl,\nand flung away from him.The last few weeks had filled out her thin figure, but she still bore\ntraces of her illness.She\nlooked curiously boyish, almost sexless.Because she saw him wince when she mentioned Christine, her ill temper\nincreased."You get out of here," she said suddenly."I didn\'t ask you to come\nback.You always knew I would have to marry some day."I didn\'t hear any reports of you hanging\naround the hospital to learn how I was getting along."Besides, one of--" He hesitated over his wife\'s name."A\ngirl I know very well was in the training-school.There would have been\nthe devil to pay if I\'d as much as called up.""You never told me you were going to get married."Cornered, he slipped an arm around her."I meant to tell you, honey; but you got sick.Anyhow, I--I hated to\ntell you, honey."There was a comfortable feeling of\ncoming home about going there again.And, now that the worst minute of\ntheir meeting was over, he was visibly happier.But Grace continued to\nstand eyeing him somberly."I\'ve got something to tell you," she said."Don\'t have a fit, and don\'t\nlaugh.If you do, I\'ll--I\'ll jump out of the window.I\'ve got a place in\na store.She was a nice girl and he was fond of her.And he was not unselfish about it.He did not want her to belong to any one else."One of the nurses in the hospital, a Miss Page, has got me something to\ndo at Lipton and Homburg\'s.I am going on for the January white sale.If\nI make good they will keep me."He had put her aside without a qualm; and now he met her announcement\nwith approval.They would have a holiday\ntogether, and then they would say good-bye.He was getting off well, all things considered.But that isn\'t any\nreason why we shouldn\'t be friends, is it?I would like to feel that I can stop in now and then and say how do you\ndo."The mention of Sidney\'s name brought up in his mind Christine as he had\nleft her that morning.She used to be a good sport,\nbut she had never been the same since the day of the wedding.He thought\nher attitude toward him was one of suspicion.But any attempt on his part to fathom it only met with cold silence."I\'ll tell you what we\'ll do," he said."We won\'t go to any of the old\nplaces.I\'ve found a new roadhouse in the country that\'s respectable\nenough to suit anybody.We\'ll go out to Schwitter\'s and get some dinner.And on the way out he lived up to the letter of\ntheir agreement.The situation exhilarated him: Grace with her new air\nof virtue, her new aloofness; his comfortable car; Johnny Rosenfeld\'s\ndiscreet back and alert ears.The adventure had all the thrill of a new conquest in it.He treated the\ngirl with deference, did not insist when she refused a cigarette, felt\nglowingly virtuous and exultant at the same time.When the car drew up before the Schwitter place, he slipped a\nfive-dollar bill into Johnny Rosenfeld\'s not over-clean hand."I don\'t mind the ears," he said.And\nJohnny stalled his engine in sheer surprise."There\'s just enough of the Jew in me," said Johnny, "to know how to\ntalk a lot and say nothing, Mr.He crawled stiffly out of the car and prepared to crank it."I\'ll just give her the \'once over\' now and then," he said."She\'ll\nfreeze solid if I let her stand."Grace had gone up the narrow path to the house.She had the gift of\nlooking well in her clothes, and her small hat with its long quill\nand her motor-coat were chic and becoming.She never overdressed, as\nChristine was inclined to do.Fortunately for Palmer, Tillie did not see him.A heavy German maid\nwaited at the table in the dining-room, while Tillie baked waffles in\nthe kitchen.Johnny Rosenfeld, going around the side path to the kitchen door with\nvisions of hot coffee and a country supper for his frozen stomach, saw\nher through the window bending flushed over the stove, and hesitated.Then, without a word, he tiptoed back to the car again, and, crawling\ninto the tonneau, covered himself with rugs.In his untutored mind were\ncertain great qualities, and loyalty to his employer was one.The five\ndollars in his pocket had nothing whatever to do with it.At eighteen he had developed a philosophy of four words.It took the\nplace of the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, and the Catechism.It\nwas: "Mind your own business."The discovery of Tillie\'s hiding-place interested but did not thrill\nhim.If she wanted to do the sort of thing she\nwas doing, that was her affair.Tillie and her middle-aged lover, Palmer\nHowe and Grace--the alley was not unfamiliar with such relationships.It\nviewed them with tolerance until they were found out, when it raised its\nhands.True to his promise, Palmer wakened the sleeping boy before nine\no\'clock.Grace had eaten little and drunk nothing; but Howe was slightly\nstimulated."Give her the \'once over,\'" he told Johnny, "and then go back and crawl\ninto the rugs again.Their progress was slow and rough over the\ncountry roads, but when they reached the State road Howe threw open the\nthrottle.He took chances\nand got away with them, laughing at the girl\'s gasps of dismay."Wait until I get beyond Simkinsville," he said, "and I\'ll let her out.The girl sat beside him with her eyes fixed ahead.He had been drinking,\nand the warmth of the liquor was in his voice.She was going to make him live up to the letter of his promise to\ngo away at the house door; and more and more she realized that it would\nbe difficult.Instead of laughing when\nshe drew back from a proffered caress, he turned surly.Obstinate lines\nthat she remembered appeared from his nostrils to the corners of his\nmouth.Finally she hit on a plan to make him stop somewhere in her neighborhood\nand let her get out of the car.Now it passed them, and as\noften they passed it.Palmer\'s car lost on\nthe hills, but gained on the long level stretches, which gleamed with a\ncoating of thin ice."I wish you\'d let them get ahead, Palmer."I told you we\'d travel to-night."What the deuce was the matter with\nwomen, anyhow?Here was Grace as\nsober as Christine.His light car skidded and struck the big car heavily.On a smooth road\nperhaps nothing more serious than broken mudguards would have been the\nresult.But on the ice the small car slewed around and slid over the\nedge of the bank.At the bottom of the declivity it turned over.Howe freed himself and stood\nerect, with one arm hanging at his side.There was no sound at all from\nthe boy under the tonneau.Down the bank plunged a heavy, gorilla-like\nfigure, long arms pushing aside the frozen branches of trees.When he\nreached the car, O\'Hara found Grace sitting unhurt on the ground.In the\nwreck of the car the lamps had not been extinguished, and by their light\nhe made out Howe, swaying dizzily.The other members of O\'Hara\'s party had crawled down the bank by that\ntime.With the aid of a jack, they got the car up.Johnny Rosenfeld lay\ndoubled on his face underneath.When he came to and opened his eyes,\nGrace almost shrieked with relief."I\'m all right," said Johnny Rosenfeld.And, when they offered him\nwhiskey: "Away with the fire-water.I--I--" A spasm of\npain twisted his face.With his arms he lifted\nhimself to a sitting position, and fell back again.CHAPTER XVII\n\n\nBy Christmas Day Sidney was back in the hospital, a little wan, but\nvaliantly determined to keep her life to its mark of service.She had a\ntalk with K. the night before she left.Katie was out, and Sidney had put the dining-room in order.K. sat by\nthe table and watched her as she moved about the room.The past few weeks had been very wonderful to him: to help her up and\ndown the stairs, to read to her in the evenings as she lay on the couch\nin the sewing-room; later, as she improved, to bring small dainties home\nfor her tray, and, having stood over Katie while she cooked them, to\nbear them in triumph to that upper room--he had not been so happy in\nyears."I hope you don\'t feel as if you must stay on," she said anxiously."Not\nthat we don\'t want you--you know better than that.""There is no place else in the whole world that I want to go to," he\nsaid simply."I seem to be always relying on somebody\'s kindness to--to keep things\ntogether.First, for years and years, it was Aunt Harriet; now it is\nyou.""Don\'t you realize that, instead of your being grateful to me, it is\nI who am undeniably grateful to you?I have lived\naround--in different places and in different ways.I would rather be\nhere than anywhere else in the world."There was so much that was hopeless in his\neyes that he did not want her to see.She would be quite capable, he\ntold himself savagely, of marrying him out of sheer pity if she ever\nguessed.And he was afraid--afraid, since he wanted her so much--that he\nwould be fool and weakling enough to take her even on those terms.Everything was ready for her return to the hospital.She had been out\nthat day to put flowers on the quiet grave where Anna lay with folded\nhands; she had made her round of little visits on the Street; and now\nher suit-case, packed, was in the hall."In one way, it will be a little better for you than if Christine and\nPalmer were not in the house."She likes you, K. She depends on you, too, especially since that night\nwhen you took care of Palmer\'s arm before we got Dr.I often think,\nK., what a good doctor you would have been.You knew so well what to do\nfor mother."She still could not trust her voice about her mother."Palmer\'s arm is going to be quite straight.Ed is so proud of Max\nover it.Once at least, whenever they were\ntogether, she brought Max into the conversation.He is\ninteresting, don\'t you think?""Very," said K.\n\nTo save his life, he could not put any warmth into his voice.It was not in human nature to expect more of him."Those long talks you have, shut in your room--what in the world do you\ntalk about?She was a little jealous of those evenings, when she sat alone, or\nwhen Harriet, sitting with her, made sketches under the lamp to the\naccompaniment of a steady hum of masculine voices from across the hall.Max came in always, before he went,\nand, leaning over the back of a chair, would inform her of the absolute\nblankness of life in the hospital without her."I go every day because I must," he would assure her gayly; "but, I tell\nyou, the snap is gone out of it.When there was a chance that every cap\nwas YOUR cap, the mere progress along a corridor became thrilling."He\nhad a foreign trick of throwing out his hands, with a little shrug of\nthe shoulders.he said--which, being translated, means:\n"What the devil\'s the use!"And K. would stand in the doorway, quietly smoking, or go back to his\nroom and lock away in his trunk the great German books on surgery with\nwhich he and Max had been working out a case.So K. sat by the dining-room table and listened to her talk of Max that\nlast evening together.Rosenfeld to-day not to be too much discouraged about\nJohnny.Now that you are\nsuch friends,"--she eyed him wistfully,--"perhaps some day you will come\nto one of his operations.Even if you didn\'t understand exactly, I know\nit would thrill you.And--I\'d like you to see me in my uniform, K. You\nnever have."She grew a little sad as the evening went on.She was going to miss K.\nvery much.While she was ill she had watched the clock for the time to\nlisten for him.She knew the way he slammed the front door.Palmer never\nslammed the door.She knew too that, just after a bang that threatened\nthe very glass in the transom, K. would come to the foot of the stairs\nand call:--\n\n"Ahoy, there!""Aye, aye," she would answer--which was, he assured her, the proper\nresponse.Whether he came up the stairs at once or took his way back to Katie had\ndepended on whether his tribute for the day was fruit or sweetbreads.He would miss her,\ntoo; but he would have Harriet and Christine and--Max.Back in a circle\nto Max, of course.She insisted, that last evening, on sitting up with him until midnight\nushered in Christmas Day.Christine and Palmer were out; Harriet, having\npresented Sidney with a blouse that had been left over in the shop from\nthe autumn\'s business, had yawned herself to bed.When the bells announced midnight, Sidney roused with a start.She\nrealized that neither of them had spoken, and that K.The little clock on the shelf took up the burden of the\nchurches, and struck the hour in quick staccato notes.Sidney rose and went over to K., her black dress in soft folds about\nher.Sidney left the little house at\nsix, with the street light still burning through a mist of falling snow.The hospital wards and corridors were still lighted when she went on\nduty at seven o\'clock.She had been assigned to the men\'s surgical ward,\nand went there at once.She had not seen Carlotta Harrison since her\nmother\'s death; but she found her on duty in the surgical ward.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.For the\nsecond time in four months, the two girls were working side by side.Sidney\'s recollection of her previous service under Carlotta made her\nnervous."We were all sorry to hear of your trouble," she said."I hope we shall\nget on nicely."Sidney surveyed the ward, full to overflowing.At the far end two cots\nhad been placed."The ward is heavy, isn\'t it?"There are three of\nus--you, myself, and a probationer."The first light of the Christmas morning was coming through the windows.Carlotta put out the lights and turned in a business-like way to her\nrecords."The probationer\'s name is Wardwell," she said."Perhaps you\'d better\nhelp her with the breakfasts.If there\'s any way to make a mistake, she\nmakes it."It was after eight when Sidney found Johnny Rosenfeld.Suffering had refined the boy\'s features.His dark, heavily fringed eyes\nlooked at her from a pale face."I was in a private room; but it cost thirty plunks a week, so I moved.Sidney had not seen him since his accident.She had wished to go, but K.\nhad urged against it.She was not strong, and she had already suffered\nmuch.And now the work of the ward pressed hard.She stood beside him and stroked his hand.He pretended to think that her sympathy was for his fall from the estate\nof a private patient to the free ward."Oh, I\'m all right, Miss Sidney," he said.Howe is paying six\ndollars a week for me.The difference between me and the other fellows\naround here is that I get a napkin on my tray and they don\'t.""Six dollars a week for a napkin is going some.I\'m no bloated\naristocrat; I don\'t have to have a napkin.""Have they told you what the trouble is?"Max Wilson is going to\noperate on me.What a thing it was\nto be able to take this life-in-death of Johnny Rosenfeld\'s and make it\nlife again!All sorts of men made up Sidney\'s world: the derelicts who wandered\nthrough the ward in flapping slippers, listlessly carrying trays; the\nunshaven men in the beds, looking forward to another day of boredom, if\nnot of pain; Palmer Howe with his broken arm; K., tender and strong, but\nfilling no especial place in the world.Towering over them all was the\nyounger Wilson.He meant for her, that Christmas morning, all that the\nother men were not--to their weakness strength, courage, daring, power.Johnny Rosenfeld lay back on the pillows and watched her face."When I was a kid," he said, "and ran along the Street, calling Dr.Max\na dude, I never thought I\'d lie here watching that door to see him come\nin.Ain\'t it the hell of a world, anyhow?It\nain\'t much of a Christmas to you, either."Sidney fed him his morning beef tea, and, because her eyes filled up\nwith tears now and then at his helplessness, she was not so skillful as\nshe might have been.When one spoonful had gone down his neck, he smiled\nup at her whimsically.As much as was possible, the hospital rested on that Christmas Day.The\ninternes went about in fresh white ducks with sprays of mistletoe in\ntheir buttonholes, doing few dressings.Over the upper floors, where the\nkitchens were located, spread toward noon the insidious odor of roasting\nturkeys.Every ward had its vase of holly.In the afternoon, services\nwere held in the chapel downstairs.Wheel-chairs made their slow progress along corridors and down\nelevators.Convalescents who were able to walk flapped along in carpet\nslippers.Outside the wide doors of the corridor\nthe wheel-chairs were arranged in a semicircle.Behind them, dressed for\nthe occasion, were the elevator-men, the orderlies, and Big John, who\ndrove the ambulance.On one side of the aisle, near the front, sat the nurses in rows, in\ncrisp caps and fresh uniforms.On the other side had been reserved a\nplace for the staff.The internes stood back against the wall, ready to\nrun out between rejoicings, as it were--for a cigarette or an ambulance\ncall, as the case might be.Over everything brooded the after-dinner peace of Christmas afternoon.The nurses sang, and Sidney sang with them, her fresh young voice rising\nabove the rest.Yellow winter sunlight came through the stained-glass\nwindows and shone on her lovely flushed face, her smooth kerchief, her\ncap, always just a little awry.Max, lounging against the wall, across the chapel, found his eyes\nstraying toward her constantly.What\na zest for living and for happiness she had!The Episcopal clergyman read the Epistle:\n\n"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even\nthy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.She was good, and she had been anointed with the oil of\ngladness.And he--\n\nHis brother was singing.His deep bass voice, not always true, boomed\nout above the sound of the small organ.Ed had been a good brother to\nhim; he had been a good son.Max\'s vagrant mind wandered away from the service to the picture of his\nmother over his brother\'s littered desk, to the Street, to K., to the\ngirl who had refused to marry him because she did not trust him, to\nCarlotta last of all.He turned a little and ran his eyes along the line\nof nurses.As if she were conscious of his scrutiny, she lifted\nher head and glanced toward him.The nurses sang:--\n\n     "O holy Child of Bethlehem!Descend to us, we pray;\n      Cast out our sin, and enter in,\n      Be born in us to-day."The wheel-chairs and convalescents quavered the familiar words.Ed\'s\nheavy throat shook with earnestness.The Head, sitting a little apart with her hands folded in her lap and\nweary with the suffering of the world, closed her eyes and listened.The Christmas morning had brought Sidney half a dozen gifts.K. sent her\na silver thermometer case with her monogram, Christine a toilet mirror.But the gift of gifts, over which Sidney\'s eyes had glowed, was a\ngreat box of roses marked in Dr.Max\'s copper-plate writing, "From a\nneighbor."Tucked in the soft folds of her kerchief was one of the roses that\nafternoon.Max was waiting for Sidney in the\ncorridor.--she glanced down to the rose\nshe wore."The others make the most splendid bit of color in the ward.""They are not any the less mine because I am letting other people have a\nchance to enjoy them."Under all his gayety he was curiously diffident with her.All the pretty\nspeeches he would have made to Carlotta under the circumstances died\nbefore her frank glance.There were many things he wanted to say to her.He wanted to tell her\nthat he was sorry her mother had died; that the Street was empty without\nher; that he looked forward to these daily meetings with her as a holy\nman to his hour before his saint.What he really said was to inquire\npolitely whether she had had her Christmas dinner.Sidney eyed him, half amused, half hurt.Is it bad for discipline for us to be good\nfriends?"Something in her eyes roused\nthe devil of mischief that always slumbered in him."My car\'s been stalled in a snowdrift downtown since early this morning,\nand I have Ed\'s Peggy in a sleigh.Put on your things and come for a\nride."He hoped Carlotta could hear what he said; to be certain of it, he\nmaliciously raised his voice a trifle.She was to be free that afternoon until six o\'clock;\nbut she had promised to go home.Ten to one, he\'s with her now."The\nheavy odor of the hospital, mingled with the scent of pine and evergreen\nin the chapel; made her dizzy.And,\nbesides, if K. were with Christine--\n\n"It\'s forbidden, isn\'t it?""And yet, you continue to tempt me and expect me to yield!""One of the most delightful things about temptation is yielding now and\nthen."Here was her old friend and\nneighbor asking to take her out for a daylight ride.The swift rebellion\nof youth against authority surged up in Sidney.Carlotta had gone by that time--gone with hate in her heart and black\ndespair.She knew very well what the issue would be.Sidney would drive\nwith him, and he would tell her how lovely she looked with the air on\nher face and the snow about her.The jerky motion of the little sleigh\nwould throw them close together.He would\ntouch Sidney\'s hand daringly and smile in her eyes.That was his method:\nto play at love-making like an audacious boy, until quite suddenly the\ncloak dropped and the danger was there.The Christmas excitement had not died out in the ward when Carlotta went\nback to it.On each bedside table was an orange, and beside it a pair\nof woolen gloves and a folded white handkerchief.There were sprays of\nholly scattered about, too, and the after-dinner content of roast turkey\nand ice-cream.The lame girl who played the violin limped down the corridor into the\nward.She was greeted with silence, that truest tribute, and with the\ninstant composing of the restless ward to peace.She was pretty in a young, pathetic way, and because to her Christmas\nwas a festival and meant hope and the promise of the young Lord, she\nplayed cheerful things.The ward sat up, remembered that it was not the Sabbath, smiled across\nfrom bed to bed.The probationer, whose name was Wardwell, was a tall, lean girl with a\nlong, pointed nose.She kept up a running accompaniment of small talk to\nthe music."Last Christmas," she said plaintively, "we went out into the country\nin a hay-wagon and had a real time.I don\'t know what I am here for,\nanyhow."Turkey and goose, mince pie and pumpkin pie, four kinds of cake; that\'s\nthe sort of spread we have up in our part of the world.When I think of\nwhat I sat down to to-day--!"She had a profound respect for Carlotta, and her motto in the hospital\ndiffered from Sidney\'s in that it was to placate her superiors, while\nSidney\'s had been to care for her patients.Seeing Carlotta bored, she ventured a little gossip.She had idly\nglued the label of a medicine bottle on the back of her hand, and was\nscratching a skull and cross-bones on it."I wonder if you have noticed something," she said, eyes on the label."I have noticed that the three-o\'clock medicines are not given," said\nCarlotta sharply; and Miss Wardwell, still labeled and adorned, made the\nrounds of the ward."I\'m no gossip," she said, putting the tray on the table."If you won\'t\nsee, you won\'t.As it was not required that tears be recorded on the record, Carlotta\npaid no attention to this.Miss Wardwell swelled with importance\nand let her superior ask her twice.A hand seemed to catch Carlotta\'s heart and hold it.Being an old friend doesn\'t make you look at a girl as if you\nwanted to take a bite out of her.Mark my word, Miss Harrison, she\'ll\nnever finish her training; she\'ll marry him.I wish," concluded the\nprobationer plaintively, "that some good-looking fellow like that would\ntake a fancy to me.I am as ugly as a mud fence, but\nI\'ve got style."She was long and sinuous, but she wore her\nlanky, ill-fitting clothes with a certain distinction.Harriet Kennedy\nwould have dressed her in jade green to match her eyes, and with long\njade earrings, and made her a fashion.The violinist had seen the tears on Johnny\nRosenfeld\'s white cheeks, and had rushed into rollicking, joyous music."I\'m twenty-one and she\'s eighteen," hummed the\nward under its breath."Lord, how I\'d like to dance!If I ever get out of this charnel-house!"The medicine-tray lay at Carlotta\'s elbow; beside it the box of labels.Carlotta knew it down to the depths of\nher tortured brain.As inevitably as the night followed the day, she was\nlosing her game.She had lost already, unless--\n\nIf she could get Sidney out of the hospital, it would simplify things.She surmised shrewdly that on the Street their interests were wide\napart.It was here that they met on common ground.The lame violin-player limped out of the ward; the shadows of the\nearly winter twilight settled down.At five o\'clock Carlotta sent Miss\nWardwell to first supper, to the surprise of that seldom surprised\nperson.The ward lay still or shuffled abut quietly.Christmas was over,\nand there were no evening papers to look forward to.Carlotta gave the five-o\'clock medicines.Then she sat down at the table\nnear the door, with the tray in front of her.There are certain thoughts\nthat are at first functions of the brain; after a long time the spinal\ncord takes them up and converts them into acts almost automatically.Perhaps because for the last month she had done the thing so often in\nher mind, its actual performance was almost without conscious thought.Carlotta took a bottle from her medicine cupboard, and, writing a new\nlabel for it, pasted it over the old one.Then she exchanged it for one\nof the same size on the medicine tray.In the dining-room, at the probationers\' table, Miss Wardwell was\ntalking."Believe me," she said, "me for the country and the simple life after\nthis.They think I\'m only a probationer and don\'t see anything, but I\'ve\ngot eyes in my head.Wilson, and she\nthinks I don\'t see it.But never mind; I paid, her up to-day for a few\nof the jolts she has given me."Throughout the dining-room busy and competent young women came and ate,\nhastily or leisurely as their opportunity was, and went on their way\nagain.In their hands they held the keys, not always of life and death\nperhaps, but of ease from pain, of tenderness, of smooth pillows, and\ncups of water to thirsty lips.In their eyes, as in Sidney\'s, burned the\nlight of service.But here and there one found women, like Carlotta and Miss Wardwell,\nwho had mistaken their vocation, who railed against the monotony of the\nlife, its limitations, its endless sacrifices.Fifty or so against two--fifty who looked out on the world with the\nfearless glance of those who have seen life to its depths, and, with the\nbroad understanding of actual contact, still found it good.Fifty who\nwere learning or had learned not to draw aside their clean starched\nskirts from the drab of the streets.And the fifty, who found the very\nscum of the gutters not too filthy for tenderness and care, let Carlotta\nand, in lesser measure, the new probationer alone.They could not have\nvoiced their reasons.The supper-room was filled with their soft voices, the rustle of their\nskirts, the gleam of their stiff white caps.When Carlotta came in, she greeted none of them.They did not like her,\nand she knew it.Before her, instead of the tidy supper-table, she was seeing the\nmedicine-tray as she had left it."I guess I\'ve fixed her," she said to herself.Her very soul was sick with fear of what she had done.CHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nK. saw Sidney for only a moment on Christmas Day.This was when the gay\nlittle sleigh had stopped in front of the house.Sidney had hurried radiantly in for a moment.Christine\'s parlor was\ngay with firelight and noisy with chatter and with the clatter of her\ntea-cups.K., lounging indolently in front of the fire, had turned to see Sidney\nin the doorway, and leaped to his feet."I can\'t come in," she cried.I am out\nsleigh-riding with Dr."Ask him in for a cup of tea," Christine called out."Here\'s Aunt\nHarriet and mother and even Palmer!"Christine had aged during the last weeks, but she was putting up a brave\nfront.Sidney ran to the front door and called: "Will you come in for a cup of\ntea?"As Sidney turned back into the house, she met Palmer.He had come out\nin the hall, and had closed the door into the parlor behind him.His arm\nwas still in splints, and swung suspended in a gay silk sling.The sound of laughter came through the door faintly.The boy\'s face was\nalways with him."Better in some ways, but of course--"\n\n"When are they going to operate?""He doesn\'t seem to blame you; he says it\'s all in the game.""Sidney, does Christine know that I was not alone that night?""If she guesses, it is not because of anything the boy has said.Out of the firelight, away from the chatter and the laughter, Palmer\'s\nface showed worn and haggard.He put his free hand on Sidney\'s shoulder."I was thinking that perhaps if I went away--"\n\n"That would be cowardly, wouldn\'t it?""If Christine would only say something and get it over with!She doesn\'t\nsulk; I think she\'s really trying to be kind.She turns pale every time I touch her hand."All the light had died out of Sidney\'s face.Life was terrible, after\nall--overwhelming.One did wrong things, and other people suffered; or\none was good, as her mother had been, and was left lonely, a widow, or\nlike Aunt Harriet.Things were so different from\nwhat they seemed to be: Christine beyond the door, pouring tea and\nlaughing with her heart in ashes; Palmer beside her, faultlessly dressed\nand wretched.The only one she thought really contented was K. He seemed\nto move so calmly in his little orbit.He was always so steady, so\nbalanced.If life held no heights for him, at least it held no depths."There\'s only one thing, Palmer," she said gravely."Johnny Rosenfeld\nis going to have his chance.If anybody in the world can save him, Max\nWilson can."The light of that speech was in her eyes when she went out to the sleigh\nagain.K. followed her out and tucked the robes in carefully about her.Is there any chance of having you home for supper?"I am to go on duty at six again."He waved them\noff smilingly from the pavement, and went rather heavily back into the\nhouse."Just how many men are in love with you, Sidney?"asked Max, as Peggy\nstarted up the Street."No one that I know of, unless--"\n\n"Exactly.Unless--"\n\n"What I meant," she said with dignity, "is that unless one counts very\nyoung men, and that isn\'t really love.""We\'ll leave out Joe Drummond and myself--for, of course, I am very\nyoung.Who is in love with you besides Le Moyne?Any of the internes at\nthe hospital?"Le Moyne is not in love with me."There was such sincerity in her voice that Wilson was relieved.K., older than himself and more grave, had always had an odd attraction\nfor women.He had been frankly bored by them, but the fact had remained.And Max more than suspected that now, at last, he had been caught."Don\'t you really mean that you are in love with Le Moyne?"I am not in love with anybody; I haven\'t time\nto be in love.So warm did the argument become that\nthey passed without seeing a middle-aged gentleman, short and rather\nheavy set, struggling through a snowdrift on foot, and carrying in his\nhand a dilapidated leather bag.But the cutter slipped by and left him knee-deep,\nlooking ruefully after them.Ed\'s mind, only a vague and\ninarticulate regret.These things that came so easily to Max, the\naffection of women, gay little irresponsibilities like the stealing\nof Peggy and the sleigh, had never been his.If there was any faint\nresentment, it was at himself.He had raised the boy wrong--he had\ntaught him to be selfish.Holding the bag high out of the drifts, he\nmade his slow progress up the Street.At something after two o\'clock that night, K. put down his pipe\nand listened.He had not been able to sleep since midnight.In his\ndressing-gown he had sat by the small fire, thinking.The content of his\nfirst few months on the Street was rapidly giving way to unrest.He\nwho had meant to cut himself off from life found himself again in close\ntouch with it; his eddy was deep with it.For the first time, he had begun to question the wisdom of what he had\ndone.It had taken courage, God knew,\nto give up everything and come away.In a way, it would have taken more\ncourage to have stayed.He had thought, at first, that he could\nfight down this love for Sidney.The\ninnocent touch of her hand on his arm, the moment when he had held her\nin his arms after her mother\'s death, the thousand small contacts of her\nreturns to the little house--all these set his blood on fire.Under his quiet exterior K. fought many conflicts those winter\ndays--over his desk and ledger at the office, in his room alone,\nwith Harriet planning fresh triumphs beyond the partition, even by\nChristine\'s fire, with Christine just across, sitting in silence and\nwatching his grave profile and steady eyes.He had a little picture of Sidney--a snap-shot that he had taken\nhimself.It showed Sidney minus a hand, which had been out of range when\nthe camera had been snapped, and standing on a steep declivity\nwhich would have been quite a level had he held the camera straight.Nevertheless it was Sidney, her hair blowing about her, eyes looking\nout, tender lips smiling.When she was not at home, it sat on K.\'s\ndresser, propped against his collar-box.When she was in the house, it\nlay under the pin-cushion.Two o\'clock in the morning, then, and K. in his dressing-gown, with the\npicture propped, not against the collar-box, but against his lamp, where\nhe could see it.He sat forward in his chair, his hands folded around his knee, and\nlooked at it.He was trying to picture the Sidney of the photograph\nin his old life--trying to find a place for her.There had been few women in his old life.There had been women who had cared for him, but he put them\nimpatiently out of his mind.Almost\nbefore he had heaved his long legs out of the chair, she was tapping at\nhis door outside.Rosenfeld was standing in the lower hall,\na shawl about her shoulders."I\'ve had word to go to the hospital," she said."I thought maybe you\'d\ngo with me.It seems as if I can\'t stand it alone."Are you afraid to stay in the house alone?"He ran up the staircase to his room and flung on some clothing.Rosenfeld\'s sobs had become low moans; Christine stood\nhelplessly over her."I am terribly sorry," she said--"terribly sorry!When I think whose\nfault all this is!"Rosenfeld put out a work-hardened hand and caught Christine\'s\nfingers.I guess you and I\nunderstand each other.K. never forgot the scene in the small emergency ward to which Johnny\nhad been taken.Under the white lights his boyish figure looked\nstrangely long.There was a group around the bed--Max Wilson, two or\nthree internes, the night nurse on duty, and the Head.Sitting just inside the door on a straight chair was Sidney--such a\nSidney as he never had seen before, her face colorless, her eyes wide\nand unseeing, her hands clenched in her lap.When he stood beside her,\nshe did not move or look up.The group around the bed had parted to\nadmit Mrs.Only Sidney and K. remained by\nthe door, isolated, alone."You must not take it like that, dear.But, after\nall, in that condition--"\n\nIt was her first knowledge that he was there.Her voice was dreary, inflectionless."They say I gave him the wrong medicine; that he\'s dying; that I\nmurdered him."I came on duty at six o\'clock and gave the\nmedicines.When the night nurse came on at seven, everything was all\nright.The medicine-tray was just as it should be.I\nwent to say good-night to him and he--he was asleep.I didn\'t give him\nanything but what was on the tray," she finished piteously."I looked at\nthe label; I always look."By a shifting of the group around the bed, K.\'s eyes looked for a moment\ndirectly into Carlotta\'s.Just for a moment; then the crowd closed up\nagain.It was well for Carlotta that it did.She looked as if she had\nseen a ghost--closed her eyes, even reeled."Get some one to\ntake her place."After all, the presence of this man in this room\nat such a time meant nothing.He was Sidney\'s friend, that was all.It was the boy\'s weakened condition that was turning her\nrevenge into tragedy."I am all right," she pleaded across the bed to the Head.He had done everything he knew without\nresult.The boy, rousing for an instant, would lapse again into stupor.With a healthy man they could have tried more vigorous measures--could\nhave forced him to his feet and walked him about, could have beaten him\nwith knotted towels dipped in ice-water.But the wrecked body on the bed\ncould stand no such heroic treatment.It was Le Moyne, after all, who saved Johnny Rosenfeld\'s life.For, when\nstaff and nurses had exhausted all their resources, he stepped forward\nwith a quiet word that brought the internes to their feet astonished.There was a new treatment for such cases--it had been tried abroad."Try it, for Heaven\'s sake," he said.The apparatus was not in the house--must be extemporized, indeed, at\nlast, of odds and ends from the operating-room.K. did the work, his\nlong fingers deft and skillful--while Mrs.Rosenfeld knelt by the bed\nwith her face buried; while Sidney sat, dazed and bewildered, on her\nlittle chair inside the door; while night nurses tiptoed along the\ncorridor, and the night watchman stared incredulous from outside the\ndoor.When the two great rectangles that were the emergency ward windows\nhad turned from mirrors reflecting the room to gray rectangles in the\nmorning light; Johnny Rosenfeld opened his eyes and spoke the first\nwords that marked his return from the dark valley.When it was clear that the boy would live, K. rose stiffly from the\nbedside and went over to Sidney\'s chair."He\'s all right now," he said--"as all right as he can be, poor lad!"How strange that you should know such a thing.The internes, talking among themselves, had wandered down to their\ndining-room for early coffee.Wilson was giving a few last instructions\nas to the boy\'s care.\'s hand and\nheld it to her lips.The iron repression of the night, of months indeed,\nfell away before her simple caress."My dear, my dear," he said huskily."Anything that I can do--for\nyou--at any time--"\n\nIt was after Sidney had crept like a broken thing to her room that\nCarlotta Harrison and K. came face to face.Johnny was quite conscious\nby that time, a little blue around the lips, but valiantly cheerful."More things can happen to a fellow than I ever knew there was!"he\nsaid to his mother, and submitted rather sheepishly to her tears and\ncaresses."You were always a good boy, Johnny," she said."Just you get well\nenough to come home.I\'ll take care of you the rest of my life.We will\nget you a wheel-chair when you can be about, and I can take you out in\nthe park when I come from work.""I\'ll be passenger and you\'ll be chauffeur, ma."Le Moyne is going to get your father sent up again.With sixty-five\ncents a day and what I make, we\'ll get along.""Oh, Johnny, if I could see you coming in the door again and yelling\n\'mother\' and\'supper\' in one breath!"The meeting between Carlotta and Le Moyne was very quiet.She had been\nmaking a sort of subconscious impression on the retina of his mind\nduring all the night.It would be difficult to tell when he actually\nknew her.When the preparations for moving Johnny back to the big ward had been\nmade, the other nurses left the room, and Carlotta and the boy were\ntogether.K. stopped her on her way to the door.Edwardes here; my name is Le Moyne.""I have not seen you since you left St."No; I--I rested for a few months.""I suppose they do not know that you were--that you have had any\nprevious hospital experience.""I shall not tell them, of course."And thus, by simple mutual consent, it was arranged that each should\nrespect the other\'s confidence.There had been a time, just before dawn,\nwhen she had had one of those swift revelations that sometimes come at\nthe end of a long night.The boy was\nvery low, hardly breathing.Her past stretched behind her, a series of\nsmall revenges and passionate outbursts, swift yieldings, slow remorse.She would have given every hope she had in the\nworld, just then, for Sidney\'s stainless past.She hated herself with that deadliest loathing that comes of complete\nself-revelation.And she carried to her room the knowledge that the night\'s struggle had\nbeen in vain--that, although Johnny Rosenfeld would live, she had gained\nnothing by what he had suffered.The whole night had shown her the\nhopelessness of any stratagem to win Wilson from his new allegiance.She\nhad surprised him in the hallway, watching Sidney\'s slender figure\nas she made her way up the stairs to her room.Never, in all his past\novertures to her, had she seen that look in his eyes.CHAPTER XIX\n\n\nTo Harriet Kennedy, Sidney\'s sentence of thirty days\' suspension came\nas a blow.K. broke the news to her that evening before the time for\nSidney\'s arrival.The little household was sharing in Harriet\'s prosperity.Katie had\na helper now, a little Austrian girl named Mimi.And Harriet had\nestablished on the Street the innovation of after-dinner coffee.It was\nover the after-dinner coffee that K. made his announcement."What do you mean by saying she is coming home for thirty days?"Not ill, although she is not quite well.The fact is, Harriet,"--for\nit was "Harriet" and "K."by this time,--"there has been a sort of\nsemi-accident up at the hospital.It hasn\'t resulted seriously, but--"\n\nHarriet put down the apostle-spoon in her hand and stared across at him."There was a mistake about the medicine, and she was blamed; that\'s\nall.""She\'d better come home and stay home," said Harriet shortly."I hope it\ndoesn\'t get in the papers.This dressmaking business is a funny sort of\nthing.One word against you or any of your family, and the crowd\'s off\nsomewhere else.""There\'s nothing against Sidney," K. reminded her.It seems it\'s a\nmere matter of discipline.Somebody made a mistake, and they cannot let\nsuch a thing go by.But he believes, as I do, that it was not Sidney."However Harriet had hardened herself against the girl\'s arrival, all she\nhad meant to say fled when she saw Sidney\'s circled eyes and pathetic\nmouth.And took her corseted\nbosom.For the time at least, Sidney\'s world had gone to pieces about her.All\nher brave vaunt of service faded before her disgrace.When Christine would have seen her, she kept her door locked and asked\nfor just that one evening alone.But after Harriet had retired, and\nMimi, the Austrian, had crept out to the corner to mail a letter back to\nGratz, Sidney unbolted her door and listened in the little upper hall.Harriet, her head in a towel, her face carefully cold-creamed, had gone\nto bed; but K.\'s light, as usual, was shining over the transom.Sidney\ntiptoed to the door."May I come in and talk to you?"He turned and took a quick survey of the room.The picture was against\nthe collar-box.But he took the risk and held the door wide.Sidney came in and sat down by the fire.By being adroit he managed to\nslip the little picture over and under the box before she saw it.It is\ndoubtful if she would have realized its significance, had she seen it."I\'ve been thinking things over," she said."It seems to me I\'d better\nnot go back.""That would be foolish, wouldn\'t it, when you have done so well?And,\nbesides, since you are not guilty, Sidney--"\n\n"I didn\'t do it!"I can\'t keep on; that\'s all there is to it.All\nlast night, in the emergency ward, I felt it going.I\nkept saying to myself: \'You didn\'t do it, you didn\'t do it\'; and all the\ntime something inside of me was saying, \'Not now, perhaps; but sometime\nyou may.\'"Poor K., who had reasoned all this out for himself and had come to the\nsame impasse!"To go on like this, feeling that one has life and death in one\'s hand,\nand then perhaps some day to make a mistake like that!"She looked up at\nhim forlornly."I am just not brave enough, K.""Wouldn\'t it be braver to keep on?Her world was in pieces about her, and she felt alone in a wide and\nempty place.And, because her nerves were drawn taut until they were\nready to snap, Sidney turned on him shrewishly."I think you are all afraid I will come back to stay.Nobody really\nwants me anywhere--in all the world!Not at the hospital, not here, not\nanyplace."When you say that nobody wants you," said K., not very steadily, "I--I\nthink you are making a mistake."The only person\nwho ever really wanted me was my mother, and I went away and left her!"She scanned his face closely, and, reading there something she did not\nunderstand, she  suddenly."No; I do not mean Joe Drummond."If he had found any encouragement in her face, he would have gone on\nrecklessly; but her blank eyes warned him."If you mean Max Wilson," said Sidney, "you are entirely wrong.He\'s not\nin love with me--not, that is, any more than he is in love with a\ndozen girls.He likes to be with me--oh, I know that; but that doesn\'t\nmean--anything else.Anyhow, after this disgrace--"\n\n"There is no disgrace, child.""He\'ll think me careless, at the least."You say he likes to be with you.Sidney had been sitting in a low chair by the fire.She rose with a\nsudden passionate movement.In the informality of the household, she,\nhad visited K. in her dressing-gown and slippers; and now she stood\nbefore him, a tragic young figure, clutching the folds of her gown\nacross her breast."I worship him, K.," she said tragically."When I see him coming, I want\nto get down and let him walk on me.I\nknow the very way he rings for the elevator.When I see him in the\noperating-room, cool and calm while every one else is flustered and\nexcited, he--he looks like a god."Then, half ashamed of her outburst, she turned her back to him and stood\ngazing at the small coal fire.It was as well for K. that she did not\nsee his face.For that one moment the despair that was in him shone in\nhis eyes.He glanced around the shabby little room, at the sagging bed,\nthe collar-box, the pincushion, the old marble-topped bureau under which\nReginald had formerly made his nest, at his untidy table, littered with\npipes and books, at the image in the mirror of his own tall figure,\nstooped and weary."You\'re sure it\'s not\njust--glamour, Sidney?"Her voice was muffled, and he knew then that\nshe was crying.Tears, of course, except in the privacy\nof one\'s closet, were not ethical on the Street."Give me a handkerchief," said Sidney in a muffled tone, and the little\nscene was broken into while K. searched through a bureau drawer.Then:\n\n"It\'s all over, anyhow, since this.If he\'d really cared he\'d have come\nover to-night.Back in a circle she came inevitably to her suspension.She would never\ngo back, she said passionately.She was innocent, had been falsely\naccused.If they could think such a thing about her, she didn\'t want to\nbe in their old hospital.K. questioned her, alternately soothing and probing.I have given him his medicines dozens of times.""Who else had access to the medicine closet?""Carlotta Harrison carried the keys, of course.I was off duty from four\nto six.When Carlotta left the ward, the probationer would have them.""Have you reason to think that either one of these girls would wish you\nharm?""None whatever," began Sidney vehemently; and then, checking\nherself,--"unless--but that\'s rather ridiculous.""I\'ve sometimes thought that Carlotta--but I am sure she is perfectly\nfair with me.Even if she--if she--"\n\n"Yes?"Wilson, I don\'t believe--Why, K., she wouldn\'t!"Murder, of course," said K., "in intention, anyhow.I\'m only trying to find out whose mistake it was."Soon after that she said good-night and went out.She turned in the\ndoorway and smiled tremulously back at him."You have done me a lot of good.With a quick movement that was one of her charms, Sidney suddenly closed\nthe door and slipped back into the room.K., hearing the door close,\nthought she had gone, and dropped heavily into a chair.said Sidney suddenly from behind him,\nand, bending over, she kissed him on the cheek.The next instant the door had closed behind her, and K. was left alone\nto such wretchedness and bliss as the evening had brought him.On toward morning, Harriet, who slept but restlessly in her towel,\nwakened to the glare of his light over the transom."I wish you wouldn\'t go to\nsleep and let your light burn!"K., surmising the towel and cold cream, had the tact not to open his\ndoor."I am not asleep, Harriet, and I am sorry about the light.Before he extinguished the light, he walked over to the old dresser and\nsurveyed himself in the glass.Two nights without sleep and much anxiety\nhad told on him.He looked old, haggard; infinitely tired.Mentally he\ncompared himself with Wilson, flushed with success, erect, triumphant,\nalmost insolent.Nothing had more certainly told him the hopelessness\nof his love for Sidney than her good-night kiss.He drew a long breath and proceeded\nto undress in the dark.Joe Drummond came to see Sidney the next day.She would have avoided\nhim if she could, but Mimi had ushered him up to the sewing-room boudoir\nbefore she had time to escape.She had not seen the boy for two months,\nand the change in him startled her.He was thinner, rather hectic,\nscrupulously well dressed.she said, and then: "Won\'t you sit down?"He dramatized himself, as he had that\nnight the June before when he had asked Sidney to marry him.He offered no conventional greeting whatever;\nbut, after surveying her briefly, her black gown, the lines around her\neyes:--\n\n"You\'re not going back to that place, of course?""Then somebody\'s got to decide for you.The thing for you to do is to\nstay right here, Sidney.Nobody here\nwould ever accuse you of trying to murder anybody."In spite of herself, Sidney smiled a little.It was a mistake about the\nmedicines.His love was purely selfish, for he brushed aside her protest as if she\nhad not spoken."You give me the word and I\'ll go and get your things; I\'ve got a car of\nmy own now.""But, Joe, they have only done what they thought was right.Whoever made\nit, there was a mistake.""You don\'t mean that you are going to stand for this sort of thing?Every time some fool makes a mistake, are they going to blame it on\nyou?"I can\'t talk to you\nif you explode like a rocket all the time."Her matter-of-fact tone had its effect.He advanced into the room, but\nhe still scorned a chair."I guess you\'ve been wondering why you haven\'t heard from me," he said."I\'ve seen you more than you\'ve seen me."The idea of espionage is always repugnant, and\nto have a rejected lover always in the offing, as it were, was\ndisconcerting."I wish you would be just a little bit sensible, Joe.It\'s so silly of\nyou, really.It\'s not because you care for me; it\'s really because you\ncare for yourself.""You can\'t look at me and say that, Sid."He ran his finger around his collar--an old gesture; but the collar was\nvery loose."I\'m just eating my heart out for you, and that\'s the truth.Everywhere I go, people say, \'There\'s the fellow Sidney\nPage turned down when she went to the hospital.\'I\'ve got so I keep off\nthe Street as much as I can."Sidney was half alarmed, half irritated.This wild, excited boy was not\nthe doggedly faithful youth she had always known.It seemed to her\nthat he was hardly sane--that underneath his quiet manner and carefully\nrepressed voice there lurked something irrational, something she could\nnot cope with."But what do you want me to do?If you\'d\nonly sit down--"\n\n"I want you to come home.I just want\nyou to come back, so that things will be the way they used to be.Now\nthat they have turned you out--"\n\n"They\'ve done nothing of the sort."Because you love the hospital, or because you love somebody connected\nwith the hospital?"Sidney was thoroughly angry by this time, angry and reckless.She had\ncome through so much that every nerve was crying in passionate protest."If it will make you understand things any better," she cried, "I am\ngoing back for both reasons!"But her words seemed, surprisingly\nenough, to steady him."Then, as far as I am concerned, it\'s all over, is it?"Suddenly:--\n\n"You think Christine has her hands full with Palmer, don\'t you?Well,\nif you take Max Wilson, you\'re going to have more trouble than Christine\never dreamed of.I can tell you some things about him now that will make\nyou think twice.""Every word that you say shows me how right I am in not marrying you,\nJoe," she said."Real men do not say those things about each other under\nany circumstances.I don\'t want you to\ncome back until you have grown up."He was very white, but he picked up his hat and went to the door."I guess I AM crazy," he said."I\'ve been wanting to go away, but mother\nraises such a fuss--I\'ll not annoy you any more."He reached in his pocket and, pulling out a small box, held it toward\nher."Reginald," he said solemnly.Some boys caught\nhim in the park, and I brought him home."He left her standing there speechless with surprise, with the box in her\nhand, and ran down the stairs and out into the Street.At the foot of\nthe steps he almost collided with Dr.I\'m glad\nyou\'ve made it up."CHAPTER XX\n\n\nWinter relaxed its clutch slowly that year.March was bitterly cold;\neven April found the roads still frozen and the hedgerows clustered with\nice.But at mid-day there was spring in the air.In the courtyard of the\nhospital, convalescents sat on the benches and watched for robins.The\nfountain, which had frozen out, was being repaired.Here and there on\nward window-sills tulips opened their gaudy petals to the sun.Harriet had gone abroad for a flying trip in March and came back laden\nwith new ideas, model gowns, and fresh enthusiasm.She carried out and\nplanted flowers on her sister\'s grave, and went back to her work with a\nfeeling of duty done.A combination of crocuses and snow on the ground\nhad given her an inspiration for a gown.She drew it in pencil on an\nenvelope on her way back in the street car.Grace Irving, having made good during the white sales, had been sent to\nthe spring cottons.The day she\nsold Sidney material for a simple white gown, she was very happy.Once\na customer brought her a bunch of primroses.All day she kept them under\nthe counter in a glass of water, and at evening she took them to Johnny\nRosenfeld, still lying prone in the hospital.On Sidney, on K., and on Christine the winter had left its mark heavily.Christine, readjusting her life to new conditions, was graver, more\nthoughtful.\'s guidance, she\nhad given up the "Duchess" and was reading real books.She was thinking\nreal thoughts, too, for the first time in her life.Sidney, as tender as ever, had lost a little of the radiance from her\neyes; her voice had deepened.Where she had been a pretty girl, she\nwas now lovely.She was back in the hospital again, this time in the\nchildren\'s ward.K., going in one day to take Johnny Rosenfeld a basket\nof fruit, saw her there with a child in her arms, and a light in her\neyes that he had never seen before.It hurt him, rather--things being as\nthey were with him.With the opening of spring the little house at Hillfoot took on fresh\nactivities.Tillie was house-cleaning with great thoroughness.She\nscrubbed carpets, took down the clean curtains, and put them up again\nfreshly starched.It was as if she found in sheer activity and fatigue a\nremedy for her uneasiness.The impeccable character of the little\nhouse had been against it.Schwitter had a little bar and\nserved the best liquors he could buy; but he discouraged rowdiness--had\nbeen known to refuse to sell to boys under twenty-one and to men who had\nalready overindulged.The word went about that Schwitter\'s was no place\nfor a good time.Even Tillie\'s chicken and waffles failed against this\nhandicap.By the middle of April the house-cleaning was done.One or two motor\nparties had come out, dined sedately and wined moderately, and had gone\nback to the city again.The\nroads dried up, robins filled the trees with their noisy spring songs,\nand still business continued dull.By the first day of May, Tillie\'s uneasiness had become certainty.Schwitter, coming in from the early milking, found her\nsitting in the kitchen, her face buried in her apron.He put down the\nmilk-pails and, going over to her, put a hand on her head."I guess there\'s no mistake, then?""There\'s no mistake," said poor Tillie into her apron.He bent down and kissed the back of her neck.Then, when she failed to\nbrighten, he tiptoed around the kitchen, poured the milk into pans,\nand rinsed the buckets, working methodically in his heavy way.The\ntea-kettle had boiled dry.Then:--\n\n"Do you want to see a doctor?""I\'d better see somebody," she said, without looking up."And--don\'t\nthink I\'m blaming you.As far as\nthat goes, I\'ve wanted a child right along.It isn\'t the trouble I am\nthinking of either."He made some tea\nclumsily and browned her a piece of toast.When he had put them on one\nend of the kitchen table, he went over to her again."I guess I\'d ought to have thought of this before, but all I thought of\nwas trying to get a little happiness out of life.And,"--he stroked\nher arm,--"as far as I am concerned, it\'s been worth while, Tillie.No\nmatter what I\'ve had to do, I\'ve always looked forward to coming back\nhere to you in the evening.Maybe I don\'t say it enough, but I guess you\nknow I feel it all right."Without looking up, she placed her hand over his."I guess we started wrong," he went on."You can\'t build happiness on\nwhat isn\'t right.You and I can manage well enough; but now that there\'s\ngoing to be another, it looks different, somehow."After that morning Tillie took up her burden stoically.The hope of\nmotherhood alternated with black fits of depression.She sang at her\nwork, to burst out into sudden tears.Schwitter had given up his nursery\nbusiness; but the motorists who came to Hillfoot did not come back.When, at last, he took the horse and buggy and drove about the country\nfor orders, he was too late.Other nurserymen had been before him;\nshrubberies and orchards were already being set out.The second payment\non his mortgage would be due in July.By the middle of May they were\nfrankly up against it.Schwitter at last dared to put the situation into\nwords."We\'re not making good, Til," he said.We are too decent; that\'s what\'s the matter with us."With all her sophistication, Tillie was vastly ignorant of life."We\'ll have to keep a sort of hotel," he said lamely."Sell to everybody\nthat comes along, and--if parties want to stay over-night--"\n\nTillie\'s white face turned crimson."If it\'s bad weather, and they\'re married--"\n\n"How are we to know if they are married or not?"Sandra went back to the office.But the\nsituation was not less acute.There were two or three unfurnished rooms\non the second floor.He began to make tentative suggestions as to their\nfurnishing.Once he got a catalogue from an installment house, and tried\nto hide it from her.She burned it in the kitchen\nstove.Schwitter himself was ashamed; but the idea obsessed him.Other people\nfattened on the frailties of human nature.Two miles away, on the other\nroad, was a public house that had netted the owner ten thousand dollars\nprofit the year before.He was not as young as he had been; there was the expense of keeping\nhis wife--he had never allowed her to go into the charity ward at the\nasylum.Now that there was going to be a child, there would be three\npeople dependent upon him.One night, after Tillie was asleep, he slipped noiselessly into his\nclothes and out to the barn, where he hitched up the horse with nervous\nfingers.Tillie never learned of that midnight excursion to the "Climbing Rose,"\ntwo miles away.Lights blazed in every window; a dozen automobiles were\nparked before the barn.From the bar came\nthe jingle of glasses and loud, cheerful conversation.When Schwitter turned the horse\'s head back toward Hillfoot, his\nmind was made up.He would furnish the upper rooms; he would bring a\nbarkeeper from town--these people wanted mixed drinks; he could get a\nsecond-hand piano somewhere.Tillie\'s rebellion was instant and complete.When she found him\ndetermined, she made the compromise that her condition necessitated.She\ncould not leave him, but she would not stay in the rehabilitated little\nhouse.When, a week after Schwitter\'s visit to the "Climbing Rose," an\ninstallment van arrived from town with the new furniture, Tillie\nmoved out to what had been the harness-room of the old barn and there\nestablished herself."I am not leaving you," she told him."I don\'t even know that I am\nblaming you.But I am not going to have anything to do with it, and\nthat\'s flat."So it happened that K., making a spring pilgrimage to see Tillie,\nstopped astounded in the road.The weather was warm, and he carried\nhis Norfolk coat over his arm.The little house was bustling; a dozen\nautomobiles were parked in the barnyard.The bar was crowded, and a\nbarkeeper in a white coat was mixing drinks with the casual indifference\nof his kind.There were tables under the trees on the lawn, and a new\nsign on the gate.Even Schwitter bore a new look of prosperity.Over his schooner of beer\nK. gathered something of the story."I\'m not proud of it, Mr.I\'ve come to do a good many things\nthe last year or so that I never thought I would do.First I took Tillie away from her good position, and after\nthat nothing went right.Then there were things coming on"--he looked at\nK. anxiously--"that meant more expense.I would be glad if you wouldn\'t\nsay anything about it at Mrs."I\'ll not speak of it, of course."It was then, when K. asked for Tillie, that Mr.Schwitter\'s unhappiness\nbecame more apparent."She wouldn\'t stand for it," he said."She moved out the day I furnished\nthe rooms upstairs and got the piano."I--I\'ll take you\nout there, if you would like to see her."K. shrewdly surmised that Tillie would prefer to see him alone, under\nthe circumstances."I guess I can find her," he said, and rose from the little table."If you--if you can say anything to help me out, sir, I\'d appreciate it.Of course, she understands how I am driven.But--especially if you would\ntell her that the Street doesn\'t know--"\n\n"I\'ll do all I can," K. promised, and followed the path to the barn.Tillie received him with a certain dignity.The little harness-room\nwas very comfortable.A white iron bed in a corner, a flat table with\na mirror above it, a rocking-chair, and a sewing-machine furnished the\nroom."I wouldn\'t stand for it," she said simply; "so here I am.There being but one chair, she sat on the bed.The room was littered\nwith small garments in the making.She made no attempt to conceal them;\nrather, she pointed to them with pride.He\'s got a\nhired girl at the house.It was hard enough to sew at first, with me\nmaking two right sleeves almost every time."Then, seeing his kindly eye\non her: "Well, it\'s happened, Mr."You\'re going to be a very good mother, Tillie."K., who also needed cheering\nthat spring day, found his consolation in seeing her brighten under the\nsmall gossip of the Street.The deaf-and-dumb book agent had taken on\nlife insurance as a side issue, and was doing well; the grocery store at\nthe corner was going to be torn down, and over the new store there\nwere to be apartments; Reginald had been miraculously returned, and was\nbuilding a new nest under his bureau; Harriet Kennedy had been to Paris,\nand had brought home six French words and a new figure.Outside the open door the big barn loomed cool and shadowy, full of\nempty spaces where later the hay would be stored; anxious mother hens\nled their broods about; underneath in the horse stable the restless\nhorses pawed in their stalls.From where he sat, Le Moyne could see only\nthe round breasts of the two hills, the fresh green of the orchard the\ncows in a meadow beyond."I\'ve had more time to think since I\nmoved out than I ever had in my life before.When the\nnoise is worst down at the house, I look at the hills there and--"\n\nThere were great thoughts in her mind--that the hills meant God, and\nthat in His good time perhaps it would all come right."The hills help a lot," she repeated.Tillie\'s work-basket lay near him.He picked up one of the\nlittle garments.In his big hands it looked small, absurd."I--I want to tell you something, Tillie.Don\'t count on it too much;\nbut Mrs.Schwitter has been failing rapidly for the last month or two."I wanted to see things work out right for you."All the color had faded from Tillie\'s face."You\'re very good to me, Mr."I don\'t wish the poor\nsoul any harm, but--oh, my God!if she\'s going, let it be before the\nnext four months are over."K. had fallen into the habit, after his long walks, of dropping into\nChristine\'s little parlor for a chat before he went upstairs.Those\nearly spring days found Harriet Kennedy busy late in the evenings, and,\nsave for Christine and K., the house was practically deserted.The breach between Palmer and Christine was steadily widening.She was\ntoo proud to ask him to spend more of his evenings with her.On those\noccasions when he voluntarily stayed at home with her, he was so\ndiscontented that he drove her almost to distraction.Although she was\nconvinced that he was seeing nothing of the girl who had been with\nhim the night of the accident, she did not trust him.Not that girl,\nperhaps, but there were others.Into Christine\'s little parlor, then, K. turned, the evening after he\nhad seen Tillie.She was reading by the lamp, and the door into the hall\nstood open."Come in," she said, as he hesitated in the doorway."There\'s a brush in the drawer of the hat-rack--although I don\'t really\nmind how you look."The little room always cheered K. Its warmth and light appealed to his\naesthetic sense; after the bareness of his bedroom, it spelled luxury.And perhaps, to be entirely frank, there was more than physical comfort\nand satisfaction in the evenings he spent in Christine\'s firelit parlor.He was entirely masculine, and her evident pleasure in his society\ngratified him.He had fallen into a way of thinking of himself as a sort\nof older brother to all the world because he was a sort of older brother\nto Sidney.The evenings with her did something to reinstate him in his\nown self-esteem.It was subtle, psychological, but also it was very\nhuman."Here\'s a chair, and here are\ncigarettes and there are matches.But, for once, K. declined the chair.He stood in front of the fireplace\nand looked down at her, his head bent slightly to one side."I wonder if you would like to do a very kind thing," he said\nunexpectedly."Something much more trouble and not so pleasant."When she was with him, when his steady eyes\nlooked down at her, small affectations fell away.She was more genuine\nwith K. than with anyone else, even herself."Tell me what it is, or shall I promise first?""I want you to promise just one thing: to keep a secret."Christine was not over-intelligent, perhaps, but she was shrewd.That Le\nMoyne\'s past held a secret she had felt from the beginning.I want you to go out to see her."The Street did not go out to see women in\nTillie\'s situation.She\'s going to have a child,\nChristine; and she has had no one to talk to but her hus--but Mr.I\'d really rather not go, K. Not,"\nshe hastened to set herself right in his eyes--"not that I feel any\nunwillingness to see her.But--what in the\nworld shall I say to her?"It had been rather a long time since Christine had been accused\nof having a kind heart.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Not that she was unkind, but in all her\nself-centered young life there had been little call on her sympathies."I wish I were as good as you think I am."Then Le Moyne spoke briskly:--\n\n"I\'ll tell you how to get there; perhaps I would better write it."He moved over to Christine\'s small writing-table and, seating himself,\nproceeded to write out the directions for reaching Hillfoot.Behind him, Christine had taken his place on the hearth-rug and stood\nwatching his head in the light of the desk-lamp."What a strong, quiet\nface it is," she thought.Why did she get the impression of such a\ntremendous reserve power in this man who was a clerk, and a clerk only?Behind him she made a quick, unconscious gesture of appeal, both hands\nout for an instant.She dropped them guiltily as K. rose with the paper\nin his hand."I\'ve drawn a sort of map of the roads," he began."You see, this--"\n\nChristine was looking, not at the paper, but up at him."I wonder if you know, K.," she said, "what a lucky woman the woman will\nbe who marries you?""I wonder how long I could hypnotize her into thinking that.""I\'ve had time to do a little thinking lately," she said, without\nbitterness.I\'ve been looking back,\nwondering if I ever thought that about him.I wonder--"\n\nShe checked herself abruptly and took the paper from his hand."I\'ll go to see Tillie, of course," she consented."It is like you to\nhave found her."Although she picked up the book that she had been reading\nwith the evident intention of discussing it, her thoughts were still on\nTillie, on Palmer, on herself.After a moment:--\n\n"Has it ever occurred to you how terribly mixed up things are?Can you think of anybody on it that--that things\nhave gone entirely right with?""It\'s a little world of its own, of course," said K., "and it has plenty\nof contact points with life.But wherever one finds people, many or few,\none finds all the elements that make up life--joy and sorrow, birth and\ndeath, and even tragedy.That\'s rather trite, isn\'t it?""To a certain extent they make their own\nfates.But when you think of the women on the Street,--Tillie,\nHarriet Kennedy, Sidney Page, myself, even Mrs.Rosenfeld back in the\nalley,--somebody else moulds things for us, and all we can do is to sit\nback and suffer.I am beginning to think the world is a terrible place,\nK. Why do people so often marry the wrong people?Why can\'t a man\ncare for one woman and only one all his life?Why--why is it all so\ncomplicated?""There are men who care for only one woman all their lives.""You\'re that sort, aren\'t you?""I don\'t want to put myself on any pinnacle.If I cared enough for\na woman to marry her, I\'d hope to--But we are being very tragic,\nChristine."There\'s going to be another mistake, K., unless you stop\nit."He tried to leaven the conversation with a little fun."If you\'re going to ask me to interfere between Mrs.McKee and the\ndeaf-and-dumb book and insurance agent, I shall do nothing of the sort.She can both speak and hear enough for both of them."He\'s mad about her, K.; and, because\nshe\'s the sort she is, he\'ll probably be mad about her all his life,\neven if he marries her.But he\'ll not be true to her; I know the type\nnow."K. leaned back with a flicker of pain in his eyes.Astute as he was, he did not suspect that Christine was using this\nmethod to fathom his feeling for Sidney.But he had himself in hand by this time, and she learned nothing from\neither his voice or his eyes."I\'m not in a position to marry anybody.Even\nif Sidney cared for me, which she doesn\'t, of course--"\n\n"Then you don\'t intend to interfere?You\'re going to let the Street see\nanother failure?""I think you can understand," said K. rather wearily, "that if I cared\nless, Christine, it would be easier to interfere."After all, Christine had known this, or surmised it, for weeks.But it\nhurt like a fresh stab in an old wound.It was K. who spoke again after\na pause:--\n\n"The deadly hard thing, of course, is to sit by and see things happening\nthat one--that one would naturally try to prevent.""I don\'t believe that you have always been of those who only stand and\nwait," said Christine."Sometime, K., when you know me better and like\nme better, I want you to tell me about it, will you?"When I discovered that I\nwas unfit to hold that trust any longer, I quit.But Christine\'s eyes were on\nhim often that evening, puzzled, rather sad.They talked of books, of music--Christine played well in a dashing way.K. had brought her soft, tender little things, and had stood over her\nuntil her noisy touch became gentle.She played for him a little, while\nhe sat back in the big chair with his hand screening his eyes.When, at last, he rose and picked up his cap; it was nine o\'clock."I\'ve taken your whole evening," he said remorsefully."Why don\'t you\ntell me I am a nuisance and send me off?"Christine was still at the piano, her hands on the keys.She spoke\nwithout looking at him:--\n\n"You\'re never a nuisance, K., and--"\n\n"You\'ll go out to see Tillie, won\'t you?"But I\'ll not go under false pretenses.I am going quite frankly\nbecause you want me to.""I forgot to tell you," she went on."Father has given Palmer five\nthousand dollars.He\'s going to buy a share in a business."I don\'t believe much in Palmer\'s business ventures."Underneath it he divined strain and\nrepression."I hate to go and leave you alone," he said at last from the door."Have\nyou any idea when Palmer will be back?"Stand behind me; I\ndon\'t want to see you, and I want to tell you something."He did as she bade him, rather puzzled."I think I am a fool for saying this.Perhaps I am spoiling the only\nchance I have to get any happiness out of life.I was terribly unhappy, K., and then you\ncame into my life, and I--now I listen for your step in the hall.I\ncan\'t be a hypocrite any longer, K."When he stood behind her, silent and not moving, she turned slowly about\nand faced him.He towered there in the little room, grave eyes on hers."It\'s a long time since I have had a woman friend, Christine," he said\nsoberly.In a good many\nways, I\'d not care to look ahead if it were not for you.I value our\nfriendship so much that I--"\n\n"That you don\'t want me to spoil it," she finished for him."I know\nyou don\'t care for me, K., not the way I--But I wanted you to know.It\ndoesn\'t hurt a good man to know such a thing.And it--isn\'t going to\nstop your coming here, is it?""Of course not," said K. heartily."But to-morrow, when we are both\nclear-headed, we will talk this over.You are mistaken about this thing,\nChristine; I am sure of that.Things have not been going well, and just\nbecause I am always around, and all that sort of thing, you think things\nthat aren\'t really so.He tried to make her smile up at him.If she had cried, things might have been different for every one; for\nperhaps K. would have taken her in his arms.He was heart-hungry enough,\nthose days, for anything.And perhaps, too, being intuitive, Christine\nfelt this.But she had no mind to force him into a situation against his\nwill."It is because you are good," she said, and held out her hand.Le Moyne took it and bent over and kissed it lightly.There was in\nthe kiss all that he could not say of respect, of affection and\nunderstanding."Good-night, Christine," he said, and went into the hall and upstairs.The lamp was not lighted in his room, but the street light glowed\nthrough the windows.Once again the waving fronds of the ailanthus tree\nflung ghostly shadows on the walls.There was a faint sweet odor of\nblossoms, so soon to become rank and heavy.Over the floor in a wild zigzag darted a strip of white paper which\ndisappeared under the bureau.CHAPTER XXI\n\n\nSidney went into the operating-room late in the spring as the result of\na conversation between the younger Wilson and the Head."When are you going to put my protegee into the operating-room?"asked\nWilson, meeting Miss Gregg in a corridor one bright, spring afternoon."That usually comes in the second year, Dr."That isn\'t a rule, is it?"Miss Page is very young, and of course there are other\ngirls who have not yet had the experience.But, if you make the\nrequest--"\n\n"I am going to have some good cases soon.I\'ll not make a request, of\ncourse; but, if you see fit, it would be good training for Miss Page."Miss Gregg went on, knowing perfectly that at his next operation Dr.Wilson would expect Sidney Page in the operating-room.The other doctors\nwere not so exigent.She would have liked to have all the staff old and\nsettled, like Dr.These young men came in\nand tore things up.The\nbutter had been bad--she must speak to the matron.The sterilizer in\nthe operating-room was out of order--that meant a quarrel with the chief\nengineer.Requisitions were too heavy--that meant going around to the\nwards and suggesting to the head nurses that lead pencils and bandages\nand adhesive plaster and safety-pins cost money.It was particularly inconvenient to move Sidney just then.Carlotta\nHarrison was off duty, ill.She had been ailing for a month, and now she\nwas down with a temperature.As the Head went toward Sidney\'s ward,\nher busy mind was playing her nurses in their wards like pieces on a\ncheckerboard.Sidney went into the operating-room that afternoon.For her blue\nuniform, kerchief, and cap she exchanged the hideous operating-room\ngarb: long, straight white gown with short sleeves and mob-cap,\ngray-white from many sterilizations.But the ugly costume seemed to\nemphasize her beauty, as the habit of a nun often brings out the placid\nsaintliness of her face.The relationship between Sidney and Max had reached that point that\noccurs in all relationships between men and women: when things must\neither go forward or go back, but cannot remain as they are.The\ncondition had existed for the last three months.As a matter of fact, Wilson could not go ahead.The situation with\nCarlotta had become tense, irritating.He felt that she stood ready\nto block any move he made.He would not go back, and he dared not go\nforward.If Sidney was puzzled, she kept it bravely to herself.In her little\nroom at night, with the door carefully locked, she tried to think things\nout.There were a few treasures that she looked over regularly: a dried\nflower from the Christmas roses; a label that he had pasted playfully\non the back of her hand one day after the rush of surgical dressings was\nover and which said "Rx, Take once and forever."There was another piece of paper over which Sidney spent much time.It\nwas a page torn out of an order book, and it read: "Sigsbee may have\nlight diet; Rosenfeld massage."Underneath was written, very small:\n\n     "You are the most beautiful person in the world."Two reasons had prompted Wilson to request to have Sidney in the\noperating-room.He wanted her with him, and he wanted her to see him at\nwork: the age-old instinct of the male to have his woman see him at his\nbest.He was in high spirits that first day of Sidney\'s operating-room\nexperience.For the time at least, Carlotta was out of the way.Her\nsomber eyes no longer watched him.Once he looked up from his work and\nglanced at Sidney where she stood at strained attention.She  under the eyes that were turned on her."A great many of them faint on the first day.We sometimes have them\nlying all over the floor."He challenged Miss Gregg with his eyes, and she reproved him with a\nshake of her head, as she might a bad boy.One way and another, he managed to turn the attention of the\noperating-room to Sidney several times.It suited his whim, and it did\nmore than that: it gave him a chance to speak to her in his teasing way.Sidney came through the operation as if she had been through fire--taut\nas a string, rather pale, but undaunted.But when the last case had been\ntaken out, Max dropped his bantering manner.The internes were looking\nover instruments; the nurses were busy on the hundred and one tasks of\nclearing up; so he had a chance for a word with her alone."I am proud of you, Sidney; you came through it like a soldier."A nurse was coming toward him; he had only a moment."I shall leave a note in the mail-box," he said quickly, and proceeded\nwith the scrubbing of his hands which signified the end of the day\'s\nwork.The operations had lasted until late in the afternoon.The night nurses\nhad taken up their stations; prayers were over.The internes were\ngathered in the smoking-room, threshing over the day\'s work, as was\ntheir custom.When Sidney was free, she went to the office for the note.It was very brief:--\n\nI have something I want to say to you, dear.I never see you alone at home any more.If you can get off for an\nhour, won\'t you take the trolley to the end of Division Street?I\'ll be\nthere with the car at eight-thirty, and I promise to have you back by\nten o\'clock.No one saw her as she stood by the mail-box.The\nticking of the office clock, the heavy rumble of a dray outside, the\nroll of the ambulance as it went out through the gateway, and in her\nhand the realization of what she had never confessed as a hope, even to\nherself!He, the great one, was going to stoop to her.It had been in\nhis eyes that afternoon; it was there, in his letter, now.To get out of her uniform and into\nstreet clothing, fifteen minutes; on the trolley, another fifteen.But she did not meet him, after all.Miss Wardwell met her in the upper\nhall."She has been waiting for hours--ever since you went to the\noperating-room."Sidney sighed, but she went to Carlotta at once.The girl\'s condition\nwas puzzling the staff.--which is hospital for\n"typhoid restrictions."has apathy, generally, and Carlotta\nwas not apathetic.Sidney found her tossing restlessly on her high white\nbed, and put her cool hand over Carlotta\'s hot one.Then, seeing her operating-room uniform: "You\'ve been\nTHERE, have you?""Is there anything I can do, Carlotta?"Excitement had dyed Sidney\'s cheeks with color']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['And then she\ntoo puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”\n\n“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite\nof herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”\n\n“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And\nthis is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”\n\n“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her\nhostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and\nthen I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,\nthe little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got\na dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May\nKirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,\n‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I\ncould only call her half after him, I called her the other half after\nyou.”\n\n“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some\namazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one\ncould accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.Well is it for Jack\nthat he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it\nbehind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name\nwas on it.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to\nJack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”\n\n“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white\ngirl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand\nand heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s\ndeath when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond\nmother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but\nMay’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She\ncannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to\nher own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have\ninflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see\nme, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be\nso kind as to bring you some day.”\n\n“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the\nfirelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as\nRuby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever\nheard.”\n\nRuby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from\nwhich Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going\naway.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss\nMay.”\n\n“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to\ngo by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has\nknown since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love\nbecause she had no love to give in return, and May’s eyes fall beneath\nhis gaze.“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,\npities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little\ngirl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a\nlight than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest\nland of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most\ncommon of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this\nwoman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;\nMay tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came\ntoo late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill\nup a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond\nof her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”\n\n“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His\neyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was\nnot there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,\nthen stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”\n\nMay answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her\neyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently\nin this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question\nchooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an\nold, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and\nfresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;\na story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the\nbeautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”\n\n“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner\ncommon to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I\nshan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very\ndense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it\nwas too good to be true.”\n\n“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside\nwhom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her\nblue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended\nvoice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too\nlittle.”\n\n“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further\nremonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED\n  LONDON AND BECCLES.TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\n\n\n  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.To be sure, they are quiet and concealed ones, coiled serpents\nthat make no stir till aroused; but then, deadly in their spring and\nrelentless in their action.Those who have known me best have not known\nthis.Often and often have I heard\nher say: "If Trueman only had more sensibility!If Trueman were not so\nindifferent to everything!In short, if Trueman had more power in him!"They thought me meek;\ncalled me Dough-face.For three years they called me this, then I turned\nupon them.Choosing out their ringleader, I felled him to the ground,\nlaid him on his back, and stamped upon him.He was handsome before\nmy foot came down; afterwards--Well, it is enough he never called me\nDough-face again.In the store I entered soon after, I met with even\nless appreciation.Regular at my work and exact in my performance of it,\nthey thought me a good machine and nothing more.What heart, soul, and\nfeeling could a man have who never sported, never smoked, and never\nlaughed?I could reckon up figures correctly, but one scarcely needed\nheart or soul for that.I could even write day by day and month by month\nwithout showing a flaw in my copy; but that only argued I was no more\nthan they intimated, a regular automaton.I let them think so, with the\ncertainty before me that they would one day change their minds as others\nhad done.Sandra went back to the kitchen.The fact was, I loved nobody well enough, not even myself,\nto care for any man\'s opinion.Life was well-nigh a blank to me; a dead\nlevel plain that had to be traversed whether I would or not.And such\nit might have continued to this day if I had never met Mary Leavenworth.But when, some nine months since, I left my desk in the counting-house\nfor a seat in Mr.Leavenworth\'s library, a blazing torch fell into\nmy soul whose flame has never gone out, and never will, till the doom\nbefore me is accomplished.When, on that first evening, I followed my new\nemployer into the parlor, and saw this woman standing up before me\nin her half-alluring, half-appalling charm, I knew, as by a lightning\nflash, what my future would be if I remained in that house.She was\nin one of her haughty moods, and bestowed upon me little more than a\npassing glance.But her indifference made slight impression upon me\nthen.It was enough that I was allowed to stand in her presence and look\nunrebuked upon her loveliness.To be sure, it was like gazing into the\nflower-wreathed crater of an awakening volcano.Fear and fascination\nwere in each moment I lingered there; but fear and fascination made the\nmoment what it was, and I could not have withdrawn if I would.Unspeakable pain as well as pleasure was in the\nemotion with which I regarded her.Yet for all that I did not cease to\nstudy her hour by hour and day by day; her smiles, her movement, her way\nof turning her head or lifting her eyelids.I\nwished to knit her beauty so firmly into the warp and woof of my being\nthat nothing could ever serve to tear it away.For I saw then as plainly\nas now that, coquette though she was, she would never stoop to me.No;\nI might lie down at her feet and let her trample over me; she would not\neven turn to see what it was she had stepped upon.I might spend days,\nmonths, years, learning the alphabet of her wishes; she would not thank\nme for my pains or even raise the lashes from her cheek to look at me as\nI passed.I was nothing to her, could not be anything unless--and this\nthought came slowly--I could in some way become her master.Leavenworth\'s dictation and pleased him.My\nmethodical ways were just to his taste.As for the other member of the\nfamily, Miss Eleanore Leavenworth--she treated me just as one of her\nproud but sympathetic nature might be expected to do.Not familiarly,\nbut kindly; not as a friend, but as a member of the household whom she\nmet every day at table, and who, as she or any one else could see, was\nnone too happy or hopeful.I had learned two things; first, that Mary\nLeavenworth loved her position as prospective heiress to a large fortune\nabove every other earthly consideration; and secondly, that she was in\nthe possession of a secret which endangered that position.What this\nwas, I had for some time no means of knowing.But when later I became\nconvinced it was one of love, I grew hopeful, strange as it may seem.Leavenworth\'s disposition almost as\nperfectly as that of his niece, and knew that in a matter of this kind\nhe would be uncompromising; and that in the clashing of these two wills\nsomething might occur which would give me a hold upon her.The only\nthing that troubled me was the fact that I did not know the name of the\nman in whom she was interested.One\nday--a month ago now--I sat down to open Mr.ran thus:\n\n"HOFFMAN HOUSE,\n\n"March 1, 1876."HORATIO LEAVENWORTH:\n\n"DEAR SIR,--You have a niece whom you love and trust, one, too, who\nseems worthy of all the love and trust that you or any other man can\ngive her; so beautiful, so charming, so tender is she in face, form,\nmanner, and conversation.But, dear sir, every rose has its thorn, and\nyour rose is no exception to this rule.Lovely as she is, charming as\nshe is, tender as she is, she is not only capable of trampling on the\nrights of one who trusted her, but of bruising the heart and breaking\nthe spirit of him to whom she owes all duty, honor, and observance."If you don\'t believe this, ask her to her cruel, bewitching face, who\nand what is her humble servant, and yours.If a bombshell had exploded at my feet, or the evil one himself appeared\nat my call, I would not have been more astounded.Not only was the name\nsigned to these remarkable words unknown to me, but the epistle itself\nwas that of one who felt himself to be her master: a position which, as\nyou know, I was myself aspiring to occupy.For a few minutes, then, I\nstood a prey to feelings of the bitterest wrath and despair; then I grew\ncalm, realizing that with this letter in my possession I was virtually\nthe arbitrator of her destiny.Some men would have sought her there and\nthen and, by threatening to place it in her uncle\'s hand, won from her\na look of entreaty, if no more; but I--well, my plans went deeper than\nthat.I knew she would have to be in extremity before I could hope to\nwin her.She must feel herself slipping over the edge of the precipice\nbefore she would clutch at the first thing offering succor.I decided\nto allow the letter to pass into my employer\'s hands.How could I manage to give it to him in this condition without\nexciting his suspicion?I knew of but one way; to let him see me open it\nfor what he would consider the first time.So, waiting till he came into\nthe room, I approached him with the letter, tearing off the end of the\nenvelope as I came.Opening it, I gave a cursory glance at its contents\nand tossed it down on the table before him."That appears to be of a private character," said I, "though there is no\nsign to that effect on the envelope."At the first word he started, looked\nat me, seemed satisfied from my expression that I had not read far\nenough to realize its nature, and, whirling slowly around in his chair,\ndevoured the remainder in silence.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.I waited a moment, then withdrew to\nmy own desk.One minute, two minutes passed in silence; he was evidently\nrereading the letter; then he hurriedly rose and left the room.As he\npassed me I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror.The expression I\nsaw there did not tend to lessen the hope that was rising in my breast.By following him almost immediately up-stairs I ascertained that he\nwent directly to Mary\'s room, and when in a few hours later the family\ncollected around the dinner table, I perceived, almost without looking\nup, that a great and insurmountable barrier had been raised between him\nand his favorite niece.Two days passed; days that were for me one long and unrelieved suspense.Would it all end as it had\nbegun, without the appearance of the mysterious Clavering on the scene?Meanwhile my monotonous work went on, grinding my heart beneath its\nrelentless wheel.I wrote and wrote and wrote, till it seemed as if my\nlife blood went from me with every drop of ink I used.Always alert\nand listening, I dared not lift my head or turn my eyes at any unusual\nsound, lest I should seem to be watching.The third night I had a dream;\nI have already told Mr.Raymond what it was, and hence will not repeat\nit here.One correction, however, I wish to make in regard to it.In my\nstatement to him I declared that the face of the man whom I saw lift his\nhand against my employer was that of Mr.The face seen by me in my dream was my own.It was that fact\nwhich made it so horrible to me.In the crouching figure stealing warily\ndown-stairs, I saw as in a glass the vision of my own form.Otherwise my\naccount of the matter was true.a\nforewarning of the way in which I was to win this coveted creature for\nmy own?Was the death of her uncle the bridge by which the impassable\ngulf between us might be spanned?I began to think it might be; to\nconsider the possibilities which could make this the only path to\nmy elysium; even went so far as to picture her lovely face bending\ngratefully towards me through the glare of a sudden release from some\nemergency in which she stood.One thing was sure; if that was the way I\nmust go, I had at least been taught how to tread it; and all through the\ndizzy, blurred day that followed, I saw, as I sat at my work, repeated\nvisions of that stealthy, purposeful figure stealing down the stairs\nand entering with uplifted pistol into the unconscious presence of my\nemployer.I even found myself a dozen times that day turning my eyes\nupon the door through which it was to come, wondering how long it would\nbe before my actual form would pause there.That the moment was at hand\nI did not imagine.Even when I left him that night after drinking with\nhim the glass of sherry mentioned at the inquest, I had no idea the hour\nof action was so near.But when, not three minutes after going upstairs,\nI caught the sound of a lady\'s dress rustling through the hall, and\nlistening, heard Mary Leavenworth pass my door on her way to the\nlibrary, I realized that the fatal hour was come; that something\nwas going to be said or done in that room which would make this deed\nnecessary.Casting about in my mind\nfor the means of doing so, I remembered that the ventilator running\nup through the house opened first into the passage-way connecting Mr.Leavenworth\'s bedroom and library, and, secondly, into the closet of\nthe large spare room adjoining mine.Hastily unlocking the door of\nthe communication between the rooms, I took my position in the closet.Instantly the sound of voices reached my ears; all was open below, and\nstanding there, I was as much an auditor of what went on between Mary\nand her uncle as if I were in the library itself.Enough to assure me my suspicions were correct; that it was a moment of\nvital interest to her; that Mr.Leavenworth, in pursuance of a threat\nevidently made some time since, was in the act of taking steps to change\nhis will, and that she had come to make an appeal to be forgiven her\nfault and restored to his favor.What that fault was, I did not learn.I only heard her\ndeclare that her action had been the result of impulse, rather than\nlove; that she regretted it, and desired nothing more than to be free\nfrom all obligations to one she would fain forget, and be again to her\nuncle what she was before she ever saw this man.I thought, fool that I\nwas, it was a mere engagement she was alluding to, and took the insanest\nhope from these words; and when, in a moment later I heard her uncle\nreply, in his sternest tone, that she had irreparably forfeited her\nclaims to his regard and favor, I did not need her short and bitter cry\nof shame and disappointment, or that low moan for some one to help her,\nfor me to sound his death-knell in my heart.Creeping back to my own\nroom, I waited till I heard her reascend, then I stole forth.Calm as\nI had ever been in my life, I went down the stairs just as I had seen\nmyself do in my dream, and knocking lightly at the library door, went\nin.Leavenworth was sitting in his usual place writing."Excuse me," said I as he looked up, "I have lost my memorandum-book,\nand think it possible I may have dropped it in the passage-way when I\nwent for the wine."He bowed, and I hurried past him into the closet.Once there, I proceeded rapidly into the room beyond, procured the\npistol, returned, and almost before I realized what I was doing, had\ntaken up my position behind him, aimed, and fired.Without a groan his head fell forward on his hands, and Mary\nLeavenworth was the virtual possessor of the thousands she coveted.My first thought was to procure the letter he was writing.Approaching\nthe table, I tore it out from under his hands, looked at it, saw that\nit was, as I expected, a summons to his lawyer, and thrust it into my\npocket, together with the letter from Mr.Clavering, which I perceived\nlying spattered with blood on the table before me.Not till this was\ndone did I think of myself, or remember the echo which that low, sharp\nreport must have made in the house.Dropping the pistol at the side of\nthe murdered man, I stood ready to shriek to any one who entered that\nMr.But I was saved from committing such\na folly.The report had not been heard, or if so, had evidently failed\nto create an alarm.No one came, and I was left to contemplate my\nwork undisturbed and decide upon the best course to be taken to avoid\ndetection.A moment\'s study of the wound made in his head by the\nbullet convinced me of the impossibility of passing the affair off as\na suicide, or even the work of a burglar.To any one versed in such\nmatters it was manifestly a murder, and a most deliberate one.My one\nhope, then, lay in making it as mysterious as it was deliberate, by\ndestroying all due to the motive and manner of the deed.Picking up the\npistol, I carried it into the other room with the intention of\ncleaning it, but finding nothing there to do it with, came back for the\nhandkerchief I had seen lying on the floor at Mr.It\nwas Miss Eleanore\'s, but I did not know it till I had used it to clean\nthe barrel; then the sight of her initials in one corner so shocked me\nI forgot to clean the cylinder, and only thought of how I could do\naway with this evidence of her handkerchief having been employed for a\npurpose so suspicious.Not daring to carry it from the room, I sought\nfor means to destroy it; but finding none, compromised the matter by\nthrusting it deep down behind the cushion of one of the chairs, in the\nhope of being able to recover and burn it the next day.This done, I\nreloaded the pistol, locked it up, and prepared to leave the room.But here the horror which usually follows such deeds struck me like a\nthunderbolt and made me for the first time uncertain in my action.I\nlocked the door on going out, something I should never have done.Not\ntill I reached the top of the stairs did I realize my folly; and then it\nwas too late, for there before me, candle in hand, and surprise written\non every feature of her face, stood Hannah, one of the servants, looking\nat me."Lor, sir, where have you been?"she cried, but strange to say, in a\nlow tone."You look as if you had seen a ghost."And her eyes turned\nsuspiciously to the key which I held in my hand.I felt as if some one had clutched me round the throat.Thrusting the\nkey into my pocket, I took a step towards her."I will tell you what I\nhave seen if you will come down-stairs," I whispered; "the ladies will\nbe disturbed if we talk here," and smoothing my brow as best I could,\nI put out my hand and drew her towards me.What my motive was I hardly\nknew; the action was probably instinctive; but when I saw the look which\ncame into her face as I touched her, and the alacrity with which she\nprepared to follow me, I took courage, remembering the one or two\nprevious tokens I had had of this girl\'s unreasonable susceptibility to\nmy influence; a susceptibility which I now felt could be utilized and\nmade to serve my purpose.Taking her down to the parlor floor, I drew her into the depths of\nthe great drawing-room, and there told her in the least alarming\nway possible what had happened to Mr.She was of course\nintensely agitated, but she did not scream;--the novelty of her position\nevidently bewildering her--and, greatly relieved, I went on to say that\nI did not know who committed the deed, but that folks would declare it\nwas I if they knew I had been seen by her on the stairs with the library\nkey in my hand."But I won\'t tell," she whispered, trembling violently\nin her fright and eagerness.I will say I\ndidn\'t see anybody."But I soon convinced her that she could never keep\nher secret if the police once began to question her, and, following\nup my argument with a little cajolery, succeeded after a long while in\nwinning her consent to leave the house till the storm should be blown\nover.But that given, it was some little time before I could make her\ncomprehend that she must depart at once and without going back after her\nthings.Not till I brightened up her wits by a promise to marry her some\nday if she only obeyed me now, did she begin to look the thing in\nthe face and show any evidence of the real mother wit she evidently\npossessed.Belden would take me in," said she, "if I could only\nget to R----.She takes everybody in who asks, her; and she would\nkeep me, too, if I told her Miss Mary sent me.But I can\'t get there\nto-night."I immediately set to work to convince her that she could.The midnight\ntrain did not leave the city for a half-hour yet, and the distance to\nthe depot could be easily walked by her in fifteen minutes.And she was afraid she couldn\'t find\nher way!She still hesitated, but\nat length consented to go, and with some further understanding of the\nmethod I was to employ in communicating with her, we went down-stairs.There we found a hat and shawl of the cook\'s which I put on her, and in\nanother moment we were in the carriage yard."Remember, you are to say\nnothing of what has occurred, no matter what happens," I whispered in\nparting injunction as she turned to leave me."Remember, you are to come\nand marry me some day," she murmured in reply, throwing her arms about\nmy neck.The movement was sudden, and it was probably at this time she\ndropped the candle she had unconsciously held clenched in her hand till\nnow.I promised her, and she glided out of the gate.Of the dreadful agitation that followed the disappearance of this girl\nI can give no better idea than by saying I not only committed the\nadditional error of locking up the house on my re-entrance, but omitted\nto dispose of the key then in my pocket by flinging it into the street\nor dropping it in the hall as I went up.The fact is, I was so absorbed\nby the thought of the danger I stood in from this girl, I forgot\neverything else.Hannah\'s pale face, Hannah\'s look of terror, as she\nturned from my side and flitted down the street, were continually before\nme.I could not escape them; the form of the dead man lying below was\nless vivid.It was as though I were tied in fancy to this woman of the\nwhite face fluttering down the midnight streets.That she would fail in\nsomething--come back or be brought back--that I should find her standing\nwhite and horror-stricken on the front steps when I went down in the\nmorning, was like a nightmare to me.I began to think no other result\npossible; that she never would or could win her way unchallenged to that\nlittle cottage in a distant village; that I had but sent a trailing flag\nof danger out into the world with this wretched girl;--danger that would\ncome back to me with the first burst of morning light!But even those thoughts faded after a while before the realization\nof the peril I was in as long as the key and papers remained in my\npossession.I dared not leave my room again,\nor open my window.Indeed I was\nafraid to move about in my room.Yes, my\nmorbid terror had reached that point--I was fearful of one whose ears I\nmyself had forever closed, imagined him in his bed beneath and wakeful\nto the least sound.But the necessity of doing something with these evidences of guilt\nfinally overcame this morbid anxiety, and drawing the two letters from\nmy pocket--I had not yet undressed--I chose out the most dangerous of\nthe two, that written by Mr.Leavenworth himself, and, chewing it till\nit was mere pulp, threw it into a corner; but the other had blood on it,\nand nothing, not even the hope of safety, could induce me to put it\nto my lips.I was forced to lie with it clenched in my hand, and the\nflitting image of Hannah before my eyes, till the slow morning broke.I\nhave heard it said that a year in heaven seems like a day; I can easily\nbelieve it.I know that an hour in hell seems an eternity!Whether it was that the sunshine glancing\non the wall made me think of Mary and all I was ready to do for her\nsake, or whether it was the mere return of my natural stoicism in the\npresence of actual necessity, I cannot say.I only know that I arose\ncalm and master of myself.The problem of the letter and key had solved\nitself also.Instead of that I would\nput them in plain sight, trusting to that very fact for their being\noverlooked.Making the letter up into lighters, I carried them into the\nspare room and placed them in a vase.Then, taking the key in my hand,\nwent down-stairs, intending to insert it in the lock of the library door\nas I went by.But Miss Eleanore descending almost immediately behind me\nmade this impossible.I succeeded, however, in thrusting it, without\nher knowledge, among the filagree work of the gas-fixture in the\nsecond hall, and thus relieved, went down into the breakfast room as\nself-possessed a man as ever crossed its threshold.Mary was there,\nlooking exceedingly pale and disheartened, and as I met her eye, which\nfor a wonder turned upon me as I entered, I could almost have laughed,\nthinking of the deliverance that had come to her, and of the time when I\nshould proclaim myself to be the man who had accomplished it.Of the alarm that speedily followed, and my action at that time and\nafterwards, I need not speak in detail.I behaved just as I would have\ndone if I had had no hand in the murder.I even forbore to touch the key\nor go to the spare room, or make any movement which I was not willing\nall the world should see.For as things stood, there was not a shadow\nof evidence against me in the house; neither was I, a hard-working,\nuncomplaining secretary, whose passion for one of his employer\'s nieces\nwas not even mistrusted by the lady herself, a person to be suspected\nof the crime which threw him out of a fair situation.So I performed\nall the duties of my position, summoning the police, and going for Mr.Veeley, just as I would have done if those hours between me leaving\nMr.Leavenworth for the first time and going down to breakfast in the\nmorning had been blotted from my consciousness.And this was the principle upon which I based my action at the inquest.Leaving that half-hour and its occurrences out of the question, I\nresolved to answer such questions as might be put me as truthfully as\nI could; the great fault with men situated as I was usually being that\nthey lied too much, thus committing themselves on unessential matters.But alas, in thus planning for my own safety, I forgot one thing,\nand that was the dangerous position in which I should thus place Mary\nLeavenworth as the one benefited by the crime.Not till the inference\nwas drawn by a juror, from the amount of wine found in Mr.Leavenworth\'s\nglass in the morning, that he had come to his death shortly after my\nleaving him, did I realize what an opening I had made for suspicion in\nher direction by admitting that I had heard a rustle on the stair a few\nminutes after going up.That all present believed it to have been made\nby Eleanore, did not reassure me.She was so completely disconnected\nwith the crime I could not imagine suspicion holding to her for an\ninstant.But Mary--If a curtain had been let down before me, pictured\nwith the future as it has since developed, I could not have seen more\nplainly what her position would be, if attention were once directed\ntowards her.So, in the vain endeavor to cover up my blunder, I began\nto lie.Forced to admit that a shadow of disagreement had been lately\nvisible between Mr.Leavenworth and one of his nieces, I threw the\nburden of it upon Eleanore, as the one best able to bear it.The\nconsequences were more serious than I anticipated.Direction had been\ngiven to suspicion which every additional evidence that now came up\nseemed by some strange fatality to strengthen.Leavenworth\'s own pistol had been used in the assassination,\nand that too by a person then in the house, but I myself was brought\nto acknowledge that Eleanore had learned from me, only a little while\nbefore, how to load, aim, and fire this very pistol--a coincidence\nmischievous enough to have been of the devil\'s own making.Seeing all this, my fear of what the ladies would admit when questioned\nbecame very great.Let them in their innocence acknowledge that, upon my\nascent, Mary had gone to her uncle\'s room for the purpose of persuading\nhim not to carry into effect the action he contemplated, and what\nconsequences might not ensue!But events of which I had at that time no knowledge had occurred to\ninfluence them.Eleanore, with some show of reason, as it seems, not\nonly suspected her cousin of the crime, but had informed her of the\nfact, and Mary, overcome with terror at finding there was more or\nless circumstantial evidence supporting the suspicion, decided to deny\nwhatever told against herself, trusting to Eleanore\'s generosity not to\nbe contradicted.Though, by the course\nshe took, Eleanore was forced to deepen the prejudice already rife\nagainst herself, she not only forbore to contradict her cousin, but when\na true answer would have injured her, actually refused to return any,\na lie being something she could not utter, even to save one especially\nendeared to her.This conduct of hers had one effect upon me.It aroused my admiration\nand made me feel that here was a woman worth helping if assistance could\nbe given without danger to myself.Yet I doubt if my sympathy would have\nled me into doing anything, if I had not perceived, by the stress laid\nupon certain well-known matters, that actual danger hovered about us\nall while the letter and key remained in the house.Even before the\nhandkerchief was produced, I had made up my mind to attempt their\ndestruction; but when that was brought up and shown, I became so alarmed\nI immediately rose and, making my way under some pretence or other to\nthe floors above, snatched the key from the gas-fixture, the\nlighters from the vase, and hastening with them down the hall to Mary\nLeavenworth\'s room, went in under the expectation of finding a fire\nthere in which to destroy them.But, to my heavy disappointment, there\nwere only a few smoldering ashes in the grate, and, thwarted in my\ndesign, I stood hesitating what to do, when I heard some one coming\nup-stairs.Alive to the consequences of being found in that room at that\ntime, I cast the lighters into the grate and started for the door.But\nin the quick move I made, the key flew from my hand and slid under a\nchair.Aghast at the mischance, I paused, but the sound of approaching\nsteps increasing, I lost all control over myself and fled from the room.I had barely reached my own door when\nEleanore Leavenworth, followed by two servants, appeared at the top of\nthe staircase and proceeded towards the room I had just left.The sight\nreassured me; she would see the key, and take some means of disposing\nof it; and indeed I always supposed her to have done so, for no further\nword of key or letter ever came to my ears.This may explain why the\nquestionable position in which Eleanore soon found herself awakened in\nme no greater anxiety.I thought the suspicions of the police rested\nupon nothing more tangible than the peculiarity of her manner at the\ninquest and the discovery of her handkerchief on the scene of the\ntragedy.I did not know they possessed what might be called absolute\nproof of her connection with the crime.But if I had, I doubt if my\ncourse would have been any different.Mary\'s peril was the one thing\ncapable of influencing me, and she did not appear to be in peril.On the\ncontrary, every one, by common consent, seemed to ignore all appearance\nof guilt on her part.Gryce, whom I soon learned to fear, had\ngiven one sign of suspicion, or Mr.Raymond, whom I speedily recognized\nas my most persistent though unconscious foe, had betrayed the least\ndistrust of her, I should have taken warning.But they did not, and,\nlulled into a false security by their manner, I let the days go by\nwithout suffering any fears on her account.But not without many\nanxieties for myself.Hannah\'s existence precluded all sense of personal\nsecurity.Knowing the determination of the police to find her, I trod\nthe verge of an awful suspense continually.Meantime the wretched certainty was forcing itself upon me that I had\nlost, instead of gained, a hold on Mary Leavenworth.Not only did she\nevince the utmost horror of the deed which had made her mistress of\nher uncle\'s wealth, but, owing, as I believed, to the influence of Mr.Raymond, soon gave evidence that she was losing, to a certain extent,\nthe characteristics of mind and heart which had made me hopeful of\nwinning her by this deed of blood.Under the terrible restraint forced upon me, I walked my weary\nround in a state of mind bordering on frenzy.Many and many a time have\nI stopped in my work, wiped my pen and laid it down with the idea that\nI could not repress myself another moment, but I have always taken it\nup again and gone on with my task.Raymond has sometimes shown his\nwonder at my sitting in my dead employer\'s chair.By keeping the murder constantly before my mind, I\nwas enabled to restrain myself from any inconsiderate action.At last there came a time when my agony could be no longer suppressed.Raymond, I saw a strange\ngentleman standing in the reception room, looking at Mary Leavenworth\nin a way that would have made my blood boil, even if I had not heard him\nwhisper these words: "But you are my wife, and know it, whatever you may\nsay or do!"It was the lightning-stroke of my life.After what I had done to make\nher mine, to hear another claim her as already his own, was stunning,\nmaddening!I had either to yell in\nmy fury or deal the man beneath some tremendous blow in my hatred.I did\nnot dare to shriek, so I struck the blow.Raymond, and hearing that it was, as I expected, Clavering, I flung\ncaution, reason, common sense, all to the winds, and in a moment of fury\ndenounced him as the murderer of Mr.The next instant I would have given worlds to recall my words.What had\nI done but drawn attention to myself in thus accusing a man against whom\nnothing could of course be proved!So, after a night of thought, I did the next best thing: gave a\nsuperstitious reason for my action, and so restored myself to my former\nposition without eradicating from the mind of Mr.Raymond that vague\ndoubt of the man which my own safety demanded.But I had no intention of\ngoing any further, nor should I have done so if I had not observed that\nfor some reason Mr.But\nthat once seen, revenge took possession of me, and I asked myself if the\nburden of this crime could be thrown on this man.Still I do not believe\nthat any active results would have followed this self-questioning if I\nhad not overheard a whispered conversation between two of the servants,\nin which I learned that Mr.Clavering had been seen to enter the\nhouse on the night of the murder, but was not seen to leave it.With such a fact for a starting-point, what might I not\nhope to accomplish?While she remained\nalive I saw nothing but ruin before me.I made up my mind to destroy\nher and satisfy my hatred of Mr.By what\nmeans could I reach her without deserting my post, or make away with\nher without exciting fresh suspicion?The problem seemed insolvable;\nbut Trueman Harwell had not played the part of a machine so long without\nresult.Before I had studied the question a day, light broke upon it,\nand I saw that the only way to accomplish my plans was to inveigle her\ninto destroying herself.No sooner had this thought matured than I hastened to act upon it.Knowing the tremendous risk I ran, I took every precaution.Locking\nmyself up in my room, I wrote her a letter in printed characters--she\nhaving distinctly told me she could not read writing--in which I played\nupon her ignorance, foolish fondness, and Irish superstition, by telling\nher I dreamed of her every night and wondered if she did of me; was\nafraid she didn\'t, so enclosed her a little charm, which, if she would\nuse according to directions, would give her the most beautiful visions.These directions were for her first to destroy my letter by burning it,\nnext to take in her hand the packet I was careful to enclose, swallow\nthe powder accompanying it, and go to bed.The powder was a deadly dose\nof poison and the packet was, as you know, a forged confession falsely\ncriminating Henry Clavering.Enclosing all these in an envelope in\nthe corner of which I had marked a cross, I directed it, according to\nagreement, to Mrs.Then followed the greatest period of suspense I had yet endured.Though\nI had purposely refrained from putting my name to the letter, I felt\nthat the chances of detection were very great.Let her depart in the\nleast particular from the course I had marked out for her, and fatal\nresults must ensue.If she opened the enclosed packet, mistrusted the\npowder, took Mrs.Belden into her confidence, or even failed to burn my\nletter, all would be lost.I could not be sure of her or know the result\nof my scheme except through the newspapers.Do you think I kept watch\nof the countenances about me?devoured the telegraphic news, or started\nwhen the bell rang?And when, a few days since, I read that short\nparagraph in the paper which assured me that my efforts had at least\nproduced the death of the woman I feared, do you think I experienced any\nsense of relief?In six hours had come the summons from Mr.Gryce,\nand--let these prison walls, this confession itself, tell the rest.I am\nno longer capable of speech or action.THE OUTCOME OF A GREAT CRIME\n\n\n    "Leave her to Heaven\n    And to those thorns that\n    In her bosom lodge\n    To prick and sting her."--Hamlet\n\n    "For she is wise, if I can judge of her;\n    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true;\n    And true she is, as she has proved herself;\n    And therefore like herself, wise, fair, and true,\n    Shall she be placed in my constant soul."I cried, as I made my way into her presence, "are you\nprepared for very good news?News that will brighten these pale cheeks\nand give the light back to these eyes, and make life hopeful and sweet\nto you once more?Tell me," I urged, stooping over her where she sat,\nfor she looked ready to faint."I don\'t know," she faltered; "I fear your idea of good news and mine\nmay differ.No news can be good but----"\n\n"What?"I asked, taking her hands in mine with a smile that ought to\nhave reassured her, it was one of such profound happiness."Tell me; do\nnot be afraid."Her dreadful burden had lain upon her so long it had become\na part of her being.How could she realize it was founded on a mistake;\nthat she had no cause to fear the past, present, or future?But when the truth was made known to her; when, with all the fervor and\ngentle tact of which I was capable, I showed her that her suspicions had\nbeen groundless, and that Trueman Harwell, and not Mary, was accountable\nfor the evidences of crime which had led her into attributing to her\ncousin the guilt of her uncle\'s death, her first words were a prayer to\nbe taken to the one she had so wronged.I cannot breathe or think till I have begged pardon of her on my\nknees.Seeing the state she was in, I deemed it wise to humor her.So,\nprocuring a carriage, I drove with her to her cousin\'s home."Mary will spurn me; she will not even look at me; and she will be\nright!"she cried, as we rolled away up the avenue."An outrage like\nthis can never be forgiven.But God knows I thought myself justified in\nmy suspicions.If you knew--"\n\n"I do know," I interposed."Mary acknowledges that the circumstantial\nevidence against her was so overwhelming, she was almost staggered\nherself, asking if she could be guiltless with such proofs against her.But----"\n\n"Wait, oh, wait; did Mary say that?"I did not answer; I wanted her to see for herself the extent of that\nchange.But when, in a few minutes later, the carriage stopped and I\nhurried with her into the house which had been the scene of so much\nmisery, I was hardly prepared for the difference in her own countenance\nwhich the hall light revealed.Her eyes were bright, her cheeks were\nbrilliant, her brow lifted and free from shadow; so quickly does the ice\nof despair melt in the sunshine of hope.Thomas, who had opened the door, was sombrely glad to see his mistress\nagain."Miss Leavenworth is in the drawing-room," said he.I nodded, then seeing that Eleanore could scarcely move for agitation,\nasked her whether she would go in at once, or wait till she was more\ncomposed."I will go in at once; I cannot wait."And slipping from my grasp, she\ncrossed the hall and laid her hand upon the drawing-room curtain, when\nit was suddenly lifted from within and Mary stepped out.I did not need to glance their\nway to know that Eleanore had fallen at her cousin\'s feet, and that\nher cousin had affrightedly lifted her.I did not need to hear: "My sin\nagainst you is too great; you cannot forgive me!"followed by the low:\n"My shame is great enough to lead me to forgive anything!"to know that\nthe lifelong shadow between these two had dissolved like a cloud, and\nthat, for the future, bright days of mutual confidence and sympathy were\nin store.Yet when, a half-hour or so later, I heard the door of the reception\nroom, into which I had retired, softly open, and looking up, saw Mary\nstanding on the threshold, with the light of true humility on her face,\nI own that I was surprised at the softening which had taken place in\nher haughty beauty."Blessed is the shame that purifies," I inwardly\nmurmured, and advancing, held out my hand with a respect and sympathy I\nnever thought to feel for her again.Blushing deeply, she came and stood by\nmy side."I have much to be grateful for; how\nmuch I never realized till to-night; but I cannot speak of it now.What\nI wish is for you to come in and help me persuade Eleanore to accept\nthis fortune from my hands.It is hers, you know; was willed to her, or\nwould have been if--"\n\n"Wait," said I, in the trepidation which this appeal to me on such a\nsubject somehow awakened.Is it your\ndetermined purpose to transfer your fortune into your cousin\'s hands?"Her look was enough without the low, "Ah, how can you ask me?"Clavering was sitting by the side of Eleanore when we entered the\ndrawing-room.He immediately rose, and drawing me to one side, earnestly\nsaid:\n\n"Before the courtesies of the hour pass between us, Mr.Raymond, allow\nme to tender you my apology.You have in your possession a document\nwhich ought never to have been forced upon you.Founded upon a mistake,\nthe act was an insult which I bitterly regret.If, in consideration of\nmy mental misery at that time, you can pardon it, I shall feel forever\nindebted to you; if not----"\n\n"Mr.The occurrences of that day belong to\na past which I, for one, have made up my mind to forget as soon as\npossible.The future promises too richly for us to dwell on bygone\nmiseries."And with a look of mutual understanding and friendship we hastened to\nrejoin the ladies.Of the conversation that followed, it is only necessary to state the\nresult.Eleanore, remaining firm in her refusal to accept property so\nstained by guilt, it was finally agreed upon that it should be devoted\nto the erection and sustainment of some charitable institution of\nmagnitude sufficient to be a recognized benefit to the city and its\nunfortunate poor.This settled, our thoughts returned to our friends,\nespecially to Mr."He has grieved like a father over us."And, in her spirit of penitence, she would have undertaken the unhappy\ntask of telling him the truth.But Eleanore, with her accustomed generosity, would not hear of this."No, Mary," said she; "you have suffered enough.And leaving them there, with the light of growing hope and confidence on\ntheir faces, we went out again into the night, and so into a dream from\nwhich I have never waked, though the shine of her dear eyes have been\nnow the load-star of my life for many happy, happy months.His Jewish brethren excommunicated him from the synagogue.Under the\nterrible curse of their religion he was made an outcast from every\nJewish home.His own father could not give him shelter, and his mother,\nafter the curse had been pronounced, could not give him bread, could not\neven speak to him, without becoming an outcast herself.All the cruelty\nof Jehovah was in this curse.Spinoza was but twenty-four years old\nwhen he found himself without friends and without kindred.He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully\ndivided his poor crust with those below.He tried to solve the problem\nof existence.According to him the universe did not commence to\nbe.It is; from eternity it was; and to eternity it will be.He insisted\nthat God is inside, not outside, of what we call substance.Thomas Paine\n\nPoverty was his mother--Necessity his master.He had more brains than\nbooks; more sense than education; more courage than politeness;\nmore strength than polish.He had no veneration for old mistakes--no\nadmiration for ancient lies.He loved the truth for the truth\'s\nsake, and for man\'s sake.He saw oppression on every hand; injustice\neverywhere; hypocrisy at the altar, venality on the bench, tyranny on\nthe throne; and with a splendid courage he espoused the cause of the\nweak against the strong--of the enslaved many against the titled few.The Greatest of all Political Writers\n\nIn my judgment, Thomas Paine was the best political writer that ever\nlived."What he wrote was pure nature, and his soul and his pen ever\nwent together."Ceremony, pageantry, and all the paraphernalia of\npower, had no effect upon him.He examined into the why and wherefore of\nthings.He was perfectly radical in his mode of thought.Nothing short\nof the bed-rock satisfied him.His enthusiasm for what he believed to\nbe right knew no bounds.During all the dark scenes of the Revolution,\nnever for one moment did he despair.Year after year his brave words\nwere ringing through the land, and by the bivouac fires the weary\nsoldiers read the inspiring words of "Common Sense," filled with ideas\nsharper than their swords, and consecrated themselves anew to the cause\nof Freedom.The Writings of Paine\n\nThe writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry\nconviction to the dullest.Day and night he labored for America, until\nthere was a government of the people and for the people.At the close\nof the Revolution no one stood higher than Thomas Paine.Had he been\nwilling to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least\ncould have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there\nwould have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled\nwith hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a\nhypocritical monument covered with lies.The truth is, he died as he had lived.Some ministers were impolite\nenough to visit him against his will.Several of them he ordered\nfrom his room.A couple of Catholic priests, in all the meekness of\nhypocrisy, called that they might enjoy the agonies of a dying friend\nof man.Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the few embers of expiring life\nblown into flame by the breath of indignation, had the goodness to curse\nthem both.His physician, who seems to have been a meddling fool, just\nas the cold hand of death was touching the patriot\'s heart, whispered\nin the dull ear of the dying man: "Do you believe, or do you wish to\nbelieve, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?"And the reply was: "I\nhave no wish to believe on that subject."These were the last remembered\nwords of Thomas Paine.He died as serenely as ever Christian passed\naway.He died in the full possession of his mind, and on the very brink\nand edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his life.Paine Believed in God\n\nThomas Paine was a champion in both hemispheres of human liberty; one of\nthe founders and fathers of the Republic; one of the foremost men of his\nage.He never wrote a word in favor of injustice.He was a despiser of\nslavery.He wast in the widest and\nbest sense, a friend of all his race.His head was as clear as his heart\nwas good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.He was\nthe first man to write these words: "The United States of America."He furnished every thought\nthat now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.He believed in one\nGod and no more.He was a believer even in special providence, and he\nhoped for immortality.The Intellectual Hera\n\nThomas Paine was one of the intellectual heroes--one of the men to whom\nwe are indebted.His name is associated forever with the Great Republic.As long as free government exists he will be remembered, admired and\nhonored.He lived a long, laborious and useful life.The world is better\nfor his having lived.For the sake of truth he accepted hatred and\nreproach for his portion.His friends\nwere untrue to him because he was true to himself, and true to them.He\nlost the respect of what is called society, but kept his own.His life\nis what the world calls failure and what history calls success.If to\nlove your fellow-men more than self is goodness, Thomas Paine was good.If to be in advance of your time--to be a pioneer in the direction of\nright--is greatness.If to avow your principles and discharge your\nduty in the presence of death is heroic, Thomas Paine was a hero.At the\nage of seventy-three, death touched his tired heart.He died in the land\nhis genius defended--under the flag he gave to the skies.Slander cannot\ntouch him now--hatred cannot reach him more.He sleeps in the sanctuary\nof the tomb, beneath the quiet of the stars.Paine, Franklin, Jefferson\n\nIn our country there were three infidels--Paine, Franklin and Jefferson.The colonies were full of superstition, the Puritans with the spirit\nof persecution.Laws savage, ignorant, and malignant had been passed in\nevery colony for the purpose of destroying intellectual liberty.The toleration acts of\nMaryland tolerated only Christians--not infidels, not thinkers, not\ninvestigators.The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those\nwho denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ.It was not\nbased upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who\ndiffered in non-essential points.David Hume\n\nOn the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.David Hume was one of\nthe few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by the church.He had\nthe manliness to examine historical and religious questions for himself,\nand the courage to give his conclusions to the world.He was singularly\ncapable of governing himself.Mary went back to the bathroom.He was a philosopher, and lived a calm\nand cheerful life, unstained by an unjust act, free from all excess,\nand devoted in a reasonable degree to benefiting his fellow-men.After\nexamining the Bible he became convinced that it was not true.For\nfailing to suppress his real opinion, for failing to tell a deliberate\nfalsehood, he brought upon him the hatred of the church.Voltaire\n\nVoltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time.From his throne at\nthe foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite\nin Europe.He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow.He was the\npioneer of his century.Through the\nshadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,\nthrough the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,\npast cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne,\nhe carried, with brave and chivalric hands, the torch of reason.John Calvin\n\nCalvin was of a pallid, bloodless complexion, thin, sickly, irritable,\ngloomy, impatient, egotistic, tyrannical, heartless, and infamous.He\nwas a strange compound of revengeful morality, malicious forgiveness,\nferocious charity, egotistic humility, and a kind of hellish justice.In other words, he was as near like the God of the Old Testament as his\nhealth permitted.Calvin\'s Five Fetters\n\nThis man forged five fetters for the brain.That is to say, predestination, particular redemption, total\ndepravity, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints.About\nthe neck of each follower he put a collar bristling with these five iron\npoints.The presence of all these points on the collar is still the test\nof orthodoxy in the church he founded.This man, when in the flush of\nyouth, was elected to the office of preacher in Geneva.He at once,\nin union with Farel, drew up a condensed statement of the Presbyterian\ndoctrine, and all the citizens of Geneva, on pain of banishment, were\ncompelled to take an oath that they believed this statement.Of this\nproceeding Calvin very innocently remarked that it produced great\nsatisfaction.A man named Caroli had the audacity to dispute with\nCalvin.Humboldt\n\nHumboldt breathed the atmosphere of investigation.Old ideas were\nabandoned; old creeds, hallowed by centuries, were thrown aside; thought\nbecame courageous; the athlete, Reason, challenged to mortal combat the\nmonsters of superstition.Humbolt\'s Travels\n\nEurope becoming too small for his genius, he visited the tropics.He\nsailed along the gigantic Amazon--the mysterious Orinoco--traversed the\nPampas--climbed the Andes until he stood upon the crags of Chimborazo,\nmore than eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, and climbed\non until blood flowed from his eyes and lips.For nearly five years he\npursued his investigations in the new world, accompanied by the intrepid\nBonplandi.He was the best intellectual\norgan of these new revelations of science.He was calm, reflective and\neloquent; filled with a sense of the beautiful, and the love of truth.His collections were immense, and valuable beyond calculation to every\nscience.He endured innumerable hardships, braved countless dangers in\nunknown and savage lands, and exhausted his fortune for the advancement\nof true learning.Humboldt\'s Illustrious Companions\n\nHumboldt was the friend and companion of the greatest poets, historians,\nphilologists, artists, statesmen, critics, and logicians of his time.He was the companion of Schiller, who believed that man would be\nregenerated through the influence of the Beautiful of Goethe, the grand\npatriarch of German literature; of Weiland, who has been called\nthe Voltaire of Germany; of Herder, who wrote the outlines of a\nphilosophical history of man; of Kotzebue, who lived in the world of\nromance; of Schleiermacher, the pantheist; of Schlegel, who gave to\nhis countrymen the enchanted realm of Shakespeare; of the sublime Kant,\nauthor of the first work published in Germany on Pure Reason; of Fichte,\nthe infinite idealist; of Schopenhauer, the European Buddhist who\nfollowed the great Gautama to the painless and dreamless Nirwana, and\nof hundreds of others, whose names are familiar to and honored by the\nscientific world.Humboldt the Apostle of Science\n\nUpon his return to Europe he was hailed as the second Columbus; as the\nscientific discover of America; as the revealer of a new world; as the\ngreat demonstrator of the sublime truth, that the universe is governed\nby law.I have seen a picture of the old man, sitting upon a mountain\nside--above him the eternal snow--below, the smiling valley of the\ntropics, filled with vine and palm; his chin upon his breast, his\neyes deep, thoughtful and calm his forehead majestic--grander than the\nmountain upon which he sat--crowned with the snow of his whitened hair,\nhe looked the intellectual autocrat of this world.Not satisfied with\nhis discoveries in America, he crossed the steppes of Asia, the wastes\nof\n\nSiberia, the great Ural range adding to the knowledge of mankind at\nevery step.H is energy acknowledged no obstacle, his life knew no\nleisure; every day was filled with labor and with thought.He was one\nof the apostles of science, and he served his divine master with\na self-sacrificing zeal that knew no abatement; with an ardor that\nconstantly increased, and with a devotion unwavering and constant as the\npolar star.Ingersoll Muses by Napoleon\'s Tomb\n\nA little while ago I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a\nmagnificent tomb of gilt and gold, fit almost for a dead deity--and\ngazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble, where rest at last\nthe ashes of the restless man.I leaned over the balustrade and thought\nabout the career of the greatest soldier of the modern world.I saw him\nwalking upon the banks of the Seine, contemplating suicide--I saw him\nat Toulon--I saw him putting down the mob in the streets of Paris--I saw\nhim at the head of the army of Italy--I saw him crossing the bridge of\nLodi with the tri-color in his hand--I saw him in Egypt in the shadows\nof the pyramids--I saw him conquer the Alps and mingle the eagles of\nFrance with the eagles of the crags.I saw him at Marengo--at Ulm and\nAusterlitz.I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the\ncavalry of the wild blast scattered his legions like Winter\'s withered\nleaves.I saw him at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million\nbayonets back upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.I saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.I saw\nhim upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where chance and fate combined\nto wreck the fortunes of their former king.Helena,\nwith his hands crossed behind him, gazing out upon the sad and solemn\nsea.I thought of the orphans and widows he had made--of the tears that\nhad been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,\npushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition.And I said I would\nrather have been a French peasant, and worn wooden shoes.I would rather\nhave lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door, and the grapes\ngrowing purple in the kisses of the Autumn sun.I would rather have been\nthat poor peasant with my loving wife by my side, knitting as the day\ndied out of the sky--with my children upon my knees and their arms about\nme; I would rather have been that man and gone down to the tongueless\nsilence of the dreamless dust, than to have been that imperial\nimpersonation of force and murder known as Napoleon the Great.And so I\nwould, ten thousand times.Eulogy on J. G. Blaine\n\nThis is a grand year--a year filled with recollections of the\nRevolution; filled with the proud and tender memories of the past; with\nthe sacred legends of liberty; a year in which the sons of freedom will\ndrink from the fountains of enthusiasm; a year in which the people call\nfor a man who has preserved in Congress what our soldiers won upon\nthe field; a year in which they call for the man who has torn from the\nthroat of treason the tongue of slander--for the man who has snatched\nthe mask of Democracy from the hideous face of rebellion; for this man\nwho, like an intellectual athlete, has stood in the arena of debate and\nchallenged all comers, and who is still a total stranger to defeat.Like\nan armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the\nhalls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and\nfair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country and the\nmaligners of her honor.For the Republican party to desert this gallant\nleader now is as though an army should desert their General upon the\nfield of battle.James G. Blaine is now and has been for years the\nbearer of the sacred standard of the Republican party.A Model Leader\n\nThe Republicans of the United States want a man who knows that this\nGovernment should protect every citizen, at home and abroad; who knows\nthat any Government that will not defend its defenders and protect its\nprotectors is a disgrace to the map of the world.They demand a man who\nbelieves in the eternal separation and divorcement of church and school.They demand a man whose political reputation is as spotless as a star;\nbut they do not demand that their candidate shall have a certificate of\nmoral character signed by a Confederate Congress.The man who has, in\nfull, heaped and rounded measure, all these splendid qualifications is\nthe present grand and gallant leader of the Republican party--James G.\nBlaine.Our country, crowned with the vast and marvelous achievements\nof its first century, asks for a man worthy of the past and prophetic\nof her future; asks for a man who has the audacity of genius; asks for\na man who is the grandest combination of heart, conscience and brain\nbeneath her flag.Such a man is James G. Blaine.Abraham Lincoln\n\nThis world has not been fit to live in fifty years.There is no liberty\nin it--very little.Why, it is only a few years ago that all the\nChristian nations were engaged in the slave trade.It was not until 1808\nthat England abolished the slave trade, and up to that time her priests\nin her churches and her judges on her benches owned stock in slave\nships, and luxuriated on the profits of piracy and murder; and when a\nman stood up and denounced it they mobbed him as though he had been a\ncommon burglar or a horse thief.It was not until the 28th\nday of August, 1833, that England abolished slavery in her colonies; and\nit was not until the 1st day of January, 1862, that Abraham Lincoln, by\ndirection of the entire North, wiped that infamy out of this country;\nand I never speak of Abraham Lincoln but I want to say that he was, in\nmy judgment, in many respects the grandest man ever President of the\nUnited States.I say that upon his tomb there ought to be this line--and\nI know of no other man deserving it so well as he: "Here lies one who\nhaving been clothed with almost absolute power never abused it except on\nthe side of mercy."Swedenborg\n\nSwedenborg was a man of great intellect, of vast acquirements, and of\nhonest intentions; and I think it equally clear that upon one subject,\nat least, his mind was touched, shattered and shaken.Misled by\nanalogies, imposed upon by the bishop, deceived by the woman, borne to\nother worlds upon the wings of dreams, living in the twilight of reason\nand the dawn of insanity, he regarded every fact as a patched and ragged\ngarment with a lining of the costliest silk, and insisted that the wrong\nside, even of the silk, was far more beautiful than the right.Jeremy Bentham\n\nThe glory of Bentham is, that he gave the true basis of morals, and\nfurnished the statesmen with the star and compass of this sentence: "The\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number."Charles Fourier\n\nFourier sustained about the same relation to this world that Swedenborg\ndid to the other.There must be something wrong about the brain of one\nwho solemnly asserts that "the elephant, the ox and the diamond were\ncreated by the Sun; the horse, the lily, and the ruby, by Saturn; the\ncow, the jonquil and the topaz, by Jupiter; and the dog, the violet\nand the opal stones by the earth itself."And yet, forgetting these\naberrations of the mind, this lunacy of a great and loving soul, for\none, that\'s in tender-est regard the memory of Charles Fourier, one of\nthe best and noblest of our race.Auguste Comte\n\nThere was in the brain of the great Frenchman--Auguste Comte--the dawn\nof that happy day in which humanity will be the only religion, good the\nonly God, happiness the only object, restitution the only atonement,\nmistake the only sin, and affection guided by intelligence, the only\nsavior of mankind.This dawn enriched his poverty, illuminated the\ndarkness of his life, peopled his loneliness with the happy millions yet\nto be, and filled his eyes with proud and tender tears.When everything\nconnected with Napoleon, except his crimes, shall be forgotten, Auguste\nComte will be lovingly remembered as a benefactor of the human race.Herbert Spencer\n\nHerbert Spencer relies upon evidence, upon demonstration, upon\nexperience; and occupies himself with one world at a time.He perceives\nthat there is a mental horizon that we cannot pierce, and that beyond\nthat is the unknown, possibly the unknowable.He endeavors to examine\nonly that which is capable of being examined, and considers the\ntheological method as not only useless, but hurtful.After all God is\nbut a guess, throned and established by arrogance and assertion.Turning his attention to those things that have in some way affected\nthe condition of mankind, Spencer leaves the unknowable to priests and\nbelievers.Robert Collyer\n\nI have the honor of a slight acquaintance with Robert Collyer.I have\nread with pleasure some of his exquisite productions.He has a brain\nfull of the dawn, the head of a philosopher, the imagination of a poet\nand the sincere heart of a child.Had such men as Robert Collyer and\nJohn Stuart Mill been present at the burning of Servetus, they would\nhave extinguished the flames with their tears.Had the presbytery of\nChicago been there, they would have quietly turned their backs, solemnly\ndivided their coat tails, and warmed themselves.John Milton\n\nEngland was filled with Puritan gloom and Episcopal ceremony.All\nreligious conceptions were of the grossest nature.The ideas of crazy\nfanatics and extravagant poets were taken as sober facts.Milton had\nclothed Christianity in the soiled and faded finery of the gods--had\nadded to the story of Christ the fables of Mythology, He gave to the\nProtestant Church the most outrageously material ideas of the Deity.He turned all the angels into soldiers--made heaven a battlefield, put\nChrist in uniform, and described God as a militia general.His works\nwere considered by the Protestants nearly as sacred as the Bible\nitself, and the imagination of the people was thoroughly polluted by the\nhorrible imagery, the sublime absurdity of the blind Milton.Ernst Haeckel\n\nAmongst the bravest, side by side with the greatest of the world in\nGermany, the land of science--stands Ernst Haeckel, who may be said\nnot only to have demonstrated the theories of Darwin, but the monistic\nconception of the world.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.He has endeavored--and I think with complete\nsuccess--to show that there is not, and never was, and never can be,\nthe creator of anything.Haeckel is one of the bitterest enemies of the\nchurch, and is, therefore, one of the bravest friends of man.Professor Swing, a Dove amongst Vultures\n\nProfessor Swing was too good a man to stay in the Presbyterian Church.He was a rose amongst thistles; he was a dove amongst vultures; and they\nhunted him out, and I am glad he came out.I have the greatest respect\nfor Professor Swing, but I want him to tell whether the 109th Psalm is\ninspired.Queen Victoria and George Eliot\n\nCompare George Eliot with Queen Victoria.The Queen is clad in garments\ngiven her by blind fortune and unreasoning chance, while George Eliot\nwears robes of glory woven in the loom of her own genius.The time is coming when men will be rated at their real\nworth; when we shall care nothing for an officer if he does not fill his\nplace.Bough on Rabbi Bien\n\nI will not answer Rabbi Bien, and I will tell you why.Because he has\ntaken himself outside of all the limits of a gentleman; because he has\ntaken upon himself to traduce American women in language the beastliest\nI ever read; and any man who says that the American women are not just\nas good women as any God can make, and pick his mind to-day, is an\nunappreciative barbarian.I will let him alone because he denounced all\nthe men in this country, all the members of Congress, all the members\nof the Senate, all the Judges on the bench, as thieves and robbers.I\npronounce him a vulgar falsifier, and let him alone.General Garfield\n\nNo man has been nominated for the office since I was born, by either\nparty, who had more brains and more heart than James A. Garfield.He\nwas a soldier, he is a statesman.In time of peace he preferred the\navocations of peace; when the bugle of war blew in his ears he withdrew\nfrom his work and fought for the flag, and then he went back to the\navocation of peace.And I say to-day that a man who, in a time of\nprofound peace, makes up his mind that he would like to kill folks for\na living is no better, to say the least of it, than the man who loves\npeace in the time of peace, and who, when his country is attacked,\nrushes to the rescue of her flag."Wealthy in Integrity; In Brain a Millionaire."James A. Garfield is to-day a poor man, and you know that there is not\nmoney enough in this magnificent street to buy the honor and manhood of\nJames A. Garfield.Money cannot make such a man, and I will swear to you\nthat money cannot buy him.James A. Garfield to-day wears the glorious\nrobe of honest poverty.He is a poor man; but I like to say it here in\nWall street; I like to say it surrounded by the millions of America; I\nlike to say it in the midst of banks, and bonds, and stocks; I love to\nsay it where gold is piled--that, although a poor man, he is rich in\nhonor, in integrity he is wealthy, and in brain he is a millionaire.Garfield a Certificate of the Splendor of the American Constitution\n\nGarfield is a certificate of the splendor of our Government, that says\nto every poor boy: "All the avenues of honor are open to you."He is a scholar; he is a statesman; he was a\nsoldier; he is a patriot; and above all he is a magnificent man, and if\nevery man in New York knew him as well as I do, Garfield would not lose\na hundred votes in this city.W. Hiram Thomas\n\nThe best thing that has come from the other side is from Dr.I\nregard him as by far the grandest intellect in the Methodist Church.He\nis intellectually a wide and tender man.I cannot conceive of an article\nbeing written in a better spirit.He finds a little fault with me for\nnot being exactly fair.Thomas\nthe probability is I never should have laid myself liable to criticism.There is some human nature in me, and I find it exceedingly difficult\nto preserve at all times perfect serenity.I have the greatest possible\nrespect for Dr.Thomas, and must heartily thank him for his perfect\nfairness.MISCELLANEOUS\n\n\n\n\n355.Heresy and Orthodoxy\n\nIt has always been the man ahead that has been called the heretic.Heresy is the last and best thought always!Heresy extends the\nhospitality of the brain to a new idea; that is what the rotting says to\nflax growing; that is what the dweller in the swamp says to the man on\nthe sun-lit hill; that is what the man in the darkness cries out to the\ngrand man upon whose forehead is shining the dawn of a grander day; that\nis what the coffin says to the cradle.Orthodoxy is a kind of shroud,\nand heresy is a banner--Orthodoxy is a fog and Heresy a star shining\nforever upon the cradle of truth.I do not mean simply in religion, I\nmean in everything and the idea I wish to impress upon you is that you\nshould keep your minds open to all the influences of nature, you should\nkeep your minds open to reason; hear what a man has to say, and do not\nlet the turtle-shell of bigotry grow above your brain.Give everybody a\nchance and an opportunity; that is all.We used to worship the golden calf, and the worst you can say of us now,\nis, we worship the gold of the calf, and even the calves are beginning\nto see this distinction.We used to go down on our knees to every man\nthat held office, now he must fill it if he wishes any respect.We care\nnothing for the rich, except what will they do with their money?How does he fill it?--that is the question.And there is rapidly growing\nup in the world an aristocracy of heart and brain--the only aristocracy\nthat has a right to exist.Truth will Bear the Test\n\nIf a man has a diamond that has been examined by the lapidaries of the\nworld, and some ignorant stonecutter told him that it is nothing but\nan ordinary rock, he laughs at him; but if it has not been examined\nby lapidaries, and he is a little suspicious himself that it is not\ngenuine, it makes him mad.Any doctrine that will not bear investigation\nis not a fit tenant for the mind of an honest man.Any man who is afraid\nto have his doctrine investigated is not only a coward but a hypocrite.Paring Nails\n\nWhy should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead?Why\nshould barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand\nyears ago, control the living world?Why should we care for the\nsuperstition of men who began the sabbath by paring their nails,\n"beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then to the\nfifth, then to the third, and ending with the thumb?"How pleasing to\nGod this must have been.There may be a God\n\nThere may be for aught I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast,\nsome being whose dreams are constellations and within whose thought the\ninfinite exists.About this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing\nto say.He has written no books, inspired no barbarians, required no\nworship, and has prepared no hell in which to burn the honest seeker\nafter truth.The People are Beginning to Think\n\nThe people are beginning to think, to reason and to investigate.Slowly,\npainfully, but surely, the gods are being driven from the earth.Only\nupon rare occasions are they, even by the most religious, supposed to\ninterfere in the affairs of men.In most matters we are at last supposed\nto be free.Since the invention of steamships and railways, so that the\nproducts of all countries can be easily interchanged, the gods have quit\nthe business of producing famine.Unchained Thought\n\nFor the vagaries of the clouds the infidels propose to substitute the\nrealities of earth; for superstition, the splendid demonstrations and\nachievements of science; and for theological tyranny, the chainless\nliberty of thought.Man the Victor of the Future\n\nIf abuses are destroyed, man must destroy them.If slaves are freed, man\nmust free them.If new truths are discovered, man must discover them.If the naked are clothed; if the hungry are fed; if justice is done;\nif labor is rewarded; if superstition is driven from the mind; if the\ndefenseless are protected, and if the right finally triumphs, all must\nbe the work of man.The grand victories of the future must be won by\nman, and by man alone.The Sacred Sabbath\n\nOf all the superstitious of mankind, this insanity about the "sacred\nSabbath" is the most absurd.The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn\nand sad one-seventh of the time!To think that we can please an infinite\nbeing by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the\nperfumed fields!Why should God hate to see a man happy?Why should it\nexcite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,\ntalking, laughing and loving?Nature works on that "sacred" day.The\nearth turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and\nbirds fill the air with song.Why should we look sad, and think about\ndeath, and hear about-hell?Why should that day be filled with gloom\ninstead of joy?Make the Sabbath Merry\n\nFreethinkers should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to\nspend with wife and child--a day of games, and books, and dreams--a day\nto put fresh flowers above our sleeping dead--a day of memory and hope,\nof love and rest.Away to the Hills and the Sea\n\nA poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of\nrest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood--a day to live with wife\nand child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength\nfor toils to come.And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away\nfrom street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where\nshe can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the\nlong, glad day.Melancholy Sundays\n\nWhen I was a little fellow most everybody thought that some days were\ntoo sacred for the young ones to enjoy themselves in.Sunday used to commence Saturday night at sundown, under\nthe old text, "The evening and the morning were the first day."They\ncommenced then, I think, to get a good ready.When the sun went down\nSaturday night, darkness ten thousand times deeper than ordinary night\nfell upon that house.The boy that looked the sickest was regarded as\nthe most pious.You could not crack hickory nuts that night, and if you\nwere caught chewing gum it was another evidence of the total depravity\nof the human heart.We would sometimes\nsing, "Another day has passed."Everybody looked as though they had the\ndyspesia--you know lots of people think they are pious, just because\nthey are bilious, as Mr.It was a solemn night, and the next\nmorning the solemnity had increased.Then we went to church, and the\nminister was in a pulpit about twenty feet high.If it was in the winter\nthere was no fire; it was not thought proper to be comfortable while you\nwere thanking the Lord.The minister commenced at firstly and ran up to\nabout twenty-fourthly, and then he divided it up again; and then he\nmade some concluding remarks, and then he said lastly, and when he said\nlastly he was about half through.Moses took Egyptian Law for his Model\n\nIt has been contended for many years that the ten commandments are the\nfoundation of all ideas of justice and of law.Eminent jurists have\nbowed to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to\nthe effect that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all\nideas of right and wrong.Nothing can be more stupidly false than such\nassertions.Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians\nhad a code of laws.They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery,\nlarceny, perjury, laws for the collection of debts, and the enforcement\nof contracts.A False Standard of Success\n\nIt is not necessary to be rich, nor powerful, nor great, to be a\nsuccess; and neither is it necessary to have your name between the\nputrid lips of rumor to be great.We have had a false standard of\nsuccess.In the years when I was a little boy we read in our books that\nno fellow was a success that did not make a fortune or get a big office,\nand he generally was a man that slept about three hours a night.They\nnever put down in the books the gentlemen who succeeded in life and yet\nslept all they wanted to.Toilers and Idlers\n\nYou can divide mankind into two classes: the laborers and the idlers,\nthe supporters and the supported, the honest and the dishonest.Every\nman is dishonest who lives upon the unpaid labor of others, no matter\nif he occupies a throne.The laborers\nshould have equal-rights before the world and before the law.And I want\nevery farmer to consider every man who labors either with hand or brain\nas his brother.Until genius and labor formed a partnership there was\nno such thing as prosperity among men.Every reaper and mower, every\nagricultural implement, has elevated the work of the farmer, and his\nvocation grows grander with every invention.In the olden time the\nagriculturist was ignorant; he knew nothing of machinery, he was the\nslave of superstition.The Sad Wilderness History\n\nWhile reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and\nhorror.Nothing can be sadder than the history of the starved and\nfrightened wretches who wandered over the desolate crags and sands of\nwilderness and desert, the prey of famine, sword and plague.Ignorant\nand superstitious to the last degree, governed by falsehood, plundered\nby hypocrisy, they were the sport of priests, and the food of fear.God\nwas their greatest enemy, and death their only friend.Law Much Older than Sinai\n\nLaws spring from the instinct of self-preservation.Industry objected\nto supporting idleness, and laws were made against theft.Laws were made\nagainst murder, because a very large majority of the people have always\nobjected to being murdered.All fundamental laws were born simply of the\ninstinct of self-defence.Long before the Jewish savages assembled at\nthe foot of Sinai, laws had been made and enforced, not only in Egypt\nand India, but by every tribe that ever existed.God raised the black flag, and\ncommanded his soldiers to kill even the smiling infant in its mother\'s\narms.Who is the blasphemer; the man who denies the existence of God, or\nhe who covers the robes of the infinite with innocent blood?Standing Tip for God\n\nWe are told in the Pentateuch that God, the father of us all, gave\nthousands of maidens, after having killed their fathers, their mothers,\nand their brothers, to satisfy the brutal lusts of savage men.If there\nbe a God, I pray him to write in his book, opposite my name, that I\ndenied this lie for him.Matter and Force\n\nThe statement in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, I\ncannot accept.It is contrary to my reason, and I cannot believe it.It\nappears reasonable for me that force has existed from eternity.Force\ncannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter.Force, in its\nnature, is forever active, and without matter it could not act; and so\nI think matter must have existed forever.To conceive of matter without\nforce, or of force without matter, or of a time when neither existed,\nor of a being who existed for an eternity without either, and who out of\nnothing created both, is to me utterly impossible.It may be that I am led to these conclusions by "total depravity," or\nthat I lack the necessary humility of spirit to satisfactorily harmonize\nHaeckel and Moses; or that I am carried away by pride, blinded by\nreason, given over to hardness of heart that I might be damned, but I\nnever can believe that the earth was covered with leaves, and buds, and\nflowers, and fruits, before the sun with glittering spear had driven\nback the hosts of night.We are told that God made man; and the question naturally arises, how\nwas this done?Was it by a process of "evolution," "development;" the\n"transmission of acquired habits;" the "survival of the fittest," or was\nthe necessary amount of clay kneaded to the proper consistency, and then\nby the hands of God moulded into form?Modern science tells that man has\nbeen evolved, through countless epochs, from the lower forms; that he\nis the result of almost an infinite number of actions, reactions,\nexperiences, states, forms, wants and adaptations.General Joshua\n\nMy own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of\nthe earth than he did mercy and justice.If he had known that the earth\nturned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and swept\nin its course about the sun at the rate of sixty-eight thousand miles\nan hour, he would have doubled the hailstones, spoken of in the same\nchapter, that the Lord cast down from heaven, and allowed the sun and\nmoon to rise and set in the usual way.This getting up so early in the morning is a relic of barbarism.It has\nmade hundreds of thousands of young men curse business.There is no need\nof getting up at three or four o\'clock in the winter morning.The farmer\nwho persists in dragging his wife and children from their beds ought to\nbe visited by a missionary.It is time enough to rise after the sun has\nset the example.Why\nnot feed them more the night before?In the old\ntimes they used to get up about three o\'clock in the morning, and go to\nwork long before the sun had risen with "healing upon his wings," and as\na just punishment they all had the ague; and they ought to have it now.Sleep is the best medicine\nin the world.There is no such thing as health, without plenty of sleep.When you work, work;\nand when you get through take a good, long and refreshing sleep.Never Rise at Four O\'Clock\n\nThe man who cannot get a living upon Illinois soil without rising before\ndaylight ought to starve.Eight hours a day is enough for any farmer to\nwork except in harvest time.When you rise at four and work till dark\nwhat is life worth?Of what use are all the improvements in farming?Of what use is all the improved machinery unless it tends to give the\nfarmer a little more leisure?What is harvesting now, compared with what\nit was in the old time?Think of the days of reaping, of cradling, of\nraking and binding and mowing.Think of threshing with the flail and\nwinnowing with the wind.And now think of the reapers and mowers, the\nbinders and threshing machines, the plows and cultivators, upon which\nthe farmer rides protected from the sun.If, with all these advantages,\nyou cannot get a living without rising in the middle of the night, go\ninto some other business.The Hermit is Mad\n\nA hermit is a mad man.Without friends and wife and child, there is\nnothing left worth living for.They\nare filled with egotism and envy, with vanity and hatred.People who\nlive much alone become narrow and suspicious.They are apt to be the\nproperty of one idea.They begin to think there is no use in anything.They look upon the happiness of others as a kind of folly.They hate\njoyous folks, because, way down in their hearts, they envy them.Duke Orang-Outang\n\nI think we came from the lower animals.I am not dead sure of it, but\nthink so.When I first read about it I didn\'t like it.My heart was\nfilled with sympathy for those people who leave nothing to be proud of\nexcept ancestors.I thought how terrible this will be upon the nobility\nof the old world.Think of their being forced to trace their ancestry\nback to the Duke Orang-Outang or to the Princess Chimpanzee.After\nthinking it all over I came to the conclusion that I liked that\ndoctrine.I read about\nrudimentary bones and muscles.I was told that everybody had rudimentary\nmuscles extending from the ear into the cheek.I was told: "They are the remains of muscles; they became rudimentary\nfrom the lack of use."They are the muscles\nwith which your ancestors used to flap their ears.Well, at first I was\ngreatly astonished, and afterward I was more astonished to find they had\nbecome rudimentary.Self-Made Men\n\nIt is often said of this or that man that he is a self-made man--that\nhe was born of the poorest and humblest parents, and that with every\nobstacle to overcome he became great.Most of the intellectual giants of the world\nhave been nursed at the sad but loving breast of poverty.Most of those\nwho have climbed highest on the shining ladder of fame commenced at the\nlowest round.They were reared in the straw thatched cottages of Europe;\nin the log houses of America; in the factories of the great cities; in\nthe midst of toil; in the smoke and din of labor.The One Window in the Ark\n\nA cubit is twenty-two inches; so that the ark was five hundred and fifty\nfeet long, ninety-one feet and eight inches wide, and fifty-five feet\nhigh.The ark was divided into three stories, and had on top, one window\ntwenty-two inches square.Ventillation must have been one of Jehovah\'s\nhobbies.Think of a ship larger than the Great Eastern with only one\nwindow, and that but twenty-two inches square!No Ante-Diluvian Camp-Meetings!It is a little curious that when God wished to reform the ante-diluvian\nworld he said nothing about hell; that he had no revivals, no\ncamp-meetings, no tracts, no out-pourings of the Holy Ghost, no\nbaptisms, no noon prayer meetings, and never mentioned the great\ndoctrine of salvation by faith.If the orthodox creeds of the world are\ntrue, all those people went to hell without ever having heard that such\na place existed.If eternal torment is a fact, surely these miserable\nwretches ought to have been warned.They were threatened only with water\nwhen they were in fact doomed to eternal fire!Hard Work in the Ark\n\nEight persons did all the work.They attended to the wants of 175,000\nbirds, 3,616 beasts, 1,300 reptiles, and 2,000,000 insects, saying\nnothing of countless animalculae.Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the\nsun?Draw a circle five inches in diameter, and by its side thrust a pin\nthrough the paper.The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same\nrelation to the circle that the earth does to the sun.Did he know that\nthe sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter; that it\nwas enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth, hotter\neven than the Christian\'s hell?Did he know that the volume of the Earth\nis less than one-millionth of that of the sun?Did he know of the one\nhundred and four planets belonging to our solar system, all children of\nthe sun?Did he know of Jupiter eighty-five thousand miles in diameter,\nhundreds of times as large as our earth, turning on his axis at the rate\nof twenty-five thousand miles an hour accompanied by four moons making\nthe tour of his orbit once only in fifty years?Something for Nothing\n\nIt is impossible for me to conceive of something being created for\nnothing.Nothing, regarded in the light of raw material, is a decided\nfailure.Neither is it\npossible to think of force disconnected with matter.You cannot imagine\nmatter going back to absolute nothing.Neither can you imagine nothing\nbeing changed into something.You may be eternally damned if you do not\nsay that you can conceive these things, but you cannot conceive them.Polygamy\n\nPolygamy is just as pure in Utah as it could have been in the promised\nland.Love and virtue are the same the whole world around, and justice\nis the same in every star.All the languages of the world are not\nsufficient to express the filth of polygamy.It makes of man a beast,\nof woman a trembling slave.It destroys the fireside, makes virtue an\noutcast, takes from human speech its sweetest words, and leaves the\nheart a den, where crawl and hiss the slimy serpents of most loathsome\nlust.The good family is the unit\nof good government.The virtues grow about the holy hearth of home--they\ncluster, bloom, and shed their perfume round the fireside where the\none man loves the one woman.Lover--husband--wife--mother--father--child--home!--without these sacred\nwords the world is but a lair, and men and women merely beasts.The Colonel in the Kitchen--How to Cook a Beefsteak\n\nThere ought to be a law making it a crime, punishable by imprisonment,\nto fry a beefsteak.Broil it; it is just as easy, and when broiled it\nis delicious.Fried beefsteak is not fit for a wild beast.You can broil\neven on a stove.Shut the front damper--open the back one, and then take\noff a griddle.There will then be a draft down through this opening.Put\non your steak, using a wire broiler, and not a particle of smoke will\ntouch it, for the reason that the smoke goes down.If you try to broil\nit with the front damper open the smoke will rise.For broiling, coal,\neven soft coal, makes a better fire than wood.Do not huddle together in a little room\naround a red-hot stove, with every window fastened down.Do not live in\nthis poisoned atmosphere, and then, when one of your children dies, put\na piece in the papers commencing with, "Whereas, it has pleased divine\nProvidence to remove from our midst--."Have plenty of air, and plenty\nof warmth.Do not imagine anything is unhealthy\nsimply because it is pleasant.Cooking a Fine Art\n\nCooking is one of the fine arts.Give your wives and daughters things to\ncook, and things to cook with, and they will soon become most excellent\ncooks.The man whose arteries\nand veins are filled with rich blood made of good and well cooked food,\nhas pluck, courage, endurance and noble impulses.Remember that your\nwife should have things to cook with.Scathing Impeachment of Intemperance\n\nIntemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood in its strength, and\nage in its weakness.It breaks the father\'s heart, bereaves the doting\nmother, extinguishes natural affections, erases conjugal loves, blots\nout filial attachments, blights parental hope, and brings down mourning\nage in sorrow to the grave.It produces weakness, not strength;\nsickness, not health; death, not life.It makes wives widows; children\norphans; fathers fiends, and all of them paupers and beggars.It feeds\nrheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites cholera, imports\npestilence and embraces consumption.It covers the land with idleness,\nmisery and crime.It fills your jails, supplies your almshouses and\ndemands your asylums.It engenders controversies, fosters quarrels, and\ncherishes riots.It crowds your penitentiaries and furnishes victims to\nyour scaffolds.It is the life blood of the gambler, the element of\nthe burglar, the prop of the highwayman and the support of the midnight\nincendiary.It countenances the liar, respects the thief, esteems\nthe blasphemer.It violates obligations, reverences fraud, and honors\ninfamy.It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue and slanders\ninnocence.It incites the father to butcher his helpless offspring,\nhelps the husband to massacre his wife, and the child to grind the\nparricidal ax.It burns up men, consumes women, detests life, curses God,\nand despises heaven.It suborns witnesses, nurses perjury, defiles\nthe jury box, and stains the judicial ermine.It degrades the citizen,\ndebases the legislator, dishonors statesmen, and disarms the patriot.It\nbrings shame, not honor; terror, not safety; despair, not hope; misery,\nnot happiness; and with the malevolence of a fiend, it calmly surveys\nits frightful desolation, and unsatisfied with its havoc, it poisons\nfelicity, kills peace, ruins morals, blights confidence, slays\nreputation, and wipes out national honors, then curses the world and\nlaughs at its ruin.Liberty Defined\n\nThe French convention gave the best definition of liberty I have ever\nread: "The liberty of one citizen ceases only where the liberty of\nanother citizen commences."I ask you\nto-day to make a declaration of individual independence.And if you are\nindependent, be just.Allow everybody else to make his declaration of\nindividual independence.Allow your wife, allow your husband, allow\nyour children to make theirs.It is a grand thing to be the owner of\nyourself.It is a grand thing to protect the rights of others.It is a\nsublime thing to be free and just.Free, Honest Thought\n\nI am going to say what little I can to make the American people brave\nenough and generous enough and kind enough to give everybody else the\nrights they have themselves.Can there ever be any progress in this\nworld to amount to anything until we have liberty?The thoughts of a man\nwho is not free are not worth much--not much.A man who thinks with the\nclub of a creed above his head--a man who thinks casting his eye askance\nat the flames of hell, is not apt to have very good thoughts.And for\nmy part, I would not care to have any status or social position even in\nheaven if I had to admit that I never would have been there only I got\nscared.When we are frightened we do not think very well.If you want to\nget at the honest thoughts of a man he must free.If he is not free you\nwill not get his honest thought.Ingersoll Prefers Shoemakers to Princes\n\nThe other day there came shoemakers, potters, workers in wood and iron,\nfrom Europe, and they were received in the city of New York as though\nthey had been princes.They had been sent by the great republic of\nFrance to examine into the arts and manufactures of the great republic\nof America.They looked a thousand times better to me than the Edward\nAlberts and Albert Edwards--the royal vermin, that live on the body\npolitic.And I would think much more of our government if it would fete\nand feast them, instead of wining and dining the imbeciles of a royal\nline.I never saw a dignified man that was not after all an\nold idiot Dignity is a mask; a dignified man is afraid that you will\nknow he does not know everything.A man of sense and argument is always\nwilling to admit what he don\'t know--why?--because there is so much\nthat he does know; and that is the first step towards learning\nanything--willingness to admit what you don\'t know, and when you don\'t\nunderstand a thing, ask--no matter how small and silly it may look to\nother people--ask, and after that you know.A man never is in a state of\nmind that he can learn until he gets that dignified nonsense out of him.The time is coming when a man will be rated at his real worth, and that\nby his brain and heart.We care nothing now about an officer unless he\nfills his place.The time will come when no matter how much money a man\nhas he will not be respected unless he is using it for the benefit of\nhis fellow-men.Three millions have increased to fifty--thirteen\nStates to thirty-eight.We have better homes, and more of the\nconveniences of life than any other people upon the face of the globe.The farmers of our country live better than did the kings and princes\ntwo hundred years ago--and they have twice as much sense and heart.Remember that the man who acts best his part--who loves\nhis friends the best--is most willing to help others--truest to the\nobligation--who has the best heart--the most feeling--the deepest\nsympathies--and who freely gives to others the rights that he claims for\nhimself, is the true nobleman.We have disfranchised the aristocrats of\nthe air and have given one country to mankind.Wanted!--More Manliness\n\nI had a thousand times rather have a farm and be independent, than to be\nPresident of the United States, without independence, filled with\ndoubt and trembling, feeling of the popular pulse, resorting to art and\nartifice, inquiring about the wind of opinion, and succeeding at last in\nlosing my self-respect without gaining the respect of others.Man needs\nmore manliness, more real independence.This we can do by labor, and in this way we can preserve our\nindependence.We should try and choose that business or profession the\npursuit of which will give us the most happiness.We can be happy without being rich--without holding office--without\nbeing famous.I am not sure that we can be happy with wealth, with\noffice, or with fame.Education of Nature\n\nIt has been a favorite idea with me that our forefathers were educated\nby nature; that they grew grand as the continent upon which they landed;\nthat the great rivers--the wide plains--the splendid lakes--the lonely\nforests--the sublime mountains--that all these things stole into and\nbecame a part of their being, and they grew great as the country in\nwhich they lived.They began to hate the narrow, contracted views of\nEurope.The Worker Wearing the Purple\n\nI want to see a workingman have a good house, painted white, grass in\nthe front yard, carpets on the floor and pictures on the wall.I want to\nsee him a man feeling that he is a king by the divine right of living in\nthe Republic.And every man here is just a little bit a king, you know.Every man here is a part of the sovereign power.Every man wears a\nlittle of purple; every man has a little of crown and a little of\nsceptre; and every man that will sell his vote for money or be ruled by\nprejudice is unfit to be an American citizen.Flowers\n\nBeautify your grounds with plants and flowers and vines.Remember that everything of beauty tends to the elevation of\nman.Every little morning-glory whose purple bosom is thrilled with the\namorous kisses of the sun tends to put a blossom in your heart.Do not\njudge of the value of everything by the market reports.Every flower\nabout a house certifies to the refinement of somebody.Every vine,\nclimbing and blossoming, tells of love and joy.The grave is not a throne, and a corpse is not a king.The living have\na right to control this world.I think a good deal more of to day than\nI do of yesterday, and I think more of to-morrow than I do of this day;\nbecause it is nearly gone--that is the way I feel.The time to be happy\nis now; the way to be happy is to make somebody else happy and the place\nto be happy is here.The School House a Fort\n\nEducation is the most radical thing in the world.To teach the alphabet is to inaugurate a revolution.To build a school\nhouse is to construct a fort.We are Getting Free\n\nWe are getting free.We are\ninvestigating with the microscope and the telescope.We are digging\ninto the earth and finding souvenirs of all the ages.We are finding out\nsomething about the laws of health and disease.We are adding years to\nthe span of human life and we are making the world fit to live in.That is what we are doing, and every man that has an honest thought and\nexpresses it helps, and every man that tries to keep honest thought from\nbeing expressed is an obstruction and a hindrance.The Solid Rock\n\nI have made up my mind that if there is a God He will be merciful to the\nmerciful.That He will forgive the forgiving;\nupon that rock I stand.That every man should be true to himself, and\nthat there is no world, no star, in which honesty is a crime; and upon\nthat rock I stand.An honest man, a good, kind, sweet woman, or a happy\nchild, has nothing to fear, neither in this world nor the world to come;\nand upon that rock I stand.INGERSOLL\'S FIVE GOSPELS\n\n\n\n\n408.The Gospel of Cheerfulness\n\nI believe in the gospel of cheerfulness; the gospel of good nature; in\nthe gospel of good health.Let us pay some attention to our bodies; take\ncare of our bodies, and our souls will take care of themselves.I believe the time will come when the public thought will be so\ngreat and grand that it will be looked upon as infamous to perpetuate\ndisease.I believe the time will come when men will not fill the future\nwith consumption and with insanity.I believe the time will come when\nwith studying ourselves and understanding the laws of health, we will\nsay we are under obligations to put the flags of health in the cheeks of\nour children.Even if I got to Heaven, and had a harp, I would hate to\nlook back upon my children and see them diseased, deformed, crazed, all\nsuffering the penalty of crimes that I had committed.The Gospel of Liberty\n\nAnd I believe, too, in the gospel of liberty,---of giving to others what\nwe claim.And I believe there is room everywhere for thought, and\nthe more liberty you give away the more you will have.In liberty\nextravagance is economy.Let us be just, let us be generous to each\nother.The Gospel of \'Good Living\n\nI believe in the gospel of good living.You cannot make any God happy by\nfasting.Let us have good food, and let us have it well cooked; it is\na thousand times better to know how to cook it than it is to understand\nany theology in the world.I\nbelieve in the gospel of good houses; in the gospel of water and soap.The Gospel of Intelligence\n\nI believe in the gospel of intelligence.That is the only lever capable\nof raising mankind.I believe in the gospel of intelligence; in the\ngospel of education.The school-house is my cathedral; the universe\nis my Bible.And no God can put a man into hell in another world who has\nmade a little heaven in this.God cannot make miserable a man who has\nmade somebody else happy.God can not hate anybody who is capable of\nloving his neighbor.So I believe in this great gospel of generosity.Ah, but they say it won\'t do.My gospel\nof health will prolong life; my gospel of intelligence, my gospel of\nloving, my gospel of good-fellowship will cover the world with happy\nhomes.My doctrine will put carpets upon your floors, pictures upon your\nwalls.My doctrine will put books upon your shelves, ideas in your mind.My doctrine will relieve the world of the abnormal monsters born of the\nignorance of superstition.My doctrine will give us health, wealth, and\nhappiness.The Gospel of Justice\n\nI believe in the gospel of justice,--that we must reap what we sow.Smith, and God forgive me,\nhow does that help Smith?If I by slander cover some poor girl with\nthe leprosy of some imputed crime, and she withers away like a blighted\nflower, and afterwards I get forgiveness, how does that help her?If\nthere is another world, we have got to settle; no bankruptcy court\nthere.Among the ancient Jews if you committed a crime you\nhad to kill a sheep; now they say, "Charge it.For every crime you commit you must answer to yourself and\nto the one you injure.And if you have ever clothed another with\nunhappiness as with a garment cf pain, you will never be quite as\nhappy as though you hadn\'t done that thing.No forgiveness, eternal,\ninexorable, everlasting justice--that is what I believe in.And if it goes hard with me, I will stand it.And I will stick to my\nlogic, and I will bear it like a man.GEMS FROM THE CONTROVERSIAL GASKET\n\n     Latest Utterances of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll,\n     in a Controversy with Judge Jere 8.Black,\n     on "The Christian Religion"\n\n\n\n\n413.The Origin of the Controversy\n\nSeveral months ago, _The North American Review_ asked me to write an\narticle, saying that it would be published if some one would furnish a\nreply.I wrote the article that appeared in the August number, and by\nme it was entitled "Is All of the Bible Inspired?"Not until the\narticle was written did I know who was expected to answer.I make this\nexplanation for the purpose of dissipating the impression that Mr.To have struck his shield with my lance might\nhave given birth to the impression that I was somewhat doubtful as to\nthe correctness of my position.I naturally expected an answer from some\nprofessional theologian, and was surprised to find that a reply had been\nwritten by a "policeman," who imagined that he had answered my arguments\nby simply telling me that my statements were false.It is somewhat\nunfortunate that in a discussion like this any one should resort to the\nslightest personal detraction.The theme is great enough to engage the\nhighest faculties of the human mind, and in the investigation of such a\nsubject vituperation is singularly and vulgarly out of place.Arguments\ncannot be answered with insults.It is unfortunate that the intellectual\narena should be entered by a "policeman," who has more confidence in\nconcussion than discussion.Good nature is often\nmistaken for virtue, and good health sometimes passes for genius.Anger blows out the lamp of the mind.In the examination of a great and\nimportant question, every one should be serene, slow-pulsed, and calm.Black\'s reply, feeling that so\ngrand a subject should not be blown and tainted with malicious words, I\nproceed to answer as best I may the arguments he has urged.Of course it is still claimed that we are a Christian people, indebted\nto something we call Christianity, for all the progress we have made.There is still a vast difference of opinion as to what Christianity\nreally is, although many wavering sects have been discussing that\nquestion, with fire and sword through centuries of creed and crime.Every new sect has been denounced at its birth as illegitimate, as\nsomething born out of orthodox wedlock, and that should have been\nallowed to perish on the steps where it was found.Summary of Evangelical Belief\n\nAmong the evangelical churches there is a substantial agreement\nupon what they consider the fundamental truths of the gospel.These\nfundamental truths, as I understand them, are:--That there is a personal\nGod, the creator of the material universe; that he made man of the dust,\nand woman from part of the man; that the man and woman were tempted by\nthe devil; that they were turned out of the garden of Eden; that, about\nfifteen hundred years afterward, God\'s patience having been exhausted by\nthe wickedness of mankind, He drowned His children, with the exception\nof eight persons; that afterward He selected from their descendants\nAbraham, and through him the Jewish people; that He gave laws to these\npeople, and tried to govern them in all things; that He made known His\nwill in many ways; that He wrought a vast number of miracles; that\nHe inspired men to write the Bible; that, in the fullness of time, it\nhaving been found impossible to reform mankind, this God came upon earth\nas a child born of the Virgin Mary; that He lived in Palestine; that He\npreached for about three years, going from place to place, occasionally\nraising the dead, curing the blind and the halt; that He was\ncrucified--for the crime of blasphemy, as the Jews supposed, but, that\nas a matter of fact, He was offered as a sacrifice for the sins of\nall who might have faith in Him; that He was raised from the dead and\nascended into heaven, where He now is, making intercession for His\nfollowers; that He will forgive the sins of all who believe on Him,\nand that those who do not believe will be consigned to the dungeons of\neternal pain.These--(it may be with the addition of the sacraments of\nBaptism and the Last Supper)--constitute what is generally known as the\nChristian religion.A Profound Change in the World of Thought\n\nA profound change has taken place in the world of thought.The pews are\ntrying to set themselves somewhat above the pulpit.The layman discusses\ntheology with the minister, and smiles.Christians excuse themselves\nfor belonging to the church by denying a part of the creed.The idea\nis abroad that they who know the most of nature believe the least about\ntheology.The sciences are regarded as infidels, and facts as scoffers.Thousands of most excellent people avoid churches, and, with few\nexceptions, only those attend prayer meetings who wish to be alone.The\npulpit is losing because the people are rising.The Believer in the Inspiration of the Bible has too Much to Believe\n\nBut the believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to declare\nthat there was a time when slavery was right--when men could buy and\nwomen sell their babes.He is compelled to insist that there was a time\nwhen polygamy was the highest form of virtue; when wars of extermination\nwere waged with the sword of mercy; when religious toleration was a\ncrime, and when death was the just penalty for having expressed an\nhonest thought.He must maintain that Jehovah is just as bad now as he\nwas four thousand years ago, or that he was just as good then as he is\nnow, but that human conditions have so changed that slavery, polygamy,\nreligious persecutions and wars of conquest are now perfectly devilish.Once they were right--once they were commanded by God himself; now, they\nare prohibited.There has been such a change in the conditions of man\nthat, at the present time, the devil is in favor of slavery, polygamy,\nreligious persecution and wars of conquest.That is to say, the devil\nentertains the same opinion to-day that Jehovah held four thousand\nyears ago, but in the meantime Jehovah has remained exactly the\nsame--changeless and incapable of change.A Frank Admission\n\nIt is most cheerfully admitted that a vast number of people not only\nbelieve these things, but hold them in exceeding reverence, and imagine\nthem to be of the utmost importance to mankind.They regard the Bible as\nthe only light that God has given for the guidance of His children; that\nit is the one star in nature\'s sky--the foundation of all morality, of\nall law, of all order, and of all individual and national progress.They\nregard it as the only means we have for ascertaining the will of God,\nthe origin of man, and the destiny of the soul.The mistake has hindered in countless ways the civilization of\nman.The Bible Should be Better than any other Book\n\nIn all ages of which any record has been preserved, there have been\nthose who gave their ideas of justice, charity, liberty, love, and\nlaw.Now, if the Bible is really the work of God, it should contain the\ngrandest and sublimest truths.It should, in all respects, excel the\nworks of man.Within that book should be found the best and loftiest\ndefinitions of justice; the truest conceptions of human liberty; the\nclearest outlines of duty; the tenderest, the highest, and the noblest\nthoughts,--not that the human mind has produced, but that the human mind\nis capable of receiving.Upon every page should be found the luminous\nevidence of its divine origin.Unless it contains grander and more\nwonderful things than man has written, we are not only justified in\nsaying, but we are compelled to say, that it was written by no being\nsuperior to man.A Serious Charge\n\nThe Bible has been the fortress and the defense of nearly every crime.No civilized country could re-enact its laws.And in many respects its\nmoral code is abhorrent to every good and tender man.It is admitted,\nhowever, that many of its precepts are pure, that many of its laws are\nwise and just, and that many of its statements are absolutely true.If the Bible is Not Verbally Inspired, What Then?It may be said that it is unfair to call attention to certain bad things\nin the Bible, while the good are not so much as mentioned.To this it\nmay be replied that a divine being would not put bad things in a book.Certainly a being of infinite intelligence, power, and goodness could\nnever fall below the ideal of "depraved and barbarous" man.It will not\ndo, after we find that the Bible upholds what we now call crimes, to say\nthat it is not verbally inspired.If the words are not inspired, what\nis?It may be said that the thoughts are inspired.But this would\ninclude only the thoughts expressed without words.If the ideas are\ninspired, they must be contained in and expressed only by inspired\nwords; that is to say, the arrangement of the words, with relation to\neach other, must have been inspired.A Hindu Example\n\nSuppose that we should now discover a Hindu book of equal antiquity with\nthe Old Testament, containing a defense of slavery, polygamy, wars of\nextermination, and religious persecution, would we regard it as evidence\nthat the writers were inspired by an infinitely wise and merciful God?A Test Fairly Applied\n\nSuppose we knew that after "inspired" men had finished the Bible, the\ndevil had got possession of it and wrote a few passages, what part of\nthe sacred Scriptures would Christians now pick out as being probably\nhis work?Which of the following passages would naturally be selected\nas having been written by the devil--"Love thy neighbor as thyself," or\n"Kill all the males among the little ones, and kill every woman; but all\nthe women children keep alive for yourselves?"It will hardly be claimed at this day, that the passages in the\nBible upholding slavery, polygamy, war, and religious persecution are\nevidences of the inspiration of that book.Suppose that there had been\nnothing in the Old Testament upholding these crimes would any modern\nChristian suspect that it was not inspired on account of that omission?Suppose that there had been nothing in the Old Testament but laws in\nfavor of these crimes, would any intelligent Christian now contend that\nit was the work of the true God?Proofs of Civilization\n\nWe know that there was a time in the history of almost every nation when\nslavery, polygamy, and wars of extermination were regarded as divine\ninstitutions; when women were looked upon as beasts of burden, and when,\namong some people, it was considered the duty of the husband to murder\nthe wife for differing with him on the subject of religion.Nations that\nentertain these views to-day are regarded as savage, and, probably, with\nthe exception of the South Sea islanders, the Feejees, some citizens\nof Delaware, and a few tribes in Central Africa, no human beings can be\nfound degraded enough to agree upon these subjects with the Jehovah of\nthe ancient Jews.The only evidence we have, or can have, that a\nnation has ceased to be savage is the fact that it has abandoned these\ndoctrines.To every one, except the theologian, it is perfectly easy to\naccount for the mistakes, atrocities, and crimes of the past, by\nsaying that civilization is a slow and painful growth; that the moral\nperceptions are cultivated through ages of tyranny, of want, of crime,\nand of heroism; that it requires centuries for man to put out the eyes\nof self and hold in lofty and in equal poise the scales of justice;\nthat conscience is born of suffering; that mercy is the child of the\nimagination--of the power to put oneself in the sufferers place, and\nthat man advances only as he becomes acquainted with his surroundings,\nwith the mutual obligations of life, and learns to take advantage of the\nforces of nature.A Persian Gospel\n\nDo not misunderstand me.My position is that the cruel passages in\nthe Old Testament are not inspired; that slavery, polygamy, wars of\nextermination, and religious persecution always have been, are, and\nforever will be, abhorred and cursed by the honest, virtuous, and the\nloving; that the innocent cannot justly suffer for the guilty, and that\nvicarious vice and vicarious virtue are equally absurd; that eternal\npunishment is eternal revenge; that only the natural can happen; that\nmiracles prove the dishonesty of the few and the credulity of the many;\nand that, according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, salvation does not\ndepend upon belief, nor the atonement, nor a "second birth," but that\nthese gospels are in exact harmony with the declaration of the great\nPersian: "Taking the first footstep with the good thought, the second\nwith the good word, and the third with the good deed, I entered\nparadise."The dogmas of the past no longer reach the level of the\nhighest thought, nor satisfy the hunger of the heart.While dusty\nfaiths, embalmed and sepulchered in ancient texts, remain the same,\nthe sympathies of men enlarge; the brain no longer kills its young; the\nhappy lips give liberty to honest thoughts; the mental firmament expands\nand lifts; the broken clouds drift by; the hideous dreams, the foul,\nmisshapen children of the monstrous night, dissolve and fade.Man the Author of all Books\n\nSo far as we know, man is the author of all books.If a book had been\nfound on the earth by the first man, he might have regarded it as the\nwork of God; but as men were here a good while before any books were\nfound, and as man has produced a great many books, the probability is\nthat the Bible is no exception.God and Brahma\n\nCan we believe that God ever said of any: "Let his children be\nfatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be continually\nvagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate\nplaces; let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the stranger\nspoil his labor, let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let\nthere be any to favor his fatherless children."If he ever said these\nwords, surely he had never heard this line, this strain of music, from\nthe Hindu: "Sweet is the lute to those who have not heard the prattle of\ntheir own children."Jehovah, "from the clouds and darkness of Sinai,"\nsaid to the Jews: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me.... Thou\nshalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy\nGod am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the\nchildren, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."Contrast this with the words put by the Hindu in the mouth of Brahma:\n"I am the same to all mankind.They who honestly serve other gods,\ninvoluntarily worship me.I am he who partaketh of all worship, and I\nam the reward of all worshipers."The first, a\ndungeon where crawl the things begot of jealous slime; the other, great\nas the domed firmament inlaid with suns.Matthew, Mark, and Luke\n\nAnd I here take occasion to say, that with most of the teachings of the\ngospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke I most heartily agree.The miraculous\nparts must, of course, be thrown aside.I admit that the necessity of\nbelief, the atonement, and the scheme of salvation are all set forth\nin the Gospel of John,--a gospel, in my opinion, not written until long\nafter the others.Christianity Takes no Step in Advance\n\nAll the languages of the world have not words of horror enough to\npaint the agonies of man when the church had power.Tiberius, Caligula,\nClaudius, Nero, Domitian, and Commodus were not as cruel, false,\nand base as many of the Christian Popes.Opposite the names of these\nimperial criminals write John the XII., Leo the VIII., Boniface the VII.,\nBenedict the IX., Innocent the III., and Alexander the VI.Was it under\nthese pontiffs that the "church penetrated the moral darkness like a\nnew sun," and covered the globe with institutions of mercy?Rome was far\nbetter when Pagan than when Catholic.It was better to allow gladiators\nand criminals to fight than to burn honest men.The greatest of Romans\ndenounced the cruelties of the arena.Seneca condemned the combats even\nof wild beasts.He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond\nof sympathy for all sentiment beings, knowing that only the depraved\nand base take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering."Aurelius\ncompelled the gladiators to fight with blunted swords.Roman lawyers\ndeclared that all men are by nature free and equal.Woman, under Pagan\nrule in Rome, become as free as man.Zeno, long before the birth of\nChrist, taught that virtue alone establishes a difference between men.We know that the Civil Law is the foundation of our codes.We know that\nfragments of Greek and Roman art--a few manuscripts saved from Christian\ndestruction, some inventions and discoveries of the Moors--were the\nseeds of modern civilization.Christianity, for a thousand years,\ntaught memory to forget and reason to believe.Not one step was taken in\nadvance.Over the manuscripts of philosophers and poets, priests, with\ntheir ignorant tongues thrust out, devoutly scrawled the forgeries of\nfaith.Christianity a Mixture of Good and Evil\n\nMr.Black attributes to me the following expression: "Christianity is\npernicious in its moral effect, darkens the mind, narrows the soul,\narrests the progress of human society, and hinders civilization."Strange, that he is only able to answer what I did\nnot say.I endeavored to show that the passages in the Old Testament\nupholding slavery, polygamy, wars of extermination, and religious\nintolerance had filled the world with blood and crime.I admitted\nthat there are many wise and good things in the Old Testament.I also\ninsisted that the doctrine of the atonement--that is to say, of moral\nbankruptcy--the idea that a certain belief is necessary to salvation,\nand the frightful dogma of eternal pain, had narrowed the soul, had\ndarkened the mind, and had arrested the progress of human society.Like\nother religions, Christianity is a mixture of good and evil.The church\nhas made more orphans than it has fed.It has never built asylums enough\nto hold the insane of its own making.Jehovah, Epictetus and Cicero\n\nIf the Bible is really inspired, Jehovah commanded the Jewish people to\nbuy the children of the strangers that sojourned among them, and ordered\nthat the children thus bought should be an inheritance for the children\nof the Jews, and that they should be bondmen and bondwomen forever.Yet\nEpictetus, a man to whom no revelation was ever made, a man whose soul\nfollowed only the light of nature, and who had never heard of the Jewish\nGod, was great enough to say: "Will you not remember that your servants\nare by nature your brothers, the children of God?In saying that you\nhave bought them, you look down on the earth and into the pit, on the\nwretched law of men long since dead,--but you see not the laws of the\nGods."We find that Jehovah, speaking to his chosen people, assured them\nthat their bondmen and bondmaids must be "of the heathen that were\nround about them.""Of them," said Jehovah, "shall ye buy bondmen\nand bondmaids."And yet Cicero, a pagan, Cicero, who had never been\nenlightened by reading the Old Testament, had the moral grandeur to\ndeclare: "They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens, but not\nforeigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which\nbenevolence and justice would perish forever."The Atonement\n\nIn countless ways the Christian world has endeavored, for nearly two\nthousand years, to explain the atonement, and every effort has ended in\nan an mission that it cannot be understood, and a declaration that it\nmust be believed.Is it not immoral to teach that man can sin, that he\ncan harden his heart and pollute his soul, and that, by repenting\nand believing something that he does not comprehend, he can avoid the\nconsequences of his crimes?Has the promise and hope of forgiveness ever\nprevented the commission of a sin?Should men be taught that sin gives\nhappiness here; that they ought to bear the evils of a virtuous life in\nthis world for the sake of joy in the next; that they can repent between\nthe last sin and the last breath; that after repentance every stain\nof the soul is washed away by the innocent blood of another; that the\nserpent of regret will not hiss in the ear of memory; that the saved\nwill not even pity the victims of their own crimes; that the goodness\nof another can be transferred to them; and that sins forgiven cease to\naffect the unhappy wretches sinned against?Sin as a Debt\n\nThe Church says that the sinner is in debt to God, and that the\nobligation is discharged by the Saviour.The best that can possibly be\nsaid of such a transaction is, that the debt is transferred, not paid.The truth is, that a sinner is in debt to the person he has injured.If a man injures his neighbor, it is not enough for him to get the\nforgiveness of God, but he must have the forgiveness of his neighbor.If a man puts his hand in the fire and God forgives him, his hand will\nsmart exactly the same.You must, after all, reap what you sow.No god\ncan give you wheat when you sow tares, and no devil can give you tares\nwhen you sow wheat.The Logic of the Coffin\n\nAs to the doctrine of the atonement, Mr.Black has nothing to offer\nexcept the barren statement that it is believed by the wisest and the\nbest.A Mohammedan, speaking in Constantinople, will say the same of the\nKoran.A Brahman, in a Hindu temple, will make the same remark, and so\nwill the American Indian, when he endeavors to enforce something upon\nthe young of his tribe.He will say: "The best, the greatest of our\ntribe have believed in this."This is the argument of the cemetery, the\nphilosophy of epitaphs, the logic of the coffin.We are the greatest and\nwisest and most virtuous of mankind?This statement, that it has been\nbelieved by the best, is made in connection with an admission that it\ncannot be fathomed by the wisest.It is not claimed that a thing is\nnecessarily false because it is not understood, but I do claim that\nit is not necessarily true because it cannot be comprehended.I still\ninsist that "the plan of redemption," as usually preached, is absurd,\nunjust, and immoral.Judas Iscariot\n\nFor nearly two thousand years Judas Iscariot has been execrated by\nmankind; and yet, if the doctrine of the atonement is true, upon his\ntreachery hung the plan of salvation.Suppose Judas had known of this\nplan--known that he was selected by Christ for that very purpose, that\nChrist was depending on him.And suppose that he also knew that only\nby betraying Christ could he save either himself or others; what ought\nJudas to have done?Are you willing to rely upon an argument that\njustifies the treachery of that wretch?The Standard of Right\n\nAccording to Mr.Black, the man who does not believe in a supreme being\nacknowledges no standard of right and wrong in this world, and therefore\ncan have no theory of rewards and punishments in the next.Is it\npossible that only those who believe in the God who persecuted for\nopinion\'s sake have any standard of right and wrong?Were the greatest\nmen of all antiquity without this standard?In the eyes of intelligent\nmen of Greece and Rome, were all deeds, whether good or evil, morally\nalike?Is it necessary to believe in the existence of an infinite\nintelligence before you can have any standard of right and wrong?Is it\npossible that a being cannot be just or virtuous unless he believes in\nsome being infinitely superior to himself?If this doctrine be true, how\ncan God be just or virtuous?Does He believe in some being superior to\nhimself?If man were incapable of suffering, if man could not\nfeel pain, the word "conscience" never would have passed his lips.The\nman who puts himself in the place of another, whose imagination has been\ncultivated to the point of feeling the agonies suffered by another, is\nthe man of conscience.Black says, "We have neither jurisdiction or capacity to rejudge\nthe justice of God."In other words, we have no right to think upon\nthis subject, no right to examine the questions most vitally affecting\nhuman-kind.We are simply to accept the ignorant statements of barbarian\ndead.This question cannot be settled by saying that "it would be a\nmere waste of time and space to enumerate the proofs which show that the\nuniverse was created by a pre-existent and self-conscious being."The\ntime and space should have been "wasted," and the proofs should have\nbeen enumerated.These "proofs" are what the wisest and greatest are\ntrying to find.It cares nothing\nfor the opinions of the "great," nothing for the prejudices of the many,\nand least of all, for the superstitions of the dead.In the world of\nscience--a fact is a legal tender.Assertions and miracles are base and\nspurious coins.We have the right to rejudge the justice even of a god.No one should throw away his reason--the fruit of all experience.It is\nthe intellectual capital of the soul, the only light, the only guide,\nand without it the brain becomes the palace of an idiot king, attended\nby a retinue of thieves and hypocrites.The Liberty of the Bible\n\nThis is the religious liberty of the Bible.If you had lived in\nPalestine, and if the wife of your bosom, dearer to you than your\nown soul, had said: "I like the religion of India better than that of\nPalestine," it would have been your duty to kill her."Your eye must not\npity her, your hand must be first upon her, and afterwards the hand of\nall the people."If she had said: "Let us worship the sun--the sun that\nclothes the earth in garments of green--the sun, the great fireside of\nthe world--the sun that covers the hills and valleys with flowers--that\ngave me your face, and made it possible for me to look into the eyes\nof my babe,--let us worship the sun," it was your duty to kill her.You\nmust throw the first stone, and when against her bosom--a bosom filled\nwith love for you--you had thrown the jagged and cruel rock, and had\nseen the red stream of her life oozing from the dumb lips of death,\nyou could then look up and receive the congratulations of the God whose\ncommandment you had obeyed.Is it possible that a being of infinite\nmercy ordered a husband to kill his wife for the crime of having\nexpressed, an opinion on the subject of religion?Has there been found\nupon the records of the savage world anything more perfectly fiendish\nthan this commandment of Jehovah?This is justified on the ground that\n"blasphemy was a breach of political allegiance, and idolatry an act of\novert treason."We can understand how a human king stands in need of the\nservice of his people.We can understand how the desertion of any of\nhis soldiers weakens his army; but were the king infinite in power,\nhis strength would still remain the same, and under no conceivable\ncircumstances could the enemy triumph.Slavery in Heaven\n\nAccording to Mr.Black, there will be slavery in Heaven, and fast by\nthe throne of God will be the auction-block, and the streets of the New\nJerusalem will be adorned with the whipping-post, while the music of\nthe harp will be supplemented by the crack of the driver\'s whip.Black, "incorporate him into his family,\ntame him, teach him to think, and give him a knowledge of the true\nprinciples of human liberty and government, he would confer upon him a\nmost beneficent boon."Black is too late with his protest against\nthe freedom of his fellow-men.Liberty is making the tour of the world.Russia has emancipated her serfs; the slave trade is prosecuted only\nby thieves and pirates; Spain feels upon her cheek the burning blush\nof shame; Brazil, with proud and happy eyes, is looking for the dawn of\nfreedom\'s day; the people of the South rejoice that slavery is no more,\nand every good and honest man (excepting Mr.Black) of every land and\nclime hopes that the limbs of men will never feel again the weary weight\nof chains.Jehovah Breaking His Own Laws\n\nA very curious thing about these Commandments is that their supposed\nauthor violated nearly every one.From Sinai, according to the account,\nHe said: "Thou shalt not kill," and yet He ordered the murder of\nmillions; "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and He gave captured maidens\nto gratify the lust of captors; "Thou shalt not steal," and yet He gave\nto Jewish marauders the flocks and herds of others; "Thou shalt not\ncovet thy neighbor\'s house, nor his wife," and yet He allowed His chosen\npeople to destroy the homes of neighbors and to steal their wives;\n"Honor thy father and mother," and yet this same God had thousands of\nfathers butchered, and with the sword of war killed children yet unborn;\n"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," and yet\nHe sent abroad "lying spirits" to deceive His own prophets, and in a\nhundred ways paid tribute to deceit.So far as we know, Jehovah kept\nonly one of these Commandments--He worshiped no other god.I know as little as anyone else about the "pla" of the universe; and as\nto the "design," I know just as little.It will not do to say that the\nuniverse was designed, and therefore there must be a designer.There\nmust first be proof that it was "designed."It will not do to say that\nthe universe has a "plan," and then assert that there must have been an\ninfinite maker.The idea that a design must have a beginning, and that a\ndesigner need not, is a simple expression of human ignorance.We find\na watch, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a thing must have had a\nmaker."We find the watchmaker, and we say: "So curious and wonderful a\nthing as man must have had a maker."We find God and we then say: "He is\nso wonderful that he must _not_ have had a maker."In other words, all\nthings a little wonderful must have been created, but it is possible for\nsomething to be so wonderful that it always existed.One would suppose\nthat just as the wonder increased the necessity for a creator increased,\nbecause it is the wonder of the thing that suggests the idea of\ncreation.Is it possible that a designer exists from all eternity\nwithout design?Was there no design in having an infinite designer?For\nme, it is hard to see the plan or design in earthquakes and pestilences.It is somewhat difficult to discern the design or the benevolence in so\nmaking the world that billions of animals live only on the agonies of\nothers.The justice of God is not visible to me in the history of this\nworld.When I think of the suffering and death, of the poverty and\ncrime, of the cruelty and malice, of the heartlessness of this "design"\nand "plan," where beak and claw and tooth tear and rend the quivering\nflesh of weakness and despair, I cannot convince myself that it is the\nresult of infinite wisdom, benevolence, and justice.What we Know of the Infinite\n\nOf course, upon a question like this, nothing can be absolutely known.We live on an atom called Earth, and what we know of the infinite is\nalmost infinitely limited; but, little as we know, all have an equal\nright to give their honest thought.Life is a shadowy, strange,\nand winding road on which we travel for a little way--a few short\nsteps--just from the cradle, with its lullaby of love, to the low and\nquiet wayside inn, where all at last must sleep, and where the only\nsalutation is--Good-night.The Universe Self-Existent\n\nThe universe, according to my idea, is, always was, and forever will\nbe.It did not "come into being;" it is the one eternal being--the only\nthing that ever did, does, or can exist.We know nothing of what we call the laws of Nature except as we gather\nthe idea of law from the uniformity of phenomena springing from like\nconditions.To make myself clear: Water always runs down hill.The\ntheist says that this happens because there is behind the phenomenon an\nactive law.As a matter of fact law is this side of the phenomenon.Law\ndoes not cause the phenomenon, but the phenomenon causes the idea of law\nin our minds, and this idea is produced from the fact that under like\ncircumstances the same phenomena always happens.Black probably\nthinks that the difference in the weight of rocks and clouds was created\nby law; that parallel lines fail to imite only because it is illegal;\nthat diameter and circumference could have been so made that it would\nbe a greater distance across than around a circle, that a straight line\ncould inclose a triangle if not prevented by law, and that a little\nlegislation could make it possible for two bodies to occupy the same\nspace at the same time.It seems to me that law can not be the cause of\nphenomena, but it is an effect produced in our minds by their succession\nand resemblance.To put a God back of the universe compels us to admit\nthat there was a time when nothing existed except this God; that this\nGod had lived from eternity in an infinite vacuum and in an absolute\nidleness.The mind of every thoughtful man is forced to one of these two\nconclusions, either that the universe is self-existent or that it\nwas created by a self-existent being.To my mied there are far more\ndifficulties in the second hypothesis than in the first.Jehovah\'s Promise Broken\n\nIf Jehovah was in fact God, He knew the end from the beginning.He knew\nthat his Bible would be a breastwork behind which tyranny and hypocrisy\nwould crouch; that it would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the\ndefense of robbers called kings and of hypocrites called priests.He\nknew that He had taught the Jewish people but little of importance.He\nknew that He found them free and left them captives.He knew that He\nhad never fulfilled the promises made to them.He knew that while other\nnations had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage\nstill.He promised them the world, and gave them a desert.He promised\nthem liberty, and He made them slaves.He promised them victory, and He\ngave them defeat.He said they should be kings, and He made them\nserfs.He promised them universal empire, and gave them exile.When one\nfinishes the Old Testament, he is compelled to say: Nothing can add to\nthe misery of a nation whose King is Jehovah!Character Bather than Creed\n\nFor a thousand years the torch of progress was extinguished in the blood\nof Christ, and His disciples, moved by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel\ncreeds, destroyed with flame and sword a hundred millions of their\nfellow-men.But if cathedrals had been\nuniversities--if dungeons of the Inquisition had been laboratories--if\nChristians had believed in character instead of creed--if they had taken\nfrom the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and absurd--if\ndomes of temples had been observatories--if priests had been\nphilosophers--if missionaries had taught the useful arts--if astrology\nhad been astronomy--if the black art had been chemistry--if superstition\nhad been science--if religion had been humanity--it would have been a\nheaven filled with love, with liberty, and joy.Mohammed the Prophet of God\n\nMohammed was a poor man, a driver of camels.He was without education,\nwithout influence, and without wealth, and yet in a few years he\nconsolidated thousands of tribes, and millions of men confess that there\nis "one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."His success was a thousand\ntimes greater during his life than that of Christ.He was not crucified;\nhe was a conqueror."Of all men, he exercised the greatest influence\nupon the human race."Never in the world\'s history did a religion\nspread with the rapidity of his.It burst like a storm over the fairest\nportions of the globe.Black is right in his position that\nrapidity is secured only by the direct aid of the Divine Being,\nthen Mohammed was most certainly the prophet of God.As to wars of\nextermination and slavery, Mohammed agreed with Mr.Black, and upon\npolygamy with Jehovah.As to religious toleration, he was great enough\nto say that "men holding to any form of faith might be saved, provided\nthey were virtuous."In this he was far in advance both of Jehovah and\nMr.Wanted!--A Little More Legislation\n\nWe are informed by Mr.Black that "polygamy is neither commanded or\nprohibited in the Old Testament--that it is only discouraged."It seems\nto me that a little legislation on that subject might have tended to its\n"discouragement."Black assures us "consists of certain immutable rules to govern the\nconduct of all men at all times and at all places in their private and\npersonal relations with others," not one word is found on the subject of\npolygamy.There is nothing "discouraging" in the Ten Commandments, nor\nin the records of any conversation Jehovah is claimed to have had with\nMoses upon Sinai.The life of Abraham, the story of Jacob and Laban,\nthe duty of a brother to be the husband of the widow of his deceased\nbrother, the life of David, taken in connection with the practice of\none who is claimed to have been the wisest of men--all these things are\nprobably relied on to show that polygamy was at least "discouraged."Certainly Jehovah had time to instruct Moses as to the infamy of\npolygamy.He could have spared a few moments from a description of\npatterns of tongs and basins for a subject so important as this.A\nfew-words in favor of the one wife and one husband--in favor of the\nvirtuous and loving home--might have taken the place of instructions\nas to cutting the garments of priests and fashioning candlesticks and\nounces of gold.If he had left out simply the order that rams\' skins\nshould be dyed red, and in its place had said, "A man shall have but one\nwife, and the wife but one husband," how much better it would have been.Again, it is urged that "the acceptance of Christianity by a large\nportion of the generation contemporary with its Founder and His\nApostles, was under the circumstances, an adjudication as solemn and\nauthoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."If this is true,\nthen "the acceptance of Buddhism by a large portion of the generation\ncontemporary with its Founder was an adjudication as solemn and\nauthoritative as mortal intelligence could pronounce."The same could\nbe said of Mohammedanism, and, in fact, of every religion that has\never benefited or cursed this world.This argument, when reduced to its\nsimplest form, is this: All that succeeds is inspired.The Morality in Christianity\n\nThe morality in Christianity has never opposed the freedom of thought.It has never put, nor tended to put, a chain on a human mind, nor a\nmanacle on a human limb; but the doctrines distinctively Christian--the\nnecessity of believing a certain thing; the idea that eternal punishment\nawaited him who failed to believe; the idea that the innocent can suffer\nfor the guilty--these things have |opposed, and for a thousand years\nsubstantially destroyed the freedom of the human mind.All religions\nhave, with ceremony, magic, and mystery, deformed, darkened, and\ncorrupted, the soul.Around the sturdy oaks of morality have grown and\nclung the parasitic, poisonous vines of the miraculous and monstrous.Irenaeus assures us that all Christians possessed the power of\nworking miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the\nsick, and even raised the dead.Epiphanius asserts that some rivers\nand fountains were annually transmuted into wine, in attestation of the\nmiracle of Cana, adding that he himself had drunk of these fountains.Augustine declares that one was told in a dream where the bones of\nSt.Stephen were buried and the bones were thus discovered and brought\nto Hippo, and that they raised five dead persons to life, and that in\ntwo years seventy miracles were performed with these relics.Justin\nMartyr states that God once sent some angels to guard the human race,\nthat these angels fell in love with the daughters of men, and became the\nfathers of innumerable devils.For hundreds of years miracles were\nabout the only things that happened.They were wrought by thousands of\nChristians, and testified to by millions.The saints and martyrs, the\nbest and greatest, were the witnesses and workers of wonders.Even\nheretics, with the assistance of the devil, could suspend the "laws\nof nature."Must we believe these wonderful accounts because they were\nwritten by "good men," by Christians," who made their statements in the\npresence and expectation of death"?The truth is that these "good men"\nwere mistaken.They fed their minds on prodigies, and their imaginations\nfeasted on effects without causes.Doubts were regarded as "rude disturbers of the congregation."Credulity\nand sanctity walked hand in hand.As the philosophy of the ancients was rendered almost worthless by the\ncredulity of the common people, so the proverbs of Christ, his religion\nof forgiveness, his creed of kindness, were lost in the mist of miracle\nand the darkness of superstition.The Honor Due to Christ\n\nFor the man Christ--for the reformer who loved his fellow-men--for the\nman who believed in an Infinite Father, who would shield the innocent\nand protect the just--for the martyr who expected to be rescued from the\ncruel cross, and who at last, finding that his rope was dust, cried out\nin the gathering gloom of death; "My God!--for that great and suffering man, mistaken though he was, I have\nthe highest admiration and respect.That man did not, as I believe,\nclaim a miraculous origin; he did not pretend to heal the sick nor raise\nthe dead.He claimed simply to be a man, and taught his fellow-men\nthat love is stronger far than hate.His life was written by reverent\nignorance.Loving credulity belittled his career with feats of jugglery\nand magic art, and priests wishing to persecute and slay, put in his\nmouth the words of hatred and revenge.The theological Christ is the\nimpossible union of the human and divine--man with the attributes of\nGod, and God with the limitations and weakness of man.Christianity has no Monopoly in Morals\n\nThe morality of the world is not distinctively Christian.Zoroaster,\nGautama, Mohammed, Confucius, Christ, and, in fact, all founders of\nreligions, have said to their disciples: You must not steal; You must\nnot murder; You must not bear false witness; You must discharge your\nobligations.Christianity is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the\nmiraculous origin of Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, his resurrection,\nhis ascension, the inspiration of the Bible, the doctrine of the\natonement, and the necessity of belief.Buddhism is the ordinary moral\ncode, _plus_ the miraculous illumination of Buddha, the performance of\ncertain ceremonies, a belief in the transmigration of the soul, and\nin the final absorption of the human by the infinite.The religion of\nMohammed is the ordinary moral code, _plus_ the belief that Mohammed\nwas the prophet of God, total abstinence from the use of intoxicating\ndrinks, a harem for the faithful here and hereafter, ablutions, prayers,\nalms, pilgrimages, and fasts.Old Age in Superstition\'s Lap\n\nAnd here I take occasion to thank Mr.Black for having admitted that\nJehovah gave no commandment against the practice of polygamy, that he\nestablished slavery, waged wars of extermination, and persecuted for\nopinions\' sake even unto death, Most theologians endeavor to putty,\npatch, and paint the wretched record of inspired crime, but Mr.Black\nhas been bold enough and honest enough to admit the truth.In this age\nof fact and demonstration it is refreshing to find a man who believes\nso thoroughly in the monstrous and miraculous, the impossible and\nimmoral--who still clings lovingly to the legends of the bib and\nrattle--who through the bitter experiences of a wicked world has kept\nthe credulity of the cradle, and finds comfort and joy in thinking about\nthe Garden of Eden, the subtile serpent, the flood, and Babel\'s tower,\nstopped by the jargon of a thousand tongues--who reads with happy eyes\nthe story of the burning brimstone storm that fell upon the cities\nof the plain, and smilingly explains the transformation of the\nretrospective Mrs.Lot--who laughs at Egypt\'s plagues and Pharaoh\'s\nwhelmed and drowning hosts--eats manna with the wandering Jews, warms\nhimself at the burning bush, sees Korah\'s company by the hungry earth\ndevoured, claps his wrinkled hands with glee above the heathens\'\nbutchered babes, and longingly looks back to the patriarchal days of\nconcubines and slaves.How touching when the learned and wise crawl back\nin cribs and ask to hear the rhymes and fables once again!How charming\nin these hard and scientific times to see old age in Superstition\'s lap,\nwith eager lips upon her withered breast!Ararat in Chicago\n\nA little while ago, in the city of Chicago, a gentleman addressed a\nnumber of Sunday-school children.In his address he stated that some\npeople were wicked enough to deny the story of the deluge; that he was\na traveler; that he had been to the top of Mount Ararat, and had brought\nwith him a stone from that sacred locality.The children were then\ninvited to form in procession and walk by the pulpit, for the purpose of\nseeing this wonderful stone.After they had looked at it, the lecturer\nsaid: "Now, children, if you ever hear anybody deny the story of the\ndeluge, or say that the ark did not rest on Mount Ararat, you can tell\nthem that you know better, because you have seen with your own eyes a\nstone from that very mountain."How Gods and Devils are Made\n\nIt was supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be\nflattered; that he delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier\nthan to see ignorant faith upon its knees; that above all things he\nhated and despised doubters and heretics, and regarded investigation as\nrebellion.Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God\nwere converted or killed.To allow a heretic to live in peace was\nto invite the wrath of God.Every public evil--every misfortune--was\naccounted for by something the community had permitted or done.When\nepidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the\nheretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the anger of God.By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced.By\nputting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created.Leave this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.If not a\nhuman being existed, the sun would continue to shine, and tempest now\nand then would devastate the earth; the rain would fall in pleasant\nshowers; violets would spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, the\nearthquake would devour, birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and\nroses blush, and volcanoes fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the\nprocession of the seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine\nas serenely as though the world were filled with loving hearts and happy\nhomes.The Romance of Figures\n\nHow long, according to the universal benevolence of the New Testament,\ncan a man be reasonably punished in the next world for failing to\nbelieve something unreasonable in this?Can it be possible that any\npunishment can endure forever?Suppose that every flake of snow that\never fell was a figure nine, and that the first flake was multiplied by\nthe second, and that product by the third, and so on to the last flake.And then suppose that this total should be multiplied by every drop of\nrain that ever fell, calling each drop a figure nine; and that total by\neach blade of grass that ever helped to weave a carpet for the earth,\ncalling each blade a figure nine; and that again by every grain of sand\non every shore, so that the grand total would make a line of nines so\nlong that it would require millions upon millions of years for light,\ntraveling at the rate of one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles per\nsecond, to reach the end.And suppose, further, that each unit in this\nalmost infinite total, stood for billions of ages--still that vast and\nalmost endless time, measured by all the years beyond, is as one flake,\none drop, one leaf, one blade, one grain, compared with all the flakes,\nand drops, and leaves, and blades and grains.Upon love\'s breast the\nChurch has placed the eternal asp.And yet, in the same book in which is\ntaught this most infamous of doctrines, we are assured that "The Lord is\ngood to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works."God and Zeno\n\nIf the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said:\n"And if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under\nhis hand, he shall be surely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue\na day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."And yet\nZeno, founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted\nthat no man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad,\nwhether the slave had become so by conquest, or by purchase.Jehovah,\nordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this\ncommand: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt\nsmite them and utterly destroy them."And yet Epictetus, whom we have\nalready quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human\nconduct: "Live with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors\nlive with thee."If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.Before him, like a\npanorama, moved the history yet to be.He knew exactly how his words\nwould be interpreted.He knew what crimes, what horrors, what infamies,\nwould be committed in his name.He knew that the fires of persecution\nwould climb around the limbs of countless martyrs.He knew that brave\nmen would languish in dungeons, in darkness, filled with pain; that the\nchurch would use instruments of torture, that his followers would appeal\nto whip and chain.He must have seen the horizon of the future red with\nthe flames of the _auto da fe_.He knew all the creeds that would spring\nlike poison fungi from every text.He saw the sects waging war against\neach other.He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,\nbuilding dungeons for their fellow-men.He heard the groans, saw the faces white with agony, the tears,\nthe blood--heard the shrieks and sobs of all the moaning, martyred\nmultitudes.He knew that commentaries would be written on his words with\nswords, to be read by the light of fagots.He knew that the Inquisition\nwould be born of teachings attributed to him.He saw all the\ninterpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and tell.He\nknew that above these fields of death, these dungeons, these burnings,\nfor a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the cross.He\nknew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh, that\ncradles would be robbed and women\'s breasts unbabed for gold;--and yet\nhe died with voiceless lips.Why did he not\ntell his disciples, and through them the world, that man should not\npersecute, for opinion\'s sake, his fellow-man?Why did he not cry, You\nshall not persecute in my name; you shall not burn and torment those who\ndiffer from you in creed?Why did he not plainly say, I am the Son of\nGod?Why did he not explain the doctrine of the trinity?Why did he not\ntell the manner of baptism that was pleasing to him?Why did he not say\nsomething positive, definite, and satisfactory about another world?Why\ndid he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven to the glad knowledge\nof another life?Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to\nmisery and to doubt?The Philosophy of Action\n\nConsequences determine the quality of an action.If consequences are\ngood, so is the action.If actions had no consequences, they would be\nneither good nor bad.Man did not get his knowledge of the consequences\nof actions from God, but from experience and reason.If man can, by\nactual experiment, discover the right and wrong of actions, is it not\nutterly illogical to declare that they who do not believe in God can\nhave no standard of right and wrong?Consequences are the standard by\nwhich actions are judged.They are the children that testify as to the\nreal character of their parents.God or no God, larceny is the enemy of\nindustry--industry is the mother of prosperity--prosperity is a good,\nand therefore larceny is an evil.God or no God, murder is a crime.There has always been a law against larceny, because the laborer wishes\nto enjoy the fruit of his toil.As long as men object to being killed,\nmurder will be illegal.I have insisted, and I still insist, that it is still impossible for\na finite man to commit a crime deserving infinite punishment; and upon\nthis subject Mr.Black admits that "no revelation has lifted the veil\nbetween time and eternity;" and, consequently, neither the priest nor\nthe "policeman" knows anything with certainty regarding another world.He simply insists that "in shadowy figures we are warned that a very\nmarked distinction will be made between the good and bad in the next\nworld."There is "a very marked distinction" in this; but there is this\nrainbow in the darkest human cloud: The worst have hope of reform.All I\ninsist is, if there is another life, the basest soul that finds its way\nto that dark or radiant shore will have the everlasting chance of\ndoing right.Nothing but the most cruel ignorance, the most heartless\nsuperstition, the most ignorant theology, ever imagined that the\nfew days of human life spent here, surrounded by mists and clouds of\ndarkness, blown over life\'s sea by storms and tempests of passion, fixed\nfor all eternity the condition of the human race.If this doctrine be\ntrue, this life is but a net, in which Jehovah catches souls for hell.We are told that "there is no good reason to doubt that the statements\nof the Evangelists, as we have them now, are genuine."The fact is, no\none knows who made the "statements of the Evangelists."There are three\nimportant manuscripts upon which the Christian world relies."The first\nappeared in the catalogue of the Vatican, in 1475.Of the New, it contains the four gospels,--the Acts, the\nseven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the\nEpistle to the Hebrews, so far as the fourteenth verse of the ninth\nchapter,"--and nothing more."The\nsecond, the Alexandrine, was presented to King Charles the First, in\n1628.It contains the Old and New Testaments, with some exceptions;\npassages are wanting in Matthew, in John, and in II.It\nalso contains the Epistle of Clemens Romanus, a letter of Athanasius,\nand the treatise of Eusebius on the Psalms."The last is the Sinaitic\nCodex, discovered about 1850, at the Convent of St."It contains the Old and New Testaments, and in addition\nthe entire Epistle of Barnabas, and a portion of the Shepherd of\nHennas--two books which, up to the beginning of the fourth century, were\nlooked upon by many as Scripture."In this manuscript, or codex, the\ngospel of St.Mark concludes with the eighth verse of the sixteenth\nchapter, leaving out the frightful passage: "Go ye into all the world,\nand preach the gospel to every creature.He that believeth and is\nbaptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."In\nmatters of the utmost importance these manuscripts disagree, but even if\nthey all agreed it would not furnish the slightest evidence of their\ntruth.It will not do to call the statements made in the gospels\n"depositions," until it is absolutely established who made them, and the\ncircumstances under which they were made.Neither can we say that "they\nwere made in the immediate prospect of death," until we know who made\nthem.It is absurd to say that "the witnesses could not have been\nmistaken, because the nature of the facts precluded the possibility of\nany delusion about them."Can it be pretended that the witnesses could\nnot have been mistaken about the relation the Holy Ghost is alleged to\nhave sustained to Jesus Christ?Is there no possibility of delusion\nabout a circumstance of that kind?Did the writers of the four gospels\nhave "the sensible and true avouch of their own eyes and ears" in that\nbehalf?How was it possible for any one of the four Evangelists to know\nthat Christ was the Son of God, or that he was God?Matthew says that an angel of the Lord told\nJoseph in a dream, but Joseph never wrote an account of this wonderful\nvision.Luke tells us that the angel had a conversation with Mary, and\nthat Mary told Elizabeth, but Elizabeth never wrote a word.There is no\naccount of Mary, or Joseph, or Elizabeth, or the angel, having had any\nconversation with Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, in which one word was\nsaid about the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ.The persons who knew\ndid not write, so that the account is nothing but hearsay.Black pretend that such statements would be admitted as evidence in any\ncourt?But how do we know that the disciples of Christ wrote a word of\nthe gospels?How do we know\nthat the writers of the gospels "were men of unimpeachable character?"Black\'s Admission\n\nFor the purpose of defending the character of his infallible God, Mr.Black is forced to defend religious intolerance, wars of extermination,\nhuman slavery, and almost polygamy.He admits that God established\nslavery; that he commanded his chosen people to buy the children of the\nheathen; that heathen fathers and mothers did right to sell their girls\nand boys; that God ordered the Jews to wage wars of extermination and\nconquest; that it was right to kill the old and young; that God forged\nmanacles for the human brain; that he commanded husbands to murder their\nwives for suggesting the worship of the sun or moon; and that every\ncruel, savage passage in the Old Testament was inspired by him.Such is\na "policeman\'s" view of God.The Stars Upon the Door of France\n\nMr.Black justifies all the crimes and horrors, excuses all the tortures\nof all the Christian years, by denouncing the cruelties of the French\nRevolution.Thinking people will not hasten to admit that an infinitely\ngood being authorized slavery in Judea, because of the atrocities of the\nFrench Revolution.They will remember the sufferings of the Huguenots.They will not forget\nthe countless cruelties of priest and king.They will not forget the\ndungeons of the Bastile.They will know that the Revolution was an\neffect, and that liberty was not the cause--that atheism was not the\ncause.Behind the Revolution they will see altar and throne--sword and\nfagot--palace and cathedral--king and priest--master and slave--tyrant\nand hypocrite.They will see that the excesses, the cruelties, and\ncrimes were but the natural fruit of seeds the church had sown.Upon that cloud of war, black with\nthe myriad miseries of a thousand years, dabbled with blood of king and\nqueen, of patriot and priest, there was this bow: "Beneath the flag of\nFrance all men are free."In spite of all the blood and crime, in spite\nof deeds that seem insanely base, the People placed upon a Nation\'s brow\nthese stars:--Liberty, Fraternity, Equality--grander words than ever\nissued from Jehovah\'s lips.A KIND WORD FOR JOHN CHINAMAN\n\nOn the 27th day of March, 1880, Messrs.Wright, Dickey, O\'Conner, and\nMurch, of the Select Committee appointed by Congress to "Consider\nthe causes of the present depression of labor," presented the majority\nspecial report on Chinese Immigration.The following quotations are\nexcerpts from Col.R. G. Ingersoll\'s caustic review of that report.The Select Committee Afraid\n\nThese gentlemen are in great fear for the future of our most holy and\nperfectly authenticated religion, and have, like faithful watchmen,\nfrom the walls and towers of Zion, hastened to give the alarm.They have\ninformed Congress that "Joss has his temple of worship in the Chinese\nquarters, in San Francisco.Within the walls of a dilapidated structure\nis exposed to the view of the faithful the God of the Chinaman, and here\nare his altars of worship, Here he tears up his pieces of paper; here he\noffers up his prayers; here he receives his religious consolations,\nand here is his road to the celestial land."That "Joss is located in a\nlong, narrow room, in a building in a back alley, upon a kind of altar;"\nthat "he is a wooden image, looking as much like an alligator as like a\nhuman being;" that the Chinese "think there is such a place as heaven;"\nthat "all classes of Chinamen worship idols;" that "the temple is open\nevery day at all hours;" that "the Chinese have no Sunday;" that this\nheathen god has "huge jaws, a big red tongue, large white teeth, a half\ndozen arms, and big, fiery, eyeballs.About him are placed offerings of\nmeat, and other eatables--a sacrificial offering."The Gods of the Joss-House and Patmos\n\nNo wonder that these members of the committee were shocked at such a\ngod, knowing as they did, that the only true God was correctly described\nby the inspired lunatic of Patmos in the following words: "And there sat\nin the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of\nMan, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps\nwith a golden girdle.His head and his hairs were white like wool, as\nwhite as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like\nunto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the\nsound of many waters.And he had in his right hand seven stars; and out\nof his mouth went a sharp, two-edged sword; and his countenance was as\nthe sun shining in his strength."Certainly, a large mouth, filled\nwith white teeth, is preferable to one used as the scabbard of a sharp,\ntwo-edged sword.Why should these gentlemen object to a god with big\nfiery eyeballs, when their own Deity has eyes like a flame of fire?A Little Too Late\n\nIs it not a little late in the day to object to people because they\nsacrifice meat and other eatables to their god?We all know, that for\nthousands of years the "real" God was exceedingly fond of roasted meat;\nthat He loved the savor of burning flesh, and delighted in the perfume\nof fresh warm blood.Christianity has a Fair Show in San Francisco\n\nThe world is also informed by these gentlemen that "the idolatry of\nthe Chinese produces a demoralizing effect upon our American youth by\nbringing sacred things into disrespect and making religion a theme of\ndisgust and contempt."In San Francisco there are some three hundred\nthousand people.Is it possible that a few Chinese can bring "our holy\nreligion" into disgust and contempt?In that city there are fifty times\nas many churches as joss-houses.Scores of sermons are uttered every\nweek; religious books and papers are plentiful as leaves in autumn, and\nsomewhat dryer; thousands of bibles are within the reach of all.An Arrow from the Quiver of Satire\n\nAnd there, too, is the example of a Christian city.Why should we send\nmissionaries to China, if we cannot convert the heathen when they come\nhere?When missionaries go to a foreign land the poor benighted people\nhave to take their word for the blessings showered upon a Christian\npeople; but when the heathen come here, they can see for themselves.What was simply a story becomes a demonstrated fact.They come in\ncontact with people who love their enemies.They see that in a Christian\nland men tell the truth; that they will not take advantage of strangers;\nthat they are just and patient; kind and tender; and have no prejudice\non account of color, race or religion; that they look upon mankind as\nbrethren; that they speak of God as a Universal Father, and are\nwilling to work and even to suffer, for the good, not only of their own\ncountrymen, but of the heathen as well.All this the Chinese see and\nknow, and why they still cling to the religion of their country is, to\nme, a matter of amazement.We Have no Religious System\n\nI take this, the earliest opportunity, to inform these gentlemen\ncomposing a majority of the committee, that we have in the United States\nno "religious system;" that this is a secular government.That it has\nno religious creed; that it does not believe nor disbelieve in a future\nstate of reward or punishment; that it neither affirms nor denies the\nexistence of a "living" God.Congress Nothing to Do with Religion\n\nCongress has nothing to do with the religion of the people.Its members\nare not responsible to God for the opinions of their constituents, and\nit may tend to the happiness of the constituents for me to state that\nthey are in no way responsible for the religion of the members.Religion\nis an individual, not a national matter.And where the nation interferes\nwith the right of conscience, the liberties of the people are devoured\nby the monster Superstition.But I am astonished that four Christian statesmen, four members of\nCongress in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, who seriously\nobject to people on account of their religious convictions, should\nstill assert that the very religion in which they believe--and the only\nreligion established by the living god-head of the American system--is\nnot adapted to the spiritual needs of one-third of the human race.It is\namazing that these four gentlemen have, in the defense of the Christian\nreligion, announced the discovery that it is wholly inadequate for\nthe civilization of mankind; that the light of the cross can never\npenetrate the darkness of China; "that all the labors of the missionary,\nthe example of the good, the exalted character of our civilization, make\nno impression upon the pagan life of the Chinese;" and that even\nthe report of this committee will not tend to elevate, refine and\nChristianize the yellow heathen of the Pacific coast.In the name\nof religion these gentlemen have denied its power and mocked at the\nenthusiasm of its founder.Worse than this, they have predicted for the\nChinese a future of ignorance and idolatry in this world, and, if the\n"American system" of religion is true, hell-fire in the next.Do not Trample on John Chinaman\n\nDo not trample upon these people because they have a different\nconception of things about which even this committee knows nothing.Give them the same privilege you enjoy of making a God after their own\nfashion.Would you be willing\nto have them remain, if one of their race, thousands of years ago, had\npretended to have seen God, and had written of him as follows: "There\nwent up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth; coals\nwere kindled by it, * * * and he rode upon a cherub and did fly."Why\nshould you object to these people on account of their religion?Your\nobjection has in it the spirit of hate and intolerance.That spirit lighted the fagot, made the\nthumb-screw, put chains upon the limbs, and lashes upon the backs of\nmen.The same spirit bought and sold, captured and kidnapped human\nbeings; sold babes, and justified all the horrors of slavery.Be Honest with the Chinese\n\nIf you wish to drive out the Chinese, do not make a pretext of religion.Do not pretend that you are trying to do God a favor.Injustice in his\nname is doubly detestable.The assassin cannot sanctify his dagger by\nfalling on his knees, and it does not help a falsehood if it be uttered\nas a prayer.Religion, used, to intensify the hatred of men toward men,\nunder the pretense of pleasing God, has cursed this world.An Honest Merchant the Best Missionary\n\nI am almost sure that I have read somewhere that "Christ died for _all_\nmen," and that "God is no respecter of persons."It was once taught\nthat it was the duty of Christians to tell to all people the "tidings of\ngreat joy."I have never believed these things myself, but have always\ncontended that an honest merchant was the best missionary.Commerce\nmakes friends, religion makes enemies; the one enriches, and the other\nimpoverishes; the one thrives best where the truth is told, the other\nwhere falsehoods are believed.For myself, I have but little confidence\nin any business, or enterprise, or investment, that promises dividends\nonly after the death of the stockholders.Good Words from Confucius\n\nFor the benefit of these four philosophers and prophets, I will give a\nfew extracts from the writings of Confucius that will, in my judgment,\ncompare favorably with the best passages of their report:\n\n"My doctrine is that man must be true to the principles of his nature,\nand the benevolent exercises of them toward others.""With coarse rice to eat, with water to drink, and with my bended arm\nfor a pillow, I still have joy.""Riches and honor acquired by injustice are to me but floating clouds.""The man who, in view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who, in view of\ndanger, forgets life; and who remembers an old agreement, however far\nback it extends, such a man may be reckoned a complete man.""Recompense injury with justice, and kindness with kindness."There is one word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one\'s\nlife: Reciprocity is that word.The Ancient Chinese\n\nWhen the ancestors of the four Christian Congressmen were barbarians,\nwhen they lived in caves, gnawed bones, and worshiped dry snakes; the\ninfamous Chinese were reading these sublime sentences of Confucius.When\nthe forefathers of these Christian statesmen were hunting toads to\nget the jewels out of their heads to be used as charms, the wretched\nChinamen were calculating eclipses, and measuring the circumference\nof the earth.When the progenitors of these representatives of the\n"American system of religion" were burning women charged with nursing\ndevils, these people "incapable of being influenced by the exalted\ncharacter of our civilization," were building asylums for the insane.The Chinese and Civil Service Reform\n\nNeither should it be forgotten that, for thousands of years, the Chinese\nhave honestly practised the great principle known as civil service\nreform--a something that even the administration of Mr.Hayes has\nreached only through the proxy of promise.Invading China in the Name of Opium and Christ\n\nThe English battered down the door of China in the names of Opium and\nChrist.This infamy was regarded as another triumph of the gospel.At last in self-defense the Chinese allowed Christians to touch their\nshores.Their wise men, their philosophers, protested, and prophesied\nthat time would show that Christians could not be trusted.This re port\nproves that the wise men were not only philosophers but prophets.Don\'t be Dishonest in the Name of God\n\nTreat China as you would England.Change it if you will, according to the laws of nations, but on no\naccount excuse a breach of national faith by pretending that we are\ndishonest for God\'s sake.CONCERNING CREEDS AND THE TYRANNY OF SECTS\n\n\n\n\n482.Diversity of Opinion Abolished by Henry VIII\n\nIn the reign of Henry VIII--that pious and moral founder of the\napostolic Episcopal Church,--there was passed by the parliament\nof England an act entitled, "An act for abolishing of diversity of\nopinion."And in this act was set forth what a good Christian was\nobliged to believe:\n\nFirst, That in the sacrament was the real body and blood of Jesus\nChrist.Second, That the body and blood of Jesus Christ was in the bread, and\nthe blood and body of Jesus Christ was in the wine.Fourth, That vows of chastity were of perpetual obligation.Fifth, That private masses ought to be continued; and,\n\nSixth, That auricular confession to a priest must be maintained.This creed was made by law, in order that all men might know just what\nto believe by simply reading the statute.The Church hated to see the\npeople wearing out their brains in thinking upon these subjects.Spencer and Darwin Damned\n\nAccording to the philosophy of theology, man has continued to degenerate\nfor six thousand years.To teach that there is that in nature which\nimpels to higher forms and grander ends, is heresy, of course.The\nDeity will damn Spencer and his "Evolution," Darwin and his "Origin\nof Species," Bastian and his "Spontaneous Generation," Huxley and his\n"Protoplasm," Tyndall and his "Prayer Gauge," and will save those, and\nthose only, who declare that the universe has been cursed, from the\nsmallest atom to the grandest star; that everything tends to evil and to\nthat only, and that the only perfect thing in nature is the Presbyterian\nConfession of Faith.The Dead do Not Persecute\n\nImagine a vine that grows at one end and decays at the other.The\nend that grows is heresy, the end that rots is orthodox.The dead are\northodox, and your cemetery is the most perfect type of a well regulated\nchurch.No thought, no progress, no heresy there.Slowly and silently,\nside by side, the satisfied members peacefully decay.There is only this\ndifference--the dead do not persecute.The Atheist a Legal Outcast in Illinois\n\nThe supreme court of Illinois decided, in the year of grace 1856, that\nan unbeliever in the existence of an intelligent First Cause could not\nbe allowed to testify in any court.His wife and children might have\nbeen murdered before his very face, and yet in the absence of other\nwitnesses, the murderer could not have even been indicted.To him, Justice was not only blind, but deaf.He\nwas liable, like other men, to support the government, and was forced to\ncontribute his share towards paying the salaries of the very judges\nwho decided that under no circumstances could his voice be heard in any\ncourt.This was the law of Illinois, and so remained until the adoption\nof the new Constitution By such infamous means has the Church endeavored\nto chain the human mind, and protect the majesty of her God.How the Owls Hoot\n\nNow and then somebody examines, and in spite of all keeps his manhood,\nand has the courage to follow where his reason leads.Then the pious\nget together and repeat wise saws, and exchange knowing nods and most\nprophetic winks.The stupidly wise sit owl-like on the dead limbs of the\ntree of knowledge, and solemnly hoot.The Fate of Theological Students\n\nThousands of young men are being educated at this moment by the various\nChurches.In order that they may be prepared to investigate\nthe phenomena by which we are surrounded?The object, and the only\nobject, is that they may be prepared to defend a creed; that they may\nlearn the arguments of their respective churches, and repeat them in\nthe dull ears of a thoughtless congregation.If one, after being thus\ntrained at the expense of the Methodists, turns Presbyterian or Baptist,\nhe is denounced as an ungrateful wretch.Honest investigation is utterly\nimpossible within the pale of any Church, for the reason, that if you\nthink the Church is right you will not investigate, and if you think it\nwrong, the Church will investigate you.The consequence of this is,\nthat most of the theological literature is the result of suppression, of\nfear, tyranny and hypocrisy.Trials for Heresy\n\nA trial for heresy means that the spirit of persecution still lingers in\nthe Church; that it still denies the right of private judgment; that it\nstill thinks more of creed than truth, and that it is still determined\nto prevent the intellectual growth of man.It means the churches are\nshambles in which are bought and sold the souls of men.It means that\nthe Church is still guilty of the barbarity of opposing thought with\nforce.It means that if it had the power, the mental horizon would be\nbound by a creed; that it would bring again the whips and chains and\ndungeon keys, the rack and fagot of the past.Presbyterianism Softening\n\nFortunately for us, civilization has had a softening effect even upon\nthe Presbyterian Church.To the ennobling influence of the arts and\nsciences the savage spirit of Calvinism has, in some slight degree,\nsuccumbed.True, the old creed remains substantially as it was written,\nbut by a kind of tacit understanding it has come to be regarded as a\nrelic of the past.The cry of "heresy" has been growing fainter and\nfainter, and, as a consequence, the ministers of that denomination\nhave ventured, now and then, to express doubts as to the damnation of\ninfants, and the doctrine of total depravity.The Methodist "Hoist with his own Petard."A few years ago a Methodist clergyman took it upon himself to give me a\npiece of friendly advice."Although you may disbelieve the bible," said\nhe, "you ought not to say so."Do\nyou believe the bible," said I. He replied, "Most assuredly."To which\nI retorted, "Your answer conveys no information to me.You may be\nfollowing your own advice.Of\ncourse a man who will advise others to dissimulate will not always be\nparticular about telling the truth himself."The Precious Doctrine of Total Depravity\n\nWhat a precious doctrine is that of the total depravity of the human\nheart!How sweet it is to believe that the lives of all the good and\ngreat were continual sins and perpetual crimes; that the love a mother\nbears her child is, in the sight of God, a sin; that the gratitude of\nthe natural heart is simple meanness; that the tears of pity are impure;\nthat for the unconverted to live and labor for others is an offense to\nheaven; that the noblest aspirations of the soul are low and groveling\nin the sight of God.Guilty of Heresy\n\nWhoever has an opinion of his own, and honestly expresses it, will be\nguilty of heresy.Heresy is what the minority believe; it is the name\ngiven by the powerful to the doctrine of the weak.This word was born of\nthe hatred, arrogance and cruelty of those who love their enemies, and\nwho, when smitten on one cheek, turn the other.This word was born of\nintellectual slavery in the feudal ages of thought.It was an epithet\nused in the place of argument.From the commencement of the Christian\nera, every art has been exhausted and every conceivable punishment\ninflicted to force all people to hold the same religious opinions.This\neffort was born of the idea that a certain belief was necessary to the\nsalvation of the soul.One great trouble is that most teachers are dishonest.They teach as\ncertainties those things concerning which they entertain doubts.They\ndo not say, "we _think_ this is so," but "we _know_ this is so."They do\nnot appeal to the reason of the pupil, but they command his faith.They\nkeep all doubts to themselves; they do not explain, they assert.In all ages reason has been regarded as the enemy of religion.Nothing\nhas been considered so pleasing to the Deity as a total denial of the\nauthority of your own mind.Self-reliance has been thought a deadly\nsin; and the idea of living and dying without the aid and consolation\nof superstition has always horrified the Church.By some unaccountable\ninfatuation, belief has been and still is considered of immense\nimportance.All religions have been based upon the idea that God will\nforever reward the true believer, and eternally damn the man who doubts\nor denies.Belief is regarded as the one essential thing.To practice\njustice, to love mercy, is not enough.You must believe in some\nincomprehensible creed.You must say, "Once one is three, and three\ntimes one is one."The man who practiced every virtue, but failed to\nbelieve, was execrated.Nothing so outrages the feelings of the Church\nas a moral unbeliever--nothing so horrible as a charitable Atheist.A Hundred and Fifty Years Ago\n\nOne hundred and fifty years ago the foremost preachers would have\nperished at the stake.A Universalist would have been torn in pieces in\nEngland, Scotland, and America.Unitarians would have found themselves\nin the stocks, pelted by the rabble with dead cats, after which their\nears would have been cut off, their tongues bored, and their foreheads\nbranded.The Despotism of Faith\n\nThe despotism of faith is justified upon the ground that Christian\ncountries are the grandest and most prosperous of the world.At one time\nthe same thing could have been truly said in India, in Egypt, in Greece,\nin Rome, and in every other country that has, in the history of the\nworld, swept to empire.This argument proves too much not only, but the\nassumption upon which it is based is utterly false.Believe, or Beware\n\nAnd what does a trial for heresy mean?It means that the Church says\na heretic, "Believe as I do, or I will withdraw my support.I will pursue you until your garments are rags; until your\nchildren cry for bread; until your cheeks are furrowed with tears.I\nwill hunt you to the very portals of the grave."Calvin\'s Petrified Heart\n\nLuther denounced mental liberty with all the coarse and brutal vigor\nof his nature; Calvin despised, from the very bottom of his petrified\nheart, anything that even looked like religious toleration, and solemnly\ndeclared that to advocate it was to crucify Christ afresh.All the\nfounders of all the orthodox churches have advocated the same infamous\ntenet.The truth is, that what is called religion is necessarily\ninconsistent with free thought.Must one be versed in Latin before he is entitled to express his opinion\nas to the genuineness of a pretended revelation from God?Common sense\nbelongs exclusively to no tongue.Logic is not confined to, nor has it\nbeen buried with, the dead languages.Paine attacked the bible as it is\ntranslated.If the translation is wrong, let its defenders correct it.A gentleman, walking among the ruins of Athens came upon a fallen statue\nof Jupiter; making an exceedingly low bow he said: "O Jupiter!He then added: "Should you ever sit upon the throne of heaven\nagain, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you\nwere prostrate."The Tail of a Lion\n\nThere is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the\ntail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think\nand act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they\njoin something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party\ncan act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to\npay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself\nabout the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept\n\nThe fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The\nfall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began\nto have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the\ncongregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories\nthemselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short\nof irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside\nworld was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while\nthe church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress\n\nChristianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human\nrace.Across the highway of progress it has always been building\nbreastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,\ndogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered\ntogether behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of\nmalice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into\na deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be\ncrowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of\nhearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you\nwill not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to\nsmilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not\nbeen found.The Real Eden is Beyond\n\nNations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy\nbecomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the\nyears sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are\nbehind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for\nknowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,\nit will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men\n\nLet us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,\nPresbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and\nwomen.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All\nother names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,\ngiven up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS\n\n\n\n\n507.On which of the six days was he\ncreated?Is it possible that God would make a successful\nrival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what\na snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced\nwoman.He knew that if the serpent\ngot into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive\nthem out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he\nhimself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be\ngood, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman\nwas a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to\ntake one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it\nnot possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these\nfables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God\ntake him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam\nand Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not\nacquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent\'s\nreputation.Questions About the Ark\n\nHow was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what\nwas done with the filth?How were some\nportions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others\nkept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their\nrespective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,\nand they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things\nmust have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept\nup a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the\nslowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the\nplains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate\nrate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and\nso sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon\ntheir health.Of course, all the polar\nbears did not go.It could be confounded only by the\ndestruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at\nthat time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain\npresiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak\nthe words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch\nthe brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in\nthe machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the\nlanguage of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man\nto be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in\nthe thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take\nmyrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a\nholy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,\ncandlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,\nat the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put\nany of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,\nthe Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,\nthat whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off\nfrom his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot\nbelieve it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep\nare?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the\nearth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters\nhappen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of\nothers?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a\nlegal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an\naltar?Were the\nstealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and\neloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these\nthings; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who\nwill burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who\nburns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the\ninvestigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,\nlaugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase\nor decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an\neternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has\nnot injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and\nentitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat\nthis atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG\n\nI do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the\nclouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,\nsoil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every\nheretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast\nout and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give\nhis individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really\nvaluable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or\nState solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically\nwe are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect\nminds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give\nup your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory\nof reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,\nthe ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:\n"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of\nman."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,\nbut after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of\nmen and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the\nhuman heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only\njustice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the\nsame as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been\nwet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne\nhave leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated\nto excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his\nexistence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the\nconditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what\nwould have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen\nis allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all\nreligions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our\nright to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his\nintellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this\nsense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own\nin which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all\nthe gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;\nthey have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think\na man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long\ntime.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike\nourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than\nservile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt\nto ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any\ntime, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from\nhuman speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of\nthe Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too\nmuch thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the\nsword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition\nScience has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality\nenough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one\nwho had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the\nmoon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church."Sandra went to the hallway."On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and\nsuccess.INGERSOLL\'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER\'S GRAVE\n\n     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother\n     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs\n     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our\n     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish\n     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would\ndo for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where\nmanhood\'s morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were\nfalling toward the west.He had not passed on life\'s highway the stone that marks the highest\npoint; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,\nusing his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that\nkisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured\nwith the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour\nof all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash\nagainst the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a\nsunken ship For whether in mid sea or \'<DW41> the breakers of the farther\nshore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every\nlife, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment\njeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep\nand dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but\nin the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic\nsouls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,\nwhile on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to\ntears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly\ngave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully\ndischarged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand\ntimes I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a\ntemple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only\ngood, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only\nreligion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;\nand were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom\nto his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet\nflowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two\neternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,\nand the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless\nlips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of\ndeath hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the\nreturn of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that\nthese dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,\nto do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,\nstronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL\'S DREAM OF THE WAR\n\n     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were\n     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran\n     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the\ngreat struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the\nmusic of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We\nsee thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see\nthe pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those\nassemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the\ngreat army of freedom.Some are\nwalking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they\nadore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as\nthey lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing\nbabes that are asleep.Some are parting with\nmothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,\nand say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with\nbrave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her\narms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand\nwaves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,\nkeeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the\ngreat cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the\nfields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory\nfields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand\nguard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with\nthem in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are\nwith them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,\nthe life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them\npierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in\nthe whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech\ncan never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden\nin the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man\nbowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings\ngoverned by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the\nstrokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through\ntangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the\nsacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the\nbrutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner\nof the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting\nshell.Instead of\nslaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches\nthe auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see\nhomes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want\nand crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They\nare at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag\nthey rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the\ntearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of\nthe clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less\npalace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In\nthe midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of\ndeath.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for\nthe living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.Daniel journeyed to the garden.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by\nvermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother\nof all abominations, the devil\'s best friend, and God\'s worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva\n\nThe Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought\n\nPrejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the\nhome.I believe in truth, in\ninvestigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and\nintelligence.It is true that, in a rapid\nsurvey of her career, the eye is at first arrested by the strange drama\nto which I have already alluded, closed by that ever memorable scene in\nthe portico of St.Mark\'s,[13] the central expression in most men\'s\nthoughts of the unendurable elevation of the pontifical power; it is\ntrue that the proudest thoughts of Venice, as well as the insignia of\nher prince, and the form of her chief festival, recorded the service\nthus rendered to the Roman Church.But the enduring sentiment of years\nmore than balanced the enthusiasm of a moment; and the bull of Clement\nV., which excommunicated the Venetians and their doge, likening them to\nDathan, Abiram, Absalom, and Lucifer, is a stronger evidence of the\ngreat tendencies of the Venetian government than the umbrella of the\ndoge or the ring of the Adriatic.The humiliation of Francesco Dandolo\nblotted out the shame of Barbarossa, and the total exclusion of\necclesiastics from all share in the councils of Venice became an\nenduring mark of her knowledge of the spirit of the Church of Rome, and\nof her defiance of it.To this exclusion of Papal influence from her councils, the Romanist\nwill attribute their irreligion, and the Protestant their success.[14]\nThe first may be silenced by a reference to the character of the policy\nof the Vatican itself; and the second by his own shame, when he reflects\nthat the English legislature sacrificed their principles to expose\nthemselves to the very danger which the Venetian senate sacrificed\ntheirs to avoid.One more circumstance remains to be noted respecting the\nVenetian government, the singular unity of the families composing\nit,--unity far from sincere or perfect, but still admirable when\ncontrasted with the fiery feuds, the almost daily revolutions, the\nrestless successions of families and parties in power, which fill\nthe annals of the other states of Italy.That rivalship should\nsometimes be ended by the dagger, or enmity conducted to its ends under\nthe mask of law, could not but be anticipated where the fierce Italian\nspirit was subjected to so severe a restraint: it is much that jealousy\nappears usually unmingled with illegitimate ambition, and that, for\nevery instance in which private passion sought its gratification\nthrough public danger, there are a thousand in which it was sacrificed\nto the public advantage.Venice may well call upon us to note with\nreverence, that of all the towers which are still seen rising like a\nbranchless forest from her islands, there is but one whose office was\nother than that of summoning to prayer, and that one was a watch-tower\nonly: from first to last, while the palaces of the other cities of\nItaly were lifted into sullen fortitudes of rampart, and fringed with\nforked battlements for the javelin and the bow, the sands of Venice\nnever sank under the weight of a war tower, and her roof terraces were\nwreathed with Arabian imagery, of golden globes suspended on the leaves\nof lilies.These, then, appear to me to be the points of chief general\ninterest in the character and fate of the Venetian people.I would next\nendeavor to give the reader some idea of the manner in which the\ntestimony of Art bears upon these questions, and of the aspect which the\narts themselves assume when they are regarded in their true connexion\nwith the history of the state.It will be remembered that I put the commencement of the Fall of Venice\nas far back as 1418.Now, John Bellini was born in 1423, and Titian in 1480.John Bellini,\nand his brother Gentile, two years older than he, close the line of the\nsacred painters of Venice.But the most solemn spirit of religious faith\nanimates their works to the last.There is no religion in any work of\nTitian\'s: there is not even the smallest evidence of religious temper or\nsympathies either in himself, or in those for whom he painted.His\nlarger sacred subjects are merely themes for the exhibition of pictorial\nrhetoric,--composition and color.His minor works are generally made\nsubordinate to purposes of portraiture.The Madonna in the church of the\nFrari is a mere lay figure, introduced to form a link of connexion\nbetween the portraits of various members of the Pesaro family who\nsurround her.Now this is not merely because John Bellini was a religious man and\nTitian was not.Titian and Bellini are each true representatives of the\nschool of painters contemporary with them; and the difference in their\nartistic feeling is a consequence not so much of difference in their own\nnatural characters as in their early education: Bellini was brought up\nin faith; Titian in formalism.Between the years of their births the\nvital religion of Venice had expired.The _vital_ religion, observe, not the formal.Outward\nobservance was as strict as ever; and doge and senator still were painted,\nin almost every important instance, kneeling before the Madonna or St.Mark; a confession of faith made universal by the pure gold of the\nVenetian sequin.But observe the great picture of Titian\'s in the ducal\npalace, of the Doge Antonio Grimani kneeling before Faith: there is a\ncurious lesson in it.The figure of Faith is a coarse portrait of one of\nTitian\'s least graceful female models: Faith had become carnal.The eye\nis first caught by the flash of the Doge\'s armor.The heart of Venice\nwas in her wars, not in her worship.The mind of Tintoret, incomparably more deep and serious than that of\nTitian, casts the solemnity of its own tone over the sacred subjects\nwhich it approaches, and sometimes forgets itself into devotion; but the\nprinciple of treatment is altogether the same as Titian\'s: absolute\nsubordination of the religious subject to purposes of decoration or\nportraiture.The evidence might be accumulated a thousandfold from the works of\nVeronese, and of every succeeding painter,--that the fifteenth century\nhad taken away the religious heart of Venice.To collect that of\nArchitecture will be our task through many a page to come; but I must\nhere give a general idea of its heads.Philippe de Commynes, writing of his entry into Venice in 1495, says,--\n\n"Chascun me feit seoir au meillieu de ces deux ambassadeurs qui est\nl\'honneur d\'Italie que d\'estre au meillieu; et me menerent au long de la\ngrant rue, qu\'ilz appellent le Canal Grant, et est bien large.Les\ngallees y passent a travers et y ay ven navire de quatre cens tonneaux\nou plus pres des maisons: et est la plus belle rue que je croy qui soit\nen tout le monde, et la mieulx maisonnee, et va le long de la ville.Les\nmaisons sont fort grandes et haultes, et de bonne pierre, et les\nanciennes toutes painctes; les aultres faictes depuis cent ans: toutes\nont le devant de marbre blanc, qui leur vient d\'Istrie, a cent mils de\nla, et encores maincte grant piece de porphire et de sarpentine sur le\ndevant.... C\'est la plus triumphante cite que j\'aye jamais vene et qui\nplus faict d\'honneur a ambassadeurs et estrangiers, et qui plus\nsaigement se gouverne, et ou le service de Dieu est le plus\nsollempnellement faict: et encores qu\'il y peust bien avoir d\'aultres\nfaultes, si je croy que Dieu les a en ayde pour la reverence qu\'ilz\nportent au service de l\'Eglise."[16]\n\n[Illustration: Plate I. Wall-Veil-Decoration.CA\'TREVISAN\n                        CA\'DARIO.]This passage is of peculiar interest, for two reasons.Observe,\nfirst, the impression of Commynes respecting the religion of Venice: of\nwhich, as I have above said, the forms still remained with some\nglimmering of life in them, and were the evidence of what the real life\nhad been in former times.But observe, secondly, the impression\ninstantly made on Commynes\' mind by the distinction between the elder\npalaces and those built "within this last hundred years; which all have\ntheir fronts of white marble brought from Istria, a hundred miles away,\nand besides, many a large piece of porphyry and serpentine upon their\nfronts."On the opposite page I have given two of the ornaments of the palaces\nwhich so struck the French ambassador.[17] He was right in his notice of\nthe distinction.There had indeed come a change over Venetian\narchitecture in the fifteenth century; and a change of some importance\nto us moderns: we English owe to it our St.Paul\'s Cathedral, and Europe\nin general owes to it the utter degradation or destruction of her\nschools of architecture, never since revived.But that the reader may\nunderstand this, it is necessary that he should have some general idea\nof the connexion of the architecture of Venice with that of the rest of\nEurope, from its origin forwards.All European architecture, bad and good, old and new, is\nderived from Greece through Rome, and  and perfected from the East.The history of architecture is nothing but the tracing of the various\nmodes and directions of this derivation.Understand this, once for all:\nif you hold fast this great connecting clue, you may string all the types\nof successive architectural invention upon it like so many beads.The\nDoric and the Corinthian orders are the roots, the one of all Romanesque,\nmassy-capitaled buildings--Norman, Lombard, Byzantine, and what else you\ncan name of the kind; and the Corinthian of all Gothic, Early English,\nFrench, German, and Tuscan.Now observe: those old Greeks gave the\nshaft; Rome gave the arch; the Arabs pointed and foliated the arch.The\nshaft and arch, the frame-work and strength of architecture, are from\nthe race of Japheth: the spirituality and sanctity of it from Ismael,\nAbraham, and Shem.There is high probability that the Greek received his shaft\nsystem from Egypt; but I do not care to keep this earlier derivation in\nthe mind of the reader.It is only necessary that he should be able to\nrefer to a fixed point of origin, when the form of the shaft was first\nperfected.But it may be incidentally observed, that if the Greeks did\nindeed receive their Doric from Egypt, then the three families of the\nearth have each contributed their part to its noblest architecture: and\nHam, the servant of the others, furnishes the sustaining or bearing\nmember, the shaft; Japheth the arch; Shem the spiritualisation of both.I have said that the two orders, Doric and Corinthian, are the\nroots of all European architecture.You have, perhaps, heard of five\norders; but there are only two real orders, and there never can be any\nmore until doomsday.On one of these orders the ornament is convex:\nthose are Doric, Norman, and what else you recollect of the kind.On the\nother the ornament is concave: those are Corinthian, Early English,\nDecorated, and what else you recollect of that kind.The transitional\nform, in which the ornamental line is straight, is the centre or root of\nboth.All other orders are varieties of those, or phantasms and\ngrotesques altogether indefinite in number and species.This Greek architecture, then, with its two orders, was clumsily\ncopied and varied by the Romans with no particular result, until they\nbegun to bring the arch into extensive practical service; except only\nthat the Doric capital was spoiled in endeavors to mend it, and the\nCorinthian much varied and enriched with fanciful, and often very\nbeautiful imagery.And in this state of things came Christianity: seized\nupon the arch as her own; decorated it, and delighted in it; invented a\nnew Doric capital to replace the spoiled Roman one: and all over the\nRoman empire set to work, with such materials as were nearest at hand,\nto express and adorn herself as best she could.This Roman Christian\narchitecture is the exact expression of the Christianity of the time,\nvery fervid and beautiful--but very imperfect; in many respects\nignorant, and yet radiant with a strong, childlike light of imagination,\nwhich flames up under Constantine, illumines all the shores of the\nBosphorus and the Aegean and the Adriatic Sea, and then gradually, as the\npeople give themselves up to idolatry, becomes Corpse-light.The\narchitecture sinks into a settled form--a strange, gilded, and embalmed\nrepose: it, with the religion it expressed; and so would have remained\nfor ever,--so _does_ remain, where its languor has been undisturbed.[19]\nBut rough wakening was ordained for it.This Christian art of the declining empire is divided into two\ngreat branches, western and eastern; one centred at Rome, the other at\nByzantium, of which the one is the early Christian Romanesque, properly\nso called, and the other, carried to higher imaginative perfection by\nGreek workmen, is distinguished from it as Byzantine.But I wish the\nreader, for the present, to class these two branches of art together in\nhis mind, they being, in points of main importance, the same; that is to\nsay, both of them a true continuance and sequence of the art of old Rome\nitself, flowing uninterruptedly down from the fountain-head, and\nentrusted always to the best workmen who could be found--Latins in Italy\nand Greeks in Greece; and thus both branches may be ranged under the\ngeneral term of Christian Romanesque, an architecture which had lost the\nrefinement of Pagan art in the degradation of the empire, but which was\nelevated by Christianity to higher aims, and by the fancy of the Greek\nworkmen endowed with brighter forms.And this art the reader may\nconceive as extending in its various branches over all the central\nprovinces of the empire, taking aspects more or less refined, according\nto its proximity to the seats of government; dependent for all its power\non the vigor and freshness of the religion which animated it; and as\nthat vigor and purity departed, losing its own vitality, and sinking\ninto nerveless rest, not deprived of its beauty, but benumbed and\nincapable of advance or change.Meantime there had been preparation for its renewal.While in\nRome and Constantinople, and in the districts under their immediate\ninfluence, this Roman art of pure descent was practised in all its\nrefinement, an impure form of it--a patois of Romanesque--was carried by\ninferior workmen into distant provinces; and still ruder imitations of\nthis patois were executed by the barbarous nations on the skirts of the\nempire.But these barbarous nations were in the strength of their youth;\nand while, in the centre of Europe, a refined and purely descended art\nwas sinking into graceful formalism, on its confines a barbarous and\nborrowed art was organising itself into strength and consistency.The\nreader must therefore consider the history of the work of the period as\nbroadly divided into two great heads: the one embracing the elaborately\nlanguid succession of the Christian art of Rome; and the other, the\nimitations of it executed by nations in every conceivable phase of early\norganisation, on the edges of the empire, or included in its now merely\nnominal extent.Some of the barbaric nations were, of course, not susceptible\nof this influence; and when they burst over the Alps, appear, like the\nHuns, as scourges only, or mix, as the Ostrogoths, with the enervated\nItalians, and give physical strength to the mass with which they mingle,\nwithout materially affecting its intellectual character.But others,\nboth south and north of the empire, had felt its influence, back to the\nbeach of the Indian Ocean on the one hand, and to the ice creeks of the\nNorth Sea on the other.On the north and west the influence was of the\nLatins; on the south and east, of the Greeks.Two nations, pre-eminent\nabove all the rest, represent to us the force of derived mind on either\nside.As the central power is eclipsed, the orbs of reflected light\ngather into their fulness; and when sensuality and idolatry had done\ntheir work, and the religion of the empire was laid asleep in a\nglittering sepulchre, the living light rose upon both horizons, and the\nfierce swords of the Lombard and Arab were shaken over its golden\nparalysis.The work of the Lombard was to give hardihood and system to\nthe enervated body and enfeebled mind of Christendom; that of the Arab\nwas to punish idolatry, and to proclaim the spirituality of worship.The Lombard covered every church which he built with the sculptured\nrepresentations of bodily exercises--hunting and war.[20] The Arab\nbanished all imagination of creature form from his temples, and\nproclaimed from their minarets, "There is no god but God."Opposite in\ntheir character and mission, alike in their magnificence of energy, they\ncame from the North and from the South, the glacier torrent and the lava\nstream: they met and contended over the wreck of the Roman empire; and\nthe very centre of the struggle, the point of pause of both, the dead\nwater of the opposite eddies, charged with embayed fragments of the\nRoman wreck, is VENICE.The Ducal palace of Venice contains the three elements in exactly equal\nproportions--the Roman, Lombard, and Arab.It is the central building of\nthe world.The reader will now begin to understand something of the\nimportance of the study of the edifices of a city which includes, within\nthe circuit of some seven or eight miles, the field of contest between\nthe three pre-eminent architectures of the world:--each architecture\nexpressing a condition of religion; each an erroneous condition, yet\nnecessary to the correction of the others, and corrected by them.It will be part of my endeavor, in the following work, to mark\nthe various modes in which the northern and southern architectures were\ndeveloped from the Roman: here I must pause only to name the\ndistinguishing characteristics of the great families.The Christian\nRoman and Byzantine work is round-arched, with single and\nwell-proportioned shafts; capitals imitated from classical Roman;\nmouldings more or less so; and large surfaces of walls entirely covered\nwith imagery, mosaic, and paintings, whether of scripture history or of\nsacred symbols.The Arab school is at first the same in its principal features, the\nByzantine workmen being employed by the caliphs; but the Arab rapidly\nintroduces characters half Persepolitan, half Egyptian, into the shafts\nand capitals: in his intense love of excitement he points the arch and\nwrithes it into extravagant foliations; he banishes the animal imagery,\nand invents an ornamentation of his own (called Arabesque) to replace\nit: this not being adapted for covering large surfaces, he concentrates\nit on features of interest, and bars his surfaces with horizontal lines\nof color, the expression of the level of the Desert.He retains the\ndome, and adds the minaret.The changes effected by the Lombard are more curious still,\nfor they are in the anatomy of the building, more than its decoration.The Lombard architecture represents, as I said, the whole of that of\nthe northern barbaric nations.And this I believe was, at first, an\nimitation in wood of the Christian Roman churches or basilicas.Without\nstaying to examine the whole structure of a basilica, the reader will\neasily understand thus much of it: that it had a nave and two aisles,\nthe nave much higher than the aisles; that the nave was separated from\nthe aisles by rows of shafts, which supported, above, large spaces of\nflat or dead wall, rising above the aisles, and forming the upper part\nof the nave, now called the clerestory, which had a gabled wooden roof.These high dead walls were, in Roman work, built of stone; but in the\nwooden work of the North, they must necessarily have been made of\nhorizontal boards or timbers attached to uprights on the top of the nave\npillars, which were themselves also of wood.[21] Now, these uprights\nwere necessarily thicker than the rest of the timbers, and formed\nvertical square pilasters above the nave piers.As Christianity extended\nand civilisation increased, these wooden structures were changed into\nstone; but they were literally petrified, retaining the form which had\nbeen made necessary by their being of wood.The upright pilaster above\nthe nave pier remains in the stone edifice, and is the first form of the\ngreat distinctive feature of Northern architecture--the vaulting shaft.In that form the Lombards brought it into Italy, in the seventh century,\nand it remains to this day in St.When the vaulting shaft was introduced in the clerestory\nwalls, additional members were added for its support to the nave piers.Perhaps two or three pine trunks, used for a single pillar, gave the\nfirst idea of the grouped shaft.Be that as it may, the arrangement of\nthe nave pier in the form of a cross accompanies the superimposition of\nthe vaulting shaft; together with corresponding grouping of minor shafts\nin doorways and apertures of windows.Thus, the whole body of the\nNorthern architecture, represented by that of the Lombards, may be\ndescribed as rough but majestic work, round-arched, with grouped shafts,\nadded vaulting shafts, and endless imagery of active life and fantastic\nsuperstitions.The glacier stream of the Lombards, and the following one of\nthe Normans, left their erratic blocks, wherever they had flowed; but\nwithout influencing, I think, the Southern nations beyond the sphere of\ntheir own presence.But the lava stream of the Arab, even after it\nceased to flow, warmed the whole of the Northern air; and the history of\nGothic architecture is the history of the refinement and\nspiritualisation of Northern work under its influence.The noblest\nbuildings of the world, the Pisan-Romanesque, Tuscan (Giottesque)\nGothic, and Veronese Gothic, are those of the Lombard schools\nthemselves, under its close and direct influence; the various Gothics of\nthe North are the original forms of the architecture which the Lombards\nbrought into Italy, changing under the less direct influence of the\nArab.Understanding thus much of the formation of the great European\nstyles, we shall have no difficulty in tracing the succession of\narchitectures in Venice herself.From what I said of the central\ncharacter of Venetian art, the reader is not, of course, to conclude\nthat the Roman, Northern, and Arabian elements met together and\ncontended for the mastery at the same period.The earliest element was\nthe pure Christian Roman; but few, if any, remains of this art exist at\nVenice; for the present city was in the earliest times only one of many\nsettlements formed on the chain of marshy islands which extend from the\nmouths of the Isonzo to those of the Adige, and it was not until the\nbeginning of the ninth century that it became the seat of government;\nwhile the cathedral of Torcello, though Christian Roman in general form,\nwas rebuilt in the eleventh century, and shows evidence of Byzantine\nworkmanship in many of its details.This cathedral, however, with the\nchurch of Santa Fosca at Torcello, San Giacomo di Rialto at Venice, and\nthe crypt of St.Mark\'s, forms a distinct group of buildings, in which\nthe Byzantine influence is exceedingly slight; and which is probably\nvery sufficiently representative of the earliest architecture on the\nislands.The Ducal residence was removed to Venice in 809, and the\nbody of St.Mark\'s was, doubtless, built in imitation of that\ndestroyed at Alexandria, and from which the relics of the saint had been\nobtained.During the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries, the\narchitecture of Venice seems to have been formed on the same model, and\nis almost identical with that of Cairo under the caliphs,[22] it being\nquite immaterial whether the reader chooses to call both Byzantine or\nboth Arabic; the workmen being certainly Byzantine, but forced to the\ninvention of new forms by their Arabian masters, and bringing these\nforms into use in whatever other parts of the world they were employed.To this first manner of Venetian architecture, together with vestiges as\nremain of the Christian Roman, I shall devote the first division of the\nfollowing inquiry.The examples remaining of it consist of three noble\nchurches (those of Torcello, Murano, and the greater part of St.Mark\'s), and about ten or twelve fragments of palaces.To this style succeeds a transitional one, of a character\nmuch more distinctly Arabian: the shafts become more slender, and the\narches consistently pointed, instead of round; certain other changes,\nnot to be enumerated in a sentence, taking place in the capitals and\nmouldings.It was natural\nfor the Venetians to imitate the beautiful details of the Arabian\ndwelling-house, while they would with reluctance adopt those of the\nmosque for Christian churches.I have not succeeded in fixing limiting dates for this style.It appears\nin part contemporary with the Byzantine manner, but outlives it.Its\nposition is, however, fixed by the central date, 1180, that of the\nelevation of the granite shafts of the Piazetta, whose capitals are the\ntwo most important pieces of detail in this transitional style in\nVenice.Examples of its application to domestic buildings exist in\nalmost every street of the city, and will form the subject of the second\ndivision of the following essay.The Venetians were always ready to receive lessons in art\nfrom their enemies (else had there been no Arab work in Venice).But their\nespecial dread and hatred of the Lombards appears to have long prevented\nthem from receiving the influence of the art which that people had\nintroduced on the mainland of Italy.Nevertheless, during the practice\nof the two styles above distinguished, a peculiar and very primitive\ncondition of pointed Gothic had arisen in ecclesiastical architecture.It appears to be a feeble reflection of the Lombard-Arab forms, which\nwere attaining perfection upon the continent, and would probably, if\nleft to itself, have been soon merged in the Venetian-Arab school, with\nwhich it had from the first so close a fellowship, that it will be found\ndifficult to distinguish the Arabian ogives from those which seem to\nhave been built under this early Gothic influence.The churches of San\nGiacopo dell\'Orio, San Giovanni in Bragora, the Carmine, and one or two\nmore, furnish the only important examples of it.But, in the thirteenth\ncentury, the Franciscans and Dominicans introduced from the continent\ntheir morality and their architecture, already a distinct Gothic,\ncuriously developed from Lombardic and Northern (German?)forms; and the\ninfluence of the principles exhibited in the vast churches of St.Paul\nand the Frari began rapidly to affect the Venetian-Arab school.Still\nthe two systems never became united; the Venetian policy repressed the\npower of the church, and the Venetian artists resisted its example; and\nthenceforward the architecture of the city becomes divided into\necclesiastical and civil: the one an ungraceful yet powerful form of the\nWestern Gothic, common to the whole peninsula, and only showing Venetian\nsympathies in the adoption of certain characteristic mouldings; the\nother a rich, luxuriant, and entirely original Gothic, formed from the\nVenetian-Arab by the influence of the Dominican and Franciscan\narchitecture, and especially by the engrafting upon the Arab forms of\nthe most novel feature of the Franciscan work, its traceries.These\nvarious forms of Gothic, the _distinctive_ architecture of Venice,\nchiefly represented by the churches of St.John and Paul, the Frari, and\nSan Stefano, on the ecclesiastical side, and by the Ducal palace, and\nthe other principal Gothic palaces, on the secular side, will be the\nsubject of the third division of the essay.The transitional (or especially Arabic) style\nof the Venetian work is centralised by the date 1180, and is transformed\ngradually into the Gothic, which extends in its purity from the middle\nof the thirteenth to the beginning of the fifteenth century; that is to\nsay, over the precise period which I have described as the central epoch\nof the life of Venice.I dated her decline from the year 1418; Foscari\nbecame doge five years later, and in his reign the first marked signs\nappear in architecture of that mighty change which Philippe de Commynes\nnotices as above, the change to which London owes St.Peter\'s, Venice and Vicenza the edifices commonly supposed to be their\nnoblest, and Europe in general the degradation of every art she has\nsince practised.This change appears first in a loss of truth and vitality in\nexisting architecture all over the world.All the Gothics in existence, southern or northern, were corrupted\nat once: the German and French lost themselves in every species of\nextravagance; the English Gothic was confined, in its insanity, by a\nstrait-waistcoat of perpendicular lines; the Italian effloresced on the\nmainland into the meaningless ornamentation of the Certosa of Pavia and\nthe Cathedral of Como (a style sometimes ignorantly called Italian\nGothic), and at Venice into the insipid confusion of the Porta della\nCarta and wild crockets of St.This corruption of all\narchitecture, especially ecclesiastical, corresponded with, and marked\nthe state of religion over all Europe,--the peculiar degradation of the\nRomanist superstition, and of public morality in consequence, which\nbrought about the Reformation.Against the corrupted papacy arose two great divisions of\nadversaries, Protestants in Germany and England, Rationalists in France\nand Italy; the one requiring the purification of religion, the other its\ndestruction.The Protestant kept the religion, but cast aside the\nheresies of Rome, and with them her arts, by which last rejection he\ninjured his own character, cramped his intellect in refusing to it one\nof its noblest exercises, and materially diminished his influence.It\nmay be a serious question how far the Pausing of the Reformation has\nbeen a consequence of this error.The Rationalist kept the arts and cast aside the religion.This\nrationalistic art is the art commonly called Renaissance, marked by a\nreturn to pagan systems, not to adopt them and hallow them for\nChristianity, but to rank itself under them as an imitator and pupil.In\nPainting it is headed by Giulio Romano and Nicolo Poussin; in\nArchitecture by Sansovino and Palladio.Instant degradation followed in every direction,--a flood of\nfolly and hypocrisy.Mythologies ill understood at first, then perverted\ninto feeble sensualities, take the place of the representations of\nChristian subjects, which had become blasphemous under the treatment of\nmen like the Caracci.Gods without power, satyrs without rusticity,\nnymphs without innocence, men without humanity, gather into idiot groups\nupon the polluted canvas, and scenic affectations encumber the streets\nwith preposterous marble.Lower and lower declines the level of abused\nintellect; the base school of landscape[23] gradually usurps the place\nof the historical painting, which had sunk into prurient pedantry,--the\nAlsatian sublimities of Salvator, the confectionery idealities of\nClaude, the dull manufacture of Gaspar and Canaletto, south of the Alps,\nand on the north the patient devotion of besotted lives to delineation\nof bricks and fogs, fat cattle and ditchwater.And thus Christianity and\nmorality, courage, and intellect, and art all crumbling together into\none wreck, we are hurried on to the fall of Italy, the revolution in\nFrance, and the condition of art in England (saved by her Protestantism\nfrom severer penalty) in the time of George II.I have not written in vain if I have heretofore done\nanything towards diminishing the reputation of the Renaissance landscape\npainting.But the harm which has been done by Claude and the Poussins is\nas nothing when compared to the mischief effected by Palladio, Scamozzi,\nand Sansovino.Claude and the Poussins were weak men, and have had no\nserious influence on the general mind.There is little harm in their\nworks being purchased at high prices: their real influence is very\nslight, and they may be left without grave indignation to their poor\nmission of furnishing drawing-rooms and assisting stranded conversation.Raised at once into all the\nmagnificence of which it was capable by Michael Angelo, then taken up by\nmen of real intellect and imagination, such as Scamozzi, Sansovino,\nInigo Jones, and Wren, it is impossible to estimate the extent of its\ninfluence on the European mind; and that the more, because few persons\nare concerned with painting, and, of those few, the larger number\nregard it with slight attention; but all men are concerned with\narchitecture, and have at some time of their lives serious business with\nit.It does not much matter that an individual loses two or three\nhundred pounds in buying a bad picture, but it is to be regretted that a\nnation should lose two or three hundred thousand in raising a ridiculous\nbuilding.Nor is it merely wasted wealth or distempered conception which\nwe have to regret in this Renaissance architecture: but we shall find in\nit partly the root, partly the expression, of certain dominant evils of\nmodern times--over-sophistication and ignorant classicalism; the one\ndestroying the healthfulness of general society, the other rendering our\nschools and universities useless to a large number of the men who pass\nthrough them.Now Venice, as she was once the most religious, was in her fall the most\ncorrupt, of European states; and as she was in her strength the centre\nof the pure currents of Christian architecture, so she is in her decline\nthe source of the Renaissance.It was the originality and splendor of\nthe palaces of Vicenza and Venice which gave this school its eminence in\nthe eyes of Europe; and the dying city, magnificent in her dissipation,\nand graceful in her follies, obtained wider worship in her decrepitude\nthan in her youth, and sank from the midst of her admirers into the\ngrave.It is in Venice, therefore, and in Venice only that effectual\nblows can be struck at this pestilent art of the Renaissance.Destroy\nits claims to admiration there, and it can assert them nowhere else.This, therefore, will be the final purpose of the following essay.I\nshall not devote a fourth section to Palladio, nor weary the reader with\nsuccessive chapters of vituperation; but I shall, in my account of the\nearlier architecture, compare the forms of all its leading features with\nthose into which they were corrupted by the Classicalists; and pause, in\nthe close, on the edge of the precipice of decline, so soon as I have\nmade its depths discernible.In doing this I shall depend upon two\ndistinct kinds of evidence:--the first, the testimony borne by\nparticular incidents and facts to a want of thought or of feeling in the\nbuilders; from which we may conclude that their architecture must be\nbad:--the second, the sense, which I doubt not I shall be able to excite\nin the reader, of a systematic ugliness in the architecture itself.Of\nthe first kind of testimony I shall here give two instances, which may\nbe immediately useful in fixing in the readers mind the epoch above\nindicated for the commencement of decline.I must again refer to the importance which I have above attached\nto the death of Carlo Zeno and the doge Tomaso Mocenigo.The tomb of\nthat doge is, as I said, wrought by a Florentine; but it is of the same\ngeneral type and feeling as all the Venetian tombs of the period, and it\nis one of the last which retains it.The classical element enters\nlargely into its details, but the feeling of the whole is as yet\nunaffected.Like all the lovely tombs of Venice and Verona, it is a\nsarcophagus with a recumbent figure above, and this figure is a faithful\nbut tender portrait, wrought as far as it can be without painfulness, of\nthe doge as he lay in death.He wears his ducal robe and bonnet--his\nhead is laid slightly aside upon his pillow--his hands are simply\ncrossed as they fall.The face is emaciated, the features large, but so\npure and lordly in their natural chiselling, that they must have looked\nlike marble even in their animation.They are deeply worn away by\nthought and death; the veins on the temples branched and starting; the\nskin gathered in sharp folds; the brow high-arched and shaggy; the\neye-ball magnificently large; the curve of the lips just veiled by the\nlight mustache at the side; the beard short, double, and sharp-pointed:\nall noble and quiet; the white sepulchral dust marking like light the\nstern angles of the cheek and brow.This tomb was sculptured in 1424, and is thus described by one of the\nmost intelligent of the recent writers who represent the popular feeling\nrespecting Venetian art."Of the Italian school is also the rich but ugly (ricco ma non bel)\n   sarcophagus in which repose the ashes of Tomaso Mocenigo.It may be\n   called one of the last links which connect the declining art of the\n   Middle Ages with that of the Renaissance, which was in its rise.We\n   will not stay to particularise the defects of each of the seven\n   figures of the front and sides, which represent the cardinal and\n   theological virtues; nor will we make any remarks upon those which\n   stand in the niches above the pavilion, because we consider them\n   unworthy both of the age and reputation of the Florentine school,\n   which was then with reason considered the most notable in Italy."[24]\n\nIt is well, indeed, not to pause over these defects; but it might have\nbeen better to have paused a moment beside that noble image of a king\'s\nmortality.In the choir of the same church, St.and Paolo, is another\ntomb, that of the Doge Andrea Vendramin.This doge died in 1478, after a\nshort reign of two years, the most disastrous in the annals of Venice.He died of a pestilence which followed the ravage of the Turks, carried\nto the shores of the lagoons.He died, leaving Venice disgraced by sea\nand land, with the smoke of hostile devastation rising in the blue\ndistances of Friuli; and there was raised to him the most costly tomb\never bestowed on her monarchs.If the writer above quoted was cold beside the statue of one of\nthe fathers of his country, he atones for it by his eloquence beside the\ntomb of the Vendramin.I must not spoil the force of Italian superlative\nby translation."Quando si guarda a quella corretta eleganza di profili e di\n   proporzioni, a quella squisitezza d\'ornamenti, a quel certo sapore\n   antico che senza ombra d\'imitazione traspare da tutta l\'opera"--&c."Sopra ornatissimo zoccolo fornito di squisiti intagli s\'alza uno\n   stylobate"--&c."Sotto le colonne, il predetto stilobate si muta\n   leggiadramente in piedistallo, poi con bella novita di pensiero e di\n   effetto va coronato da un fregio il piu gentile che veder si\n   possa"--&c."Non puossi lasciar senza un cenno l\'_arca dove_ sta\n   chiuso il doge; capo lavoro di pensiero e di esecuzione," &c.\n\nThere are two pages and a half of closely printed praise, of which the\nabove specimens may suffice; but there is not a word of the statue of the\ndead from beginning to end.I am myself in the habit of considering this\nrather an important part of a tomb, and I was especially interested in it\nhere, because Selvatico only echoes the praise of thousands.It is\nunanimously declared the chef d\'oeuvre of Renaissance sepulchral work,\nand pronounced by Cicognara (also quoted by Selvatico)\n\n   "Il vertice a cui l\'arti Veneziane si spinsero col ministero del\n   scalpello,"--"The very culminating point to which the Venetian arts\n   attained by ministry of the chisel."To this culminating point, therefore, covered with dust and cobwebs, I\nattained, as I did to every tomb of importance in Venice, by the\nministry of such ancient ladders as were to be found in the sacristan\'s\nkeeping.I was struck at first by the excessive awkwardness and want of\nfeeling in the fall of the hand towards the spectator, for it is thrown\noff the middle of the body in order to show its fine cutting.Now the\nMocenigo hand, severe and even stiff in its articulations, has its veins\nfinely drawn, its sculptor having justly felt that the delicacy of the\nveining expresses alike dignity and age and birth.The Vendramin hand is\nfar more laboriously cut, but its blunt and clumsy contour at once makes\nus feel that all the care has been thrown away, and well it may be, for\nit has been entirely bestowed in cutting gouty wrinkles about the\njoints.Such as the hand is, I looked for its fellow.At first I thought\nit had been broken off, but, on clearing away the dust, I saw the\nwretched effigy had only _one_ hand, and was a mere block on the inner\nside.The face, heavy and disagreeable in its features, is made\nmonstrous by its semi-sculpture.One side of the forehead is wrinkled\nelaborately, the other left smooth; one side only of the doge\'s cap is\nchased; one cheek only is finished, and the other blocked out and\ndistorted besides; finally, the ermine robe, which is elaborately\nimitated to its utmost lock of hair and of ground hair on the one side,\nis blocked out only on the other: it having been supposed throughout the\nwork that the effigy was only to be seen from below, and from one side.It was indeed to be so seen by nearly every one; and I do\nnot blame--I should, on the contrary, have praised--the sculptor for\nregulating his treatment of it by its position; if that treatment had\nnot involved, first, dishonesty, in giving only half a face, a\nmonstrous mask, when we demanded true portraiture of the dead; and,\nsecondly, such utter coldness of feeling, as could only consist with an\nextreme of intellectual and moral degradation: Who, with a heart in his\nbreast, could have stayed his hand as he drew the dim lines of the old\nman\'s countenance--unmajestic once, indeed, but at least sanctified by\nthe solemnities of death--could have stayed his hand, as he reached the\nbend of the grey forehead, and measured out the last veins of it at so\nmuch the zecchin?I do not think the reader, if he has feeling, will expect that much\ntalent should be shown in the rest of his work, by the sculptor of this\nbase and senseless lie.The whole monument is one wearisome aggregation\nof that species of ornamental flourish, which, when it is done with a\npen, is called penmanship, and when done with a chisel, should be called\nchiselmanship; the subject of it being chiefly fat-limbed boys sprawling\non dolphins, dolphins incapable of swimming, and dragged along the sea\nby expanded pocket-handkerchiefs.But now, reader, comes the very gist and point of the whole matter.This\nlying monument to a dishonored doge, this culminating pride of the\nRenaissance art of Venice, is at least veracious, if in nothing else, in\nits testimony to the character of its sculptor._He was banished from\nVenice for forgery_ in 1487.I have more to say about this convict\'s work hereafter; but I\npass at present, to the second, slighter, but yet more interesting piece\nof evidence, which I promised.The ducal palace has two principal facades; one towards the sea, the\nother towards the Piazzetta.The seaward side, and, as far as the\nseventh main arch inclusive, the Piazzetta side, is work of the early\npart of the fourteenth century, some of it perhaps even earlier; while\nthe rest of the Piazzetta side is of the fifteenth.The difference in\nage has been gravely disputed by the Venetian antiquaries, who have\nexamined many documents on the subject, and quoted some which they never\nexamined.I have myself collated most of the written documents, and one\ndocument more, to which the Venetian antiquaries never thought of\nreferring,--the masonry of the palace itself.That masonry changes at the centre of the eighth arch from\nthe sea angle on the Piazzetta side.It has been of comparatively small\nstones up to that point; the fifteenth century work instantly begins\nwith larger stones, "brought from Istria, a hundred miles away."[26] The\nninth shaft from the sea in the lower arcade, and the seventeenth, which\nis above it, in the upper arcade, commence the series of fifteenth\ncentury shafts.These two are somewhat thicker than the others, and\ncarry the party-wall of the Sala del Scrutinio.The\nface of the palace, from this point to the Porta della Carta, was built\nat the instance of that noble Doge Mocenigo beside whose tomb you have\nbeen standing; at his instance, and in the beginning of the reign of his\nsuccessor, Foscari; that is to say, circa 1424.This is not disputed; it\nis only disputed that the sea facade is earlier; of which, however, the\nproofs are as simple as they are incontrovertible: for not only the\nmasonry, but the sculpture, changes at the ninth lower shaft, and that\nin the capitals of the shafts both of the upper and lower arcade: the\ncostumes of the figures introduced in the sea facade being purely\nGiottesque, correspondent with Giotto\'s work in the Arena Chapel at\nPadua, while the costume on the other capitals is Renaissance-Classic:\nand the lions\' heads between the arches change at the same point.And\nthere are a multitude of other evidences in the statues of the angels,\nwith which I shall not at present trouble the reader.Now, the architect who built under Foscari, in 1424 (remember\nmy date for the decline of Venice, 1418), was obliged to follow the\nprincipal forms of the older palace.But he had not the wit to invent\nnew capitals in the same style; he therefore clumsily copied the old\nones.The palace has seventeen main arches on the sea facade, eighteen\non the Piazzetta side, which in all are of course carried by thirty-six\npillars; and these pillars I shall always number from right to left,\nfrom the angle of the palace at the Ponte della Paglia to that next the\nPorta della Carta.I number them in this succession, because I thus have\nthe earliest shafts first numbered.So counted, the 1st, the 18th, and\nthe 36th, are the great supports of the angles of the palace; and the\nfirst of the fifteenth century series, being, as above stated, the 9th\nfrom the sea on the Piazzetta side, is the 26th of the entire series,\nand will always in future be so numbered, so that all numbers above\ntwenty-six indicate fifteenth century work, and all below it, fourteenth\ncentury, with some exceptional cases of restoration.Then the copied capitals are: the 28th, copied from the 7th; the 29th,\nfrom the 9th; the 30th, from the 10th; the 31st, from the 8th; the 33rd,\nfrom the 12th; and the 34th, from the 11th; the others being dull\ninventions of the 15th century, except the 36th, which is very nobly\ndesigned.The capitals thus selected from the earlier portion of\nthe palace for imitation, together with the rest, will be accurately\ndescribed hereafter; the point I have here to notice is in the copy of\nthe ninth capital, which was decorated (being, like the rest, octagonal)\nwith figures of the eight Virtues:--Faith, Hope, Charity, Justice,\nTemperance, Prudence, Humility (the Venetian antiquaries call it\nHumanity!The Virtues of the fourteenth century are\nsomewhat hard-featured; with vivid and living expression, and plain\nevery-day clothes of the time.Charity has her lap full of apples\n(perhaps loaves), and is giving one to a little child, who stretches his\narm for it across a gap in the leafage of the capital.Fortitude tears\nopen a lion\'s jaws; Faith lays her hand on her breast, as she beholds\nthe Cross; and Hope is praying, while above her a hand is seen emerging\nfrom sunbeams--the hand of God (according to that of Revelations, "The\nLord God giveth them light"); and the inscription above is, "Spes optima\nin Deo."This design, then, is, rudely and with imperfect chiselling,\nimitated by the fifteenth century workmen: the Virtues have lost their\nhard features and living expression; they have now all got Roman noses,\nand have had their hair curled.Their actions and emblems are, however,\npreserved until we come to Hope: she is still praying, but she is\npraying to the sun only: _The hand of God is gone._\n\nIs not this a curious and striking type of the spirit which had then\nbecome dominant in the world, forgetting to see God\'s hand in the light\nHe gave; so that in the issue, when that light opened into the\nReformation, on the one side, and into full knowledge of ancient\nliterature on the other, the one was arrested and the other perverted?Such is the nature of the accidental evidence on which I shall\ndepend for the proof of the inferiority of character in the Renaissance\nworkmen.But the proof of the inferiority of the work itself is not so\neasy, for in this I have to appeal to judgments which the Renaissance\nwork has itself distorted.I felt this difficulty very forcibly as I\nread a slight review of my former work, "The Seven Lamps," in "The\nArchitect:" the writer noticed my constant praise of St.We," said the Architect,\n"think it a very ugly building."I was not surprised at the difference\nof opinion, but at the thing being considered so completely a subject of\nopinion.My opponents in matters of painting always assume that there\n_is_ such a thing as a law of right, and that I do not understand it:\nbut my architectural adversaries appeal to no law, they simply set their\nopinion against mine; and indeed there is no law at present to which\neither they or I can appeal.No man can speak with rational decision of\nthe merits or demerits of buildings: he may with obstinacy; he may with\nresolved adherence to previous prejudices; but never as if the matter\ncould be otherwise decided than by a majority of votes, or pertinacity\nof partizanship.I had always, however, a clear conviction that there\n_was_ a law in this matter: that good architecture might be indisputably\ndiscerned and divided from the bad; that the opposition in their very\nnature and essence was clearly visible; and that we were all of us just\nas unwise in disputing about the matter without reference to principle,\nas we should be for debating about the genuineness of a coin, without\nringing it.I felt also assured that this law must be universal if it\nwere conclusive; that it must enable us to reject all foolish and base\nwork, and to accept all noble and wise work, without reference to style\nor national feeling; that it must sanction the design of all truly great\nnations and times, Gothic or Greek or Arab; that it must cast off and\nreprobate the design of all foolish nations and times, Chinese or\nMexican, or modern European: and that it must be easily applicable to\nall possible architectural inventions of human mind.I set myself,\ntherefore, to establish such a law, in full belief that men are\nintended, without excessive difficulty, and by use of their general\ncommon sense, to know good things from bad; and that it is only because\nthey will not be at the pains required for the discernment, that the\nworld is so widely encumbered with forgeries and basenesses.I found the\nwork simpler than I had hoped; the reasonable things ranged themselves\nin the order I required, and the foolish things fell aside, and took\nthemselves away so soon as they were looked in the face.I had then,\nwith respect to Venetian architecture, the choice, either to establish\neach division of law in a separate form, as I came to the features with\nwhich it was concerned, or else to ask the reader\'s patience, while I\nfollowed out the general inquiry first, and determined with him a code\nof right and wrong, to which we might together make retrospective\nappeal.I thought this the best, though perhaps the dullest way; and in\nthese first following pages I have therefore endeavored to arrange those\nfoundations of criticism, on which I shall rest in my account of\nVenetian architecture, in a form clear and simple enough to be\nintelligible even to those who never thought of architecture before.To\nthose who have, much of what is stated in them will be well known or\nself-evident; but they must not be indignant at a simplicity on which\nthe whole argument depends for its usefulness.From that which appears a\nmere truism when first stated, they will find very singular consequences\nsometimes following,--consequences altogether unexpected, and of\nconsiderable importance; I will not pause here to dwell on their\nimportance, nor on that of the thing itself to be done; for I believe\nmost readers will at once admit the value of a criterion of right and\nwrong in so practical and costly an art as architecture, and will be apt\nrather to doubt the possibility of its attainment than dispute its\nusefulness if attained.I invite them, therefore, to a fair trial, being\ncertain that even if I should fail in my main purpose, and be unable to\ninduce in my reader the confidence of judgment I desire, I shall at\nleast receive his thanks for the suggestion of consistent reasons, which\nmay determine hesitating choice, or justify involuntary preference.And\nif I should succeed, as I hope, in making the Stones of Venice\ntouchstones, and detecting, by the mouldering of her marble, poison more\nsubtle than ever was betrayed by the rending of her crystal; and if thus\nI am enabled to show the baseness of the schools of architecture and\nnearly every other art, which have for three centuries been predominant\nin Europe, I believe the result of the inquiry may be serviceable for\nproof of a more vital truth than any at which I have hitherto hinted.For observe: I said the Protestant had despised the arts, and the\nRationalist corrupted them.He\nboasts that it was the papacy which raised the arts; why could it not\nsupport them when it was left to its own strength?How came it to yield\nto Classicalism which was based on infidelity, and to oppose no barrier\nto innovations, which have reduced the once faithfully conceived imagery\nof its worship to stage decoration?Shall we not rather find that\nRomanism, instead of being a promoter of the arts, has never shown\nitself capable of a single great conception since the separation of\nProtestantism from its side?[27] So long as, corrupt though it might be,\nno clear witness had been borne against it, so that it still included in\nits ranks a vast number of faithful Christians, so long its arts were\nnoble.But the witness was borne--the error made apparent; and Rome,\nrefusing to hear the testimony or forsake the falsehood, has been struck\nfrom that instant with an intellectual palsy, which has not only\nincapacitated her from any further use of the arts which once were her\nministers, but has made her worship the shame of its own shrines, and\nher worshippers their destroyers.Come, then, if truths such as these\nare worth our thoughts; come, and let us know, before we enter the\nstreets of the Sea city, whether we are indeed to submit ourselves to\ntheir undistinguished enchantment, and to look upon the last changes\nwhich were wrought on the lifted forms of her palaces, as we should on\nthe capricious towering of summer clouds in the sunset, ere they sank\ninto the deep of night; or whether, rather, we shall not behold in the\nbrightness of their accumulated marble, pages on which the sentence of\nher luxury was to be written until the waves should efface it, as they\nfulfilled--"God has numbered thy kingdom, and finished it."FOOTNOTES:\n\n  [1] Appendix 1, "Foundation of Venice."[2] Appendix 2, "Power of the Doges."[3] Sismondi, Hist.[4] Appendix 3, "Serrar del Consiglio."[5] "Ha saputo trovar modo che non uno, non pochi, non molti,\n    signoreggiano, ma molti buoni, pochi migliori, e insiememente, _un\n    ottimo solo_."(_Sansovino._) Ah, well done, Venice!Wisdom this,\n    indeed.We owe to this historian the discovery\n    of the statutes of the tribunal and date of its establishment.[8] Ominously signified by their humiliation to the Papal power (as\n    before to the Turkish) in 1509, and their abandonment of their right\n    of appointing the clergy of their territories.[9] The senate voted the abdication of their authority by a majority\n    of 512 to 14.[10] By directing the arms of the Crusaders against a Christian\n    prince.[11] Appendix 4, "San Pietro di Castello."[12] Tomaso Mocenigo, above named, Sec.[13]                         "In that temple porch,\n         (The brass is gone, the porphyry remains,)\n         Did BARBAROSSA fling his mantle off,\n         And kneeling, on his neck receive the foot\n         Of the proud Pontiff--thus at last consoled\n         For flight']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Honora Jager, exhorting the said Honora\nJager, and her heirs, into whose hands soever it may fall, to guard it\nwith sacred care from the sun and from damp, as I have guarded it, that\nso the posterity of my valued friend may know what, in his prime, was\nthe form of him whose mind through life, by the acknowledgment of all\nwho knew him, and could discern the superior powers of talent and\nvirtue, was the seat of liberal endowment, warm piety, and energetic\nbenevolence."Being thus on the subject of portraits, let me remark, that it is not\nalways that we meet with a faithful likeness.de\nGenlis\'s _Petrarch et Laure_, justly observes, that "it is doubtful if\nany of the portraits of _Petrarch_, which still remain, were painted\nduring his life-time.However that may be, it is impossible to trace in\nthem, either the elevation of his mind, the fire of his imagination, or\nthe pensive melancholy of his soul."In the Essays on Petrarch, by Ugo\nFoscolo, he informs us, that "_Petrarch\'s_ person, if we trust his\nbiographers, was so striking with beauties, as to attract universal\nadmiration.They represent him with large and manly features, eyes full\nof fire, a blooming complexion, and a countenance that bespoke all the\ngenius and fancy that shone forth in his works."Do we yet know one\nreally good likeness of _Mary Queen of Scots_?[2] It has often struck me (perhaps erroneously), that the attachment\nwhich the great Sully evinced for gardens, even to the last period of\nhis long-protracted life, (eighty-two), _might_ in some degree have been\ncherished or increased from the writings of the great Lord Bacon.When\nthis illustrious duke retired to his country seats, wounded to the heart\nby the baseness of those who had flattered him when Henry was alive, his\nnoble and honest mind indulged in the embellishment of his gardens.I\nwill very briefly quote what history relates:--"The life he led in his\nretreat at _Villebon_, was accompanied with grandeur and even majesty,\nsuch as might be expected from a character so grave and full of dignity\nas his.His table was served with taste and magnificence; he admitted to\nit none but the nobility in his neighbourhood, some of the principal\ngentlemen, and the ladies and maids of honour, who belonged to the\nduchess of Sully.He often went into his gardens, and passing through a\nlittle covered alley, which separated the flower from the kitchen\ngarden, ascended by a stone staircase (which the present duke of Sully\nhas caused to be destroyed), into a large walk of linden trees, upon a\nterrace on the other side of the garden.It was then the taste to have a\ngreat many narrow walks, very closely shaded with four or five rows of\ntrees, or palisadoes.Here he used to sit upon a settee painted green,\namused himself by beholding on the one side an agreeable landscape, and\non the other a second alley on a terrace extremely beautiful, which\nsurrounded a large piece of water, and terminated by a wood of lofty\ntrees.There was scarce one of his estates, those especially which had\ncastles on them, where he did not leave marks of his magnificence, to\nwhich he was chiefly incited by a principle of charity, and regard to\nthe public good.At _Rosny_, he raised that fine terrace, which runs\nalong the Seine, to a prodigious extent, and those great gardens, filled\nwith groves, arbours, and grottos, with water-works.He embellished\n_Sully_ with gardens, of which the plants were the finest in the world,\nand with a canal, supplied with fresh water by the little river Sangle,\nwhich he turned that way, and which is afterwards lost in the Loire.He\nerected a machine to convey the water to all the basons and fountains,\nof which the gardens are full.He enlarged the castle of _La Chapelle\nd\'Angillon_, and embellished it with gardens and terraces."These gardens somewhat remind one of these lines, quoted by Barnaby\nGooche:\n\n   _Have fountaines sweet at hand, or mossie waters,\n   Or pleasaunt brooke, that passing through the meads, is sweetly seene._\n\nThat fine gardens delighted Sully, is evident even from his own\nstatement of his visit to the Duke d\'Aumale\'s, at Anet, near Ivry,\n(where Henry and Sully fought in that famous battle), for he says,--"Joy\nanimated the countenance of Madame d\'Aumale the moment she perceived me.She gave me a most kind and friendly reception, took me by the hand, and\nled me through those fine galleries and beautiful gardens, which make\nAnet a most enchanting place."One may justly apply to Sully, what he\nhimself applies to the Bishop of Evreaux: "A man for whom eloquence and\ngreat sentiments had powerful charms."I had designed some few years ago, to have published a Review of some of\nthe superb Gardens in France, during the reign of Henry IV.and during\nthe succeeding reigns, till the demise of Louis XV., embellished with\nplates of some of the costly and magnificent decorations of those times;\nwith extracts from such of their eminent writers whose letters or works\nmay have occasionally dwelt on gardens.--My motto, for want of a better,\nmight have been these two lines from Rapin,\n\n   _----France, in all her rural pomp appears\n   With numerous gardens stored._\n\nPerhaps I might have been so greedy and insolent, as to have presumed to\nhave monopolized our Shakspeare\'s line,--"I love _France_ so well, that\nI will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine."Isaac Walton gives the following lines from a translation of a German\npoet, which makes one equally fond of England:\n\n   We saw so many woods, and princely bowers,\n   Sweet fields, brave palaces, and stately towers,\n   _So many gardens dress\'d with curious care_,\n   That Thames with royal Tiber may compare.[3] The Encyclopaedia of Gardening has a rich page (35) devoted to Le\nNotre.thus records his genius and his grand and\nmagnificent efforts:--"Ce grand homme fut choisi pour decorer les\njardins du chateau de Vau-le-Vicomte.Il en fit un sejour enchanteur,\npar les ornamens nouveaux, pleins de magnificence, qu\'il y prodigua.On\nvit alors, pour la premiere fois, des portiques, des berceaux, des\ngrottes, des traillages, des labyrinths, &c. embellir varier le\nspectacle des jardins.Le Roi, temoin des ces merveilles, lui donna la\ndirection de tous ses parcs.Daniel moved to the office.Il embellit par son art, Versailles,\nTrianon, et il fit a St.Germain cette fameuse terrasse qu\'on voit\ntoujours avec une nouvelle admiration.Les jardins de Clagny, de\nChantilly, de St.Cloud, de Meudon, de Sceaux, le parterre du Tibre, et\nles canaux qui ornent ce lieu champetre a Fontainbleau, sont encore son\nouvrage.Il demanda a faire voyage de l\'Italie, dans l\'esperance\nd\'acquerir de nouvelles connoissances; mais son genie createur l\'avoit\nconduit a la perfection.Il ne vit rien de comparable a ce qu\'il avoit\nfait en France."Notwithstanding the above just and high tribute, I have no hesitation in\nsaying, that it is not superior to the magic picture which the\nfascinating pen of Mad.de Sevigne has drawn of le Notre\'s creative\ngenius, in her letter of Aug.Many others of this charming\nwoman\'s letters breathe her love of gardens.[4] The Nouveau Dict.thus speaks of the Pere Rapin:--"A un genie\nheureux, a un gout sur, il joignoit une probite exacte, un coeur droit,\nun caractere aimable et des moeurs douces.Il etoit naturellement\nhonnete, et il s\'etoit encore poli dans le commerce des grands.Parmi\nses differentes Poesies Latines, on distingue le Poeme des Jardins.C\'est son chef d\'oeuvre; il est digne du siecle d\'Auguste, dit l\'Abbe\nDes Fontaines, pour l\'elegance et la purete du langage, pour l\'esprit et\nles graces qui y regnent."Among the letters of Rabutin de Bussy, are\nmany most interesting ones from this worthy father.[5] "Rien n\'est plus admirable que la peinture naive que la Pere Vaniere\nfait des amusemens champetres; on est egalement enchante de la richesse\net de la vivacite de son imagination, de l\'eclat et de l\'harmonie de sa\npoesie, du choix de la purete de ses expressions.Il mourut a Toulouse\nen 1739, et plusiers poetes ornerent de fleurs son tombeau."--Nouv.[6] La Comtesse de la Riviere, thus alludes to this convent: "Madame de\nSevigne a pour ce monastere une veneration qui est audela de toute\nexpression; elle assure qu\'on n\'approche pas de ce lieu sans sentir au\ndedans de soi une onction divine."[7] The late Sir U. Price, pays a very high compliment to this exquisite\npoem, in p.i. of his Essays, terming it full of the justest\ntaste, and most brilliant imagery.[8] In the Earl of Harcourt\'s garden, at Nuneham, in Oxfordshire, (laid\nout in some parts under the eye and fine taste of the poet Mason), on a\nbust of Rousseau are these lines:\n\n   Say, is thy honest heart to virtue warm?Approach, behold this venerable form;\n     \'Tis Rousseau!There are attractive pages in this little volume of the Viscount\'s,\nwhich would have interested either Shenstone, or Gainsborough,\nparticularly the pages 59, 143, 145, and 146, (of Mr.Malthus\'s\ntranslation), for in these pages "we feel all the truth and energy of\nnature."131, will enable the reader to judge of\nthe writer\'s style:--"When the cool evening sheds her soft and\ndelightful tints, and leads on the hours of pleasure and repose, then is\nthe universal reign of sublime harmony.It is at this happy moment that\nClaude has caught the tender colouring, the enchanting calm, which\nequally attaches the heart and the eyes; it is then that the fancy\nwanders with tranquillity over distant scenes.Masses of trees through\nwhich the light penetrates, and under whose foliage winds a pleasant\npath; meadows, whose mild verdure is still softened by the transparent\nshades of the evening; crystal waters which reflect all the near objects\nin their pure surface; mellow tints, and distances of blue vapour; such\nare in general the objects best suited to a western exposure.The sun,\nbefore he leaves the horizon, seems to blend earth and sky, and it is\nfrom sky that evening views receive their greatest beauty.The\nimagination dwells with delight upon the exquisite variety of soft and\npleasing colours, which embellishes the clouds and the distant country,\nin this peaceful hour of enjoyment and contemplation."[9] He was enthusiastically devoted to the cultivation of his gardens,\nwhich exhibited enchanting scenery, umbrageous walks, and magnificent\nwater-falls.When thus breathing the pure air of rural life, the\nblood-stained monsters of 1793 seized him in his garden, and led him to\nthe scaffold."He heard unmoved his own sentence, but the condemnation\nof his daughter and grand-daughter, tore his heart: the thought of\nseeing two weak and helpless creatures perish, shook his fortitude.Being taken back to the _Conciergerie_, his courage returned, and he\nexhorted his children to prepare for death.When the fatal bell rung, he\nrecovered all his wonted cheerfulness; having paid to nature the tribute\nof feeling, he desired to give his children an example of magnanimity;\nhis looks exhibited the sublime serenity of virtue, and taught them to\nview death undismayed.When he ascended the cart, he conversed with his\nchildren, unaffected by the clamours of the ferocious populace; and on\narriving at the foot of the scaffold, took a last and solemn farewell of\nhis children; immediately after he was dismissed into eternity."Sir Walter Scott, after noticing "the wild and squalid features" of\nMarat, who "lay concealed in some obscure garret or cellar, among his\ncut-throats, until a storm appeared, when, like a bird of ill omen, his\ndeath-screech was again heard," thus states the death of another of the\nmurderers of the Malherbes:--"Robespierre, in an unsuccessful attempt to\nshoot himself, had only inflicted a horrible _fracture on his\nunder-jaw_.In this situation they were found like wolves in their lair,\nfoul with blood, mutilated, despairing, and yet not able to die.Robespierre lay on a table in an anti-room, his head supported by a deal\nbox, and his hideous countenance half-hidden by a bloody and dirty cloth\nbound round his shattered chin.As the fatal cars passed to the\nguillotine, those who filled them, but especially Robespierre, were\noverwhelmed with execrations.The nature of his previous wound, from\nwhich the cloth had never been removed till the executioner _tore_ it\noff, added to the torture of the sufferer.The shattered jaw dropped,\nand the wretch yelled aloud, to the horror of the spectators.A mask\ntaken from that dreadful head was long exhibited in different nations of\nEurope, and appalled the spectator by its ugliness, and the mixture of\nfiendish expression with that of bodily agony."Malherbes loved to relate an answer made to him by a common\nfellow, during his stay at Paris, when he was obliged to go four times\nevery day to the prison of the Temple, to attend the king: his extreme\nage did not allow him to walk, and he was compelled to take a carriage.One day, particularly, when the weather was intensely severe, he\nperceived, on coming out of the vehicle, that the driver was benumbed\nwith cold."My friend," said Malherbes to him, in his naturally tender\nmanner, "you must be penetrated by the cold, and I am really sorry to\ntake you abroad in this bitter season."--"That\'s nothing, M. de\nMalherbes; in such a cause as this, I\'d travel to the world\'s end\nwithout complaining."--"Yes, but your poor horses could not."--"Sir,"\nreplied the honest coachman, "_my horses think as I do_."[10] I cannot pass by the name of Henry, without the recollection of\nwhat an historian says of him: "L\'Abbe Langlet du Fresnoy a publie\ncinquante-neuf lettres de a bon Roi, dans sa nouvelle edition du Journal\nde Henry III.on y remarque du feu de l\'esprit, de l\'imagination, et\nsur-tout cette eloquence du coeur, qui plait tout dans un monarque.--On\nl\'exortoit a traiter avec rigueur quelques places de la Ligue, qu\'il\navoit redites par la force: _La satisfaction qu\'on tire de la vengeance\nne dure qu\'un moment_ (repondit ce prince genereuse) _mais celle qu\'on\ntire de la clemence est eternelle_.Plus on connoitre Henri, plus on\nl\'aimera, plus on l\'admiriroet."[11] The king, knowing his fine taste for sculpture and painting, sent\nhim to Italy, and the Nouv.gives this anecdote: "La Pape\ninstruit de son merite, voulut le voir, et lui donna une assez longue\naudience, sur la fin de laquelle le Notre s\'ecria en s\'adressant au\nPape: J\'ai vu les plus grands hommes du monde, Votre Saintete, et le Roi\nmon maitre.Il y a grande difference, dit le Pape; le Roi est un grand\nprince victorieux, je suis un pauvre pretre serviteur des serviteurs de\nDieu.Le Notre, charme de cette reponse, oublia qui la lui faisoit, et\nfrappant sur l\'epaule du Pape lui repondit a son tour: Mon Reverend\nPere, vous vous portez bien et vous enterrerez tout la Sacre College.Le\nPape, qui entendoit le Francois, rit du pronostic.Le Notre, charme de\nplus en plus de sa bonte, et de l\'estime particuliere qu\'il temoignoit\npour le Roi, se jeta au cou du Pape et l\'embrassa.C\'etoit au reste sa\ncoutume d\'embrasser tous ceux qui publioient les louanges de Louis XIV.,\net il embrassoit le Roi lui-meme, toutes les fois que ce prince revenoit\nde la campagne."[12] I will conclude by mentioning a justly celebrated man, who, it\nseems was not over fond of his garden, though warmly attached both to\nBoileau, and to Mad.de Sevigne,--I mean that most eloquent preacher\nBossuet, of whom a biographer, after stating that he was so absorbed in\nthe study of the ancient fathers of the church, "qu\'il ne se permettoit\nque des delassemens fort courts.Il ne se promenoit que rarement meme\ndans son jardin.Son jardinier lui dit un jour: _Si je plantois des\nSaint Augustins, et des Saint Chrysostomes, vous les viendriez voir;\nmais pour vos arbres, vous ne vous en souciez guere_."Worlidge, who wrote during part of the reigns of Charles II.judiciously observes, that "the glory of the French\npalaces, often represented to our English eyes in sculpture, are adorned\n_with their beauteous gardens before them_; which wanting, they would\nseem without lustre or grandeur."[14] He was fined L30,000 for having taken a favourite of the king\'s, in\nthe very presence chamber, by the nose, for having insulted him, and\nafterwards dragging him out of the room.[15] It was to this nobleman, that Addison addressed his elegant and\nsublime epistle, after he had surveyed with the eyes and genius of a\nclassical poet, the monuments and heroic deeds of ancient Rome.[16] Lord Chesterfield thus speaks of this distinguished man:--"His\nprivate life was stained by no vices, nor sullied by any meanness.His\neloquence was of every kind; but his invectives were terrible, and\nuttered with such energy of diction and countenance, that he intimidated\nthose who were the most willing and the best able to encounter him."Sir\nW. Chatham Trelawney used to observe of him, that it was impossible for\nthe members of the side opposed to him in the House of Commons to look\nhim in the face when he was warmed in debate: he seemed to bid them all\na haughty defiance."For my own part," said Trelawney, "I never dared\ncast my eyes towards his, for if I did, _they nailed me to the floor_."Smollet says, that he displayed "such irresistible energy of argument,\nand such power of elocution, as struck his hearers with astonishment and\nadmiration.It flashed like the lightning of heaven against the\nministers and sons of corruption, blasting where it smote, and withering\nthe nerves of opposition; but his more substantial praise was founded\nupon his disinterested integrity, his incorruptible heart, his\nunconquerable spirit of independance, and his invariable attachment to\nthe interest and liberty of his country."Another biographer thus\nmentions him:--"His elevated aspect commanded the awe and mute attention\nof all who beheld him, whilst a certain grace in his manner, conscious\nof all the dignities of his situation, of the solemn scene he acted in,\nas well as his own exalted character, seemed to acknowledge and repay\nthe respect he received; his venerable form, bowed with infirmity and\nage, but animated by a mind which nothing could subdue; his spirit\nshining through him, arming his eye with lightning, and cloathing his\nlips with thunder; or, if milder topics offered, harmonizing his\ncountenance in smiles, and his voice in softness, for the compass of his\npowers was infinite.As no idea was too vast, no imagination too\nsublime, for the grandeur and majesty of his manner; so no fancy was too\nplayful, nor any allusion too comic, for the ease and gaiety with which\nhe could accommodate to the occasion.But the character of his oratory\nwas dignity; this presided in every respect, even to his sallies of\npleasantry."[17] Sir Walter Scott\'s attachment to gardens, breaks out even in his\nLife of Swift, where his fond enquiries have discovered the sequestered\nand romantic garden of _Vanessa_, at Marley Abbey.[18] So thought Sir W. Raleigh;\n\n   Sweet violets, love\'s paradise, that spread\n     Your gracious odours...\n   Upon the gentle wing of some calm-breathing wind,\n       That plays amidst the plain.The lines in Twelfth Night we all recollect:\n\n   That strain again;--it had a dying fall:\n   O, it came o\'er my ear like the sweet south\n   That breathes upon a bank of _violets_,\n   Stealing and giving odour.That these flowers were the most favourite ones of Shakspeare, there can\nbe little doubt--Perditta fondly calls them\n\n   ----sweeter than the lids of Juno\'s eyes\n   Or Cytherea\'s breath.When Petrarch first saw Laura: "elle avail une robe verte, sa coleur\nfavorite, parsemee de _violettes_, la plus humble des fleurs."--Childe\nHarold thus paints this flower:\n\n   The sweetness of the violet\'s deep blue eyes\n   (Kiss\'d by the breath of heaven) seems colour\'d by its skies.[19] One almost fancies one perceives Lord Bacon\'s attachment to\ngardens, or to rural affairs, even in the speech he made before the\nnobility, when first taking his seat in the High Court of Chancery; he\nhoped "that these same _brambles_ that _grow_ about justice, of needless\ncharge and expence, and all manner of exactions, might be rooted out;"\nadding also, that immediate and "_fresh_ justice was the _sweetest_."Mason, in a note to his English Garden, after paying a high\ncompliment to Lord Bacon\'s picturesque idea of a garden, thus concludes\nthat note:--"Such, when he descended to matters of more elegance (for,\nwhen we speak of Lord Bacon, to treat of these was to descend,) were the\namazing powers of this universal genius."Pope\'s delight in gardens, is visible even in the condensed\nallusion he makes to them, in a letter to Mr.Digby; "I have been above\na month strolling about in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, from garden\nto garden, but still returning to Lord Cobham\'s, with fresh\nsatisfaction.I should be sorry to see my Lady Scudamore\'s, till it has\nhad the full advantage of Lord Bathurst\'s improvements."[21] A biographer thus speaks of the Prince de Ligne: "Quand les rois se\nreunirent a Vienne en 1814, ils se firent tous un devoir de l\'accuellier\navec distinction, et furent enchante de la vivacite de son esprit, et de\nson intarissable gaiete, qui malgre ses infirmites et son grand age, ne\nl\'avoit pasencore abandonne.Ses saillies, et ses bon mots etoient comme\nautrefois repetes pour tous."His generous heart thus speaks of the\nabused and unfortunate Marie Antoinette:--"The breath of calumny has not\neven respected the memory of the loveliest and best of women, of whose\nspotless heart and irreproachable conduct, no one can bear stronger\nevidence than I. Her soul was as pure as her face was fair; yet neither\nvirtue nor beauty could save the victim of sanguinary liberty."In\nrelating this (says his biographer), his voice faultered, and his eyes\nwere suffused with tears.He thus briefly states, with his usual humour\nand vivacity, his conversation with Voltaire as to the garden at Ferney:\n\n_P.de L._--Monsieur, Monsieur, cela doit vous coupe beaucoup, quel\ncharmant jardin!mon jardinier est un bete: c\'est moi meme qui ait fait\ntout.[22] Monsieur Thomas, in his eulogy of Descartes says, it should have\nbeen pronounced at the foot of Newton\'s statue: or rather, Newton\nhimself should have been his panegyrist.Of this eulogy, Voltaire, in a\nmost handsome letter to Mons.Thomas, thus speaks:--"votre ouvrage\nm\'enchante d\'un bout a l\'autre, et Je vais le relire des que J\'aurai\ndicte ma lettre."The sleep and expanding of flowers are most\ninterestingly reviewed by Mr.187 of his Encyclop., and by\nM. V. H. de Thury, in the above discourse, a few pages preceding his\nseducing description of the magnificent garden of M. de Boursault.So late ago as the year 1804 it was proposed at Avignon, to erect an\nobelisk in memory of Petrarch, at Vaucluse: "il a ete decide, qu\'on\nl\'elevera, vis-avis _l\'ancien jardin_ de Petrache, lieu ou le lit de\nsorgue forme un angle."Walpole observes) was planted by the poet,\nenriched by him with the fairy gift of eternal summer.Pope thus mentions the vines round this cave:--\n\n   Depending vines the shelving cavern skreen,\n   With purple clusters blushing through the green.are devoted to a very\ninteresting research on the gardens of the Romans.Sir Joseph Banks has\na paper on the Forcing Houses of the Romans, with a list of Fruits\ncultivated by them, now in our gardens, in vol.Pulteney gives a list of several manuscripts in the Bodleian\nLibrary, the writers of which are unknown, and the dates not precisely\ndetermined, but supposed to have been written, if not prior to the\ninvention of printing, at least before the introduction of that art into\nEngland.I select the two following.--\n\nNo.De Arboribus, Aromatis, et _Floribus_.Glossarium Latino-anglicum Arborum, _Fructuum_, Frugam, &c.\n\nAnd he states the following from Bib.S. Petri Cant:--\n\nNo.Notabilia de Vegetabilibus, et Plantis.Pulteney observes, that the above list might have been considerably\nextended, but that it would have unnecessarily swelled the article he\nwas then writing.mentions a personage whose attachment to his\ngarden, and one of whose motives for cultivating that garden, does not\ndeserve a notice:--"Attale III.Roi de Pergame, fils de Stratonice,\nsoulla la throne en repandant le sang de ses amis et de sea parens.Il\nabandonna ensuite le soin de ses affaires _pour s\'occuper entirement de\nson jardin_.Il y cultivoit des poisons, tels que l\'aconit et la cigue,\nqu\'il envoyoit quelque fois en present a ses amis.Il mourut 133 ans\navant Jesus Christ."[27] To have completed the various contrasting vicissitudes of this poor\n_Suffolk_ farmer\'s life, he should have added to his other employments,\nthose of another _Suffolk_ man, the late W. Lomax, who had been\n_grave-digger_ at the pleasant town of Bury St.Edmund\'s, for thirty-six\nyears, and who, also, for a longer period than thirty-six years, had\nbeen a _morrice-dancer_ at all the elections for that borough.[28] Gerarde, speaking of good sorts of apples and pears, thus mentions\nthe above named _Pointer_:--"Master Richard Pointer has them all growing\nin his ground at Twickenham, near London, who is a most cunning and\ncurious grafter and planter of all manner of rare fruits; and also in\nthe ground of an excellent grafter and painful planter, Master Henry\nBunbury, of Touthil-street, near unto Westminster; and likewise in the\nground of a diligent and most affectionate lover of plants, Master\nWarner, neere Horsely Down, by London; and in divers other grounds about\nLondon."[29] The fate of this poor man reminds one of what is related of\nCorregio:--"He received from the mean canons of Parma, for his\nAssumption of the Virgin, the small pittance of two hundred livres, and\nit was paid him in copper.He hastened with the money to his starving\nfamily; but as he had six or eight miles to travel from Parma, the\nweight of his burden, and the heat of the climate, added to the\noppression of his breaking heart, a pleurisy attacked him, which, in\nthree days, terminated his existence and his sorrows in his fortieth\nyear."If one could discover a portrait of either of the authors mentioned in\nthe foregoing list, one might, I think, inscribe under each of such\nportraits, these verses:\n\n   Ce pourtrait et maint liure\n   Par le peintre et l\'escrit,\n   Feront reuoir et viure\n   Ta face et ton esprit.They are inscribed under an ancient portrait, done in 1555, which Mr.Dibdin has preserved in his account of Caen, and which he thus\nintroduces: "As we love to be made acquainted with the _persons_ of\nthose from whom we have received instruction and pleasure, so take,\ngentle reader, a representation of Bourgueville."John Parkinson, an apothecary of this city, (yet living, and\nlabouring for the common good,) in the year 1629, set forth a work by\nthe name of _Paradisus Terrestris_, wherein he gives the figures of all\nsuch plants as are preserved in gardens, for the beauty of their\nflowers, in use in meats or sauces; and also an orchard for all trees\nbearing fruit, and such shrubs as for their beauty are kept in orchards\nand gardens, with the ordering, planting, and preserving of all these.In this work he hath not superficially handled these things, but\naccurately descended to the very varieties in each species, wherefore I\nhave now and then referred my reader, addicted to these delights, to\nthis work, especially in flowers and fruits, wherein I was loth to spend\ntoo much time, especially seeing I could adde nothing to what he had\ndone upon that subject before."Hartlib (says Worlidge) tells you of the benefits of _orchard\nfruits_, that they afford curious walks for pleasure, food for cattle in\nthe spring, summer, and winter, (meaning under their shadow,) fewel for\nthe fire, shade for the heat, physick for the sick, refreshment for the\nsound, plenty of food for man, and that not of the worst, and drink also\nof the best."Milton also in the above Tractate thus speaks:--"In those vernal seasons\nof the year, when the air is calm and pleasant, it were an injury and\nsullenness against nature, not to go out and see her riches, and partake\nin her rejoicing with heaven and earth."[32] In the above tract of Dr.Beale\'s, he thus breaks out in praise of\nthe Orchards of this _deep and rich_ county:--"From the greatest person\nto the poorest cottager, all habitations are encompassed with orchards,\nand gardens, and in most places our hedges are enriched with rows of\nfruit trees, pears or apples.All our villages, and generally all our\nhighways, (all our vales being thick set with rows of villages), are in\nthe spring time sweetened and beautified with the blossomed trees, which\ncontinue their changeable varieties of ornament, till (in the end of\nautumn), they fill our garners with pleasant fruit, and our cellars with\nrich and winy liquors.Orchards, being the pride of our county, do not\nonly sweeten, but also purify the ambient air, which I conceive to\nconduce very much to the constant health and long lives for which our\ncounty hath always been famous.We do commonly devise a shadowy walk\nfrom our gardens, through our orchards (which is the richest, sweetest,\nand most embellished grove) into our coppice woods, or timber woods."Beale does not praise the whole of their land.He describes some as\n"starvy, chapt, and cheany, as the basest land upon the Welch\nmountains."He makes amends, however, for this, for he describes the\nnags bred on their high grounds, as very different from our present\nhackney-coach horses; they "are airey and sinewy, full of spirits and\nvigour, in shape like the _barbe_, they rid ground, and gather courage\nand delight in their own speed."[33] A Lady Gerard is mentioned in two letters of Mr.Pope, to W.\nFortescue, Esq.They appear in Polwhele\'s\nHistory of Devonshire."I have just received a note from Mrs.Blount,\nthat she and Lady Gerard will dine here to-day."And "Lady Gerard was to\nsee Chiswick Gardens (as I imagined) and therefore forced to go from\nhence by five; it was a mortification to Mrs.Blount to go, when there\nwas a hope of seeing you and Mr.There are three more\nletters, without date, to Martha Blount, written from the Wells at\nBristol, and from Stowe, in which Pope says, "I have no more room but to\ngive Lady Gerard my hearty services."And "once more my services to Lady\nGerard.""I desire you will write a post-letter to my man John, at what\ntime you would have the pine apples, to send to Lady Gerard."Probably\nMartha Blount\'s Lady Gerard was a descendant of Rea\'s.[34] A most curious account of the _Tulipomania_, or rage for tulips,\nformerly in Holland, may be seen in Phillips\'s Flora Historica.[35] Perhaps no one more truly painted rich pastoral scenes than Isaac\nWalton.This occurs in many, many pages of his delightful _Angler_.The\nlate ardently gifted, and most justly lamented Sir Humphry Davy too, in\nhis _Salmonia_, has fondly caught the charms of Walton\'s pages.His pen\nriots in the wild, the beautiful, the sweet, delicious scenery of\nnature:--"how delightful in the early spring, to wander forth by some\nclear stream, to see the leaf bursting from the purple bud, to scent the\nodours of the bank, perfumed by the violet, and enamelled as it were\nwith the primrose, and the daisy; to wander upon the fresh turf below\nthe shade of trees, whose bright blossoms are filled with the music of\nthe bee."Worlidge, in his Systema Agriculturae, says, that the\ndelights in angling "rouzes up the ingenious early in the spring\nmornings, that they have the benefit of the sweet and pleasant morning\nair, which many through sluggishness enjoy not; so that health (the\ngreatest treasure that mortals enjoy) and pleasure, go hand in hand in\nthis exercise.What can be more said of it, than that the most\ningenious, most use it."Whately, in his usual charming style, thus\npaints the spring:--"Whatever tends to animate the scene, accords with\nthe season, which is full of youth and vigour, fresh and sprightly,\nbrightened by the verdure of the herbage, and the woods, gay with\nblossoms, and flowers, and enlivened by the songs of the birds in all\ntheir variety, from the rude joy of the skylark, to the delicacy of the\nnightingale."John moved to the bedroom.[36] Tusser seems somewhat of Meager\'s opinion:--\n\n   Sow peason and beans, in the wane of the moon,\n   Who soweth them sooner, he soweth too soon;\n   That they with the planet may rest and arise,\n   And flourish, with bearing most plentifull wise.The celebrated Quintinye says, "I solemnly declare, that after a\ndiligent observation of the moon\'s changes for thirty years together,\nand an enquiry whether they had any influence in gardening, the\naffirmative of which has been so long established among us, I perceive\nit was no weightier than old wives\' tales."Mavor) having an influence on the tides and the\nweather, she was formerly supposed to extend her power over all nature.There is a treatise, by _Claude Gadrois_, on the _Influences des\nAstres_.Surely this merits perusal, when the Nouv.thus\nspeaks of him:--"Il etoit ami du celebre Arnauld et meritoit de l\'etre\npar _la justesse de son esprit_ et la purete de ses moeurs, par la bonte\nde son caractere et par la droiture de son coeur."The following wise experiment occurs in an ancient book on husbandry;\nbut if the two parties there mentioned had lived with Leonard Meager,\none must not do him the injustice of supposing he would have been a\nconvert to their opinion:--"_Archibius_ is said to have written (or sent\nword most likely) to _Antiochus_, king of _Syria_, that if you bury a\nspeckled toad inclosed in an earthen pot, in the middle of your garden,\nthe same will be defended from all hurtful weather and tempests."Meager, however, is kept in countenance by Mr.Worlidge, who, in his\nchapter of Prognostics, at the end of his interesting Systemae\nAgriculturae, actually states that\n\nIf dog\'s guts rumble and make a noise, it presageth rain or snow.The cat, by washing her face, and putting her foot over her ear,\nforeshews rain.The squeaking and skipping up and down of mice and rats, portend rain.Leonard Meager thus notices a nurseryman of his day:--"Here follows a\ncatalogue of divers sorts of fruits, which I had of my very loving\nfriend, Captain Garrle, dwelling at the great nursery between\nSpittlefields and Whitechapel; a very eminent and ingenious nurseryman."Perhaps this is the same nurseryman that Rea, in his _Pomona_, mentions.He says (after naming some excellent pear-trees) "they may be had out of\nthe nurseries about London, especially those of Mr.Leonard _Girle_, who will faithfully furnish such as desire these,\nor any other kinds of rare fruit-trees, of whose fidelity in the\ndelivery of right kinds, I have had long experience in divers\nparticulars, a virtue not common to men of that profession."At this\nperiod, the space between Spittlefields and Whitechapel, must have\nconsisted of gardens, and perhaps superb country houses.The Earl of\nDevonshire had a fine house and garden near Petticoat-lane.Sir W.\nRaleigh had one near Mile-end.Some one (I forget the author) says, "On\nboth sides of this lane (Petticoat-lane) were anciently hedges and rows\nof elm trees, and the pleasantness of the neighbouring fields induced\nseveral gentlemen to build their houses here; among whom was the Spanish\nAmbassador, whom Strype supposes was Gondamour."Gondamour was the\nperson to please whom (or rather that James might the more easily marry\nhis son Charles to one of the daughters of Spain, with her immense\nfortune) this weak monarch was urged to sacrifice the life of Raleigh.Within one\'s own memory, it is painful to reflect, on the many pleasant\nfields, neat paddocks, rural walks, and gardens, (breathing pure air)\nthat surrounded this metropolis for miles, and miles, and which are now\nill exchanged for an immense number of new streets, many of them the\nreceptacles only of smoke and unhealthiness.[37] These lines are from him, at whose death (says Sir W. Scott in his\ngenerous and glowing eulogy) we were stunned "by one of those\ndeath-notes which are peeled at intervals, as from an archangel\'s\ntrumpet"--they are from "that mighty genius which walked amongst men as\nsomething superior to ordinary mortality, and whose powers were beheld\nwith wonder, and something approaching to terror, as if we knew not\nwhether they were of good or evil"--they are from "that noble tree which\nwill never more bear fruit, or blossom!which has been cut down in its\nstrength, and the past is all that remains to us of Byron: whose\nexcellences will _now_ be universally acknowledged, and his faults (let\nus hope and believe) not remembered in his epitaph."His "deep\ntransported mind" (to apply Milton\'s words to him) thus continues his\nmoralization:--\n\n   What are the hopes of man?old Egypt\'s king\n     CHEOPS, erected the first pyramid,\n   And largest; thinking it was just the thing\n     To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;\n\n\n\n   But somebody or other rummaging,\n     Burglariously broke his coffin\'s lid:\n   Let not a monument give you, or me, hopes,\n   Since not a pinch of dust remains of CHEOPS.The Quarterly Review, in reviewing Light\'s Travels, observes, that\n"Cheops employed three hundred and sixty thousand of his subjects for\ntwenty years in raising this pyramid, or pile of stones, equal in weight\nto six millions of tons; and to render his precious dust more secure,\nthe narrow chamber was made accessible only by small intricate passages,\nobstructed by stones of an enormous weight, and so carefully closed,\nexternally, as not to be perceptible.Yet how vain are all the\nprecautions of man!Not a bone was left of Cheops, either in the stone\ncoffin, or in the vault, when Shaw entered the gloomy chamber."Sir\nWalter Scott himself, has justly received many eulogies.Perhaps none\nmore heart-felt, than the effusion delivered at a late Celtic meeting,\nby that eloquent and honest lawyer, the present Lord Chief Justice of\nthe Court of Exchequer, in Scotland, which was received by long, loud,\nand continued applause.[38] John Bauhine wrote a Treatise in 1591, De Plantis a Divis sanctisve\nnomen habentibus.has this observation: "Plants, when\ntaken from the places whence they derive their extraction, and planted\nin others of different qualities, _betray such fondness for their native\nearth_, that with great difficulty they are brought to thrive in\nanother; and in this it is that the florist\'s art consists; for _to\nhumour each plant_ with the soil, the sun, the shade, the degrees of\ndryness or moisture, and the neighbourhood it delights in, (for there is\na natural antipathy between some plants, insomuch that they will not\nthrive near one another) are things not easily attainable, but by a\nlength of study and application."[39] What these ruffles and lashes were, I know not.Perhaps the words\nof Johnson may apply to them:--\n\n   Fate never wounds more deep the generous heart,\n   Than when a blockhead\'s insult points the dart.This mournful truth is every where confess\'d,\n   Slow rises worth, by poverty oppress\'d.[40] Barnaby Gooche, in his Chapter on Gardens, calls the sun "the\ncaptaine and authour of the other lights, _the very soule of the\nworld_."[41] A translation of De Lille\'s garden thus pleads:--\n\n   Oh!by those shades, beneath whose evening bowers\n   The village dancers tripp\'d the frolic hours;\n   By those deep tufts that show\'d your fathers\' tombs,\n   Spare, ye profane, their venerable glooms!To violate their sacred age, beware,\n   Which e\'en the awe-struck hand of time doth spare.Whateley observes, that "The whole range of nature is open to\nhim, (the landscape gardener) from the parterre to the forest; and\nwhatever is agreeable to the senses, or the imagination, he may\nappropriate to the spot he is to improve; it is a part of his business\nto collect into one place, the delights which are generally dispersed\nthrough different species of country."[43] At page 24 he says, "_Cato_, one of the most celebrated writers on\nHusbandry and Gardening among the Romans, (who, as appears by his\nIntroduction, took the model of his precepts from the _Greeks_) in his\nexcellent Treatise _De Re Rustica_, has given so great an encomium on\nthe excellence and uses of this good plant, (the Brocoli) not only as to\nits goodness in eating, but also in physick and pharmacy, that makes it\nesteemed one of the best plants either the field or garden produces."[44] His Chapter on the Water-Works of the Ancient Romans, French, &c.\nis charmingly written.Those who delight in the formation of rivers,\nfountains, falls of water, or cascades, as decorations to their gardens,\nmay inspect this ingenious man\'s Hydrostatics.And another specimen of\nhis genius may be seen in the magnificent iron gateway now remaining at\n_Leeswood_, near Mold, and of which a print is given in Pugh\'s _Cambria\nDepicta_.[45] In this volume is a letter written to Switzer, from his "ingenious\nfriend Mr.Thomas Knowlton, Gardener to the Earl of Burlington, who, on\naccount of his own industry, and the opportunity he has had of being\neducated under the late learned Dr.Sherrard, claims a very advanced\nplace in the list of Botanists."This letter is dated Lansborough, July,\n1728.I insert part of this letter:--"I hope, Sir, you will excuse the\nfreedom I take in giving you my opinion, having always had a respect for\nyour endeavours in Husbandry and Gardening, ever since you commenced an\nauthor.Your introduction to, and manner of handling those beloved\nsubjects, (the sale of which I have endeavoured to promote) is in great\nesteem with me; being (as I think) the most useful of any that have been\nwrote on these useful subjects.If on any subject, you shall hereafter\nrevise or write farther upon, any communication of mine will be useful\nor serviceable to you, I shall be very ready to do it.I heartily wish\nyou success in whatever you undertake, as it tends to a publick good."Pulteney says of Knowlton, "His zeal for English Botany was\nuncommonly great, and recommended him successfully to the learned\nBotanists of this country.From Sir Hans Sloane, he received eminent\ncivilities."[46] few short notices occur of names formerly eminent in\ngardening:--"My late ingenious and laborious friend, Mr._Oram_,\nNurseryman, of Brompton-lane.""That great virtuoso and encourager of gardening, Mr."Their beautiful aspects in pots, (the nonpareil) and the middle of a\ndesert, has been the glory of one of the most generous encouragers of\ngardening this age has produced, I mean the Right Honourable the Lord\nCastlemain.""The late noble and most publick spirited encourager of arts and\nsciences, especially gardening, his Grace the Duke of Montague, at\nDitton.""The Elrouge Nectarine is also a native of our own, the name being the\nreverse of _Gourle_, a famous Nurseryman at Hogsden, in King Charles the\nSecond\'s time, by whom it was raised."And speaking of the successful cultivation of vines in the open air, he\nrefers to the garden of a Mr._Rigaud_, near _Swallow-street_; and to\nanother great cultivator of the vine, "of whose friendship I have proof,\nthe Rev._Only_, of _Cottesmore_, in Rutland, some time since\ndeceased; one of the most curious lovers of gardening that this or any\nother age has produced."This gentleman, in 1765, published "An Account\nof the care taken in most civilized nations for the relief of the poor,\nmore particularly in the time of scarcity and distress;" 4to.I believe the same gentleman also published, in 1765, a Treatise "Of the\nPrice of Wheat."[47] Lord Bacon says, "Because the breath of flowers is far sweeter in\nthe air (where it comes and goes, like the warbling of musick) than in\nthe hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that delight, than to know\nwhat be the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air."The Prince\nde Ligne says,\n\n   Je ne veux point avoir l\'orgueilleuse tulipe;\n   _L\'odorat en jardin_ est mon premier principe.The translation of _Spectacle de la Nature_, a very pleasing work,\nobserves that "Flowers are not only intended to beautify the earth with\ntheir shining colours, but the greatest part of them, in order to render\nthe entertainment more exquisite, diffuse a fragrance that perfumes all\nthe air around us; and it should seem as if they were solicitous to\n_reserve their odours for the evening and morn_, when walking is most\nagreeable; but their sweets are very faint during the heat of the day,\nwhen we visit them the least."I must again trespass on the pages of the great Bacon, by briefly\nshewing the _natural wildness_ he wishes to introduce into one part of\nhis garden:--"thickets, made only of sweet-briar and honeysuckle, and\nsome wild vine amongst, and the ground set with violets, strawberries,\nand primroses; for these are sweet, and prosper in the shade."The dew or pearly drops that one sees in a morning on cowslips, remind\none of what is said of Mignon:--"Ses ouvrages sont precieux par l\'art\navec le quel il representoit les fleurs dans tout leur eclat, et les\nfruits avec toute leur fraicheur.La rosee et les goutes d\'eau qu\'elle\nrepand sur les fleurs, sont si bien imitees dans ses tableaux, qu\'on est\ntente d\'y porter la main."It is said also that in the works of\nVan-Huysum, "le veloute des fruits, l\'eclat des fleurs, le transparent\nde la rosee, tout enchante dans les tableaux de ce peintre admirable."Sir U. Price observes of this latter painter, "that nature herself is\nhardly more soft and delicate in her most delicate productions, than the\ncopies of them by Van-Huysum."Two flower pieces by this painter, sold\nat the Houghton sale for 1200_l._\n\nIn the pieces of _Bos_, a Flemish painter, the dew was represented so\nmuch like nature, as to deserve universal approbation.Bernazzano painted strawberries on a wall so naturally, that, we are\ntold, the plaster was torn down by the frequent pecking of peacocks.Amidst these celebrated painters, these admiring judges of nature, let\nus not forget our never-dying Hogarth; his piercing eye even discovers\nitself in his letter to Mr.Ellis, the naturalist:--"As for your pretty\nlittle seed cups, or vases, they are a sweet confirmation of the\npleasure nature seems to take in superadding an elegance of form to most\nof her works, wherever you find them.How poor and bungling are all the\ninventions of art!"[48] The very numerous works of this indefatigable writer, embracing so\nmany subjects, make one think he must have been as careful of his time,\nas the celebrated friend of the witty _Boileau_: the humane, benevolent,\nand dignified Chancellor _Aguesseau_, who finding that his wife always\nkept him waiting an hour after the dinner bell had rung, resolved to\ndevote this time to writing a work on Jurisprudence.He put this project\nin execution, and in the course of time, produced a quarto work in four\nthick volumes.[49] This chesnut tree is thus noticed in a newspaper of August,\n1829:--"The celebrated chesnut tree, the property of Lord Ducie, at\nTortworth, in the county of Gloucester, is the oldest, if not the\nlargest tree in England, having this year attained the age of 1002\nyears, and being 52 feet in circumference, and yet retains so much\nvigour, that it bore nuts so lately as two years ago, from which young\ntrees are now being raised."published in 1717, called the "Lady\'s Recreation,"\nby _Charles_ Evelyn, Esq.There are two letters subjoined, written to\nthis author by the Rev.From page 103, 105, 129 and 141,\none should think this was not the son of the famous Mr.Lawrence, in the Preface to his Kalendar, inserted at the\nend of his fifth edition, assures the public, "that the book called the\nLady\'s Recreation could not be published by my approbation, because it\nwas never seen by me till it was in print; besides, I have reason to\nthink it was an artifice of the booksellers to impose upon the world,\nunder the borrowed name of Evelyn."[51] This sermon was preached for several years by Dr.Colin Milne, by\nwhom it was published in 1799, and afterwards by the Rev.Ellis, of\nMerchant Taylors\' School.Ellis, in his History of Shoreditch, gives\nus much information as to this bequest; in which the handsome conduct of\nMr.Denne, a former vicar, is not the least interesting.of his Literary Anecdotes, bears testimony to Dr.Denne\'s\nfeeling towards the poor and distressed, and to his attachment to\nliterary pursuits.Three of these Sermons are in the second volume of\n"Thirty Sermons on Moral and Religious Subjects, by the Rev.W. Jones, of Nayland, his Theological, Philosophical,\nand Miscellaneous Works, with Life, 12 vols._neat_, 7_l._ 7_s._\n6_d._ 1801.William Jones, of Nayland, Suffolk:\nChaplain to the Right Rev.George Horne, Bishop of Norwich; 1 vol.with Portrait of the Author, price 12_s._ Dove, St.John\'s Square,\nPrinter, 1828."Of this faithful servant of God, (the Rev.W. Jones) I\ncan speak both from personal knowledge and from his writings.He was a\nman of quick penetration, of extensive learning, and the soundest piety;\nand he had, beyond any other man I ever knew, the talent of writing upon\nthe deepest subjects to the plainest understandings."--_Bishop Horsley\'s\nCharges._ The Rev.Samuel Ayscough, of the British Museum, began, in\n1790, to preach this annual sermon, and, I believe, continued it for\nfourteen years.Ellis, of _Little Gaddesden_, in his Practical Farmer, 8vo.1732, thus speaks on this subject:--"What a charming sight is a large\ntree in blossom, and after that, when loaden with fruit, enough perhaps\nto make a hogshead of cyder or perry!A scene of beauty, hopes, and\nprofit, and all!It may be on less than two feet diameter of ground.And\nabove all, what matter of contemplation does it afford, when we let our\nthoughts descend to a single kernel of an apple or pear?And again, how\nheightened, on the beholding so great a bulk raised and preserved, by\nOmnipotent Power, from so small a body."[53] The thought of planting the sides of public roads, was first\nsuggested by the great _Sully_.Weston, in his introduction to these Tracts, seems to have\npleasure in recording the following anecdote of La Quintinye, from\nHarte\'s Essay."The famous La Quintinie, director of the royal gardens\nin France, obtained from Louis XIV.an abbacy for his son, in one of the\nremote provinces; and going soon afterwards to make the abbot a visit,\n(who was not then settled in his apartments) he was entertained and\nlodged by a neighbouring gentleman with great friendliness and\nhospitality.La Quintinie, as was natural, soon examined the gardens of\nhis host; he found the situation beautiful, and the soil excellent; but\nevery thing was rude, savage, and neglected: nature had done much, art\nnothing.The guest, delighted with his friendly reception, took leave\nwith regret, and some months after, sent one of the king\'s gardeners,\nand four under-gardeners, to the gentleman, with strict command to\naccept of no gratuity.They took possession of his little inclosure the\nmoment they arrived, and having digged it many times over, they manured,\nreplanted it, and left one of their number behind them, as a settled\nservant in the family.This young man was soon solicited to assist the\nneighbourhood, and filled their kitchen gardens and fruit gardens with\nthe _best_ productions of every kind, which are preserved and propagated\nto this very hour."_Perrault_, in\nhis _Hommes Illustres_, has given his Life, and Portrait.Gibson, in\nhis Fruit Gardener, calls him "truly an original author;" and further\npays him high compliments.thus speaks of him:--"Il vint a Paris se faire\nrecevoir avocat.Une eloquence naturelle, cultivee avec soin, le fit\nbriller dans le Barreau, et lui consila l\'estime des premiers\nmagistrais.Quoi qu\'il eut peu de temps dont il put disposer, il en\ntrouvoit neanmoins suffisament pour satisfaire la passion qu\'il avoit\npour l\'agriculture.Il augmenta ses connoissances sur le jardinage, dans\nun voyage qu\'il fit en Italie.De retour a Paris, il se livra tout\nentier a l\'agriculture, et fit un grand nombre d\'experiences curieuses\net utiles.Le grand Prince de _Conde_, qui aimoit l\'agriculture, prenoit\nune extreme plaisir a s\'entretenir avec lui; et Charles II.Roi\nd\'Angleterre lui offrit une pension considerable pour l\'attacher a la\nculture de ses Jardins, mais il refusa ses offres avantageuses par\nl\'amour qu\'il avoit pour sa patrie, et trouva en France les recompenses\ndue a son merite.On a de lui un excellent livre, intitule \'Instructions\npour les Jardins Fruitiers et Potagers, Paris, 1725, 2 tom._et\nplusieurs Lettres sur la meme matiere_."Switzer, in his History of\nGardening, says, that in Mons.de la Quintinye\'s "Two Voyages into\nEngland, he gained considerable friendship with several lords with whom\nhe kept correspondence by letters till his death, and these letters,\nsays Perrault, are all _printed at London_."And he afterwards says,\nspeaking of Lord Capel\'s garden at Kew, "the greatest advance made by\nhim herein, was the bringing over several sorts of fruits from France;\nand this noble lord we may suppose to be one that held for many years a\ncorrespondence with Mons.Such letters on such\ncorrespondence if ever printed, must be worth perusal.[55] Lamoignon de Malherbes (that excellent man) had naturalized a vast\nnumber of foreign trees, and at the age of eighty-four, saw every where,\nin France, (as Duleuze observes) plants of his own introduction.The old Earl of _Tweedale_, in the reign of Charles II.and his\nimmediate successor, planted more than six thousand acres, in Scotland,\nwith fir trees.In a Tour through Scotland, in 1753, it mentions, that\n"The county of Aberdeen is noted for its timber, having in it upwards of\nfive millions of fir trees, besides vast numbers of other kinds, planted\nwithin these seventy years, by the gentry at and about their seats."Marshall, in his "Planting and Rural Ornament," states, that "In\n1792, his Grace the Duke of Athol (we speak from the highest authority)\nwas possessed of a thousand larch trees, then growing on his estates of\nDunkeld and Blair only, of not less than two to four tons of timber\neach; and had, at that time, a million larches, of different sizes,\nrising rapidly on his estate."The zeal for planting in Scotland, of late years, has been stimulated by\nthe writings of James Anderson, and Lord Kames.It is pleasing to transcribe the following paragraph from a newspaper of\nthe year 1819:--"Sir Watkin Williams Wynn has planted, within the last\nfive years, on the mountainous lands in the vicinity of Llangollen,\nsituated from 1200 to 1400 feet above the level of the sea, 80,000 oaks,\n63,000 Spanish chesnuts, 102,000 spruce firs, 110,000 Scotch firs,\n90,000 larches, 30,000 wych elms, 35,000 mountain elms, 80,000 ash, and\n40,000 sycamores, all of which are, at this time, in a healthy and\nthriving condition."It is impossible, on this subject, to avoid paying\na grateful respect to the memory of that bright ornament of our church,\nand literature, the late Dr.Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, whose extensive\nplantations, near Ambleside, have long since enriched that part.The\nlate Richard Crawshay (surpassed by no being during the whole course of\nhis very long life, for either integrity or generosity) assured the\npresent writer, that during an early period of Dr.Watson\'s planting, he\noffered him, on the security of his note of hand only, and to be repaid\nat his own entire convenience, ten thousand pounds, and that he (with\ngrateful thanks to Mr.[56] How widely different has the liberal and classic mind of Dr.Alison\nviewed the rich pages of Mr.Whateley, in his deep and learned Essays on\nTaste, first published nearly twenty years after Mr.One regrets that there is no Portrait of Mr.Alison,\nthere is a masterly one by Sir Henry Raeburn, admirably engraved by W.\nWalker, of Edinburgh, in 1823.Perhaps it is one of the finest Portraits\nof the present day.One is happy to perceive marks of health expressed\nin his intellectually striking countenance.[57] In Biographical Anecdotes, 3 vols.appears a correspondence in\nLondon, with Dr.Franklin, and William Whateley, and Joseph Whateley, in\n1774.Temple, by a brother of Thomas\nWhateley.Franklin, it appears, that\ninflammatory and ill-judged letters were written by George Hutchinson,\nand others, to _Thomas_ Whateley, Esq._private Secretary to Lord\nGrenville_, respecting some disturbances in America, concerning Lord\nGrenville\'s Stamp Act.On the death of Thomas, these letters were placed\nin the hands of Dr.Franklin, whose duty, as agent to the colony, caused\nhim to transmit them to Boston.A quarrel arose between William Whateley\nand Mr.Temple, as to which of them gave up those letters, and a duel\nwas fought.Franklin immediately cleared both those gentlemen from\nall imputation.Of the celebrated interview in the council chamber,\nbetween Mr.Franklin, an account is given by Dr.page 1. of the Monthly Magazine, and which candid\naccount entirely acquits Dr.Franklin from having deserved the rancorous\npolitical acrimony of Mr.Wedderburn, whose intemperate language is\nfully related in some of the Lives of Dr.Franklin, and in his Life,\npublished and sold by G. Nicholson, _Stourport_, 12mo.Lord Chatham spoke of Franklin in the highest strain of panegyric, when\nadverting, in the year 1777, to his dissuasive arguments against the\nAmerican war.William Whateley was administrator of the goods and chattels of his\nbrother Thomas, who, of course, died without a will.and Political Tracts, the nineteenth\nchapter consists of his account of two _Political_ Tracts, by Thomas\nWhateley, Esq.and he thus concludes this chapter:--"Mr.Whateley also\nwrote a tract on laying out pleasure grounds."is an\naccount of the quarrel and duel with Mr.It appears that Thomas Whateley died in June, 1772, and left two\nbrothers, William and Joseph.Debrett published "Scarce Tracts," in 4 vols.i. is one\ncalled "The Budget," by D. Hartley, Esq.This same volume contains a\nreply to this, viz."Remarks on the Budget, by Thomas Whateley, Esq.another tract by\nThomas Whateley, Esq.entitled "Considerations on the Trade and Finances\nof the Kingdom."These two pamphlets, upon subjects so very different\nfrom the alluring one on landscape gardening, and his unfinished one on\nShakspeare, convinces us, what a powerful writer he would have been, had\nhis life been longer spared.[58] The reader will be amply gratified by perusing page 158 of the late\nSir U. Price\'s well known Letter to Mr.Morris\'s\nObservations on Water, as regards Ornamental Scenery; inserted in the\nGardener\'s Magazine for May, 1827.Whateley\'s distinction between a\nriver, a rivulet, and a rill, form, perhaps, five of the most seductive\npages of his book.Our own Shakspeare\'s imagery on this subject, should\nnot be overlooked:--\n\n   The current that with gentle murmur glides,\n   Thou know\'st, being stopp\'d, impatiently doth rage;\n   But when his fair course is not hindered,\n   He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones,\n   Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge\n   He overtaketh in his pilgrimage:\n   And so by many winding nooks he strays\n   With willing sport to the wild ocean.[59] The benevolent mind of the marquis shines even in his concluding\nchapter; for he there wishes "to bring us back to a true taste for\nbeautiful nature--to more humane and salutary regulations of the\ncountry--to produce the _moral_ landscapes which delight the mind.His\nview of the good mother, seeing her children playing round her at their\ncottage, near the common, thus "endearing her home, and making even the\nair she breathed more delightful to her, make these sort of commons, to\nme, the most delightful of _English gardens_.The dwellings of the happy\nand peaceful husbandmen would soon rise up in the midst of compact\nfarms.Can there exist a more delightful habitation for man, than a neat\nfarm-house in the centre of a pleasing landscape?There avoiding disease\nand lassitude, useless expence, the waste of land in large and dismal\nparks, and above all, by preventing misery, and promoting happiness, we\nshall indeed have gained the prize of having united the agreeable with\nthe useful.Perhaps, when every folly is exhausted, there will come a\ntime, in which men will be so far enlightened as to prefer the real\npleasures of nature to vanity and chimera."[60] Perhaps it may gratify those who seek for health, by their\nattachment to gardens, to note the age that some of our English\nhorticulturists have attained to:--Parkinson died at about 78;\nTradescant, the father, died an old man; Switzer, about 80; Sir Thomas\nBrowne died at 77; Evelyn, at 86; Dr.Beale, at 80; Jacob Bobart, at 85;\nCollinson, at 75; a son of Dr.Lawrence (equally fond of gardens as his\nfather) at 86; Bishop Compton, at 81; Bridgman, at an advanced age;\nKnowlton, gardener to Lord Burlington, at 90; Miller, at 80; James Lee,\nat an advanced age; Lord Kames, at 86; Abercrombie, at 80; the Rev.Gilpin, at 80; Duncan, a gardener, upwards of 90; Hunter, who published\n_Sylva_, at 86; Speechley, at 86; Horace Walpole, at 80; Mr.Bates, the\ncelebrated and ancient horticulturist of High Wickham, who died there in\nDecember, 1819, at the great age of 89; Marshall, at an advanced age;\nSir Jos.Banks, at 77; Joseph Cradock, at 85; James Dickson, at 89; Dr.Andrew Duncan, at 83; and Sir U. Price, at 83.Loudon, at page 1063\nof his Encyclop.inform us, that a market garden, and nursery, near\nParson\'s Green, had been, for upwards of two centuries, occupied by a\nfamily of the name of Rench; that one of them (who instituted the first\nannual exhibition of flowers) died at the age of ninety-nine years,\nhaving had thirty-three children; and that his son (mentioned by\nCollinson, as famous for forest trees) introduced the moss-rose, planted\nthe elm trees now growing in the Bird-cage Walk, St.James\'s Park, from\ntrees reared in his own nursery, married two wives, had thirty-five\nchildren, and died in 1783, in the same room in which he was born, at\nthe age of a hundred and one years.Reflecting on the great age of some\nof the above, reminds me of what a "Journal Encyclopedique" said of\nLestiboudois, another horticulturist and botanist, who died at Lille, at\nthe age of ninety, and who (for even almost in our ashes _live their\nwonted fires_) gave lectures in the very last year of his life."When he\nhad (says an ancient friend of his) but few hours more to live, he\nordered snow-drops, violets, and crocuses, to be brought to his bed, and\ncompared them with the figures in Tournefort.His whole existence had\nbeen consecrated to the good of the public, and to the alleviation of\nmisery; thus he looked forward to his dissolution with a tranquillity of\nsoul that can only result from a life of rectitude; he never acquired a\nfortune; and left no other inheritance to his children, but integrity\nand virtue."[61] About eighty years previous to Hyll\'s Treatise on Bees, Rucellai,\nan Italian of distinction, who aspired to a cardinal\'s hat, and who\nlaboured with zeal and taste (I am copying from De Sismondi\'s View of\nthe Literature of the South of Europe) to render Italian poetry\nclassical, or a pure imitation of the ancients, published his most\ncelebrated poem on Bees."It receives (says De Sismondi) a particular\ninterest from the real fondness which Rucellai seems to have entertained\nfor these creatures.There is something so sincere in his respect for\ntheir virgin purity, and in his admiration of the order of their\ngovernment, that he inspires us with real interest for them.All his\ndescriptions are full of life and truth."[62] Ben Jonson, in his _Discourses_, gives the following eulogy on this\nillustrious author:--"No member of his speech but consisted of his own\ngraces.His hearers could not cough or look aside from him without loss.He commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at his\ndevotion: no man had their affections more in his power; the fear of\nevery man that heard him was, lest he should make an end."Loudon,\nwhen treating on the study of plants, observes, that "This wonderful\nphilosopher explored and developed the true foundations of human\nknowledge, with a sagacity and penetration unparalleled in the history\nof mankind."applied to the eight books of Hooker\'s\nEcclesiastical Polity, may well apply to the writings of Bacon:--"there\nis no learning that this man hath not searched into.His books will get\nreverence by age, for there is in them such seeds of eternity, that they\nwill continue till the last fire shall devour all learning."Monsieur\nThomas, in his Eulogy of Descartes, says, "Bacon explored every path of\nhuman knowledge, he sat in judgment on past ages, and anticipated those\nthat were to come."The reader will be gratified by inspecting the\nsecond volume of Mr.Malone\'s publication of Aubrey\'s Letters, in the\nBodleian Library, as well as the richly decorated and entertaining\nBeauties of England and Wales, and Pennant\'s Tour from Chester to\nLondon, for some curious notices of the ancient mansion, garden, and\norchard, at Gorhambury.[63] The reader will be amply gratified by Mr.Johnson\'s review of the\ngeneral state of horticulture at this period, in his History of English\nGardening, and with the zeal with which he records the attachment of\nJames I. and Charles, to this science; and where, in a subsequent\nchapter, he glances on the progress of our Botany, and proudly twines\nround the brows of the modest, but immortal, Ray, a most deserved and\ngenerous wreath.[64] I subjoin a few extracts from the first book of his English\nHusbandman, 4to.1635:--"A garden is so profitable, necessary, and such\nan ornament and grace to every house and housekeeper, that the\ndwelling-place is lame and maimed if it want that goodly limbe, and\nbeauty.I do not wonder either at the worke of art, or nature, when I\nbehold in a goodly, rich and fertill soyle, a garden adorned with all\nthe delights and delicacies which are within man\'s understanding,\nbecause the naturall goodnesse of the earth (which not enduring to bee\nidle) will bring forth whatsoever is cast into her; but when I behold\nupon a barren, dry, and dejected earth, such as the Peake-hills, where a\nman may behold snow all summer, or on the East-mores, whose best herbage\nis nothing but mosse, and iron-stone, in such a place, I say, to behold\na delicate, rich, and fruitful garden, it shewes great worthinesse in\nthe owner, and infinite art and industry in the workeman, and makes mee\nboth admire and love the begetters of such excellencies."And again,--"For the situation of the garden-plot for pleasure, you\nshall understand, that it must ever bee placed so neare unto the\ndwelling-house as it is possible, both because the eye of the owner may\nbe a guard and support from inconveniences, as all that the especial\nroomes and prospects of the house may be adorned, perfumed, and inriched\nwith the delicate proportions, odoriferous smells, and wholesome airs\nwhich shall ascend and vaporate from the same."He then gives a variety of cuts of knots and mazes, and labyrinths, of\nwhich he observes, that "many other adornations and beautifyings there\nare, which belong to the setting forth of a curious garden, but for as\nmuch as none are more rare or more esteemed than these I have set down,\nbeing the best ornaments of the best gardens of this kingdome, I think\nthem tastes sufficient for every husbandman or other of better quality,\nwhich delighteth in the beauty, and well trimming of his ground."He\nthus remarks:--"as in the composition of a delicate woman, the grace of\nher cheeke is the mixture of red and white, the wonder of her eye blacke\nand white, and the beauty of her hand blew and white, any of which is\nnot said to be beautifull if it consist of single or simple colours; and\nso in these walkes or alleyes the all greene, nor the all yellow cannot\nbe said to bee most beautifull, but the greene and yellow, (that is to\nsay, the untroade grasse, and the well knit gravell) being equally mixt,\ngive the eye both luster and delight beyond all comparison."His description of the following flower is singular: "_The Crowne\nEmperiall_, is, of all flowers, both forraigne and home-bred, the\ndelicatest, and strangest: it hath the true shape of an imperiall\ncrowne, and will be of divers colours, according to the art of the\ngardener.In the middest of the flower you shall see a round pearle\nstand, in proportion, colour, and orientnesse, like a true naturall\npearle, only it is of a soft liquid substance: this pearle, if you shake\nthe flower never so violently, will not fall off, neyther if you let it\ncontinue never so long, will it eyther encrease or diminish in the\nbignesse, but remaineth all one: yet if with your finger you take and\nwipe it away, in less than an hour after you shall have another arise in\nthe same place, and of the same bignesse.This pearle, if you taste it\nupon your tongue, is pleasant, and sweet like honey: this flower when\nthe sunne ariseth, you shall see it looke directly to the east, with the\nstalk bent lowe thereunto, and as the sunne ariseth higher and higher,\nso the flower will likewise ascend, and when the sunne is come into the\nmeridian or noone poynt, which is directly over it, then will it stand\nupright upon the stalke, and looke directly upward, and as the sunne\ndeclineth, so will it likewise decline, and at the sunne setting looke\ndirectly to the west only."His mention of another flower is attractive:--"Now for your _Wall\nGilliflower_, it delighteth in hard rubbish, limy, and stony grounds,\nwhence it commeth they covet most to grow upon walls, pavements, and\nsuch like barraine places.It may be sowen in any moneth or season, for\nit is a seed of that hardness, that it makes no difference betwixt\nwinter and summer, but will flourish in both equally, and beareth his\nflowers all the yeere, whence it comes that the husbandman preserves it\nmost in his _bee-garden_, for it is _wondrous sweet_, and affordeth much\nhoney.It would be sowen in very small quantity, for after it hath once\ntaken roote, it will naturally of itself overspread much ground, and\nhardly ever after be rooted out.It is of itselfe of so exceeding a\nstrong, and _sweet smell_, that it cannot be forced to take any other,\nand therefore is ever preserved in its owne nature."of Gardening, fondly reviews the taste\nfor flowers which pervaded most ranks during the time of Elizabeth, and\nEvelyn.The _Spectacle de la Nature_, of which we have a translation in 1740,\nhas a richly diffuse chapter on flowers.I here transcribe a small part\nthereof:--\n\n_Prior._ "The beauty of flowers never fails to inspire us with joy; and\nwhen we have sufficiently examined the fairest, we are sensible they are\nonly proper to refresh the sight; and, indeed, the prospect they afford\nis so touching, and we experience their power to be so effectual, that\nthe generality of those arts which are ambitious to please, seem most\nsuccessful when they borrow their assistance.Sculpture imitates them in\nits softest ornaments; architecture bestows the embellishments of leaves\nand festoons on those columns and fronts, which would otherwise be too\nnaked.The richest embroideries are little more than foliage and\nflowers; the most magnificent silks are almost covered with these\ncharming forms, and are thought beautiful, in proportion as they\nresemble the lively tinge of natural flowers."These have always been the symbols, or representations of joy; they\nwere formerly the inseparable ornaments of feasts, and are still\nintroduced with applause, toward the close of our entertainments, when\nthey are brought in with the fruit, to enliven the festival that begins\nto languish.And they are so peculiarly adapted to scenes of pleasure,\nthat they are always considered as inconsistent with mourning.John travelled to the bathroom.Decency,\ninformed by nature, never admits them into those places where tears and\naffliction are predominant._Countess._ "The festivals in the country are never celebrated without\ngarlands, and the entertainments of the polite are ushered in by a\nflower.If the winter denies them that gratification, they have recourse\nto art.A young bride, in all the magnificence of her nuptial array,\nwould imagine she wanted a necessary part of her ornaments, if she did\nnot improve them with a sprig of flowers.A queen, amidst the greatest\nsolemnities, though she is covered with the jewels of the crown, has an\ninclination to this rural ornament; she is not satisfied with mere\ngrandeur and majesty, but is desirous of assuming an air of softness and\ngaiety, by the mediation of flowers._Prior._ "Religion itself, with all its simplicity and abstraction, and\namidst the abhorrence it professes to theatrical pomp, which rather\ntends to dissipate the heart, than to inspire it with a due reverence\nfor sacred mysteries, and a sensibility of human wants, permits some of\nits festivals to be celebrated with boughs, and chaplets of flowers."[66] In his Diary is the following entry:--"1658, 27 Jan.After six fits\nof an ague, died my son Richard, five years and three days old onely,\nbut, at that tender age, a prodigy for witt and understanding; for\nbeauty of body, a very angel; for endowment of mind, of incredible and\nrare hopes.He was all life, all prettinesse.What shall I say of his\nfrequent pathetical ejaculations uttered of himselfe: _Sweete Jesus,\nsave me, deliver me, pardon my sins, let thine angels receive me!_ So\nearly knowledge, so much piety and perfection!for such a child I blesse God in whose bosome he is!"Nanteuil\'s portrait is prefixed to his _Sylva_, 1664; and a fine copy of\nthe same, by Bartolozzi, is prefixed to Hunter\'s _Sylva_.Worlidge\nengraved a fine portrait of him, prefixed to his _Sculptura_.Gaywood\nengraved his portrait for the translation of _Lucretius_.In Walpole\'s\nAnecdotes is his portrait, by Bannerman.[67] In "A Picturesque Promenade round Dorking," are selected many\ninteresting particulars of Mr.[68] Essex lost his head for having said that Elizabeth grew old and\ncankered, and that her mind was as crooked as her carcase.Perhaps the\nbeauty of Mary galled Elizabeth.The Quarterly Review of July, 1828, thus remarks:--"When Elizabeth\'s\nwrinkles waxed many, it is reported that an unfortunate master of the\nMint incurred disgrace, by a too faithful shilling; the die was broken,\nand only one mutilated impression is now in existence.Her maids of\nhonour took the hint, and were thenceforth careful that no fragment of a\nlooking glass should remain in any room of the palace.In fact, the\nlion-hearted lady had not heart to look herself in the face for the last\ntwenty years of her life."She loved Essex, of all\nmen, best; and yet the same axe which murdered Anne Bulleyn, was used to\nrevenge herself on him.The bloody task took three strokes, which so\nenraged the multitude, (who loved Essex) that they would have torn the\nexecutioner to pieces, had not the soldiers prevented them.Hutton,\nin his "Journey to London," observes, that "their vengeance ought to\nhave been directed against the person who caused him to use it."What\nher reflections were on these two bloody acts when on her death-bed, we\nscarcely know.A modern writer on horticulture, nearly concludes a very\npleasing work, by enumerating (with slight historical notices) the\nseveral plants cultivated in our gardens.He thus concludes his account\nof one:--"Queen Elizabeth, in her last illness, eat little but Succory\nPottage."Loudon says it is used "as a fodder for cattle."The\nFrench call it Chicoree _sauvage_.Her taste must have been something\nlike her heart.Poor Mary eat no supper the night previous to _her_ last\nillness.Had it been possible for Elizabeth to have read those pages of\nRobertson, which paint the long succession of calamities which befel\nMary, and the insolence and brutality she received from Darnley, and\nwhich so eloquently plead for her frailties, perhaps even these pages\nwould not have softened her bloody disposition, which she seems to have\ninherited from that insolent monster, her father."Mary\'s sufferings\n(says this enchanting historian) exceed, both in degree and duration,\nthose tragical distresses which fancy has feigned, to excite sorrow and\ncommiseration; and while we survey them, we are apt altogether to forget\nher frailties; we think of her faults with less indignation, and approve\nof our tears as if they were shed for a person who had attained much\nnearer to pure virtue.With regard to the queen\'s person, all\ncontemporary authors agree in ascribing to Mary the utmost beauty of\ncountenance, and elegance of shape, of which the human form is capable.Her hair was black, though, according to the fashion of that age, she\nfrequently borrowed locks, and of different colours.Her eyes were a\ndark grey; her complexion was exquisitely fine, and her hands and arms\nremarkably delicate, both as to shape and colour.Her stature was of an\nheight that rose to the majestic.She danced, she walked, and she rode\nwith equal grace.She sung, and played upon the lute with uncommon\nskill."[69] I will merely give this brief extract as one out of many of great\nforce and beauty, from his _Salmonia_:--"If we look with wonder upon the\ngreat remains of human works, such as the columns of Palmyra, broken in\nthe midst of the desert, the temples of Paestum, beautiful in the decay\nof twenty centuries, or the mutilated fragments of Greek sculpture in\nthe Acropolis of Athens, or in our own Museum, as proofs of the genius\nof artists, and power and riches of nations now past away, with how much\ndeeper feeling of admiration must we consider those grand monuments of\nnature, which mark the revolutions of the globe; continents broken into\nislands; one land produced, another destroyed; the bottom of the ocean\nbecome a fertile soil; whole races of animals extinct; and the bones and\nexuviae of one class covered with the remains of another, and upon the\ngraves of past generations--the marble or rocky tomb, as it were, of a\nformer animated world--new generations rising, and order and harmony\nestablished, and a system of life and beauty produced, as it were, out\nof chaos and death; proving the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness, of\nthe GREAT CAUSE OF ALL BEING!"I must trespass on my reader, by again\nquoting from _Salmonia_:--"I envy no quality of the mind or intellect in\nothers; not genius, power, wit, or fancy; but if I could choose what\nwould be most delightful, and I believe most useful to me, I should\nprefer _a firm religious belief_ to every other blessing; for it makes\nlife a discipline of goodness--creates new hopes, when all earthly hopes\nvanish; and throws over the decay, the destruction of existence, the\nmost gorgeous of lights; awakens life even in death, and from corruption\nand decay calls up beauty and divinity: makes an instrument of torture\nand of shame the ladder of ascent to Paradise; and, far above all\ncombinations of earthly hopes, calls up the most delightful visions of\npalms and amaranths, the gardens of the blest, the security of\neverlasting joys, where the sensualist and the sceptic view only gloom,\ndecay, annihilation, and despair!"[70] In this delightful essay, he says, "the most exquisite delights of\nsense are pursued, in the contrivance and plantation of gardens, which,\nwith fruits, flowers, shades, fountains, and the music of birds that\nfrequent such happy places, seem to furnish all the pleasures of the\nseveral senses."Johnson, in his History of English Gardening, admirably\nconfirms this conflagration argument, by quoting the opinion or\ntestimony of the celebrated Goethe.[72] To this interesting subject is devoted, a part of Mr.Loudon\'s\nconcise and luminous review "Of the Rise, Progress, and Present State of\nGardening in the British Isles;" being chapter iv.[73] Perhaps there are few pages that more awfully paint the sacredness\nof this spot, than page 36 in the fifth edition of Dr.[74] I do not mean to apply to the hospitable table of this reverend\ngentleman, the lines of Peter Pindar:--\n\n   One cut from _venison_, to the heart can speak,\n   Stronger than ten quotations from the _Greek_.[75] I cannot prevent myself from quoting a very small portion of the\nanimated address of another clergyman, the Rev.J. G. Morris, as\nchairman to the Wakefield Horticultural Society.I am certain each one\nof my readers will blame me for not having inserted the whole of this\neloquent appeal.I copy it from the Gardener\'s Magazine for August,\n1828:--"Conscious that I possessed no qualifications to fit me for the\ntask, and feeling that it ill became me to assume it, as I am as yet\nnearly a stranger amongst you; aware, too, that I should be surrounded\nby individuals so much more eligible, inasmuch as they are eminently\ngifted with botanical science and practical knowledge, the result of\ntheir horticultural pursuits and facilities, of which I am quite devoid;\nI wished and begged to decline the proffered honour.It appears,\nhowever, that my entreaties are not listened to, and that your kindness\nand partiality persist in selecting for your chairman one so inadequate\nto the situation.Gentlemen, I take the chair with much diffidence; but\nI will presume to say, that, in the absence of other qualities, I bring\nwith me a passionate love for plants and flowers, for the sweets and\nbeauties of the garden, and no inconsiderable fondness for its more\nsubstantial productions.Gardening, as a recreation and relaxation from\nseverer studies and more important avocations, has exquisite charms for\nme; and I am ready, with old _Gerarde_, to confess, that \'the principal\ndelight is in the mind, singularly enriched with the knowledge of these\nvisible things; setting forth to us the invisible wisdom and admirable\nworkmanship of Almighty God.\'With such predilections, you will easily\ngive me credit, gentlemen, for participating with this assembly in the\nsincerest wishes for the complete and permanent establishment of a\nsociety amongst us, whose object shall be to promote, in the surrounding\ndistrict, the introduction of different sorts of flowers, culinary\nvegetables, fruits, improved culture and management generally, and _a\ntaste_ for botany as a science.These are pursuits, gentlemen, combining\nat once health and innocence, pleasure and utility.Wakefield and its\nvicinity appear to possess facilities for the accomplishment of such a\nproject, inferior to no district within this great palatinate, indeed,\nlittle inferior to any in the kingdom.The country is beautiful and\ncharmingly varied, and, from the diversity of soil, suited to varied\nproductions; the whole thickly interspersed with seats and villas of\npersons of opulence, possessing their conservatories, hot-houses, and\nstoves, their orchards, flower and kitchen gardens: whilst few towns can\nboast (as Wakefield can) of so many gardens within its enclosure,\ncultivated with so much assiduity and skill, so much taste and deserved\nsuccess.Seven years ago, I had the honour to originate a similar\nproject in Preston, in Lancashire, and with the happiest success.In\nthat borough, possessing far less advantages than Wakefield offers, a\nhorticultural society was established, which, in its four annual\nmeetings, assembles all the rank and fashion of a circuit of more than\nten miles, and numbers more than a hundred and twenty subscribers to its\nfunds.Those who have not witnessed the interesting sight, can form but\na faint idea of the animating scene which is presented in a spacious and\nhandsome room, tastefully adorned with the choicest exotics from various\nconservatories, and the more choice, because selected with a view to\ncompetition: decorated with the varied beauties of the parterre, vieing\nwith each other in fragrance, hue, and delicacy of texture; whilst the\ntables groan under the weight of delicious fruits and rare vegetables in\nendless variety, the joint produce of hot-houses, stoves, orchards, and\nkitchen gardens.Figure to yourselves, gentlemen, this elysium, graced\nby some hundreds of our fair countrywomen, an absolute galaxy of\nanimated beauty, and that music lends its aid, and you will agree with\nme that a more fascinating treat could hardly be devised.New flowers,\nnew fruits, recent varieties of those of long standing and established\ncharacter for excellence, are thus introduced, in lieu of those whose\ninferiority is no longer doubtful.New culinary vegetables, or, from\nsuperior treatment or mode of culture, rendered more salubrious and of\nexquisite flavour, will load the stalls of our market-gardeners.Daniel travelled to the bathroom.I call\nupon you, then, gentlemen, for your zealous support.Say not that you\nhave no gardens, or that your gardens are inconsiderable, or that you\nare no cultivators; you are all interested in having good and delicious\nfruits, nutritious and delicate culinary vegetables, and in procuring\nthem at a reasonable rate, which will be the results of improved and\nsuccessful cultivation.At our various exhibitions, let each contribute\nthat in which he excels, and our object will be attained.Gentlemen, I\nfear I have trespassed too long on your patience and indulgence.I will\njust urge one more motive for your warm support of our intended society;\nit is this: that, by diffusing a love of plants and gardening, you will\nmaterially contribute to the comfort and happiness of the laborious\nclasses; for the pleasure taken in such pursuits forms an\nunexceptionable relaxation from the toils of business, and every hour\nthus spent is subtracted from the ale-house and other haunts of idleness\nand dissipation."[76] In the grounds of _Hagley_, were once inscribed these lines:--\n\n   Here Pope!--ah, never must that tow\'ring mind\n   To his loved haunts, or dearer friend return;\n   What art, what friendships!what fame resign\'d:\n   In yonder glade I trace his mournful urn.[77] At Holm-Lacey is preserved a sketch, in crayons, by Pope, (when on\na visit there) of Lord Strafford by Vandyke.It is well known that Pope\npainted Betterton in oil colours, and gave it to Lord Mansfield.The\nnoble lord regretted the loss of this memorial, when his house was\nconsumed at the time of the disgraceful and ignorant riots.[78] Sir Joshua Reynolds used to tell the following anecdote relative to\nPope.--"When Reynolds was a young man, he was present at an auction of\nvery scarce pictures, which attracted a great crowd of _connoisseurs_\nand others; when, in the moment of a very interesting piece being put\nup, Mr.All was in an instant, from a scene of\nconfusion and bustle, a dead calm.The auctioneer, as if by instinct,\nsuspended his hammer.The audience, to an individual, as if by the same\nimpulse, rose up to receive the poet; and did not resume their seats\ntill he had reached the upper end of the room."A similar honour was paid to the Abbe Raynal, whose reputation was such,\nthat the Speaker of the House of Commons observing _him_ among the\nspectators, suspended the business of the house till he had seen the\neloquent historian placed in a more commodious seat.It is painful to\nrelate, that this powerful writer, and good man, who narrowly escaped\nthe guillotine, expired in a garret, in extreme poverty, at the age of\neighty-four; the only property he left being one assignat of fifty\nlivres, worth not threepence in ready money.Perhaps one might have\napplied the following anecdote (told by Dr.Drake in his Literary Hours)\nto Abbe Raynal:--"A respectable character, having long figured in the\ngay world at Paris, was at length compelled to live in an obscure\nretreat in that city, the victim of severe misfortunes.He was so\nindigent, that he subsisted only on an allowance from the parish.Every\nweek bread was sent to him sufficient for his support, and yet at\nlength, he demanded more.\'With whom, sir, is it possible I should live?I am wretched, since I thus solicit charity, and am abandoned by all the\nworld.\'\'But, sir, if you live alone, why do you ask for more bread than\nis sufficient for yourself?\'The other at last, with great reluctance,\nconfessed that he had a dog.The curate desired him to observe, that he\nwas only the distributor of the bread that belonged to the poor, and\nthat it was absolutely necessary that he should dispose of his dog.exclaimed the poor man, weeping, \'and if I lose my dog, who is\nthere then to love me?\'The good pastor took his purse, and giving it to\nhim, \'take this, sir,\' said he; \'this is mine--this I _can_ give.\'"[79] How applicable are Gray\'s lines to Lord Byron himself, now!Can storied urn or animated bust\n     Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?Can honour\'s voice provoke the silent dust,\n     Or flatt\'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?Perhaps in this _neglected_ spot is laid\n     Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire!--\n\n\n\n[80] Mr.Bowles, in some stanzas written since the death of Byron, thus\nfeelingly apostrophizes his noble spirit:--\n\n   But I will bid th\' Arcadian cypress wave,\n     Pluck the green laurel from Peneus\' side,\n   And pray thy spirit may such quiet have\n     That not one thought unkind be murmur\'d o\'er thy grave.[81] Perhaps one motive (no doubt there were numberless others) that\n_might_ have induced Mr.Mason thus to honour the memory of Pope,\n\n   ----_letting cold tears bedew his silver urn_,\n\n_might_ have been from the recollection of his attachment to what\nequally charmed Mr.[82] I know not whether Milton\'s portrait should have been here noticed.In a note to the eloquent, the talented, and graceful "Discours\nd\'Installation, prononce par M. le Vicomte H. de Thury, president de la\nSociete d\'Horticulture de Paris," it is beautifully observed, that\n"Personne n\'a mieux decrit ce delicieux jardin que Milton.Les Anglais\nregardent comme le type de tous les jardins paysagers, et pittoresques,\nla description que fait Milton du jardin d\'Eden, et qui atteste que se\nsublime genie etoit egalement poete, peintre et paysagiste."As I have\nsought for the portraits of Mr.Whateley, and\nhave noticed those of Launcelot Brown, and Mr.Cradock, M.\nR. P. Knight and Sir U. Price, who were all _paysagists_; surely our\ngreat and severe republican was one.The Prince de Ligne speaks thus of Milton:--"les vers enchanteurs de ce\nRoi des poetes, et des _jardiniers_.I do not know that every one will agree with Switzer in the concluding\npart of what he says of Milton, in the History of Gardening, prefixed to\nhis Iconologia:--"But although things were in this terrible combustion,\nwe must not omit the famous Mr.John Milton, one of Cromwell\'s\nSecretaries; who, by his excellent and never-to-be-equalled poem of\nParadise Lost, has particularly distinguished gardening, by taking that\nfor his theme; and shows, that though his eyes deprived him of the\nbenefit of seeing, yet his mind was wonderfully moved with the\nphilosophy, innocence, and beauty of this employ; his books, though\nmixed with other subjects, being a kind of a philosophical body of\ngardening, as well as divinity._had his pen been employed on\nno other subject_."It must be needless reminding my reader, that Mr.Walpole\'s powerful pen\nhas taken care that our mighty poet, (who "on evil days, though fallen,\nand with darkness and solitude compassed round,") shall not be\n_defrauded of half his glory_.It is gratifying to remark, that an edition of Paradise Lost is now\nannounced for publication, in which the zeal of its spirited proprietors\nhas determined, that every word shall be printed in letters of gold.The\nsanction of some of our most distinguished divines, and men of high\nrank, evince the pride with which we all acknowledge the devout zeal and\nmighty powers of the blind poet.Garrick\'s fondness for ornamental gardening, induced him finely\nto catch at this invention, in his inimitable performance of Lord\nChalkstone.Pulteney relates this anecdote of Mr.Miller: "He was the only\nperson I ever knew who remembered to have seen Mr.I shall not\neasily forget the pleasure that enlightened his countenance, it so\nstrongly expressed the _Virgilium tantum vidi_, when, in speaking of\nthat revered man, he related to me that incident of his youth."Ray only meditated a work to have been entitled _Horti_ Angliae.Had he written it, I should have felt a singular pride in introducing\nhis valued name in the present imperfect volume.[85] The generous minded reader will be gratified by referring to the\nkind tribute, paid to the memory of Shenstone, by Mr.Johnson, in his History\nof Gardening, thus speaks:--"Taken as a whole, it is the most complete\nbook of gardening ever published;"--and that, with the exception of\nchymistry, "every art and science, at all illustrative of gardening, are\nmade to contribute their assistance."[86] In his "Unconnected Thoughts" he admires the _Oak_, for "its\nmajestic appearance, the rough grandeur of its bark, and the wide\nprotection of its branches: a large, branching, aged oak, is, perhaps,\nthe most venerable of all inanimate objects."[87] Tea was the favourite beverage of Dr.When Hanway\npronounced his anathema against it, Johnson rose in defence of it,\ndeclaring himself "in that article a hardened sinner, having for years\ndiluted my meals with the infusion of that fascinating plant; my\ntea-kettle has had no time to cool; with tea I have solaced the midnight\nhour, and with tea welcomed the morning."Pennant was a great lover\nof tea; a hardy honest Welch parson, on hearing that he usually retired\nin the afternoon to his summer-house to enjoy that beverage, was moved\nwith indignation, that any thing weaker than ale or wine should be drunk\nthere; and calling to mind the good hunting times of old, passionately\nexclaimed, "his father would have scorned it."[88] Sir Uvedale thus expresses his own sensations when viewing some of\nthese plantations:--"The inside fully answers to the dreary appearance\nof the outside; of all dismal scenes it seems to me the most likely for\na man to hang himself in; he would, however, find some difficulty in the\nexecution, for amidst the endless multitude of stems, there is rarely a\nsingle side branch to which a rope could be fastened.The whole wood is\na collection of tall naked poles.... Even its gloom is without\nsolemnity; it is only dull and dismal; and what light there is, like\nthat of hell,\n\n   _Serves only to discover scenes of woe,\n   Regions of sorrow, doleful shades._"\n\n\n\n[89] This observation confirms what Sir U. Price so pointedly enforces\nthroughout the whole of his causticly sportive letter to Mr.Repton:\n"that the best landscape painters would be the best landscape gardeners,\nwere they to turn their minds to the practical part; consequently, a\nstudy of their works, the most useful study to an improver."--And that\n"Van Huysum would be a much better judge of the merits and defects of\nthe most dressed scene--of a mere flower garden,--than a gardener."Browne was not an author; yet the title of the present volume\nis "On the Portraits of English _Authors_ on Gardening."Neither was old\nBridgman nor Kent _authors_ on this subject; still I could not prevail\non myself to pass over such names in total silence.Clive resided at Moreton-Say, near Market-Drayton.He was a\nprebend of Westminster.In\nhis village, scarcely a poor man existed.His kindness and benevolence\nto the poor, could only be equalled by his friendly hospitality and kind\nfeeling to the more affluent in his neighbourhood:\n\n   _Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,\n   Follow thee up to joy and bliss for ever._\n\nMiss Seward thus concludes one of her letters to him:--"I wish none were\npermitted to enter the lists of criticism but those who feel poetic\nbeauty as keenly as yourself, and who have the same generous desire that\nothers should feel it."Clive with gratitude, from a\nrecollection of kindnesses received from him at a very early period of\nmy life, and which were of such a nature, as could not fail to animate\nthe mind of a young man to studious exertions.Archdeacon Plimley (now\nthe truly venerable Archdeacon Corbet, and who has been so long an\nhonour to his native county), in his Agricultural Survey of Shropshire,\nrespectfully introduces Mr.Clive\'s name; and when he addressed his\ncharge to the diocese of Hereford, in 1793, one really cannot but apply\nto Mr.Clive, what he so eloquently enforces in that charge to each\nclergyman:--"to cultivate a pure spirit within their own bosoms; to be\nin every instance the right-hand neighbour to each parishioner; their\nprivate adviser, their public monitor, their example in christian\nconduct, their joy in health, their consolation in sickness."Archdeacon Clive, lies buried Robert Lord Clive,\nconqueror of _Plassy_: on whose death appeared these extempore lines, by\na man of distinction, a friend to Lord Clive:--\n\n   Life\'s a surface, slippery, glassy,\n   Whereon tumbled Clive of Plassy;\n   All the wealth the east could give,\n   Brib\'d not death to let him live:\n   There\'s no distinction in the grave\n   \'Twixt the nabob and the slave.His lordship\'s death, in 1774, was owing to the same cause which\nhastened that of the most worthy of men, Sir Samuel Romilly--from\nshattered and worn out nerves;--from severe study in the latter, and\nfrom the burning climate of the east in the former.Had Lord Clive lived\na few years longer, he would have enriched the whole neighbourhood round\nhis native spot.His vigorous, ardently-gifted, and penetrating mind,\nprojected plantations and other improvements, that could only have been\nconceived by such minds as Olivier de Serres, or by Sully, or by our own\nEvelyn.He was generous, social and\nfriendly; and if ever charity to the poor warmed the breast of any\nmortal, it warmed that of Lord Clive.Few men had more kind affections\nthan Lord Clive.[92] The following passage from a favourite book of Dr.Darwin\'s, (the\nSystem of Nature, by Linnaeus) will well apply to that searching and\npenetrating mind, which so strongly possessed him through life.--"How\nsmall a part of the great works of nature is laid open to our eyes, and\nhow many things are going on in secret which we know nothing of!How\nmany things are there which this age first was acquainted with!How many\nthings that we are ignorant of will come to light when all memory of us\nshall be no more!for nature does not at once reveal all her secrets.We\nare apt to look on ourselves as already admitted into the sanctuary of\nher temple; we are still only in the porch."How full of grace, of\ntenderness, and passion, is that elegy, which he composed the night he\nfeared a life he so passionately loved (Mrs.Pole, of Radburn,) was in\nimminent danger, and when he dreamed she was dead:\n\n   Stretch\'d on her sable bier, the grave beside,\n     A snow-white shroud her breathless bosom bound,\n   O\'er her white brow the _mimic lace_ was tied,\n     And loves, and virtues, hung their garlands round.From these cold lips did softest accents flow?Round that pale mouth did sweetest dimples play?On this dull cheek the rose of beauty blow,\n     And those dim eyes diffuse celestial rays?Did this cold hand unasking want relieve,\n     Or wake the lyre to every rapturous sound?How sad, for other\'s woes, this breast could heave!How light this heart, for other\'s transport, bound![93] It was at this period of his residence at Lichfield, that the\npresent writer heard him strongly enforce the cultivation of _papaver\nsomniferum_.What he may have also enforced to others, may possibly have\ngiven rise to some of those ingenious papers on its cultivation, which\nare inserted not only in the Transactions of the Society for the\nEncouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce; in other publications,\nbut in the first and fifth volumes of the Memoirs of the Caledonian\nHorticultural Society.Jones, on its\ncultivation, in the former of these transactions, are particularly\ndiffuse and valuable.The subjoined plate is a copy of that in the title page to\n"_Opiologia_, ou traicte concernant le naturel proprietes, vraye\npreparation, et seur vsage de l\'opium," a favourite volume with Dr.Darwin, printed at _la Haye_, 1614, 12mo.Darwin, in his Botanical\nGarden, thus speaks of opium: "the finest opium is procured by wounding\nthe heads of large poppies with a three-edged knife, and tying\nmuscle-shells to them, to catch the drops.In small quantities it\nexhilirates the mind, raises the passions, and invigorates the body; in\nlarge ones, it is succeeded by intoxication, languor, stupor, and\ndeath."[94] _Sterne_ mentions a traveller who always set out with the spleen\nand jaundice,--"without one generous connection, or pleasurable anecdote\nto tell of,--travelling straight on, looking neither to his right hand\nor his left, lest love or pity should seduce him out of the road."Loudon seems to be a very different kind of a traveller: for his\nhorticultural spirit and benevolent views, pervade almost every page of\nhis late tour through _Bavaria_.One envies his feelings, too, in\nanother rural excursion, through the romantic scenery of _Bury_, at Mr.Hope\'s at _Deepdene_; and particularly when he\npaints his own emotions on viewing the room of sculpture there.He even\ncould not, in October last, take his rural ride from _Edgware_ to _St.Alban\'s_ without thus awakening in each traveller a love of gardens, and\ngiving this gentle hint to an honest landlord:--"A new inn, in the\noutskirts of _St.Alban\'s_, in the _Dunstable_ road, has an ample\ngarden, not made the most of.Such a piece of ground, and a gardener of\ntaste, would give an inn, so situated, so great a superiority, that\n_every one would be tempted to stop there_; but the garden of this\nBoniface, exhibits but the beginning of a good idea."When travelling\nalong our English roads, his mind no doubt frequently reverts to those\nroad-side gardens in the Netherlands, which he thus happily adverts to\nin p.32 of his Encyclopaedia: "The gardens of the cottagers in these\ncountries, are undoubtedly better managed and more productive than those\nof any other country; no man who has a cottage is without a garden\nattached; often small, but rendered useful to a poor family, by the high\ndegree of culture given to it."Linnaeus, in his eloquent oration at\nUpsal, enforces the pleasure of travelling in one\'s own country, through\nits fields _and roads_.Heath, the zealous and affectionate\nhistorian of Monmouth, in his account of that town and its romantic\nneighbourhood, (published in 1804,) omits no opportunity of noticing the\nmany neat gardens, which add to the other rural charms of its rich\nscenery, thus mentions another Boniface:--"The late Thomas Moxley, who\nkept the public-house at Manson Cross, was a person that took great\ndelight in fruit-trees, and had a large piece of ground let him, for the\npurpose of planting it with apple-trees; but his death (which followed\nsoon after) prevented the plan from being carried to the extent he\nintended, though some of the land bears evidence of his zeal and\nlabour."Heath cannot even travel on the turnpike road, from\nMonmouth to Hereford, without benevolently remarking, that "a number of\nlaborious families have erected small tenements, with a garden to each,\nmost of which are thickly planted with apple-trees, whose produce\nconsiderably adds to the owner\'s support."[95] Of this celebrated biographer of Dr.Darwin (whose Verses to the\nMemory of Mr.Garrick, and whose Monody on Captain Cook, will live as\nlong as our language is spoken,) Sir W. Scott thus describes his first\npersonal interview with:--"Miss Seward, when young, must have been\nexquisitely beautiful; for, in advanced age, the regularity of her\nfeatures, the fire and expression of her countenance, gave her the\nappearance of beauty, and almost of youth.Her eyes were auburn, of the\nprecise shade and hue of her hair, and possessed great expression.In\nreciting, or in speaking with animation, they appeared to become darker;\nand, as it were, to flash fire.I should have hesitated to state the\nimpression which this peculiarity made upon me at the time, had not my\nobservation been confirmed by that of the first actress of this or any\nother age, with whom I lately happened to converse on our deceased\nfriend\'s expressive powers of countenance."[96] From one of these pleasing sermons I extract these few\nlines:--"Among the most pleasing sights of a country village, is that of\na father and mother, followed by their family of different ages, issuing\nfrom their little dwelling on a Sunday morning, as the bell tolls to\nchurch.The children, with their ruddy, wholesome looks, are all neat\nand clean.Their behaviour at church shews what an impression their\nparents have given them of the holiness of the place, and of the duties\nthey have to perform.Though unregarded, as they return home, by their\nricher neighbours, they carry back with them to their humble cottage the\nblessing of God.--Pious parents!lead on your children from church to\nheaven.an account of\nsome of the most remarkable places in North Wales.de Voltaire was so charmed with the taste and talents, and\npolite engaging manners of La Fage, that he paid him the following\ncompliment; which may very justly be applied to Mr.Cradock:\n\n   _Il recut deux presens des Dieux,\n   Les plus charmans qu\'ils puissent faire;\n   L\'un etoit le talent de plaire,\n   L\'autre le secret d\'etre heureux._\n\n\n\n[99] The Quarterly Review for April, 1821, observes, that "The total\nnumber of exotics, introduced into this country, appears to be 11,970,\nof which the first forty-seven species, including the orange, apricot,\npomegranate, &c. were introduced previously or during the reign of Henry\nVIII., and no fewer than 6756 in the reign of George III.For this proud\naccession to our exotic botany in the last century, the public are\nchiefly indebted to Sir Joseph Banks, and Messrs.Lee and Kennedy, of\nthe Hammersmith nursery."[100] The invocation to this Vale, reminds one of Mr.Repton\'s\ndescription:--"Downton Vale, near Ludlow, one of the most beautiful and\nromantic valleys that the imagination can conceive.It is impossible by\ndescription to convey an idea of its natural charms, or to do justice to\nthat taste which has displayed these charms to the greatest advantage,\n\n   _With art clandestine, and conceal\'d design._\n\nA narrow, wild, and natural path, sometimes creeps under the beetling\nrock, close by the margin of a mountain stream.It sometimes ascends to\nan awful precipice, from whence the foaming waters are heard roaring in\nthe dark abyss below, or seen wildly dashing against its opposite banks;\nwhile, in other places, the course of the river _Teme_ being impeded by\nnatural ledges of rock, the vale presents a calm, glassy mirror, that\nreflects the surrounding foliage.The path, in various places, crosses\nthe water by bridges of the most romantic and contrasted forms; and,\nbranching in various directions, including some miles in length, is\noccasionally varied and enriched by caves and cells, hovels, and covered\nseats, or other buildings, in perfect harmony with the wild but pleasing\nhorrors of the scene."[101] Foxley, this far-famed seat of dignified and benevolent\nretirement, has on many occasions become interesting.It gave a peaceful asylum to Benjamin Stillingfleet, when\nhis mind was depressed by disappointment.The then owner, Robert Price,\nEsq.and his mild and amiable lady, both kindly pressed him to become an\ninmate of their domestic retreat, that his health might be restored, and\nhis mind calmed; and though he modestly refused being a constant\nintruder, yet he took up his residence in a cottage near them, and\ndelighted to pass his leisure hours in their happy domestic circle,\n"blending his studious pursuits, with rural occupations," and\nparticularly with gardening.No doubt, to this protecting kindness, may,\non this spot, have been imbibed his great veneration for Theophrastus;\nand here he must have laid the foundation of those attainments, which,\nduring the future periods of his life, obtained for him the high\napprobation of the justly celebrated Mrs.Montagu, who, in her letters,\nspeaks of "this invaluable friend," in the highest possible terms of\npraise.In this peaceful and consoling retreat, was written his original\nand masterly tribute to the talents of Xenophon; and here was first\nkindled his deep enthusiastic zeal for the classic authors of antiquity;\nand the materials for his then intended edition of Milton (who he says\nequalled all the ancients whom he imitated; the sublimity of Homer, the\nmajesty of Sophocles, the softness of Theocritus, and the gaiety of\nAnacreon,) enriched with parallel passages from holy writ, the classics,\nand the early Italian poets; and here he composed his matchless treatise\non the power and principles of Tartini\'s music (for it seems Mr.Price\nhimself "was a master of the art.")Here too, most probably, he\nsketched, or first gathered, his early memoranda towards his future\ngeneral history of husbandry, from the earliest ages of the world to his\nown time; and fostered a devoted zeal for Linnaeus, which produced that\nspirited eulogium on him, which pervades the preface to his translation\nof "Miscellaneous Tracts on Natural History."[102] Sir Uvedale, about fifty years ago, translated _Pausanias_ from\nthe Greek.One may judge of the feeling with which he dwelt on the pages\nof this book, by what he says of that nation in vol.65 of his\nEssays, where he speaks of being struck with the extreme richness of\nsome of the windows of our cathedrals and ruined abbeys: "I hope it will\nnot be supposed, that by admiring the picturesque circumstances of the\nGothic, I mean to undervalue the symmetry and beauty of Grecian\nbuildings: whatever comes to us from the Greeks, has an irresistible\nclaim to our admiration; that distinguished people seized on the true\npoints both of beauty and grandeur in all the arts, and their\narchitecture has justly obtained the same high pre-eminence as their\nsculpture, poetry, and eloquence."[103] On the pomp of devotion in our ancient abbeys, Mr.R. P. Knight\nthus interests his readers, in the chapter "Of the Sublime and\nPathetic," in the Inquiry into the principles of Taste:--"Every person\nwho has attended the celebration of high mass, at any considerable\necclesiastical establishment, must have felt how much the splendour and\nmagnificence of the Roman Catholic worship tends to exalt the spirit of\ndevotion, and to inspire the soul with rapture and enthusiasm.Not only\nthe impressive melody of the vocal and instrumental music, and the\nimposing solemnity of the ceremonies, but the pomp and brilliancy of the\nsacerdotal garments, and the rich and costly decorations of the altar,\nraise the character of religion, and give it an air of dignity and\nmajesty unknown to any of the reformed churches."he thus adverts to the effects of\nthe levelling system of Launcelot Browne:--"From this influence of\nfashion, and the particular influence of Mr.Browne, models of old\ngardens are in this country still scarcer in nature than in painting;\nand therefore what good parts there may be in such gardens, whether\nproceeding from original design, or from the changes produced by time\nand accident, can no longer be observed; and yet, from these specimens\nof ancient art, however they may be condemned as old fashioned, many\nhints might certainly be taken, and blended with such modern\nimprovements as really deserve the name."--"Were my arguments in favour\nof many parts of the old style of gardening ever so convincing, the most\nI could hope from them at present, would be, to produce _some caution_;\nand to assist in preserving some of the few remains of old magnificence\nthat still exist, by making the owner less ready to listen to a\nprofessor, whose interest it is to recommend total demolition."R.\nP. Knight, in a note to his _landscape_, thus remarks on this subject:\n"I remember a country clock-maker, who being employed to clean a more\ncomplex machine than he had been accustomed to, very confidently took it\nto pieces; but finding, when he came to put it together again, some\nwheels of which he could not discover the use, very discreetly carried\nthem off in his pocket.The simple artifice of this prudent mechanic,\nalways recurs to my mind, when I observe the manner in which our modern\nimprovers repair and embellish old places; not knowing how to employ the\nterraces, mounds, avenues, and other features which they find there,\nthey take them all away, and cover the places which they occupied with\nturf.It is a short and easy method of proceeding; and if their\nemployers will be satisfied with it, they are not to be blamed for\npersevering in it, as it may be executed by proxy, as well as in\nperson."Severely (and no doubt justly), as the too generally smooth and\nmonotonous system of Mr.Browne has been condemned, yet he must have had\ngreat merit to have obtained the many encomiums he did obtain from some\nof our first nobility and gentry.The _evil_ which he did in many of\ntheir altered pleasure-grounds, _lives after him--the good is oft\ninterred in his grave_.George Mason justly observes that "Nature\'s favourite haunts\nare the school of gardening."Chrysostom said of Xenophon, that "he had something of\nwitchcraft in his writings."It would not be too much to say the same of\nthis poet."Confoond ye, Hillocks, what are ye ploiterin\' aboot here for in the\nweet wi\' a face like a boiled beet?<DW37> ye no ken that ye\'ve a titch o\'\nthe rose (erysipelas), and ocht tae be in the hoose?Gae hame wi\' ye\nafore a\' leave the bit, and send a haflin for some medicine.Ye donnerd\nidiot, are ye ettlin tae follow Drums afore yir time?"And the medical\nattendant of Drumtochty continued his invective till Hillocks started,\nand still pursued his  retreating figure with medical directions of a\nsimple and practical character.[Illustration: "THE GUDEWIFE IS KEEPIN\' UP A DING-DONG"]\n\n"A\'m watchin\', an\' peety ye if ye pit aff time.Keep yir bed the\nmornin\', and dinna show yir face in the fields till a\' see ye.A\'ll gie\nye a cry on Monday--sic an auld fule--but there\'s no are o\' them tae\nmind anither in the hale pairish."Hillocks\' wife informed the kirkyaird that the doctor "gied the gudeman\nan awfu\' clear-in\'," and that Hillocks "wes keepin\' the hoose," which\nmeant that the patient had tea breakfast, and at that time was wandering\nabout the farm buildings in an easy undress with his head in a plaid.It was impossible for a doctor to earn even the most modest competence\nfrom a people of such scandalous health, and so MacLure had annexed\nneighbouring parishes.His house--little more than a cottage--stood on\nthe roadside among the pines towards the head of our Glen, and from this\nbase of operations he dominated the wild glen that broke the wall of the\nGrampians above Drumtochty--where the snow drifts were twelve feet deep\nin winter, and the only way of passage at times was the channel of the\nriver--and the moorland district westwards till he came to the Dunleith\nsphere of influence, where there were four doctors and a hydropathic.Drumtochty in its length, which was eight miles, and its breadth, which\nwas four, lay in his hand; besides a glen behind, unknown to the world,\nwhich in the night time he visited at the risk of life, for the way\nthereto was across the big moor with its peat holes and treacherous\nbogs.And he held the land eastwards towards Muirtown so far as Geordie,\nthe Drumtochty post, travelled every day, and could carry word that the\ndoctor was wanted.He did his best for the need of every man, woman and\nchild in this wild, straggling district, year in, year out, in the snow\nand in the heat, in the dark and in the light, without rest, and without\nholiday for forty years.One horse could not do the work of this man, but we liked best to see\nhim on his old white mare, who died the week after her master, and the\npassing of the two did our hearts good.It was not that he rode\nbeautifully, for he broke every canon of art, flying with his arms,\nstooping till he seemed to be speaking into Jess\'s ears, and rising in\nthe saddle beyond all necessity.But he could rise faster, stay longer\nin the saddle, and had a firmer grip with his knees than any one I ever\nmet, and it was all for mercy\'s sake.When the reapers in harvest time\nsaw a figure whirling past in a cloud of dust, or the family at the foot\nof Glen Urtach, gathered round the fire on a winter\'s night, heard the\nrattle of a horse\'s hoofs on the road, or the shepherds, out after the\nsheep, traced a black speck moving across the snow to the upper glen,\nthey knew it was the doctor, and, without being conscious of it, wished\nhim God speed.[Illustration]\n\nBefore and behind his saddle were strapped the instruments and medicines\nthe doctor might want, for he never knew what was before him.There were\nno specialists in Drumtochty, so this man had to do everything as best\nhe could, and as quickly.He was chest doctor and doctor for every other\norgan as well; he was accoucheur and surgeon; he was oculist and aurist;\nhe was dentist and chloroformist, besides being chemist and druggist.It was often told how he was far up Glen Urtach when the feeders of the\nthreshing mill caught young Burnbrae, and how he only stopped to change\nhorses at his house, and galloped all the way to Burnbrae, and flung\nhimself off his horse and amputated the arm, and saved the lad\'s life."You wud hae thocht that every meenut was an hour," said Jamie Soutar,\nwho had been at the threshing, "an\' a\'ll never forget the puir lad lying\nas white as deith on the floor o\' the loft, wi\' his head on a sheaf, an\'\nBurnbrae haudin\' the bandage ticht an\' prayin\' a\' the while, and the\nmither greetin\' in the corner.she cries, an\' a\' heard the soond o\' the horse\'s\nfeet on the road a mile awa in the frosty air.said Burnbrae, and a\' slippit doon the ladder\nas the doctor came skelpin\' intae the close, the foam fleein\' frae his\nhorse\'s mooth.wes a\' that passed his lips, an\' in five meenuts he hed\nhim on the feedin\' board, and wes at his wark--sic wark, neeburs--but he\ndid it weel.An\' ae thing a\' thocht rael thochtfu\' o\' him: he first sent\naff the laddie\'s mither tae get a bed ready."Noo that\'s feenished, and his constitution \'ill dae the rest," and he\ncarried the lad doon the ladder in his airms like a bairn, and laid him\nin his bed, and waits aside him till he wes sleepin\', and then says he:\n\'Burnbrae, yir gey lad never tae say \'Collie, will yelick?\'for a\' hevna\ntasted meat for saxteen hoors.\'"It was michty tae see him come intae the yaird that day, neeburs; the\nverra look o\' him wes victory."[Illustration: "THE VERRA LOOK O\' HIM WES VICTORY"]\n\nJamie\'s cynicism slipped off in the enthusiasm of this reminiscence, and\nhe expressed the feeling of Drumtochty.No one sent for MacLure save in\ngreat straits, and the sight of him put courage in sinking hearts.But\nthis was not by the grace of his appearance, or the advantage of a good\nbedside manner.A tall, gaunt, loosely made man, without an ounce of\nsuperfluous flesh on his body, his face burned a dark brick color by\nconstant exposure to the weather, red hair and beard turning grey,\nhonest blue eyes that look you ever in the face, huge hands with wrist\nbones like the shank of a ham, and a voice that hurled his salutations\nacross two fields, he suggested the moor rather  than the drawing-room.But what a clever hand it was in an operation, as delicate as a woman\'s,\nand what a kindly voice it was in the humble room where the shepherd\'s\nwife was weeping by her man\'s bedside.He was "ill pitten the gither" to\nbegin with, but many of his physical defects were the penalties of his\nwork, and endeared him to the Glen.That ugly scar that cut into his\nright eyebrow and gave him such a sinister expression, was got one night\nJess slipped on the ice and laid him insensible eight miles from home.His limp marked the big snowstorm in the fifties, when his horse missed\nthe road in Glen Urtach, and they rolled together in a drift.MacLure\nescaped with a broken leg and the fracture of three ribs, but he never\nwalked like other men again.He could not swing himself into the saddle\nwithout making two attempts and holding Jess\'s mane.Neither can you\n"warstle" through the peat bogs and snow drifts for forty winters\nwithout a touch of rheumatism.But they were honorable scars, and for\nsuch risks of life men get the Victoria Cross in other fields.[Illustration: "FOR SUCH RISKS OF LIFE MEN GET THE VICTORIA CROSS IN\nOTHER FIELDS"]\n\nMacLure got nothing but the secret affection of the Glen, which knew\nthat none had ever done one-tenth as much for it as this ungainly,\ntwisted, battered figure, and I have  seen a Drumtochty face\nsoften at the sight of MacLure limping to his horse.Hopps earned the ill-will of the Glen for ever by criticising\nthe doctor\'s dress, but indeed it would have filled any townsman with\namazement.Black he wore once a year, on Sacrament Sunday, and, if\npossible, at a funeral; topcoat or waterproof never.His jacket and\nwaistcoat were rough homespun of Glen Urtach wool, which threw off the\nwet like a duck\'s back, and below he was clad in shepherd\'s tartan\ntrousers, which disappeared into unpolished riding boots.His shirt was\ngrey flannel, and he was uncertain about a collar, but certain as to a\ntie which he never had, his beard doing instead, and his hat was soft\nfelt of four colors and seven different shapes.His point of distinction\nin dress was the trousers, and they were the subject of unending\nspeculation."Some threep that he\'s worn thae eedentical pair the last twenty year,\nan\' a\' mind masel him gettin\' a tear ahint, when he was crossin\' oor\npalin\', and the mend\'s still veesible."Ithers declare \'at he\'s got a wab o\' claith, and hes a new pair made in\nMuirtown aince in the twa year maybe, and keeps them in the garden till\nthe new look wears aff."For ma ain pairt," Soutar used to declare, "a\' canna mak up my mind,\nbut there\'s ae thing sure, the Glen wud not like tae see him withoot\nthem: it wud be a shock tae confidence.There\'s no muckle o\' the check\nleft, but ye can aye tell it, and when ye see thae breeks comin\' in ye\nken that if human pooer can save yir bairn\'s life it \'ill be dune."The confidence of the Glen--and tributary states--was unbounded, and\nrested partly on long experience of the doctor\'s resources, and partly\non his hereditary connection."His father was here afore him," Mrs.Macfadyen used to explain; "atween\nthem they\'ve hed the countyside for weel on tae a century; if MacLure\ndisna understand oor constitution, wha dis, a\' wud like tae ask?"For Drumtochty had its own constitution and a special throat disease, as\nbecame a parish which was quite self-contained between the woods and the\nhills, and not dependent on the lowlands either for its diseases or its\ndoctors."He\'s a skilly man, Doctor MacLure," continued my friend Mrs.Macfayden,\nwhose judgment on sermons or anything else was seldom at fault; "an\'\na kind-hearted, though o\' coorse he hes his faults like us a\', an\' he\ndisna tribble the Kirk often."He aye can tell what\'s wrang wi\' a body, an\' maistly he can put ye\nricht, and there\'s nae new-fangled wys wi\' him: a blister for the\nootside an\' Epsom salts for the inside dis his wark, an\' they say\nthere\'s no an herb on the hills he disna ken."If we\'re tae dee, we\'re tae dee; an\' if we\'re tae live, we\'re tae live,"\nconcluded Elspeth, with sound Calvinistic logic; "but a\'ll say this\nfor the doctor, that whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a\nsharp meisture on the skin.""But he\'s no veera ceevil gin ye bring him when there\'s naethin\' wrang,"\nand Mrs.Macfayden\'s face reflected another of Mr.Hopps\' misadventures\nof which Hillocks held the copyright."Hopps\' laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they hed to sit up a\'\nnicht wi\' him, an\' naethin\' wud do but they maun hae the doctor, an\' he\nwrites \'immediately\' on a slip o\' paper."Weel, MacLure had been awa a\' nicht wi\' a shepherd\'s wife Dunleith wy,\nand he comes here withoot drawin\' bridle, mud up tae the cen."\'What\'s a dae here, Hillocks?"he cries; \'it\'s no an accident, is\'t?\'and when he got aff his horse he cud hardly stand wi\' stiffness and\ntire."\'It\'s nane o\' us, doctor; it\'s Hopps\' laddie; he\'s been eatin\' ower\nmony berries.\'[Illustration: "HOPPS\' LADDIE ATE GROSARTS"]\n\n"If he didna turn on me like a tiger."<DW37> ye mean tae say----\'\n\n"\'Weesht, weesht,\' an\' I tried tae quiet him, for Hopps wes comin\' oot."\'Well, doctor,\' begins he, as brisk as a magpie, \'you\'re here at last;\nthere\'s no hurry with you Scotchmen.My boy has been sick all night, and\nI\'ve never had one wink of sleep.You might have come a little quicker,\nthat\'s all I\'ve got to say.\'"We\'ve mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend tae every bairn that hes a\nsair stomach,\' and a\' saw MacLure wes roosed.Our doctor at home always says to\nMrs.\'Opps "Look on me as a family friend, Mrs.\'Opps, and send for me\nthough it be only a headache."\'"\'He\'d be mair sparin\' o\' his offers if he hed four and twenty mile tae\nlook aifter.There\'s naethin\' wrang wi\' yir laddie but greed.Gie him a\ngude dose o\'

noo in the Sooth?\'MacLure, we\'re homoeopathists, and I\'ve my little\nchest here,\' and oot Hopps comes wi\' his boxy."\'Let\'s see\'t,\' an\' MacLure sits doon and taks oot the bit bottles, and\nhe reads the names wi\' a lauch every time."\'Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like?Weel, ma mannie,\' he says tae Hopps, \'it\'s a fine\nploy, and ye \'ill better gang on wi\' the Nux till it\'s dune, and gie him\nony ither o\' the sweeties he fancies."\'Noo, Hillocks, a\' maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh\'s grieve, for he\'s\ndoon wi\' the fever, and it\'s tae be a teuch fecht.A\' hinna time tae\nwait for dinner; gie me some cheese an\' cake in ma haund, and Jess \'ill\ntak a pail o\' meal an\' water."\'Fee; a\'m no wantin\' yir fees, man; wi\' that boxy ye dinna need a\ndoctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae some puir body, Maister Hopps,\' an\'\nhe was doon the road as hard as he cud lick."His fees were pretty much what the folk chose to give him, and he\ncollected them once a year at Kildrummie fair."Well, doctor, what am a\' awin\' ye for the wife and bairn?Ye \'ill need\nthree notes for that nicht ye stayed in the hoose an\' a\' the veesits.""Havers," MacLure would answer, "prices are low, a\'m hearing; gie\'s\nthirty shillings.""No, a\'ll no, or the wife \'ill tak ma ears off," and it was settled for\ntwo pounds.Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields, and one\nway or other, Drumsheugh told me, the doctor might get in about L150.a year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper\'s wages and a\nboy\'s, and keep two horses, besides the cost of instruments and books,\nwhich he bought through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.There was only one man who ever complained of the doctor\'s charges, and\nthat was the new farmer of Milton, who was so good that he was above\nboth churches, and held a meeting in his barn.(It was Milton the Glen\nsupposed at first to be a Mormon, but I can\'t go into that now.)He\noffered MacLure a pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon\nMacLure expressed his opinion of Milton, both from a theological and\nsocial standpoint, with such vigor and frankness that an attentive\naudience of Drumtochty men could hardly contain themselves.Jamie Soutar\nwas selling his pig at the time, and missed the meeting, but he hastened\nto condole with Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the doctor\'s\nlanguage.[Illustration]\n\n"Ye did richt tae resist him; it \'ill maybe roose the Glen tae mak a\nstand; he fair hands them in bondage."Thirty shillings for twal veesits, and him no mair than seeven mile\nawa, an\' a\'m telt there werena mair than four at nicht."Ye \'ill hae the sympathy o\' the Glen, for a\' body kens yir as free wi\'\nyir siller as yir tracts."Wes\'t \'Beware o\'

Samaritan,\nan\' the Pharisees didna think muckle o\' his chance aither in this warld\nor that which is tae come."Maurice is crying, looking at his\nfather._\n\nLAGARD\n\n_Softly._\n\nBravo, Belgium!The sound of cannonading is heard._\n\nJEANNE\n\n_Softly, to Maurice._\n\nSit down, Maurice, it is hard for you to stand.MAURICE\n\nOh, mamma!I am so happy to stand here now--\n\nLAGARD\n\nNow I shall add a few words.As you know, Grelieu, I am a man of\nthe people.I know the price the people pay for their hard work.I know the cost of all these gardens, orchards and factories\nwhich we shall bury under the water.They have cost us sweat\nand health and tears, Grelieu.These are our sufferings which\nwill be transformed into joy for our children.But as a nation\nthat loves and respects liberty above its sweat and blood and\ntears--as a nation, I say, I would prefer that sea waves should\nseethe here over our heads rather than that we should have to\nblack the boots of the Prussians.And if nothing but islands\nremain of Belgium they will be known as "honest islands," and\nthe islanders will be Belgians as before._All are agitated._\n\nEMIL GRELIEU\n\nAnd what do the engineers say?GENERAL\n\n_Respectfully waiting for the Count\'s answer._\n\nMonsieur Grelieu, they say this can be done in two hours.LAGARD\n\n_Grumbles._\n\nIn two hours!How many years have we been building\nit!GENERAL\n\nThe engineers were crying when they said it, Monsieur.LAGARD\n\nThe engineers were crying?_Suddenly he bursts into sobs, and slowly takes a handkerchief\nfrom his pocket._\n\nCOUNT CLAIRMONT\n\nWe are awaiting your answer impatiently, Grelieu.You are\ncharged with a grave responsibility to your fatherland--to lift\nyour hand against your own fatherland.EMIL GRELIEU Have we no other defence?Lagard dries\nhis eyes and slowly answers with a sigh_.JEANNE\n\n_Shaking her head._\n\nNo.COUNT CLAIRMONT\n\n_Rapidly._\n\nWe must gain time, Grelieu.By the power of all our lives,\nthrown in the fields, we cannot stop them._Stamping his foot._\n\nTime, time!We must steal from fate a small part of eternity--a\nfew days, a week!The Russians are\ncoming to us from the East.The German steel has already\npenetrated to the heart of the French land--and infuriated with\npain, the French eagle is rising over the Germans\' bayonets\nand is coming toward us!The noble knights of the sea--the\nBritish--are already rushing toward us, and to Belgium are their\npowerful arms stretched out over the abyss.Belgium is praying for a few days, for\na few hours!You have already given to Belgium your blood,\nGrelieu, and you have the right to lift your hand against your\nblood-stained fatherland!_Brief pause._\n\nEMIL GRELIEU\n\nWe must break the dams._Curtain_\n\n\n\nSCENE V\n\n\n_Night.A sentinel\non guard at the door leading to the rooms occupied by the\nCommander of the army.Two officers on duty are\ntalking lazily, suffering apparently from the heat.Only from time to time the measured footsteps of\npickets are heard, and muffled voices and angry exclamations._\n\nVON RITZAU\n\nDo you feel sleepy, von Stein?VON STEIN\n\nI don\'t feel sleepy, but I feel like smoking.RITZAU\n\nA bad habit!STEIN\n\nBut what if _he_ should come in?Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs.The air is poisoned with the smell of smoke.We must invent\nsomething against this obnoxious odor.RITZAU\n\nI am not an inventor.First of all it is necessary to wring out\nthe air as they wring the clothes they wash, and dry it in the\nsun.It is so moist, I feel as though I were diving in it.Do\nyou know whether _he_ is in a good mood today?STEIN\n\nWhy, is he subject to moods, good or bad?RITZAU\n\nGreat self-restraint!STEIN\n\nHave you ever seen him undressed--or half-dressed?Or have you\never seen his hair in disorder?RITZAU\n\nHe speaks so devilishly little, Stein.STEIN\n\nHe prefers to have his cannon speak.It is quite a powerful\nvoice, isn\'t it, Ritzau?A tall, handsome officer enters quickly and\ngoes toward the door leading to the room of the Commander._\n\nBlumenfeld!_The tall officer waves his hand and opens the door cautiously,\nready to make his bow._\n\nHe is malting his career!RITZAU\n\nHe is a good fellow.STEIN\n\nWould you rather be in Paris?RITZAU\n\nI would prefer any less unbearable country to this.How dull it\nmust be here in the winter time.STEIN\n\nBut we have saved them from dullness for a long time to come.Were you ever in the Montmartre cafés, Ritzau?STEIN\n\nDoesn\'t one find there a wonderful refinement, culture and\ninnate elegance?Unfortunately, our Berlin people are far\ndifferent.RITZAU\n\nOh, of course._The tall officer comes out of the door, stepping backward.He\nheaves a sigh of relief and sits down near the two officers.Takes out a cigar._\n\nVON BLUMENFELD How are things?STEIN\n\nThen I am going to smoke too.BLUMENFELD\n\nYou may smoke.He is not coming out Do you want to hear\nimportant news?BLUMENFELD He laughed just now I\n\nSTEIN\n\nReally!BLUMENFELD\n\nUpon my word of honor!And he touched my shoulder with two\nfingers--do you understand?STEIN\n\n_With envy._\n\nOf course!I suppose you brought him good news, Blumenfeld?_The military telegraphist, standing at attention, hands\nBlumenfeld a folded paper._\n\nTELEGRAPHIST\n\nA radiogram, Lieutenant!BLUMENFELD\n\nLet me have it._Slowly he puts his cigar on the window sill and enters the\nCommander\'s room cautiously._\n\nSTEIN\n\nHe\'s a lucky fellow.You may say what you please about luck,\nbut it exists.Von?--Did you know his\nfather?RITZAU\n\nI have reason to believe that he had no grandfather at all._Blumenfeld comes out and rejoins the two officers, taking up\nhis cigar._\n\nSTEIN\n\nAnother military secret?BLUMENFELD\n\nOf course.Everything that is said and done here is a military\nsecret.The information we have\nreceived concerns our new siege guns--they are advancing\nsuccessfully.BLUMENFELD\n\nYes, successfully.They have just passed the most difficult part\nof the road--you know where the swamps are--\n\nSTEIN\n\nOh, yes.BLUMENFELD\n\nThe road could not support the heavy weight and caved in.He ordered a report about the\nmovement at each and every kilometer.STEIN\n\nNow he will sleep in peace.BLUMENFELD\n\nHe never sleeps, von Stein.BLUMENFELD\n\nHe never sleeps, von Stein!When he is not listening to\nreports or issuing commands, he is thinking.As the personal\ncorrespondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many\nthings which others are not allowed to know--Oh, gentlemen, he\nhas a wonderful mind!_Another very young officer enters, stands at attention before\nBlumenfeld._\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nSit down, von Schauss.BLUMENFELD\n\nHe has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as\nLeibnitz managed ideas.Everything is preconceived, everything\nis prearranged, the movement of our millions of people has been\nelaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself\nwould have been proud of it.Gentlemen, we are led forward by\nindomitable logic and by an iron will._The officers express their approval by subdued exclamations of\n"bravo."_\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nHow can he sleep, if the movement of our armies is but the\nmovement of parts of his brains!And what is the use of sleep\nin general?I sleep very little myself, and I advise you,\ngentlemen, not to indulge in foolish sleep.RITZAU\n\nBut our human organism requires sleep.BLUMENFELD\n\nNonsense!Organism--that is something invented by the doctors\nwho are looking for practice among the fools.I know only my desires and my will, which says:\n"Gerhardt, do this!SCHAUSS\n\nWill you permit me to take down your words in my notebook?BLUMENFELD\n\nPlease, Schauss._The telegraphist has entered._\n\nZIGLER\n\nI really don\'t know, but something strange has happened.It\nseems that we are being interfered with, I can\'t understand\nanything.BLUMENFELD\n\nWhat is it?ZIGLER\n\nWe can make out one word, "Water"--but after that all is\nincomprehensible.And then again, "Water"--\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nWhat water?ZIGLER\n\nHe is also surprised and cannot understand.BLUMENFELD\n\nYou are a donkey, Zigler!We\'ll have to call out--\n\n_The Commander comes out.His voice is dry and unimpassioned._\n\nCOMMANDER\n\nBlumenfeld!_All jump up, straighten themselves, as if petrified._\n\nWhat is this?BLUMENFELD\n\nI have not yet investigated it, your Highness.Zigler is\nreporting--\n\nCOMMANDER\n\nWhat is it, Zigler?ZIGLER\n\nYour Highness, we are being interfered with.I don\'t know what\nit is, but I can\'t understand anything.We have been able to\nmake out only one word--"Water."COMMANDER\n\n_Turning around._\n\nSee what it is, Blumenfeld, and report to me--\n\n_Engineer runs in._\n\nENGINEER\n\nWhere is Blumenfeld?COMMANDER\n\n_Pausing._\n\nWhat has happened there, Kloetz?ENGINEER\n\nThey don\'t respond to our calls, your Highness.COMMANDER\n\nYou think something serious has happened?ENGINEER\n\nI dare not think so, your Highness, but I am alarmed.Silence is\nthe only answer to our most energetic calls._The second telegraphist has entered quietly._\n\nGREITZER\n\nThey are silent, your Highness._Brief pause._\n\nCOMMANDER\n\n_Again turning to the door._\n\nPlease investigate this, Lieutenant._He advances a step to the door, then stops.There is a\ncommotion behind the windows--a noise and the sound of voices.The noise keeps\ngrowing, turning at times into a loud roar._\n\nWhat is that?An officer, bareheaded, rushes in\nexcitedly, his hair disheveled, his face pale._\n\nOFFICER\n\nI want to see his Highness.BLUMENFELD\n\n_Hissing._\n\nYou are insane!COMMANDER\n\nCalm yourself, officer.I have the honor to report to you that the\nBelgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded._With horror._\n\nWe must hurry, your Highness!OFFICER\n\nThey are flooded, your Highness.COMMANDER\n\nCompose yourself, you are not behaving properly!I am asking you\nabout our field guns--\n\nOFFICER\n\nThey are flooded, your Highness.We must hurry, your Highness, we are in a valley.They have broken the dams; and the water is\nrushing this way violently.It is only five kilometers away from\nhere--and we can hardly--.The beginning of a terrible panic is felt,\nembracing the entire camp.All watch impatiently the reddening\nface of the Commander._\n\nCOMMANDER\n\nBut this is--\n\n_He strikes the table with his fist forcibly._\n\nAbsurd!_He looks at them with cold fury, but all lower their eyes.The\nfrightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window.The\nlights grow brighter outside--it is evident that a building has\nbeen set on fire.A\ndull noise, then the crash of shots is heard.The discipline is\ndisappearing gradually._\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nThey have gone mad!STEIN\n\nBut that can\'t be the Belgians!RITZAU\n\nThey may have availed themselves--\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nAren\'t you ashamed, Stein?I beg of you--\n\n_Suddenly a piercing, wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to\nretreat.The roaring sound is growing rapidly._\n\nCOMMANDER\n\n_Shots._\n\nWho has commanded to retreat?_Blumenfeld lowers his head._\n\nCOMMANDER\n\nThis is not the German Army!You are unworthy of being called\nsoldiers!BLUMENFELD\n\n_Stepping forward, with dignity._\n\nYour Highness!We are not fishes to swim in the water!_Runs out, followed by two or three others.The panic is\ngrowing._\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nYour Highness!Your life is in danger--your\nHighness.Only the\nsentinel remains in the position of one petrified._\n\nBLUMENFELD\n\nYour Highness!Your life--I am afraid that\nanother minute, and it will be too late!COMMANDER\n\nBut this is--\n\n_Again strikes the table with his fist._\n\nBut this is absurd, Blumenfeld!_Curtain_\n\n\n\nSCENE VI\n\n\n_The same hour of night.In the darkness it is difficult to\ndiscern the silhouettes of the ruined buildings and of the\ntrees.At the right, a half-destroyed bridge.From time to time the German flashlights are\nseen across the dark sky.Near the bridge, an automobile in\nwhich the wounded Emil Grelieu and his son are being carried to\nAntwerp.Jeanne and a young physician are with them.Something\nhas broken down in the automobile and a soldier-chauffeur is\nbustling about with a lantern trying to repair it.Langloi\nstands near him._\n\n\nDOCTOR\n\n_Uneasily._\n\nWell?CHAUFFEUR\n\n_Examining._\n\nI don\'t know yet.DOCTOR\n\nIs it a serious break?CHAUFFEUR\n\nNo--I don\'t know.MAURICE\n\n_From the automobile._\n\nWhat is it, Doctor?CHAUFFEUR\n\n_Angrily._\n\nWe\'ll start!DOCTOR\n\nI don\'t know.MAURICE\n\nShall we stay here long?DOCTOR\n\n_To the chauffeur._\n\nShall we stay here long?CHAUFFEUR\n\n_Angrily._\n\nHow do I know?_Hands the lantern to the doctor._\n\nMAURICE\n\nThen I will come out.JEANNE\n\nYou had better stay here, Maurice.MAURICE\n\nNo, mother, I am careful._Jumps off and watches the chauffeur at work._\n\nMAURICE\n\nHow unfortunate that we are stuck here!CHAUFFEUR\n\n_Grumbling._\n\nA bridge!DOCTOR\n\nYes, it is unfortunate.MAURICE\n\n_Shrugging his shoulders._\n\nFather did not want to leave.Mamina, do\nyou think our people are already in Antwerp?JEANNE\n\nYes, I think so.EMIL GRELIEU\n\nNo.It is very pleasant to breathe the fresh air.DOCTOR\n\n_To Maurice._\n\nI think we are still in the region which--\n\nMAURICE\n\nYes.DOCTOR\n\n_Looking at his watch._\n\nTwenty--a quarter of ten.MAURICE\n\nThen it is a quarter of an hour since the bursting of the dams.Mamma, do you hear, it is a quarter of ten now!JEANNE\n\nYes, I hear.MAURICE\n\nBut it is strange that we haven\'t heard any explosions.DOCTOR\n\nHow can you say that, Monsieur Maurice?MAURICE\n\nI thought that such explosions would be heard a hundred\nkilometers away.Our house and our\ngarden will soon be flooded!I wonder how high the water will\nrise.Do you think it will reach up to the second story?CHAUFFEUR\n\n_Grumbling._\n\nI am working.Mamma, see how the searchlights are working.EMIL GRELIEU\n\nJeanne, lift me a little.JEANNE\n\nMy dear, I don\'t know whether I am allowed to do it.DOCTOR\n\nYou may lift him a little, if it isn\'t very painful.JEANNE\n\nDo you feel any pain?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nNo.MAURICE\n\nFather, they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like\nmadmen._A bluish light is flashed over them, faintly illuminating the\nwhole group._\n\nMAURICE\n\nRight into my eyes!EMIL GRELIEU\n\nI suppose so.Either they have been warned, or the water is\nreaching them by this time.JEANNE\n\nDo you think so, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nYes.It seems to me that I hear the sound of the water from that\nside._All listen and look in the direction from which the noise came._\n\nDOCTOR\n\n_Uneasily._\n\nHow unpleasant this is!MAURICE\n\nFather, it seems to me I hear voices.Listen--it sounds as\nthough they are crying there.Father, the\nPrussians are crying._A distant, dull roaring of a crowd is heard.The searchlights are\nswaying from side to side._\n\nEMIL GRELIEU\n\nIt is they.DOCTOR\n\nIf we don\'t start in a quarter of an hour--\n\nEMIL GRELIEU\n\nIn half an hour, Doctor.MAURICE\n\nFather, how beautiful and how terrible it is!JEANNE\n\nWhat is it?MAURICE\n\nI want to kiss it.JEANNE\n\nWhat a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.MAURICE\n\nMonsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove\nmy bandage.Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to\ntake up my gun again!...The\nchauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers.A figure appears\nfrom the field, approaching from one of the ditches.A peasant,\nwounded in the leg, comes up slowly, leaning upon a cane._\n\nMAURICE\n\nWho is there?PEASANT\n\nOur own, our own.MAURICE\n\nYes, we\'re going to the city.Our car has broken down, we\'re\nrepairing it.PEASANT\n\nWhat am I doing here?They also look at him\nattentively, by the light of the lantern._\n\nCHAUFFEUR\n\nGive me the light!PEASANT\n\nAre you carrying a wounded man?I\ncannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you\nspeak French I crawled out.DOCTOR\n\nHow were you wounded?PEASANT\n\nI was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have\nthought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._\n\nThey must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,\ngentlemen?MAURICE\n\nDon\'t you know?PEASANT\n\nWhat can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that\'s all I\nknow.Just look at it, I have been watching\nit all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nSit down near us.MAURICE\n\nListen, sit down here.They are\ncrying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of\nit by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._\n\nMAURICE\n\nSit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR\n\n_Muttering._\n\nSit down, sit down!DOCTOR\n\n_Uneasily._\n\nWhat is it?MAURICE\n\nWhat an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE\n\n_Agitated._\n\nThey shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a\nrabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._\n\nPEASANT\n\nI look like a rabbit!JEANNE\n\nDo you hear, Emil?_Laughs._\n\nEMIL GRELIEU\n\nJeanne!JEANNE\n\nIt makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake\nus for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just\npicture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE\n\nNo, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._\n\nAnd what else are we?PEASANT\n\n_Laughs._\n\nAnd now we must hide in the ground--\n\nJEANNE\n\n_In the same tone._\n\nAnd they will remain on the ground?EMIL GRELIEU\n\nMy dear!MAURICE\n\n_To the doctor._\n\nListen, you must do something.Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!JEANNE\n\nNo, never mind, I am not laughing any more.Maurice, I simply felt like talking.I\nwas forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering.Emil,\nI am not disturbing you with my talk, am I?Why is the water so\nquiet, Emil?It was the King who said, "The water is silent,"\nwas it not?But I should like to see it roar, crash like\nthunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence!Ah, why is\nit so quiet--I cannot bear it!MAURICE\n\n_To the chauffeur._\n\nMy dear fellow, please hurry up!CHAUFFEUR\n\nYes, yes!JEANNE\n\n_Suddenly cries, threatening._\n\nBut I cannot bear it!_Covers her mouth with her hands; sobs._\n\nI cannot!EMIL GRELIEU\n\nAll will end well, Jeanne.JEANNE\n\n_Sobbing, but calming herself somewhat._\n\nI cannot bear it!EMIL GRELIEU\n\nAll will end well, Jeanne!I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!CHAUFFEUR\n\nIn a moment, in a moment.EMIL GRELIEU\n\n_Faintly._\n\nJeanne!JEANNE\n\nYes, yes, I know....

Venturi,\nProfessor of Natural Philosophy at Modena, and of the Institute of\nBologna, &c. who was permitted to inspect them, says[i77], that "they\ncontain speculations in those branches of natural philosophy nearest\nallied to geometry; that they are first sketches and occasional notes,\nthe Author always intending afterwards to compose from them complete\ntreatises."He adds further, "that they are written backwards from\nright to left, in the manner of the oriental writers, probably with\nintention that the curious should not rob him of his discoveries.The spirit of geometry guided him throughout, whether it were in the\nart of analysing a subject in the connexion of the discourse, or the\ncare of always generalizing his ideas.As to natural philosophy, he\nnever was satisfied on any proposition if he had not proved it by\nexperiment."From the extracts given from these manuscripts by Venturi\nhimself, and which he has ranged under the different heads mentioned\nin the note[i78], the contents of these volumes appear to be extremely\nmiscellaneous; and it is evident, as Venturi has marked by references\nwhere each extract is to be found in the original, that from the great\ndistance at which passages on the same subject are placed from each\nother, they must have been entered without any regard to method or\narrangement of any kind whatever.The volume in the possession of his Britannic Majesty is described as\nconsisting "of a variety of elegant heads, some of which are drawn\nwith red and black chalks on blue or red paper, others with a metal\npencil on a tinted paper; a few of them are washed and heightened with\nwhite, and many are on common paper.The subjects of these drawings\nare miscellaneous, as portraits, caricatures, single figures, tilting,\nhorses, and other animals; botany, optics, perspective, gunnery,\nhydraulics, mechanics, and a great number of anatomical subjects, which\nare drawn with a more spirited pen, and illustrated with a variety of\nmanuscript notes.This volume contains what is of more importance, the\nvery characteristic head of Leonardo, as it was sketched by himself,\nand now engraved by that eminent artist Mr.Specimens\nfrom this volume have been published some years since by Mr.Dalton,\nand more recently and accurately by Mr.Chamberlaine; and though it\nmust be confessed, that the former are extremely ill drawn, and betray\nthe grossest ignorance of the effect which light and shadow were\nintended to produce, yet some of the subjects which the volume contains\nmay be ascertained by them; and among them is also a fac simile of a\npage of the original manuscript, which proves this, like the other\nvolumes, to be in Italian, and written backwards.The latter is a\nvery beautiful work, and is calculated to give an accurate idea of\nLeonardo\'s talents as a draughtsman[i80].From these two publications\nit appears, that this volume also is of a very miscellaneous nature,\nand that it consists of manuscript entries, interspersed with finished\ndrawings of heads and figures, and slight sketches of mechanical\nengines and anatomical subjects, some of which are intermixed with the\nwriting itself.It has been already seen, that these volumes were originally given by\nthe will of Leonardo to Francisco Melzi; and their subsequent history\nwe are enabled to state on the authority of John Ambrose Mazenta,\nthrough whose hands they passed.Du Fresne, in the life prefixed to\nthe edition which he published in Italian, of Leonardo da Vinci\'s\nTreatise on Painting, has, in a very loose way, and without citing\nany authority, given their history; but Venturi has inserted[i81]\na translation into French, from the original manuscript memoir of\nMazenta; and from him a version of it into English is here given, with\nthe addition of Venturi\'s notes, rendered also into English."It is near fifty years[i82] since there fell into my hands thirteen\nvolumes of Leonardo da Vinci in folio and quarto, written backwards.Accident brought them to me in the following manner: I was residing\nat Pisa, for the purpose of studying the law, in the family of Aldus\nManutius the younger, a great lover of books.A person named Lelio\nGavardi, of Asola, Prevost of S. Zeno, at Pavia, a very near relation\nof Aldus, came to our house; he had been a teacher of the _belles\nlettres_ in the family of the Melzi of Milan, called de Vavero, to\ndistinguish them from other families of the same name in that city.He had, at their country house at Vavero, met with several drawings,\ninstruments, and books of Leonardo.Francisco Melzi[i83] approached\nnearer than any one to the manner of De Vinci; he worked little,\nbecause he was rich; his pictures are very much finished, they are\noften confounded with those of his master.Sandra moved to the hallway.At his death he left the\nworks of Leonardo in his house at Vavero, to his sons, who having\ntastes and pursuits of a different kind, neglected these treasures,\nand soon dispersed them; Lelio Gavardi possessed himself of as many of\nthem as he pleased; he carried thirteen volumes to Florence, in hopes\nof receiving for them a good price from the Grand Duke Francis, who\nwas eager after works of this sort; and the rather as Leonardo was in\ngreat reputation in his own country.But this prince died[i84] as soon\nas Gavardi was arrived at Florence.He then went to Pisa, to the house\nof Manutius.I could not approve his proceeding; it was scandalous.My studies being finished, I had occasion to return to Milan.He gave\nme the volumes of Vinci, desiring me to return them to the Melzi: I\nacquitted myself faithfully of my commission; I carried them all back\nto Horatio, the chief of the family of Melzi, who was surprised at\nmy being willing to give myself this trouble.He made me a present\nof these books, telling me he had still many drawings by the same\nauthor, long neglected in the garrets of his house in the country.Thus these books became my property, and afterwards they belonged to\nmy brothers[i85].These latter having made too much parade of this\nacquisition, and the ease with which I was brought to it, excited the\nenvy of other amateurs, who beset Horatio, and obtained from him some\ndrawings, some figures, some anatomical pieces, and other valuable\nremains of the cabinet of Leonardo.One of these spungers for the works\nof Leonardo, was Pompeo Aretin, son of the Cavalier Leoni, formerly a\ndisciple of Bonaroti, and who was about Philip II.King of Spain, for\nwhom he did all the bronzes which are at the Escurial.Pompeo engaged\nhimself to procure for Melzi an employment to the senate of Milan,\nif he succeeded in recovering the thirteen books, wishing to offer\nthem to King Philip, a lover of such curiosities.Flattered with this\nhope, Melzi went to my brother\'s house: he besought him on his knees\nto restore him his present; he was a fellow-collegian, a friend, a\nbenefactor: seven volumes were returned to him[i86].Of the six others\nwhich remained to the Mazenta family, one was presented to Cardinal\nFrederic Borromeo, for the Ambrosian library[i87].My brother gave a\nsecond to Ambrose Figini, a celebrated painter of his time, who left\nit to his heir Hercole Bianchi, with the rest of his cabinet.Urged by\nthe Duke of Savoy, I procured for him a third; and in conclusion, my\nbrother having died at a distance from Milan[i88], the three remaining\nvolumes came also into the hands of Pompeo Aretin; he re-assembled\nalso others of them, he separated the leaves of them to form a thick\nvolume[i89], which passed to his heir Polidoro Calchi, and was\nafterwards sold to Galeazzo Arconati.This gentleman keeps it now in\nhis rich library; he has refused it to the Duke of Savoy, and to other\nprinces who were desirous of it."In addition to this memoir, Venturi notices[i90], that Howard Earl\nof Arundel made ineffectual efforts to obtain this large volume,\nand offered for it as far as 60,000 francs, in the name of the King\nof England.Arconati would never part with it; he bought eleven\nother books of Da Vinci, which came also, according to appearance,\nfrom Leoni; in 1637 he made a gift of them all to the Ambrosian\nlibrary[i91], which already was in possession of the volume E, from\nMazenta, and received afterwards the volume K from Horatio Archinto, in\n1674[i92].Venturi says, this is the history of all the manuscripts of Vinci that\nare come into France; they are in number fourteen, because the volume\nB contains an appendix of eighteen leaves, which may be separated, and\nconsidered as the fourteenth volume[i93].In the printed catalogue of the library of Turin, one does not see\nnoticed the manuscript which Mazenta gave to the Duke of Savoy: it has\nthen disappeared.Might it not be that which an Englishman got copied\nby Francis Ducci, library-keeper at Florence, and a copy of which is\nstill remaining in the same city[i94]?The Trivulce family at Milan, according to Venturi[i95], possess also a\nmanuscript of Vinci, which is in great part only a vocabulary.Of the volume in the possession of his Britannic Majesty, the following\naccount is given in the life of Leonardo, prefixed to that number\nalready published from it by Mr.Chamberlaine: "It was one of the three\nvolumes which became the property of Pompeo Leoni, that is now in his\nMajesty\'s cabinet.It is rather probable than certain, that this great\ncuriosity was acquired for King Charles I. by the Earl of Arundel, when\nhe went Ambassador to the Emperor Ferdinand II.in 1636, as may indeed\nbe inferred from an instructive inscription over the place where the\nvolumes are kept, which sets forth, that James King of England offered\nthree thousand pistoles for one of the volumes of Leonardo\'s works.And\nsome documents in the Ambrosian library give colour to this conjecture.This volume was happily preserved during the civil wars of the last\ncentury among other specimens of the fine arts, which the munificence\nof Charles I. had amassed with a diligence equal to his taste.And it\nwas discovered soon after his present Majesty\'s accession in the same\ncabinet where Queen Caroline found the fine portraits of the court of\nHenry VIII.by Hans Holbein, which the King\'s liberality permitted\nme lately to lay before the public.On the cover of this volume is\nwritten, in gold letters, what ascertains its descent; _Disegni di\nLeonardo da Vinci, restaurati da Pompeo Leoni_."Although no part of the collections of Leonardo was arranged and\nprepared by himself, or others under his direction, for publication,\nsome extracts have been made from his writings, and given to the world\nas separate tracts.The best known, and indeed the principal of these,\nis the following Treatise on Painting, of which there will be occasion\nto say more presently; but besides this, Edward Cooper, a London\nbookseller, about the year 1720, published a fragment of a Treatise by\nLeonardo da Vinci, on the Motions of the Human Body, and the Manner of\ndrawing Figures, according to geometrical Rules.It contains but ten\nplates in folio, including the title-page, and was evidently extracted\nfrom some of the volumes of his collections, as it consists of slight\nsketches and verbal descriptions both in Italian and English, to\nexplain such of them as needed it.Dalton, as has been before noticed, several years since published\nsome engravings from the volume in our King\'s collection, but they are\nso badly done as to be of no value.Chamberlaine therefore, in\n1796, took up the intention afresh, and in that year his first number\ncame out, which is all that has yet appeared.Of the Treatise on Painting, Venturi[i96] gives the following\nparticulars: "The Treatise on Painting which we have of Vinci is only\na compilation of different fragments extracted from his manuscripts.It was in the Barberini library at Rome, in 1630[i97]: the Cav.del\nPozzo obtained a copy from it, and Poussin designed the figures of it\nin 1640[i98].This copy, and another derived from the same source,\nin the possession of Thevenot, served as the basis for the edition\npublished in 1651, by Raphael du Frene.The manuscript of Pozzo,\nwith the figures of Poussin, is actually at Paris, in the valuable\ncollection of books of Chardin[i99].It is from this that I have taken\nthe relation of Mazenta; it is at the end of the manuscript under this\ntitle: "Some Notices of the Works of Leonardo da Vinci at Milan, and\nof his Books, by J. Ambrose Mazenta of Milan, of the Congregation of\nthe Priests Regular of St.Mazenta does\nnot announce himself as the author of the compilation; he may however\nbe so; it may also happen, that the compilation was made by the heir\nhimself of Vinci, Francisco Melzo.Vasari, about 1567, says[i100], that\na painter of Milan had the manuscripts of Vinci, which were written\nbackwards; that this painter came to him, and afterwards went to Rome,\nwith intention to get them printed, but that he did not know what was\nthe result.However it may be, Du Frene confesses that this compilation\nis imperfect in many respects, and ill arranged.It is so, because the\ncompiler has not seized the methodical spirit of Vinci, and that there\nare mixed with it some pieces which belong to other tracts; besides,\none has not seen where many other chapters have been neglected which\nought to make part of it.For example, the comparison of painting with\nsculpture, which has been announced as a separate treatise of the same\nauthor, is nothing more than a chapter belonging to the Treatise on\nPainting, A.All this will be complete, and put in order, in the\nTreatise on Optics[i101].In the mean time, however, the following are\nthe different editions of this compilation, such as it is at present:\n\n"Trattato della Pittura di Leonardo da Vinci, nuovamente dato in Luce,\ncon la Vita dell\' Autore da Raphaele du Frene, Parigi 1651, in fol.;\nreprinted at Naples in 1733, in folio; at Bologna, in 1786, in folio;\nat Florence, in 1792, in 4to.This last edition has been given from a\ncopy in the hand-writing of Stephano della Bella.\n\n"----Translated into French by Roland Freart de Chambray, Paris 1651,\nfol.1716, in 12mo, and 1796, in 8vo.\n\n"----Translated into German, in 4to.Nuremberg 1786, Weigel.\n\n"----Translated into Greek by Panagiotto, manuscript in the Nani\nlibrary at Venice."Another manuscript copy of this compilation was in the possession of\nP. Orlandi, from whence it passed into the library of Smith[i102]."Cellini, in a discourse published by Morelli, says[i103], that he\npossessed a copy of a book of De Vinci on Perspective, which he\ncommunicated to Serlio, and that this latter published from it all that\nhe could comprehend.Might not this be the tract which Gori announces\nto be in the library of the Academy of Cortona[i104]?"The reputation in which the Treatise on Painting ought to be held,\nis not now for the first time to be settled; its merit has been\nacknowledged by the best judges, though at that time it laboured under\ngreat disadvantage from the want of a proper arrangement.In the\npresent publication that objection is removed, and the attempt has\nbeen favourable to the work itself, as it has shewn it, by bringing\ntogether the several chapters that related to each other, to be a\nmuch more complete and connected treatise than was before supposed.Notwithstanding however the fair estimation in which it has always\nstood, and which is no more than its due, one person has been found\nhardy enough to endeavour, though unsuccessfully, to lessen its credit:\na circumstance which it would not have been worth while to notice, if\nit had not been intimated to us, that there are still some persons\nin France who side with the objector, which, as he was a Frenchman,\nand Leonardo an Italian, may perhaps be ascribed, in some measure at\nleast, to the desire which in several instances that people have lately\nshewn of claiming on behalf of their countrymen, a preference over\nothers, to which they are not entitled.Abraham Bosse, of the city of\nTours, an engraver in copper, who lived in the last century, is the\nperson here alluded to; and it may not be impertinent in this place to\nstate some of the motives by which he was induced to such a conduct.At the time when this Treatise first made its appearance in France,\nas well in Italian as in French, Bosse appears to have been resident\nat Paris, and was a member of the Academy of Painting, where he gave\nthe first lessons on perspective, and, with the assistance of Mons.Desargues, published from time to time several tracts on geometry and\nperspective, the manner of designing, and the art of engraving, some\nof which at least are described in the title-page, as printed at Paris\nfor the author[i105].This man, in his lectures, having, it is said,\nattacked some of the pictures painted by Le Brun, the then Director of\nthe Academy, had been very deservedly removed from his situation, and\nforced to quit the Academy, for endeavouring to lessen that authority,\nwhich for the instruction and improvement of students it was necessary\nthe Director should possess, and attempting thus to render fruitless\nthe precepts which his situation required him to deliver.As this\nTreatise of Leonardo had in the translation been adopted by Le Brun,\nwho fully saw its value, and introduced it into the Academy for the\nadvantage of the students, by which means the sale of Bosse\'s work\nmight be, and probably was, affected; Bosse, at the end of a Treatise\non Geometry and Perspective, taught in the Royal Academy of Painting\nand Sculpture, published by him in octavo in 1665, has inserted a paper\nwith this title, which in the original is given in French, but we have\npreferred translating it: "_What follows is for those who shall have\nthe curiosity to be acquainted with a part of the procedings of Mons.Desargues, and myself, against some of our antagonists, and part of\ntheir skill; together with some remarks made on the contents of several\nchapters of a Treatise attributed to Leonardo de Vinci, translated\nfrom Italian into French by Mons.Freart Sieur de Chambray, from a\nmanuscript taken from that which is in the library of the illustrious,\nvirtuous, and curious Mons.le Chevalier Du Puis at Rome_."After the explanation of his motives above given, it is not wonderful\nto find him asserting, that this Treatise of Leonardo was in a number\nof circumstances inferior to his own; nor to observe, that in a list of\nsome of the chapters which he has there given, we should be frequently\ntold by him that they are false, absurd, ridiculous, confused,\ntrifling, weak, and, in short, every thing but good.It is true that\nthe estimation of Leonardo da Vinci was in France too high for him to\nattack without risking his own character for judgment and taste, and he\nhas therefore found it necessary for his purpose insidiously to suggest\nthat these chapters were interpolations; but of this he has produced no\nproof, which, had it been the fact, might have been easily obtained, by\nonly getting some friend to consult Leonardo\'s manuscript collections\nin the Ambrosian library.That he would have taken this step if he\nhad expected any success from it, may fairly be inferred from the\ncircumstance of his writing to Poussin at Rome, apparently in hopes of\ninducing him to say something to the disadvantage of the work; and his\nomitting to make this inquiry after the enmity he has shewn against the\nbook, fully justifies an opinion that he forbore to inquire, because\nhe was conscious that such an investigation would have terminated in\nvindicating his adversaries from his aspersions, and have furnished\nevidence of their fidelity and accuracy.What the letter which he wrote to Poussin contained, he has not\ninformed us; but he has given us, as he says, Poussin\'s answer[i106],\nin which are some passages relating to this Treatise, of which we here\ngive a translation: "As to what concerns the book of Leonard Vinci, it\nis true that I have designed the human figures which are in that which\nMons.le Chevalier du Puis has; but all the others, whether geometrical\nor otherwise, are of one man, named Gli Alberti, the very same who has\ndrawn the plants which are in the book of subterraneous Rome; and the\nawkward landscapes which are behind some of the little human figures of\nthe copy which Mons.du Chambray has caused to be printed, have been\nadded to it by one Errard, without my knowing any thing of it."All that is good in this book may be written on one sheet of paper, in\na large character, and those who believe that I approve all that is in\nit, do not know me; I who profess never to give sanction to things of\nmy profession which I know to be ill done and ill said."Whoever recollects the difference in the course of study pursued and\nrecommended by Leonardo (that of Nature), from that observed by Poussin\n(that of the antique), and remembers also the different fortunes of\nLe Brun and Poussin, that the one was at the head of his profession,\nenjoying all its honours and emoluments, while the other, though\nconscious of his own great powers, was toiling for a daily subsistence\nin comparative obscurity, may easily conceive why the latter could not\napprove a work which so strongly inculcates the adopting Nature as the\nguide throughout; and which was at the same time patronized by one whom\nhe could not but consider as his more fortunate rival.It may however\nbe truly affirmed, that even the talents of Poussin, great as they\ncertainly were, and his knowledge and correctness in drawing, would\nhave been abundantly improved by an attention to the rules laid down\nin this Treatise, and that the study of Nature would have freed his\npictures from that resemblance to statues which his figures frequently\nhave, and bestowed on them the soft and fleshy appearance for which\nLeonardo was so remarkable; while a minute investigation of Leonardo\'s\nsystem of colouring would have produced perhaps in him as fortunate a\nchange as we have seen it did in the case of Raphael.Though Bosse tells us[i107], that he had seen in the hands of Mons.Felibien, a manuscript copy of this Tract on Painting, which he said\nhe had taken from the same original mentioned before, for the purpose\nof translating it into French; and that on Bosse\'s pointing out to\nhim some of these errors, and informing him that Mons.de Chambray\nwas far advanced in his translation, he abandoned his design, and\nassigned to the Sieur de Chambray the privilege he had obtained for it;\nwe have no intention here to enumerate or answer Bosse\'s objections,\nmerely because such an undertaking would greatly exceed the limits\nwhich can here be allowed us.Most of them will be found captious\nand splenetic, and, together with the majority of the rest, might be\nfully refuted by a deduction of facts; it is however sufficient on the\npresent occasion to say, that wherever opportunity has been afforded\nof tracing the means by which Leonardo procured his materials for any\ngreat composition, he is found to have exactly pursued the path which\nhe recommends to others[i108]; and for the success of his precepts, and\nwhat may be effected by them, we need only appeal to his own example.To this enumeration of the productions of Leonardo\'s pen, and in\ncontradiction to the fact already asserted, that no part of his\ncollections was ever arranged or prepared for publication by himself,\nit is probable we may be told we should add tracts on Motion; on the\nEquilibrium of bodies; on the nature, equilibrium, and motion of Water;\non Anatomy; on the Anatomy of an horse; on Perspective; and on Light\nand Shadow: which are either mentioned by himself in the Treatise on\nPainting, or ascribed to him by others.But as to these, there is great\nreason for supposing, that, though they might be intended, they were\nnever actually drawn up into form.Certain it is, that no such have\nbeen ever given to the world, as those before noticed are the only\ntreatises of this author that have yet appeared in print; and even they\nhave already been shewn to be no more than extracts from the immense\nmass of his collections of such passages as related to the subjects on\nwhich they profess to give intelligence.If any tracts therefore in his\nname, on any of the above topics, are any where existing in manuscript,\nand in obscurity, it is probable they are only similar selections.And\nindeed it will be found on inspection, that his collections consist\nof a multitude of entries made at different times, without method,\norder, or arrangement of any kind, so as to form an immense chaos of\nintelligence, which he, like many other voluminous collectors, intended\nat some future time to digest and arrange, but unfortunately postponed\nthis task so long, that he did not live to carry that intention into\neffect.Under these circumstances, should it happen, as perhaps it\nmay, that any volume of the whole is confined exclusively to any one\nbranch of science, such as hydrostatics for instance, it was not the\nconsequence of a designed plan, but only arose from this accident, that\nhe had then made that branch the object of his pursuit, and for a time\nlaid aside the rest.In proof of this assertion it may be observed,\nthat the very treatise of light and shadow above mentioned, is\ndescribed as in the Ambrosian library at Milan, and as a folio volume\ncovered with red velvet, presented by Signior Mazzenta to Cardinal\nBorromeo[i109]; from all which circumstances it is evidently proved\nto be one of the volumes now existing in France[i110], which were\ninspected and described by Venturi in the tract so often cited in the\ncourse of this life.Although the principal of Leonardo\'s productions have been already\nmentioned, it has been thought proper, for the satisfaction of the\ncurious, here to subjoin a catalogue of such of them as have come to\nour knowledge; distinguishing in it such as were only drawings, from\nsuch as were finished pictures, and noticing also which of them have\nbeen engraven, and by whom.CATALOGUE\n\n                                OF THE\n\n                                 WORKS\n\n                                  OF\n\n                         _LEONARDO DA VINCI_.Many _designs for plans and buildings_, made by him in his youth[i111]._A model_ made by him for raising the roof of the church of St._The house of the family of Melzi at Vaprio_, supposed by Della Valle\nto be designed by Leonardo[i113].MODELS /and/ SCULPTURE.Some _heads of laughing women_, modelled by him in clay, in his\nyouth[i114].Some _boys\' heads_ also, which appeared to have come from the hand of a\nmaster[i115]._Three figures in bronze_, over the gate on the north side of the\nchurch of St.John, at Florence, made by Gio.Francesco Rustici, but\ndesigned with the advice of Leonardo da Vinci[i116]._A model in clay_, in alto relievo.It is a circle of about two palms\nin diameter, and represents St.Jerom in a grotto, old, and much worn\nout by prayer.Ignazio Hugford, a\npainter at Florence, who was induced to buy it in consequence of the\ngreat praises which in his youth he had heard bestowed on it by the\ncelebrated Anton.Dominico Gabbiani, his master, who knew it to be of\nthe hand of Leonardo.This model appears to have been much studied in\nthe time of Pontormo and Rosso;

but\nVasari says it was never executed, and that in his time the carton\nremained at Florence, in the house of Ottaviano de Medici.Whether this\ncarton is still existing is unknown[i120]._Several ridiculous heads of men and women_, formerly in Vasari\'s\ncollection, drawn in pen and ink[i121].Aurelio Lovino had, says\nLomazzo, a book of sketches by Leonardo, of odd and ridiculous heads.This book appears to have contained about 250 figures of countrymen\nand countrywomen laughing, drawn by the hand of Leonardo.Silvio\nValenti had a similar book, in which were caricature heads drawn with a\npen, like that engraven by Count Caylus.Of these caricatures mention\nis made in the second volume of the Lettere Pittoriche, p.The passage in the Lettere Pittoriche here referred to, is part of a\nletter without any name or date, addressed _Al Sig.C. di C._; but a\nnote of the editor\'s explains these initials, as meaning Sig.Conte\ndi Caylus, and supposes the author to have been the younger Mariette.The letter mentions a collection of heads from Leonardo\'s drawings,\npublished by the Count; and the editor, in another note, tells us, that\nthey are caricature heads drawn in pen and ink; that the originals\nwere bought in Holland, from Sig.Silvio Valenti, and that the\nprints of which the letter speaks, are in the famous collection of the\nCorsini library.The author of the Letter supposes these caricatures to\nhave been drawn when Vinci retired to Melzi\'s house, that he invented\nthem as a new sort of recreation, and intended them as a subject for\nthe academy which he had established at Milan.In another part of the same Letter, p.173, 174, this collection of\ndrawings of heads is again mentioned, and it is there said, that it\nmight be that which belonged to the Earl of Arundel.This conjecture\nis founded on there being many such heads engraven formerly by Hollar.In fact, the number of the plates which he has done from drawings of\nthis painter, are near one hundred, which compose different series.The\nauthor of the Letter adds, that, if a conjecture might be permitted,\nwe might affirm, that this is the collection of heads of which Paul\nLomazzo speaks; at least the description which he gives of a similar\ncollection which was in the hands of Aurelio Lovino, a painter of\nMilan, corresponds with this as well in the number of the drawings\nas their subjects.It represents, like this, studies from old men,\ncountrymen, wrinkled old women, which are all laughing.Another part of\nthis Letter says, it is easy to believe that the collection of drawings\nof heads which occasioned this Letter, might be one of those books in\nwhich Leonardo noted the most singular countenances.198 of the same Letter, Hollar\'s engravings are said to be about\nan hundred, and to have been done at Antwerp in 1645, and the following\nyear; and in p.199, Count Caylus\'s publication is said to contain 59\nplates in aqua fortis, done in 1730, and that this latter is the work\nso often mentioned in the Letter._Another collection of the same kind of caricature heads_ mentioned in\nMariette\'s Letter[i123], as existing in the cabinet of either the King\nof Spain or the King of Sardinia._Four caricature heads_, mentioned, Lett.190,\nas being in the possession of Sig.They are described as\ndrawn with a pen, and are said to have come originally from Vasari\'s\ncollection of drawings.Of this collection it is said, in a note on the\nabove passage, that it was afterwards carried into France, and fell\ninto the hands of a bookseller, who took the volume to pieces, and\ndisposed of the drawings separately, and that many of them came into\nthe cabinets of the King, and Sig.Others say, and it is more\ncredible, that Vasari\'s collection passed into that of the Grand Dukes\nof Medici._A head of Americo Vespucci_, in charcoal, but copied by Vasari in pen\nand ink[i124]._A head of an old man_, beautifully drawn in charcoal[i125]._An head of Scarramuccia, captain of the gypsies_, in chalk; formerly\nbelonging to Pierfrancesco Giambullari, canon of St.Lorenzo, at\nFlorence, and left by him to Donato Valdambrini of Arezzo, canon of St._Several designs of combatants on horseback_, made by Leonardo for\nGentil Borri, a master of defence[i127], to shew the different\npositions necessary for a horse soldier in defending himself, and\nattacking his enemy._A carton of our Saviour, the Virgin, St.John._ Vasari\nsays of this, that for two days, people of all sorts, men and women,\nyoung and old, resorted to Leonardo\'s house to see this wonderful\nperformance, as if they had been going to a solemn feast; and adds,\nthat this carton was afterwards in France.It seems that this was\nintended for an altar-piece for the high altar of the church of the\nAnnunziata, but the picture was never painted[i128].However, when\nLeonardo afterwards went into France, he, at the desire of Francis\nthe First, put the design into colours.Lomazzo has said, that this\ncarton of St.Ann was carried into France; that in his time it was at\nMilan, in the possession of Aurelio Lovino, a painter; and that many\ndrawings from it were in existence.What was the fate this carton of\nSt.Ann underwent, may be seen in a letter of P. Resta, printed in the\nthird volume of the Lettere Pittoriche, in which he says, that Leonardo\nmade three of these cartons, and nevertheless did not convert it into\na picture, but that it was painted by Salai, and that the picture is\nstill in the sacristy of St._A drawing of an old man\'s head, seen in front_, in red chalk;\nmentioned Lett._A carton_ designed by him _for painting the council-chamber at\nFlorence_.The subject which he chose for this purpose was, the history\nof Niccolo Piccinino, the Captain of Duke Philip of Milan, in which\nhe drew a group of men on horseback fighting for a standard[i130].Mariette, in a note, Lett.193, mentions this carton,\nwhich he says represented two horsemen fighting for a standard; that\nit was only part of a large history, the subject of which was the rout\nof Niccolo Piccinino, General of the army of Philip Duke of Milan,\nand that a print was engraven of it by Edelinck, when young, but the\ndrawing from which he worked was a bad one.In the catalogue of prints\nfrom the works of Leonardo, inserted Lett.195, this\nprint is again mentioned and described more truly, as representing\nfour horsemen fighting for a standard.It is there supposed to have\nbeen engraven from a drawing by Fiammingo, and that this drawing might\nhave been made from the picture which Du Fresne speaks of as being in\nhis time in the possession of Sig.La Maire, an excellent painter of\nperspective._A design of Neptune drawn in his car by sea horses, attended by sea\ngods_;

but probably included in Leonardo\'s manuscript\ncollections.Several designs by Leonardo were in the possession of Sig.Jabac, who\nseems to have been a collector of pictures, and to have bought up for\nthe King of France several excellent pictures particularly by Leonardo\nda Vinci[i135]._A drawing of a young man embracing an old woman_, whom he is caressing\nfor the sake of her riches.198, as engraven by Hollar, in 1646._A head of a young man seen in profile_, engraven in aqua fortis\nby Conte di Caylus, from a drawing in the King of France\'s\ncollection[i136]._A fragment of a Treatise on the Motions of the Human Body_, already\nmentioned in the foregoing life.In the Lettere Pittoriche, vol.199, mention is made of a print\nrepresenting _some intertwisted lines upon a black ground_, in the\nstyle of some of Albert Durer\'s engravings in wood.In the middle of\nthis, in a small compartment, is to be read, "/Academia Leonardi Vin/."Vasari, it is there said, has noticed it as a singularity.200 of the same work, a similar print is also noticed, which\ndiffers only in the inscription from the former.In this last it is\n/Academia Leonardi Vici/.Both this and the former print are said to\nbe extremely rare, and only to have been seen in the King of France\'s\ncollection.It does not however appear from any thing in the Lett.The Abate di Villeloin, in his Catalogue of Prints published in 1666,\nspeaks, under the article of Leonardo da Vinci, of a print of the\ntaking down from the Cross;

notwithstanding which, it cannot\nperfectly comprehend more than one object at a time.For example, the\nreader, at one look over this page, immediately perceives it full of\ndifferent characters; but he cannot at the same moment distinguish each\nletter, much less can he comprehend their meaning.He must consider it\nword by word, and line by line, if he be desirous of forming a just\nnotion of these characters.In like manner, if we wish to ascend to\nthe top of an edifice, we must be content to advance step by step,\notherwise we shall never be able to attain it.A young man, who has a natural inclination to the study of this art,\nI would advise to act thus: In order to acquire a true notion of the\nform of things, he must begin by studying the parts which compose\nthem, and not pass to a second till he has well stored his memory, and\nsufficiently practised the first; otherwise he loses his time, and will\nmost certainly protract his studies.And let him remember to acquire\naccuracy before he attempts quickness.III./--_How to discover a young Man\'s Disposition for Painting._\n\n\n/Many/ are very desirous of learning to draw, and are very fond of it,\nwho are, notwithstanding, void of a proper disposition for it.This may\nbe known by their want of perseverance; like boys, who draw every thing\nin a hurry, never finishing, or shadowing.IV./--_Of Painting, and its Divisions._\n\n\n/Painting/ is divided into two principal parts.The first is the figure,\nthat is, the lines which distinguish the forms of bodies, and their\ncomponent parts.The second is the colour contained within those limits.V./--_Division of the Figure._\n\n\n/The/ form of bodies is divided into two parts; that is, the proportion\nof the members to each other, which must correspond with the whole; and\nthe motion, expressive of what passes in the mind of the living figure.VI./--_Proportion of Members._\n\n\n/The/ proportion of members is again divided into two parts, viz.By equality is meant (besides the measure\ncorresponding with the whole), that you do not confound the members\nof a young subject with those of old age, nor plump ones with those\nthat are lean; and that, moreover, you do not blend the robust and firm\nmuscles of man with feminine softness: that the attitudes and motions\nof old age be not expressed with the quickness and alacrity of youth;\nnor those of a female figure like those of a vigorous young man.The\nmotions and members of a strong man should be such as to express his\nperfect state of health.VII./--_Of Dimensions in general._\n\n\n/In/ general, the dimensions of the human body are to be considered\nin the length, and not in the breadth; because in the wonderful works\nof Nature, which we endeavour to imitate, we cannot in any species\nfind any one part in one model precisely similar to the same part in\nanother.Let us be attentive, therefore, to the variation of forms,\nand avoid all monstrosities of proportion; such as long legs united\nto short bodies, and narrow chests with long arms.Observe also\nattentively the measure of joints, in which Nature is apt to vary\nconsiderably; and imitate her example by doing the same.VIII./--_Motion, Changes, and Proportion of Members._\n\n\n/The/ measures of the human body vary in each member, according as it\nis more or less bent, or seen in different views, increasing on one\nside as much as they diminish on the other.IX./--_The Difference of Proportion between Children and grown\nMen._\n\n\n/In/ men and children I find a great difference between the joints of\nthe one and the other in the length of the bones.A man has the length\nof two heads from the extremity of one shoulder to the other, the same\nfrom the shoulder to the elbow, and from the elbow to the fingers; but\nthe child has only one, because Nature gives the proper size first to\nthe seat of the intellect, and afterwards to the other parts.X./--_The Alterations in the Proportion of the human Body from\nInfancy to full Age._\n\n\n/A man/, in his infancy, has the breadth of his shoulders equal to the\nlength of the face, and to the length of the arm from the shoulder\nto the elbow, when the arm is bent[2].It is the same again from the\nlower belly to the knee, and from the knee to the foot.But, when a\nman is arrived at the period of his full growth, every one of these\ndimensions becomes double in length, except the face, which, with\nthe top of the head, undergoes but very little alteration in length.A well-proportioned and full-grown man, therefore, is ten times the\nlength of his face; the breadth of his shoulders will be two faces, and\nin like manner all the above lengths will be double.The rest will be\nexplained in the general measurement of the human body[3].XI./--_Of the Proportion of Members._\n\n\n/All/ the parts of any animal whatever must be correspondent with\nthe whole.So that, if the body be short and thick, all the members\nbelonging to it must be the same.One that is long and thin must have\nits parts of the same kind; and so of the middle size.Something of the\nsame may be observed in plants, when uninjured by men or tempests; for\nwhen thus injured they bud and grow again, making young shoots from old\nplants, and by those means destroying their natural symmetry.XII./--_That every Part be proportioned to its Whole._\n\n\n/If/ a man be short and thick, be careful that all his members be\nof the same nature, viz.short arms and thick, large hands, short\nfingers, with broad joints; and so of the rest.XIII./--_Of the Proportion of the Members._\n\n\n/Measure/ upon yourself the proportion of the parts, and, if you find\nany of them defective, note it down, and be very careful to avoid it in\ndrawing your own compositions.For this is reckoned a common fault in\npainters, to delight in the imitation of themselves.XIV./--_The Danger of forming an erroneous Judgment in regard to\nthe Proportion and Beauty of the Parts._\n\n\n/If/ the painter has clumsy hands, he will be apt to introduce them\ninto his works, and so of any other part of his person, which may not\nhappen to be so beautiful as it ought to be.He must, therefore, guard\nparticularly against that self-love, or too good opinion of his own\nperson, and study by every means to acquire the knowledge of what is\nmost beautiful, and of his own defects, that he may adopt the one and\navoid the other.XV./--_Another Precept._\n\n\n/The/ young painter must, in the first instance, accustom his hand to\ncopying the drawings of good masters; and when his hand is thus formed,\nand ready, he should, with the advice of his director, use himself also\nto draw from relievos; according to the rules we shall point out in the\ntreatise on drawing from relievos[4].XVI./--_The Manner of drawing from Relievos, and rendering Paper\nfit for it._\n\n\n/When/ you draw from relievos, tinge your paper of some darkish\ndemi-tint.And after you have made your outline, put in the darkest\nshadows, and, last of all, the principal lights, but sparingly,\nespecially the smaller ones; because those are easily lost to the eye\nat a very moderate distance[5].XVII./--_Of drawing from Casts or Nature._\n\n\n/In/ drawing from relievo, the draftsman must place himself in such a\nmanner, as that the eye of the figure to be drawn be level with his\nown[6].XVIII./--_To draw Figures from Nature._\n\n\n/Accustom/ yourself to hold a plummet in your hand, that you may judge\nof the bearing of the parts.XIX./--_Of drawing from Nature._\n\n\n/When/ you draw from Nature, you must be at the distance of three times\nthe height of the object; and when you begin to draw, form in your own\nmind a certain principal line (suppose a perpendicular); observe well\nthe bearing of the parts towards that line; whether they intersect, are\nparallel to it, or oblique.XX./--_Of drawing Academy Figures._\n\n\n/When/ you draw from a naked model, always sketch in the whole of the\nfigure, suiting all the members well to each other; and though you\nfinish only that part which appears the best, have a regard to the\nrest, that, whenever you make use of such studies, all the parts may\nhang together.In composing your attitudes, take care not to turn the head on the same\nside as the breast, nor let the arm go in a line with the leg[7].If\nthe head turn towards the right shoulder, the parts must be lower on\nthe left side than on the other; but if the chest come forward, and the\nhead turn towards the left, the parts on the right side are to be the\nhighest.XXI./--_Of studying in the Dark, on first waking in the Morning,\nand before going to sleep._\n\n\n/I have/ experienced no small benefit, when in the dark and in bed, by\nretracing in my mind the outlines of those forms which I had previously\nstudied, particularly such as had appeared the most difficult to\ncomprehend and retain; by this method they will be confirmed and\ntreasured up in the memory.XXII./--_Observations on drawing Portraits._\n\n\n/The/ cartilage, which raises the nose in the middle of the face,\nvaries in eight different ways.It is equally straight, equally\nconcave, or equally convex, which is the first sort.Or, secondly,\nunequally straight, concave, or convex.Or, thirdly, straight in the\nupper part, and concave in the under.Or, fourthly, straight again\nin the upper part, and convex in those below.Or, fifthly, it may be\nconcave and straight beneath.Or, sixthly, concave above, and convex\nbelow.Or, seventhly, it may be convex in the upper part, and straight\nin the lower.And in the eighth and last place, convex above, and\nconcave beneath.The uniting of the nose with the brows is in two ways, either it is\nstraight or concave.It is\nstraight, concave, or round.The first is divided into two parts, viz.it is either convex in the upper part, or in the lower, sometimes both;\nor else flat above and below.XXIII./--_The Method of retaining in the Memory the Likeness of\na Man, so as to draw his Profile, after having seen him only once._\n\n\n/You/ must observe and remember well the variations of the four\nprincipal features in the profile; the nose, mouth, chin, and forehead.And first of the nose, of which there are three different sorts[8],\nstraight, concave, and convex.Of the straight there are but four\nvariations, short or long, high at the end, or low.Of the concave\nthere are three sorts; some have the concavity above, some in the\nmiddle, and some at the end.The convex noses also vary three ways;\nsome project in the upper part, some in the middle, and others at the\nbottom.Nature, which seems to delight in infinite variety, gives again\nthree changes to those noses which have a projection in the middle; for\nsome have it straight, some concave, and some convex.XXIV./--_How to remember the Form of a Face._\n\n\n/If/ you wish to retain with facility the general look of a face, you\nmust first learn how to draw well several faces, mouths, eyes, noses,\nchins, throats, necks, and shoulders; in short, all those principal\nparts which distinguish one man from another.For instance, noses are\noften different sorts[9].Straight, bunched, concave, some raised\nabove, some below the middle, aquiline, flat, round, and sharp.In the front view there are eleven different sorts.Even, thick in the middle, thin in the middle, thick at the tip, thin\nat the beginning, thin at the tip, and thick at the beginning.Broad,\nnarrow, high, and low nostrils; some with a large opening, and some\nmore shut towards the tip.The same variety will be found in the other parts of the face, which\nmust be drawn from Nature, and retained in the memory.Or else, when\nyou mean to draw a likeness from memory, take with you a pocket-book,\nin which you have marked all these variations of features, and after\nhaving given a look at the face you mean to draw, retire a little\naside, and note down in your book which of the features are similar to\nit; that you may put it all together at home.XXV./--_That a Painter should take Pleasure in the Opinion of\nevery body._\n\n\n/A painter/ ought not certainly to refuse listening to the opinion of\nany one; for we know that, although a man be not a painter, he may have\njust notions of the forms of men; whether a man has a hump on his back,\na thick leg, or a large hand; whether he be lame, or have any other\ndefect.Now, if we know that men are able to judge of the works of\nNature, should we not think them more able to detect our errors?XXVI./--_What is principally to be observed in Figures._\n\n\n/The/ principal and most important consideration required in drawing\nfigures, is to set the head well upon the shoulders, the chest upon the\nhips, the hips and shoulders upon the feet.XXVII./--_Mode of Studying._\n\n\n/Study/ the science first, and then follow the practice which results\nfrom that science.Pursue method in your study, and do not quit one\npart till it be perfectly engraven in the memory; and observe what\ndifference there is between the members of animals and their joints[10].XXVIII./--_Of being universal._\n\n\n/It/ is an easy matter for a man who is well versed in the principles\nof his art, to become universal in the practice of it, since all\nanimals have a similarity of members, that is, muscles, tendons, bones,\n&c. These only vary in length or thickness, as will be demonstrated\nin the Anatomy[11].As for aquatic animals, of which there is great\nvariety, I shall not persuade the painter to take them as a rule,\nhaving no connexion with our purpose.XXIX./--_A Precept for the Painter._\n\n\n/It/ reflects no great honour on a painter to be able to execute only\none thing well, such as a head, an academy figure, or draperies,\nanimals, landscape, or the like, confining himself to some particular\nobject of study; because there is scarcely a person so void of genius\nas to fail of success, if he apply earnestly to one branch of study,\nand practise it continually.XXX./--_Of the Measures of the human Body, and the bending of\nMembers._\n\n\n/It/ is very necessary that painters should have a knowledge of\nthe bones which support the flesh by which they are covered, but\nparticularly of the joints, which increase and diminish the length of\nthem in their appearance.As in the arm, which does not measure the\nsame when bent, as when extended; its difference between the greatest\nextension and bending, is about one eighth of its length.The increase\nand diminution of the arm is effected by the bone projecting out of\nits socket at the elbow; which, as is seen in figure A B, Plate I. is\nlengthened from the shoulder to the elbow; the angle it forms being\nless than a right angle.It will appear longer as that angle becomes\nmore acute, and will shorten in proportion as it becomes more open or\nobtuse._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.XXXI./--_Of the small Bones in several Joints of the human Body._\n\n\n/There/ are in the joints of the human body certain small bones, fixed\nin the middle of the tendons which connect several of the joints.Such\nare the patellas of the knees, and the joints of the shoulders, and\nthose of the feet.They are eight in number, one at each shoulder, one\nat each knee, and two at each foot under the first joint of the great\ntoe towards the heel.These grow extremely hard as a man advances in\nyears.XXXII./--_Memorandum to be observed by the Painter._\n\n\n/Note/ down which muscles and tendons are brought into action by the\nmotion of any member, and when they are hidden.Remember that these\nremarks are of the greatest importance to painters and sculptors, who\nprofess to study anatomy, and the science of the muscles.Do the same\nwith children, following the different gradations of age from their\nbirth even to decrepitude, describing the changes which the members,\nand particularly the joints, undergo; which of them grow fat, and which\nlean.XXXIII./--_The Shoulders._\n\n\n/The/ joints of the shoulders, and other parts which bend, shall be\nnoticed in their places in the Treatise on Anatomy, where the cause\nof the motions of all the parts which compose the human body shall be\nexplained[12].XXXIV./--_The Difference of Joints between Children and grown\nMen._\n\n\n/Young/ children have all their joints small, but they are thick and\nplump in the spaces between them; because there is nothing upon the\nbones at the joints, but some tendons to bind the bones together.The\nsoft flesh, which is full of fluids, is enclosed under the skin in the\nspace between the joints; and as the bones are bigger at the joints\nthan in the space between them, the skin throws off in the progress to\nmanhood that superfluity, and draws nearer to the bones, thinning the\nwhole part together.But upon the joints it does not lessen, as there\nis nothing but cartilages and tendons.For these reasons children are\nsmall in the joints, and plump in the space between, as may be observed\nin their fingers, arms, and narrow shoulders.Men, on the contrary, are\nlarge and full in the joints, in the arms and legs; and where children\nhave hollows, men are knotty and prominent.XXXV./--_Of the Joints of the Fingers._\n\n\n/The/ joints of the fingers appear larger on all sides when they\nbend; the more they bend the larger they appear.It is the same in the toes, and it will be more\nperceptible in proportion to their fleshiness.XXXVI./--_Of the Joint of the Wrist._\n\n\n/The/ wrist or joint between the hand and arm lessens on closing the\nhand, and grows larger when it opens.The contrary happens in the arm,\nin the space between the elbow and the hand, on all sides; because in\nopening the hand the muscles are extended and thinned in the arm, from\nthe elbow to the wrist; but when the hand is shut, the same muscles\nswell and shorten.The tendons alone start, being stretched by the\nclenching of the hand.XXXVII./--_Of the Joint of the Foot._\n\n\n/The/ increase and diminution in the joint of the foot is produced\non that side where the tendons are seen, as D E F, _Plate I._ which\nincreases when the angle is acute, and diminishes when it becomes\nobtuse.It must be understood of the joint in the front part of the\nfoot A B C.XXXVIII./--_Of the Knee._\n\n\n/Of/ all the members which have pliable joints, the knee is the only\none that lessens in the bending, and becomes larger by extension.XXXIX./--_Of the Joints._\n\n\n/All/ the joints of the human body become larger by bending, except\nthat of the leg.XL./--_Of the Naked._\n\n\n/When/ a figure is to appear nimble and delicate, its muscles must\nnever be too much marked, nor are any of them to be much swelled.Because such figures are expressive of activity and swiftness, and are\nnever loaded with much flesh upon the bones.They are made light by the\nwant of flesh, and where there is but little flesh there cannot be any\nthickness of muscles.XLI./--_Of the Thickness of the Muscles._\n\n\n/Muscular/ men have large bones, and are in general thick and short,\nwith very little fat; because the fleshy muscles in their growth\ncontract closer together, and the fat, which in other instances lodges\nbetween them, has no room.The muscles in such thin subjects, not being\nable to extend, grow in thickness, particularly towards their middle,\nin the parts most removed from the extremities.XLII./--_Fat Subjects have small Muscles._\n\n\n/Though/ fat people have this in common with muscular men, that they\nare frequently short and thick, they have thin muscles; but their skin\ncontains a great deal of spongy and soft flesh full of air; for that\nreason they are lighter upon the water, and swim better than muscular\npeople.XLIII./--_Which of the Muscles disappear in the different\nMotions of the Body._\n\n\n/In/ raising or lowering the arm, the pectoral muscles disappear, or\nacquire a greater relievo.A similar effect is produced by the hips,\nwhen they bend either inwards or outwards.It is to be observed, that\nthere is more variety of appearances in the shoulders, hips, and neck,\nthan in any other joint, because they are susceptible of the greatest\nvariety of motions.But of this subject I shall make a separate\ntreatise[13].XLIV./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscles are not to be scrupulously marked all the way, because it\nwould be disagreeable to the sight, and of very difficult execution.But on that side only where the members are in action, they should\nbe pronounced more strongly; for muscles that are at work naturally\ncollect all their parts together, to gain increase of strength, so\nthat some small parts of those muscles will appear, that were not seen\nbefore.XLV./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscles of young men are not to be marked strongly, nor too much\nswelled, because that would indicate full strength and vigour of age,\nwhich they have not yet attained.Nevertheless they must be more or\nless expressed, as they are more or less employed.For those which are\nin motion are always more swelled and thicker than those which remain\nat rest.The intrinsic and central line of the members which are bent,\nnever retains its natural length.XLVI./--_The Extension and Contraction of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscle at the back part of the thigh shows more variety in\nits extension and contraction, than any other in the human body; the\nsecond, in that respect, are those which compose the buttocks; the\nthird, those of the back; the fourth, those of the neck; the fifth,\nthose of the shoulders; and the sixth, those of the Abdomen, which,\ntaking their rise under the breast, terminate under the lower belly; as\nI shall explain when I speak of each.XLVII./--_Of the Muscle between the Chest and the lower Belly._\n\n\n/There/ is a muscle which begins under the breast at the Sternum, and\nis inserted into, or terminates at the Os pubis, under the lower belly.It is called the Rectus of the Abdomen; it is divided, lengthways,\ninto three principal portions, by transverse tendinous intersections\nor ligaments, viz.the superior part, and a ligament; the second part,\nwith its ligaments; and the third part, with the third ligament;\nwhich last unites by tendons to the Os pubis.These divisions and\nintersections of the same muscle are intended by nature to facilitate\nthe motion when the body is bent or distended.If it were made of one\npiece, it would produce too much variety when extended, or contracted,\nand also would be considerably weaker.When this muscle has but little\nvariety in the motion of the body, it is more beautiful[14].XLVIII./--_Of a Man\'s complex Strength, but first of the Arm._\n\n\n/The/ muscles which serve either to straighten or bend the arm, arise\nfrom the different processes of the Scapula; some of them from the\nprotuberances of the Humerus, and others about the middle of the Os\nhumeri.The extensors of the arm arise from behind, and the flexors\nfrom before.That a man has more power in pulling than in pushing, has been proved\nby the ninth proposition De Ponderibus[15], where it is said, that of\ntwo equal weights, that will have the greatest power which is farthest\nremoved from the pole or centre of its balance.It follows then of\ncourse, that the muscle N B, _Plate II._ and the muscle N C, being of\nequal power, the inner muscle N C, will nevertheless be stronger than\nthe outward one N B, because it is inserted into the arm at C, a point\nfarther removed from the centre of the elbow A, than B, which is on\nthe other side of such centre, so that that question is determined.But this is a simple power, and I thought it best to explain it before\nI mentioned the complex power of the muscles, of which I must now\ntake notice.The complex power, or strength, is, for instance, this,\nwhen the arm is going to act, a second power is added to it (such as\nthe weight of the body and the strength of the legs, in pulling or\npushing), consisting in the extension of the parts, as when two men\nattempt to throw down a column; the one by pushing, and the other by\npulling[16].XLIX./--_In which of the two Actions, Pulling or Pushing, a Man\nhas the greatest Power_, Plate II./A man/ has the greatest power in pulling, for in that action he has\nthe united exertion of all the muscles of the arm, while some of them\nmust be inactive when he is pushing; because when the arm is extended\nfor that purpose, the muscles which move the elbow cannot act, any\nmore than if he pushed with his shoulders against the column he means\nto throw down; in which case only the muscles that extend the back,\nthe legs under the thigh, and the calves of the legs, would be active.From which we conclude, that in pulling there is added to the power\nof extension the strength of the arms, of the legs, of the back, and\neven of the chest, if the oblique motion of the body require it.But\nin pushing, though all the parts were employed, yet the strength of\nthe muscles of the arms is wanting; for to push with an extended arm\nwithout motion does not help more than if a piece of wood were placed\nfrom the shoulder to the column meant to be pushed down._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.L./--_Of the bending of Members, and of the Flesh round the\nbending Joint._\n\n\n/The/ flesh which covers the bones near and at the joints, swells or\ndiminishes in thickness according to their bending or extension; that\nis, it increases at the inside of the angle formed by the bending, and\ngrows narrow and lengthened on the outward side of the exterior angle.The middle between the convex and concave angle participates of this\nincrease or diminution, but in a greater or less degree as the parts\nare nearer to, or farther from, the angles of the bending joints.LI./--_Of the naked Body._\n\n\n/The/ members of naked men who work hard in different attitudes, will\nshew the muscles more strongly on that side where they act forcibly to\nbring the part into action; and the other muscles will be more or less\nmarked, in proportion as they co-operate in the same motion.LII./--_Of a Ligament without Muscles._\n\n\n/Where/ the arm joins with the hand, there is a ligament, the largest\nin the human body, which is without muscles, and is called the strong\nligament of the Carpus; it has a square shape, and serves to bind\nand keep close together the bones of the arm, and the tendons of the\nfingers, and prevent their dilating, or starting out.LIII./--_Of Creases._\n\n\n/In/ bending the joints the flesh will always form a crease on the\nopposite side to that where it is tight.LIV./--_How near behind the Back one Arm can be brought to the\nother_, Plate III./When/ the arms are carried behind the back, the elbows can never be\nbrought nearer than the length from the elbow to the end of the longest\nfinger; so that the fingers will not be seen beyond the elbows, and\nin that situation, the arms with the shoulders form a perfect square.The greatest extension of the arm across the chest is, when the elbow\ncomes over the pit of the stomach; the elbow and the shoulder in this\nposition, will form an equilateral triangle.LV./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/A naked/ figure being strongly marked, so as to give a distinct view\nof all the muscles, will not express any motion; because it cannot\nmove, if some of its muscles do not relax while the others are pulling.Those which relax cease to appear in proportion as the others pull\nstrongly and become apparent._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 24_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LVI./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscles of the human body are to be more or less marked according\nto their degree of action.Those only which act are to be shewn, and\nthe more forcibly they act, the stronger they should be pronounced.Those that do not act at all must remain soft and flat.LVII./--_Of the Bending of the Body._\n\n\n/The/ bodies of men diminish as much on the side which bends, as they\nincrease on the opposite side.That diminution may at last become\ndouble, in proportion to the extension on the other side.But of this I\nshall make a separate treatise[17].LVIII./--_The same Subject._\n\n\n/The/ body which bends, lengthens as much on one side as it shortens\non the other; but the central line between them will never lessen or\nincrease.LIX./--_The Necessity of anatomical Knowledge._\n\n\n/The/ painter who has obtained a perfect knowledge of the nature of the\ntendons and muscles, and of those parts which contain the most of them,\nwill know to a certainty, in giving a particular motion to any part of\nthe body, which, and how many of the muscles give rise and contribute\nto it; which of them, by swelling, occasion their shortening, and which\nof the cartilages they surround.He will not imitate those who, in all the different attitudes they\nadopt, or invent, make use of the same muscles, in the arms, back, or\nchest, or any other parts.MOTION AND EQUIPOISE OF FIGURES.LX./--_Of the Equipoise of a Figure standing still._\n\n\n/The/ non-existence of motion in any animal resting on its feet, is\nowing to the equality of weight distributed on each side of the line of\ngravity.LXI./--_Motion produced by the Loss of Equilibrium._\n\n\n/Motion/ is created by the loss of due equipoise, that is, by\ninequality of weight; for nothing can move of itself, without losing\nits centre of gravity, and the farther that is removed, the quicker and\nstronger will be the motion._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LXII./--_Of the Equipoise of Bodies_, Plate V./The/ balance or equipoise of parts in the human body is of two sorts,\nviz.Simple, when a man stands upon his feet\nwithout motion: in that situation, if he extends his arms at different\ndistances from the middle, or stoop, the centre of his weight will\nalways be in a perpendicular line upon the centre of that foot which\nsupports the body; and if he rests equally upon both feet, then the\nmiddle of the chest will be perpendicular to the middle of the line\nwhich measures the space between the centres of his feet.The complex balance is, when a man carries a weight not his own, which\nhe bears by different motions; as in the figure of Hercules stifling\nAnteus, by pressing him against his breast with his arms, after he has\nlifted him from the ground.He must have as much of his own weight\nthrown behind the central line of his feet, as the weight of Anteus\nadds before.LXIII./--_Of Positions._\n\n\n/The/ pit of the neck, between the two Clavicles, falls perpendicularly\nwith the foot which bears the weight of the body.If one of the arms be\nthrown forwards, this pit will quit that perpendicular; and if one of\nthe legs goes back, that pit is brought forwards, and so changes its\nsituation at every change of posture.LXIV./--_Of balancing the Weight round the Centre of Gravity in\nBodies._\n\n\n/A figure/ standing upon its feet without motion, will form an\nequipoise of all its members round the centre of its support.If this figure without motion, and resting upon its feet, happens to\nmove one of its arms forwards, it must necessarily throw as much of its\nweight on the opposite side, as is equal to that of the extended arm\nand the accidental weight.And the same I say of every part, which is\nbrought out beyond its usual balance.LXV./--_Of Figures that have to lift up, or carry any Weight._\n\n\n/A weight/ can never be lifted up or carried by any man, if he do not\nthrow more than an equal weight of his own on the opposite side.LXVI./--_The Equilibrium of a Man standing upon his Feet_, Plate\nVI./The/ weight of a man resting upon one leg will always be equally\ndivided on each side of the central or perpendicular line of gravity,\nwhich supports him.LXVII./--_Of Walking_, Plate VII./A man/ walking will always have the centre of gravity over the centre\nof the leg which rests upon the ground._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 28_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LXVIII./--_Of the Centre of Gravity in Men and Animals._\n\n\n/The/ legs, or centre of support, in men and animals, will approach\nnearer to the centre of gravity, in proportion to the slowness of their\nmotion; and, on the contrary, when the motion is quicker, they will be\nfarther removed from that perpendicular line.LXIX./--_Of the corresponding Thickness of Parts on each Side of\nthe Body._\n\n\n/The/ thickness or breadth of the parts in the human body will never be\nequal on each side, if the corresponding members do not move equally\nand alike.LXX./--_Of the Motions of Animals._\n\n\n/All/ bipeds in their motions lower the part immediately over the foot\nthat is raised, more than over that resting on the ground, and the\nhighest parts do just the contrary.This is observable in the hips and\nshoulders of a man when he walks; and also in birds in the head and\nrump.LXXI./--_Of Quadrupeds and their Motions._\n\n\n/The/ highest parts of quadrupeds are susceptible of more variation\nwhen they walk, than when they are still, in a greater or less degree,\nin proportion to their size.This proceeds from the oblique position of\ntheir legs when they touch the ground, which raise the animal when they\nbecome straight and perpendicular upon the ground.LXXII./--_Of the Quickness or Slowness of Motion._\n\n\n/The/ motion performed by a man, or any other animal whatever, in\nwalking, will have more or less velocity as the centre of their weight\nis more or less removed from the centre of that foot upon which they\nare supported.LXXIII./--_Of the Motion of Animals._\n\n\n/That/ figure will appear the swiftest in its course which leans the\nmost forwards.Any body, moving of itself, will do it with more or less velocity\nin proportion as the centre of its gravity is more or less removed\nfrom the centre of its support.This is mentioned chiefly in regard\nto the motion of birds, which, without any clapping of their wings,\nor assistance of wind, move themselves.This happens when the centre\nof their gravity is out of the centre of their support, viz.out of\nits usual residence, the middle between the two wings.Because, if\nthe middle of the wings be more backward than the centre of the whole\nweight, the bird will move forwards and downwards, in a greater or\nless degree as the centre of its weight is more or less removed from\nthe middle of its wings.From which it follows, that if the centre of\ngravity be far removed from the other centre, the descent of the bird\nwill be very oblique; but if that centre be near the middle of the\nwings, the descent will have very little obliquity._London, Published by J.

Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LXXIX./--_In what Manner extending one Arm alters the Balance._\n\n\n/The/ extending of the arm, which was bent, removes the weight of the\nfigure upon the foot which bears the weight of the whole body: as is\nobservable in rope-dancers, who dance upon the rope with their arms\nopen, without any pole.LXXX./--_Of a Man bearing a Weight on his Shoulders_, Plate X./The/ shoulder which bears the weight is always higher than the other.This is seen in the figure opposite, in which the centre line passes\nthrough the whole, with an equal weight on each side, to the leg on\nwhich it rests.If the weight were not equally divided on each side\nof this central line of gravity, the whole would fall to the ground.But Nature has provided, that as much of the natural weight of the man\nshould be thrown on one side, as of accidental weight on the other,\nto form a counterpoise.This is effected by the man\'s bending, and\nleaning on the side not loaded, so as to form an equilibrium to the\naccidental weight he carries; and this cannot be done, unless the\nloaded shoulder be raised, and the other lowered.This is the resource\nwith which Nature has furnished a man on such occasions.LXXXI./--_Of Equilibrium._\n\n\n/Any/ figure bearing an additional weight out of the central line, must\nthrow as much natural or accidental weight on the opposite side as is\nsufficient to form a counterpoise round that line, which passes from\nthe pit of the neck, through the whole mass of weight, to that part\nof the foot which rests upon the ground.We observe, that when a man\nlifts a weight with one arm, he naturally throws out the opposite arm;\nand if that be not enough to form an equipoise, he will add as much of\nhis own weight, by bending his body, as will enable him to resist such\naccidental load.We see also, that a man ready to fall sideways and\nbackwards at the same time, always throws out the arm on the opposite\nside.LXXXII./--_Of Motion._\n\n\n/Whether/ a man moves with velocity or slowness, the parts above the\nleg which sustains the weight, will always be lower than the others on\nthe opposite side.LXXXIII./--_The Level of the Shoulders._\n\n\n/The/ shoulders or sides of a man, or any other animal, will preserve\nless of their level, in proportion to the slowness of their motion;\nand, _vice versa_, those parts will lose less of their level when the\nmotion is quicker.This is proved by the ninth proposition, treating of\nlocal motions, where it is said, any weight will press in the direction\nof the line of its motion; therefore the whole moving towards any one\npoint, the parts belonging to it will follow the shortest line of the\nmotion of its whole, without giving any of its weight to the collateral\nparts of the whole._London, Published by J.

Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LXXXIV./--_Objection to the above answered_, Plate XI./It/ has been objected, in regard to the first part of the above\nproposition, that it does not follow that a man standing still, or\nmoving slowly, has his members always in perfect balance upon the\ncentre of gravity; because we do not find that Nature always follows\nthat rule, but, on the contrary, the figure will sometimes bend\nsideways, standing upon one foot; sometimes it will rest part of its\nweight upon that leg which is bent at the knee, as is seen in the\nfigures B C. But I shall reply thus, that what is not performed by the\nshoulders in the figure C, is done by the hip, as is demonstrated in\nanother place.LXXXV./--_Of the Position of Figures_, Plate XIII./In/ the same proportion as that part of the naked figure marked D A,\nlessens in height from the shoulder to the hip, on account of its\nposition the opposite side increases.And this is the reason: the\nfigure resting upon one (suppose the left) foot, that foot becomes the\ncentre of all the weight above; and the pit of the neck, formed by the\njunction of the two Clavicles, quits also its natural situation at the\nupper extremity of the perpendicular line (which passes through the\nmiddle surface of the body), to bend over the same foot; and as this\nline bends with it, it forces the transverse lines, which are always at\nright angles, to lower their extremities on that side where the foot\nrests, as appears in A B C. The navel and middle parts always preserve\ntheir natural height.LXXXVI./--_Of the Joints._\n\n\n/In/ the bending of the joints it is particularly useful to observe the\ndifference and variety of shape they assume; how the muscles swell on\none side, while they flatten on the other; and this is more apparent in\nthe neck, because the motion of it is of three sorts, two of which are\nsimple motions, and the other complex, participating also of the other\ntwo.The simple motions are, first, when the neck bends towards the\nshoulder, either to the right or left, and when it raises or lowers\nthe head.The second is, when it twists to the right or left, without\nrising or bending, but straight, with the head turned towards one of\nthe shoulders.The third motion, which is called complex, is, when to\nthe bending of it is added the twisting, as when the ear leans towards\none of the shoulders, the head turning the same way, and the face\nturned upwards.LXXXVII./--_Of the Shoulders._\n\n\n/Of/ those which the shoulders can perform, simple motions are the\nprincipal, such as moving the arm upwards and downwards, backwards and\nforwards.Though one might almost call those motions infinite, for if\nthe arm can trace a circle upon a wall, it will have performed all the\nmotions belonging to the shoulders.Every continued quantity being\ndivisible _ad infinitum_, and this circle being a continued quantity,\nproduced by the motion of the arm going through every part of the\ncircumference, it follows, that the']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The engine of the parliamentary train\nstruck the rear carriage of the excursion train and mounted upon\nits fragments, and then on those of the carriage in front of it,\nuntil its smoke-stack came in contact with the roof of the tunnel.The collision had\ntaken place so far within the tunnel as to be beyond the reach of\ndaylight, and the wreck of the trains had quite blocked up the arch,\nwhile the steam and smoke from the engines poured forth with loud\nsound and in heavy volumes, filling the empty space with stifling\nand scalding vapors.When at last assistance came and the trains\ncould be separated, twenty-three corpses were taken from the ruins,\nwhile one hundred and seventy-six other persons had sustained more\nor less severe injuries.A not less extraordinary accident of the same description,\nunaccompanied, however, by an equal loss of life, occured on the\nGreat Northern Railway upon the 10th of June, 1866.In this case\nthe tube of a locomotive of a freight train burst at about the\ncentre of the Welwyn Tunnel, some five miles north of Hatfield,\nbringing the train to a stand-still.The guard in charge of the\nrear of the train failed from some cause to go back and give the\nsignal for an obstruction, and speedily another freight train from\nthe Midland road entered and dashed into the rear of the train\nalready there.Apparently those in charge of these two trains were\nin such consternation that they did not think to provide against a\nfurther disaster; at any rate, before measures to that end had been\ntaken, an additional freight train, this time belonging to the Great\nNorthern road, came up and plowed into the ruins which already\nblocked the tunnel.One of the trains had contained wagons laden\nwith casks of oil, which speedily became ignited from contact with\nthe coals scattered from the fire-boxes, and there then ensued one\nof the most extraordinary spectacles ever witnessed on a railroad.The tunnel was filled to the summit of its arch and completely\nblocked with the wrecked locomotives and wagons.These had ignited,\nand the whole cavity, more than a half a mile in length, was\nconverted into one huge furnace, belching forth smoke and flame with\na loud roaring sound through its several air shafts.So fierce was\nthe fire that no attempt was made to subdue it, and eighteen hours\nelapsed before any steps could be taken towards clearing the track.Strange to say, in this disaster the lives of but two persons were\nlost.Rear-end collisions have been less frequent in this country than\nin England, for the simple reason that the volume of traffic has\npressed less heavily on the capacity of the lines.Yet here, also,\nthey have been by no means unknown.In 1865 two occurred, both of\nwhich were accompanied with a considerable loss of life; though,\ncoming as they did during the exciting scenes which marked the\nclose of the war of the Rebellion, they attracted much less public\nnotice than they otherwise would.The first of these took place in\nNew Jersey on the 7th of March, 1865, just three days after the\nsecond inauguration of President Lincoln.As the express train\nfrom Washington to New York over the Camden & Amboy road was\npassing through Bristol, about thirty miles from Philadelphia, at\nhalf-past-two o\'clock in the morning, it dashed into the rear of\nthe twelve o\'clock "owl train," from Kensington to New York, which\nhad been delayed by meeting an oil train on the track before it.The case appears to have been one of very culpable negligence, for,\nthough the owl train was some two hours late, those in charge of it\nseem to have been so deeply engrossed in what was going on before\nthem that they wholly neglected to guard their rear.The express\ntrain accordingly, approaching around a curve, plunged at a high\nrate of speed into the last car, shattering it to pieces; the engine\nis even said to have passed completely through that car and to have\nimbedded itself in the one before it.It so happened that most of\nthe sufferers by this accident, numbering about fifty, were soldiers\non their way home from the army upon furlough.The second of the two disasters referred to, occurred on the 16th of\nAugust, 1865, upon the Housatonic road of Connecticut.A new engine\nwas out upon an experimental trip, and in rounding a curve it ran\ninto the rear of a passenger train, which, having encountered a\ndisabled freight train, had coupled on to it and was then backing\ndown with it to a siding in order to get by.In this case the\nimpetus was so great that the colliding locomotive utterly destroyed\nthe rear car of the passenger train and penetrated some distance\ninto the car preceding it, where its boiler burst.Fortunately\nthe train was by no means full of passengers; but, even as it was,\neleven persons were killed and some seventeen badly injured.The great peculiarity of the Revere accident, and that which gave\na permanent interest to it, lay in the revelation it afforded of\nthe degree in which a system had outgrown its appliances.The railroads of New England had\nlong been living on their early reputation, and now, when a sudden\ntest was applied, it was found that they were years behind the time.In August, 1871, the Eastern railroad was run as if it were a line\nof stage-coaches in the days before the telegraph.Not in one point\nalone, but in everything, it broke down under the test.The disaster\nwas due not to any single cause but to a combination of causes\nimplicating not only the machinery and appliances in use by the\ncompany, but its discipline and efficiency from the highest official\ndown to the meanest subordinate.In the first place the capacity of\nthe road was taxed to the utmost; it was vital, almost, that every\nwheel should be kept in motion.Yet, under that very exigency, the\nwheels stopped almost as a matter of necessity.How could it be\notherwise?--Here was a crowded line, more than half of which was\nequipped with but a single track, in operating which no reliance was\nplaced upon the telegraph.With trains running out of their schedule\ntime and out of their schedule place, engineers and conductors were\nleft to grope their way along as best they could in the light of\nrules, the essence of which was that when in doubt they were to\nstand stock still.Then, in the absence of the telegraph, a block\noccurred almost at the mouth of the terminal station; and there the\ntrains stood for hours in stupid obedience to a stupid rule, because\nthe one man who, with a simple regard to the dictates of common\nsense, was habitually accustomed to violate it happened to be sick.Trains commonly left a station out of time and out of place; and\nthe engineer of an express train was sent out to run a gauntlet the\nwhole length of the road with a simple verbal injunction to look\nout for some one before him.Then, at last, when this express train\nthrough all this chaos got to chasing an accommodation train, much\nas a hound might course a hare, there was not a pretence of a signal\nto indicate the time which had elapsed between the passage of the\ntwo, and employés, lanterns in hand, gaped on in bewilderment at the\nawful race, concluding that they could not at any rate do anything\nto help matters, but on the whole they were inclined to think that\nthose most immediately concerned must know what they were about.Finally, even when the disaster was imminent, when deficiency in\norganization and discipline had done its worst, its consequences\nmight yet have been averted through the use of better appliances;\nhad the one train been equipped with the Westinghouse brake,\nalready largely in use in other sections of the country, it might\nand would have been stopped; or had the other train been provided\nwith reflecting tail-lights in place of the dim hand-lanterns which\nglimmered on its rear platform, it could hardly have failed to make\nits proximity known.Any one of a dozen things, every one of which\nshould have been but was not, ought to have averted the disaster.Obviously its immediate cause was not far to seek.It lay in the\ncarelessness of a conductor who failed to consult his watch, and\nnever knew until the crash came that his train was leisurely moving\nalong on the time of another.Nevertheless, what can be said in\nextenuation of a system under which, at this late day, a railroad is\noperated on the principle that each employé under all circumstances\ncan and will take care of himself and of those whose lives and limbs\nare entrusted to his care?There is, however, another and far more attractive side to the\npicture.The lives sacrificed at Revere were not lost in vain.Seven\ncomplete railroad years passed by between that and the Wollaston\nHeights accident of 1878.During that time not less than two hundred\nand thirty millions of persons were carried by rail within the\nlimits of Massachusetts.Of this vast number while only 50, or\nabout one in each four and a half millions, sustained any injury\nfrom causes beyond their own power to control, the killed were just\ntwo.This certainly was a record with which no community could well\nfind fault; and it was due more than anything else to the great\ndisaster of August 26, 1871.More than once, and on more than one\nroad, accidents occurred which, but for the improved appliances\nintroduced in consequence of the experience at Revere, could hardly\nhave failed of fatal results.Not that these appliances were in\nall cases very cheerfully or very eagerly accepted.Neither the\nMiller platform nor the Westinghouse brake won its way into general\nuse unchallenged.Indeed, the earnestness and even the indignation\nwith which presidents and superintendents then protested that their\ncar construction was better and stronger than Miller\'s; that their\nantiquated handbrakes were the most improved brakes,--better, much\nbetter, than the Westinghouse; that their crude old semaphores and\ntargets afforded a protection to trains which no block-system would\never equal,--all this certainly was comical enough, even in the\nvery shadow of the great tragedy.Men of a certain type always have\nprotested and will always continue to protest that they have nothing\nto learn; yet, under the heavy burden of responsibility, learn\nthey still do.On this point the figures\nof the Massachusetts annual returns between the year 1871 and the\nyear 1878 speak volumes.At the time of the Revere disaster, with\none single honorable exception,--that of the Boston & Providence\nroad,--both the atmospheric train-brake and the Miller platform, the\ntwo greatest modern improvements in American car construction, were\npractically unrecognized on the railroads of Massachusetts.Even a\nyear later, but 93 locomotives and 415 cars had been equipped even\nwith the train-brake.In September, 1873, the number had, however,\nrisen to 194 locomotives and 709 cars; and another twelve months\ncarried these numbers up to 313 locomotives and 997 cars.Finally\nin 1877 the state commissioners in their report for that year spoke\nof the train-brake as having been then generally adopted, and at\nthe same time called attention to the very noticeable fact "that\nthe only railroad accident resulting in the death of a passenger\nfrom causes beyond his control within the state during a period of\ntwo years and eight months, was caused by the failure of a company\nto adopt this improvement on all its passenger rolling-stock."The adoption of Miller\'s method of car construction had meanwhile\nbeen hardly less rapid.Almost unknown at the time of the Revere\ncatastrophe in September, 1871, in October, 1873, when returns on\nthe subject were first called for by the state commissioners,\neleven companies had already adopted it on 778 cars out of a total\nnumber of 1548 reported.In 1878 it had been adopted by twenty-two\ncompanies, and applied to 1685 cars out of a total of 1792.In other\nwords it had been brought into general use.THE AUTOMATIC ELECTRIC BLOCK SYSTEM.A realizing sense of the necessity of ultimately adopting some\nsystem of protection against the danger of rear-end collisions was,\nabove all else, brought directly home to American railroad managers\nthrough the Revere disaster.In discussing and comparing the\nappliances used in the practical operation of railroads in different\ncountries, there is one element, however, which can never be left\nout of the account.The intelligence, quickness of perception\nand capacity for taking care of themselves--that combination of\nqualities which, taken together, constitute individuality and\nadaptability to circumstance--vary greatly among the railroad\nemployés of different countries.The American locomotive engineer,\nas he is called, is especially gifted in this way.He can be relied\non to take care of himself and his train under circumstances which\nin other countries would be thought to insure disaster.Volumes\non this point were included in the fact that though at the time\nof the Revere disaster many of the American lines, especially in\nMassachusetts, were crowded with the trains of a mixed traffic,\nthe necessity of making any provision against rear-end collisions,\nfurther than by directing those in immediate charge of the trains\nto keep a sharp look out and to obey their printed orders, seemed\nhardly to have occurred to any one.The English block system was\nnow and then referred to in a vague, general way; but it was very\nquestionable whether one in ten of those referring to it knew\nanything about it or had ever seen it in operation, much less\ninvestigated it.A characteristic illustration of this was afforded\nin the course of those official investigations which followed the\nRevere disaster, and have already more than once been alluded to.Prior to that disaster the railroads of Massachusetts had, as a\nrule, enjoyed a rather exceptional freedom from accidents, and\nthere was every reason to suppose that their regulations were as\nexact and their system as good as those in use in other parts of\nthe country.Yet it then appeared that in the rules of very few of\nthe Massachusetts roads had any provision, even of the simplest\ncharacter, been made as to the effect of telegraphic orders, or\nthe course to be pursued by employés in charge of trains on their\nreceipt.The appliances for securing intervals between following\ntrains were marked by a quaint simplicity.They were, indeed,\n"singularly primitive," as the railroad commissioners on a\nsubsequent occasion described them, when it appeared that on one of\nthe principal roads of the state the interval between two closely\nfollowing trains was signalled to the engineer of the second train\nby a station-master\'s holding up to him as he passed a number of\nfingers corresponding to the number of minutes since the first\ntrain had gone by.For the rest the examination revealed, as the\nnearest approach to a block system, a queer collection of dials,\nsand-glasses, green flags,  lanterns and hand-targets.The\nclimax in the course of that investigation was, however, reached\nwhen some reference, involving a description of it, was made to the\nEnglish block.This was met by a protest on the part of one veteran\nsuperintendent, who announced that it might work well under certain\ncircumstances, but for himself he could not be responsible for the\noperation of a road running the number of trains he had charge of in\nreliance on any such system.The subject, in fact, was one of which\nhe knew absolutely nothing;--not even that, through the block system\nand through it alone, fourteen trains were habitually and safely\nmoved under circumstances where he moved one.This occurred in 1871,\nand though eight years have since elapsed information in regard\nto the block system is not yet very widely disseminated inside of\nrailroad circles, much less outside of them.It is none the less\na necessity of the future.It has got to be understood, and, in\nsome form, it has got to be adopted; for even in America there are\nlimits to the reliance which, when the lives and limbs of many are\nat stake, can be placed on the "sharp look out" of any class of men,\nno matter how intelligent they may be.The block system is of English origin, and it scarcely needs\nto be said that it was adopted by the railroad corporations of\nthat country only when they were driven to it by the exigencies\nof their traffic.But for that system, indeed, the most costly\nportion of the tracks of the English roads must of necessity have\nbeen duplicated years ago, as their traffic had fairly outgrown\nthose appliances of safety which have even to this time been found\nsufficient in America.There were points, for instance, where two\nhundred and seventy regular trains of one line alone passed daily.On the London & North-Western there are more than sixty through\ndown trains, taking no account of local trains, each day passing\nover the same line of tracks, among which are express trains which\nstop nowhere, way trains which stop everywhere, express-freight,\nway-freight, mineral trains and parcel trains.On the Midland road\nthere are nearly twice as many similar trains on each track.On the\nMetropolitan railway the average interval is three and one-third\nminutes between trains.In one case points were mentioned where\n270 regular trains of one line alone passed a given junction\nduring each twenty-four hours,--where 470 trains passed a single\nstation, the regular interval between them being but five-eighths\nof a mile,--where 132 trains entered and left a single station\nduring three hours of each evening every day, being one train in\neighty-two seconds.In 1870 there daily reached or left the six\nstations of the Boston roads some 385 trains; while no less than\n650 trains a day were in the same year received and despatched from\na single one of the London stations.On one single exceptional\noccasion 1,111 trains, carrying 145,000 persons, were reported as\nentering and leaving this station in the space of eighteen hours,\nbeing rather more than a train a minute.Indeed it may well be\nquestioned whether the world anywhere else furnishes an illustration\nso apt and dramatic of the great mechanical achievements of recent\ntimes as that to be seen during the busy hours of any week-day from\nthe signal and interlocking galleries which span the tracks as\nthey enter the Charing Cross or Cannon street stations in London.Below and in front of the galleries the trains glide to and fro,\ncoming suddenly into sight from beyond the bridges and as suddenly\ndisappearing,--winding swiftly in and out, and at times four of them\nrunning side by side on as many tracks but in both directions,--the\nwhole making up a swiftly shifting maze of complex movement under\nthe influence of which a head unaccustomed to the sight grows\nactually giddy.Yet it is all done so quietly and smoothly, with\nsuch an absence of haste and nervousness on the part of the stolid\noperators in charge, that it is not easy to decide which most to\nwonder at, the almost inconceivable magnitude and despatch of the\ntrain-movement or the perfection of the appliances which make it\npossible.No man concerned in the larger management of railroads,\nwho has not passed a morning in those London galleries, knows what\nit is to handle a great city\'s traffic.Perfect as it is in its way, however, it may well be questioned\nwhether the block system as developed in England is likely to\nbe generally adopted on American railroads.Upon one or two of\nthem, and notably on the New Jersey Central and a division of the\nPennsylvania, it has already been in use for a number of years.From an American point of view, however, it is open to a number\nof objections.That in itself it is very perfect and has been\nsuccessfully elaborated so as to provide for almost every possible\ncontingency is proved by the results daily accomplished by means of\nit.[13] The English lines are made to do an incredible amount of\nwork with comparative few accidents.The block system is, however,\nnone the less a very clumsy and complicated one, necessitating the\nconstant employment of a large number of skilled operators.Here\nis the great defect in it from the American point of view.In this\ncountry labor is scarce and capital costly.The effort is always\ntowards the perfecting of labor-saving machines.Hitherto the\npressure of traffic on the lines has not been greater than could\nbe fairly controlled by simpler appliances, and the expense of the\nEnglish system is so heavy that its adoption, except partially,\nwould not have been warranted.As Barry says in his treatise on the\nsubject, "one can \'buy gold too dear\'; for if every possible known\nprecaution is to be taken, regardless of cost, it may not pay to\nwork a railway at all."[13] An excellent popular description of this system will be found\n  in Barry\'s _Railway Appliances, Chapter V_.It is tolerably safe, therefore, to predict that the American\nblock system of the future will be essentially different from the\npresent English system.The basis--electricity--will of course be\nthe same; but, while the operator is everywhere in the English\nblock, his place will be supplied to the utmost possible degree by\nautomatic action in the American.It is in this direction that the\nwhole movement since the Revere disaster has been going on, and\nthe advance has been very great.From peculiarities of condition\nalso the American block must be made to cover a multitude of weak\npoints in the operation of roads, and give timely notice of dangers\nagainst which the English block provides only to a limited degree,\nand always through the presence of yet other employés.For instance,\nas will presently be seen, many more accidents and, in Europe even,\nfar greater loss of life is caused by locomotives coming in contact\nwith vehicles at points where highways cross railroad tracks at a\nlevel therewith than by rear-end collisions; meanwhile throughout\nAmerica, even in the most crowded suburban neighborhoods, these\ncrossings are the rule, whereas in Europe they are the exception.The English block affords protection against this danger by giving\nelectric notice to gatemen; but gatemen are always supposed.So\nalso as respects the movements of passengers in and about stations\nin crossing tracks as they come to or leave the trains, or prepare\nto take their places in them.The rule in Europe is that passenger\ncrossings at local stations are provided over or under the tracks;\nin America, however, almost nowhere is any provision at all made,\nbut passengers, men, women and children, are left to scramble across\ntracks as best they can in the face of passing trains.They are\nexpected to take care of themselves, and the success with which they\ndo it is most astonishing.Having been brought up to this self-care\nall their lives, they do not, as would naturally be supposed, become\nconfused and stumble under the wheels of locomotives; and the\nstatistics seem to show that no more accidents from this cause occur\nin America than in Europe.Nevertheless some provision is manifestly\ndesirable to notify employés as well as passengers that trains are\napproaching, especially where way-stations are situated on curves.Again, it is well known that, next to collisions, the greatest\nsource of danger to railroad trains is due to broken tracks.It\nis, of course, apparent that tracks may at any time be broken by\naccident, as by earth-slides, derailment or the fracture of rails.This danger has to be otherwise provided for; the block has nothing\nto do with it further than to prevent a train delayed by any such\nbreak from being run into by any following train.The broken track\nwhich the perfect block should give notice of is that where the\nbreak is a necessary incident to the regular operation of the road.It is these breaks which, both in America and elsewhere, are the\nfruitful source of the great majority of railroad accidents, and\ndraw-bridges and switches, or facing points as they are termed in\nthe English reports, are most prominent among them.Wherever there\nis a switch, the chances are that in the course of time there will\nbe an accident.Four matters connected with train movement have now been specified,\nin regard to which some provision is either necessary or highly\ndesirable: these are rear collisions, tracks broken at draw-bridges\nor at switches, highway grade crossings, and the notification of\nagents and passengers at stations.The effort in America, somewhat\nin advance of that crowded condition of the lines which makes the\nadoption of something a measure of present necessity, has been\ndirected towards the invention of an automatic system which at\none and the same time should cover all the dangers and provide\nfor all the needs which have been referred to, eliminating the\nrisks incident to human forgetfulness, drowsiness and weakness of\nnerves.Can reliable automatic provision thus be made?--The English\nauthorities are of opinion that it cannot.They insist that "if\nautomatic arrangements be adopted, however suitable they may be to\nthe duties which they have to perform, they should in all cases be\nused as additions to, and not as substitutions for, safety machinery\nworked by competent signal-men.The signal-man should be bound to\nexercise his observation, care and judgment, and to act thereon; and\nthe machine, as far as possible, be such that if he attempts to go\nwrong it shall check him."It certainly cannot be said that the American electrician has as\nyet demonstrated the incorrectness of this conclusion, but he has\nundoubtedly made a good deal of progress in that direction.Of the\nvarious automatic blocks which have now been experimented with or\nbrought into practice, the Hall Electric and the Union Safety Signal\nCompany systems have been developed to a very marked degree of\nperfection.They depend for their working on diametrically opposite\nprinciples: the Hall signals being worked by means of an electric\ncircuit caused by the action of wheels moving on the rails, and\nconveyed through the usual medium of wires; while, under the other\nsystem, the wires being wholly dispensed with, a continuous electric\ncircuit is kept up by means of the rails, which are connected\nfor the purpose, and the signals are then acted upon through the\nbreaking of this normal circuit by the movement of locomotives and\ncars.So far as the signals are concerned, there is no essential\ndifference between the two systems, except that Hall supplies the\nnecessary motive force by the direct action of electricity, while in\nthe other case dependence is placed upon suspended weights.Of the\ntwo the Hall system is the oldest and most thoroughly elaborated,\nhaving been compelled to pass through that long and useful tentative\nprocess common to all inventions, during which they are regarded\nas of doubtful utility and are gradually developed through a\nsuccession of partial failures.So far as Hall\'s system is concerned\nthis period may now fairly be regarded as over, for it is in\nestablished use on a number of the more crowded roads of the North,\nand especially of New England, while the imperfections necessarily\nincident to the development of an appliance at once so delicate and\nso complicated, have for certain purposes been clearly overcome.Its signal arrangements, for instance, to protect draw-bridges,\nstations and grade-crossings are wholly distinct from its block\nsystem, through which it provides against dangers from collision and\nbroken tracks.So far as draw-bridges are concerned, the protection\nit affords is perfect.Not only is its interlocking apparatus so\ndesigned that the opening of the draw blocks all approach to it,\nbut the signals are also reciprocal; and if through carelessness or\nautomatic derangement any train passes the block, the draw-tender is\nnotified at once of the fact in ample time to stop it.In the case of a highway crossing at a level, the electric bell\nunder Hall\'s system is placed at the crossing, giving notice of\nthe approaching train from the moment it is within half a mile\nuntil it passes; so that, where this appliance is in use, accidents\ncan happen only through the gross carelessness of those using the\nhighway.When the electric bell is silent there is no train within\nhalf a mile and the crossing is safe; it is not safe while the bell\nis ringing.As it now stands the law usually provides that the\nprescribed signals, either bell or whistle, shall be given from the\nlocomotive as it approaches the highway, and at a fixed distance\nfrom it.The signal, therefore, is given at a distance of several\nhundred yards, more or less, from the point of danger.The electric\nsystem improves on this by placing the signal directly at the point\nof danger,--the traveller approaches the bell, instead of the bell\napproaching the traveller.At any point of crossing which is really\ndangerous,--that is at any crossing where trees or cuttings or\nbuildings mask the railroad from the highway,--this distinction is\nvital.In the one case notice of the unseen danger must be given\nand cannot be unobserved; in the other case whether it is really\ngiven or not may depend on the condition of the atmosphere or the\ndirection of the wind.Usually, however, in New England the level crossings of the more\ncrowded thoroughfares, perhaps one in ten of the whole number, are\nprotected by gates or flag-men.Under similar circumstances in\nGreat Britain there is an electric connection between a bell in the\ncabin of the gate-keeper and the nearest signal boxes of the block\nsystem on each side of the crossing, so that due notice is given of\nthe approach of trains from either direction.In this country it has\nheretofore been the custom to warn gate-keepers by the locomotive\nwhistle, to the intense annoyance of all persons dwelling near the\ncrossing, or to make them depend for notice on their own eyes.Under\nthe Hall system, however, the gate-keeper is automatically signalled\nto be on the look out, if he is attending to his duty; or, if he is\nneglecting it, the electric bell in some degree supplies his place,\nwithout releasing the corporation from its liability.In America\nthe heavy fogs of England are almost unknown, and the brilliant\nhead lights, heavy bells and shrill high whistles in use on the\nlocomotives would at night, it might be supposed, give ample notice\nto the most careless of an approaching train.Continually recurring\nexperience shows, however, that this is not the case.Under these\ncircumstances the electric bell at the crossing becomes not only a\nmatter of justice almost to the employé who is stationed there, but\na watchman over him.This, however, like the other forms of signals which have been\nreferred to, is, in the electric system, a mere adjunct of its chief\nuse, which is the block,--they are all as it were things thrown\ninto the bargain.As contradistinguished from the English block,\nwhich insures only an unoccupied track, the automatic blocks seek to\ninsure an unbroken track as well,--that is not only is each segment\ninto which a road is divided, protected as respects following trains\nby, in the case of Hall\'s system, double signals watching over each\nother, the one at safety, the other at danger,--both having to\ncombine to open the block,--but every switch or facing point, the\nthrowing of which may break the main track, is also protected.The\nUnion Signal Company\'s system it is claimed goes still further than\nthis and indicates any break in the track, though due to accidental\nfracture or displacement of rails.Without attempting this the Hall\nsystem has one other important feature in common with the English\nblock, and a very important feature, that of enabling station agents\nin case of sudden emergency to control the train movement within\nhalf a mile or more of their stations on either side.Within the\ngiven distance they can stop trains either leaving or approaching.The inability to do this has been the cause of some of the most\ndisastrous collisions on record, and notably those at Revere and at\nThorpe.The one essential thing, however, in every perfect block system,\nwhether automatic or worked by operators, is that in case of\naccident or derangement or doubt, the signal should rest at danger.This the Hall system now fully provides for, and in case even of\nthe wilful displacement of a switch, an occurrence by no means\nwithout precedent in railroad experience, the danger signal could\nnot but be displayed, even though the electric connection had been\ntampered with.Accidents due to wilfullness, however, can hardly\nbe provided for except by police precautions.Train wrecking is\nnot to be taken into account as a danger incident to the ordinary\noperation of a railroad.Carelessness or momentary inadvertence,\nor, most dangerous of all, that recklessness--that unnecessary\nassumption of risk somewhere or at some time, which is almost\ninseparable from a long immunity from disaster--these are the\ngreat sources of peril most carefully to be guarded against.The\ncomplicated and unceasing train movement depends upon many thousand\nemployés, all of whom make mistakes or assume risks sometimes;--and\ndid they not do so they would be either more or less than men.Being, however, neither angels nor machines, but ordinary mortals\nwhose services are bought for money at the average market rate of\nwages, it would certainly seem no small point gained if an automatic\nmachine could be placed on guard over those whom it is the great\neffort of railroad discipline to reduce to automatons.Could this\nresult be attained, the unintentional throwing of a lever or the\ncarelessness which leaves it thrown, would simply block the track\ninstead of leaving it broken.An example of this, and at the same\ntime a most forcible illustration of the possible cost of a small\neconomy in the application of a safeguard, was furnished in the\ncase of the Wollaston disaster.At the time of that disaster, the\nOld Colony railroad had for several years been partially equipped\non the portion of its track near Boston, upon which the accident\noccurred, with Hall\'s system.It had worked smoothly and easily, was\nwell understood by the employés, and the company was sufficiently\nsatisfied with it to have even then made arrangements for its\nextension.Unfortunately, with a too careful eye to the expenditure\ninvolved, the line had been but partially equipped; points where\nlittle danger was apprehended had not been protected.Among these\nwas the "Foundry switch," so called, near Wollaston.Had this switch\nbeen connected with the system and covered by a signal-target, the\nmere act of throwing it would have automatically blocked the track,\nand only when it was re-set would the track have been opened.The\nswitch was not connected, the train hands were recklessly careless,\nand so a trifling economy cost in one unguarded moment some fifty\npersons life and limb, and the corporation more than $300,000.One objection to the automatic block is generally based upon the\ndelicacy and complicated character of the machinery on which its\naction necessarily depends; and this objection is especially urged\nagainst those other portions of the Hall system, covering draws\nand level crossings, which have been particularly described.It\nis argued that it is always liable to get out of order from a\ngreat multiplicity of causes, some of which are very difficult to\nguard against, and that it is sure to get out of order during any\nelectric disturbance; but it is during storms that accidents are\nmost likely to occur, and especially is this the case at highway\ngrade-crossings.It is comparatively easy to avoid accidents so long\nas the skies are clear and the elements quiet; but it is exactly\nwhen this is not the case and when it becomes necessary to use every\nprecaution, that electricity as a safeguard fails or runs mad, and,\nby participating in the general confusion, proves itself worse\nthan nothing.Then it will be found that those in charge of trains\nand tracks, who have been educated into a reliance upon it under\nordinary circumstances, will from force of habit, if nothing else,\ngo on relying upon it, and disaster will surely follow.This line of reasoning is plausible, but none the less open to\none serious objection; it is sustained neither by statistics nor\nby practical experience.Moreover it is not new, for, slightly\nvaried in phraseology, it has been persistently urged against the\nintroduction of every new railroad appliance, and, indeed, was first\nand most persistently of all urged against the introduction of\nrailroads themselves.Pretty and ingenious in theory, practically it\nis not feasible!--for more than half a century this formula has been\nheard.That the automatic electric signal system is complicated,\nand in many of its parts of most delicate construction, is\nundeniable.In point of fact the whole\nrailroad organization from beginning to end--from machine-shop to\ntrain-movement--is at once so vast and complicated, so delicate\nin that action which goes on with such velocity and power, that\nit is small cause for wonder that in the beginning all plain,\nsensible, practical men scouted it as the fanciful creation of\nvisionaries.They were wholly justified in so doing; and to-day\nany sane man would of course pronounce the combined safety and\nrapidity of ordinary railroad movement an utter impossibility, did\nhe not see it going on before his eyes.So it is with each new\nappliance.It is ever suggested that at last the final result has\nalready been reached.It is but a few years, as will presently be\nseen, since the Westinghouse brake encountered the old "pretty and\ningenious" formula.Going yet a step further, and taking the case\nof electricity itself, the bold conception of operating an entire\nline of single track road wholly as respects one half of its train\nmovement by telegraph, and without the use of any time table at\nall, would once have been condemned as mad.Yet to-day half of the\nvast freight movement of this continent is carried on in absolute\nreliance on the telegraph.Nevertheless it is still not uncommon\nto hear among the class of men who rise to the height of their\ncapacity in themselves being automaton superintendents that they do\nnot believe in deviating from their time tables and printed rules;\nthat, acting under them, the men know or ought to know exactly what\nto do, and any interference by a train despatcher only relieves them\nof responsibility, and is more likely to lead to accidents than if\nthey were left alone to grope their own way out.Another and very similar argument frequently urged against the\nelectric, in common with all other block systems by the large class\nwho prefer to exercise their ingenuity in finding objections rather\nthan in overcoming difficulties, is that they breed dependence and\ncarelessness in employés;--that engine-drivers accustomed to rely\non the signals, rely on them implicitly, and get into habits of\nrecklessness which lead inevitably to accidents, for which they\nthen contend the signals, and not they themselves, are responsible.This argument is, indeed, hardly less familiar than the "pretty and\ningenious" formula just referred to.It has, however, been met and\ndisposed of by Captain Tyler in his annual reports to the Board of\nTrade in a way which can hardly be improved upon:--\n\n     It is a favorite argument with those who oppose the introduction\n     of some of these improvements, or who make excuses for the want\n     of them, that their servants are apt to become more careless\n     from the use of them, in consequence of the extra security which\n     they are believed to afford; and it is desirable to consider\n     seriously how much of truth there is in this assertion.* * *\n     Allowing to the utmost for these tendencies to confide too\n     much in additional means of safety, the risk is proved by\n     experience to be very much greater without them than with them;\n     and, in fact, the negligence and mistakes of servants are found\n     to occur most frequently, and generally with the most serious\n     results, not when the men are over-confident in their appliances\n     or apparatus, but when, in the absence of them, they are\n     habituated to risk in the conduct of the traffic.In the daily\n     practice of railway working station-masters, porters, signalmen,\n     engine-drivers or guards are frequently placed in difficulties\n     which they have to surmount as best they can.The more they are\n     accustomed to incur risk in order to perform their duties, the\n     less they think of it, and the more difficult it is to enforce\n     discipline and obedience to regulations.The personal risk which\n     is encountered by certain classes of railway servants is coming\n     to be more precisely ascertained.It is very considerable;\n     and it is difficult to prevent men who are in constant danger\n     themselves from doing things which may be a source of danger to\n     others, or to compel them to obey regulations for which they do\n     not see altogether the necessity, and which impede them in their\n     work.This difficulty increases with the want of necessary means\n     and appliances; and is diminished when, with proper means and\n     appliances, stricter discipline becomes possible, safer modes\n     of working become habitual, and a higher margin of safety is\n     constantly preserved.[14]\n\n  [14] Reports; 1872, page 23, and 1873, page 39.In Great Britain the ingenious theory that superior appliances\nor greater personal comfort in some indefinable way lead to\ncarelessness in employés was carried to such an extent that only\nwithin the last few years has any protection against wind, rain and\nsunshine been furnished on locomotives for the engine-drivers and\nstokers.The old stage-coach driver faced the elements, and why\nshould not his successor on the locomotive do the same?--If made too\ncomfortable, he would become careless and go to sleep!--This was the\nline of argument advanced, and the tortures to which the wretched\nmen were subjected in consequence of it led to their fortifying\nnature by drink.They had to be regularly inspected and examined\nbefore mounting the foot-board, to see that they were sober.It took\nyears in Great Britain for intelligent railroad managers to learn\nthat the more protected and comfortable a man is the better he will\nattend to his duty.And even when the old argument, refuted by long\nexperience, was at last abandoned as respected the locomotive cab,\nit, with perfect freshness and confidence in its own novelty and\nforce, promptly showed its brutal visage in opposition to the next\nnew safeguard.For the reasons which Captain Tyler has so forcibly put in the\nextracts which have just been quoted, the argument against the block\nsystem from the increased carelessness of employés, supposed to be\ninduced by it, is entitled to no weight.Neither is the argument\nfrom the delicacy and complication of the automatic, electric signal\nsystem entitled to any more, when urged against that.Not only has\nit been too often refuted under similar conditions by practical\nresults, but in this case it is based on certain assumptions of\nfact which are wholly opposed to experience.The record does not\nshow that there is any peculiar liability to railroad accidents\nduring periods of storm; perhaps because those in charge of train\nmovements or persons crossing tracks are under such circumstances\nmore especially on the look out for danger.On the contrary the\nfull average of accidents of the worst description appear to\nhave occurred under the most ordinary conditions of weather, and\nusually in the most unanticipated way.This is peculiarly true of\naccidents at highway grade crossings.These commonly occur when the\nconditions are such as to cause the highway travelers to suppose\nthat, if any danger existed, they could not but be aware of it.In the next place, the question in regard to automatic electric\nsignals is exactly what it was in regard to the Westinghouse brake,\nwith its air-pump, its valves and connecting tubes;--it is the\npurely practical question,--Does the thing work?--The burden of\nproof is properly on the inventor.In the case of the electric signals they have for years been\nin limited but constant use, and while thus in use they have been\nundergoing steady improvement.Though now brought to a considerable\ndegree of comparative perfection they are, of course, still in\ntheir earlier stage of development.In use, however, they have not\nbeen found open to the practical objections urged against them.At\nfirst much too complicated and expensive, requiring more machinery\nthan could by any reasonable exertions be kept in order and more\ncare than they were worth, they have now been simplified until a\nsingle battery properly located can do all the necessary work for\na road of indefinite length.As a system they are effective and do\nnot lead to accidents; nor are they any more subject than telegraph\nwires to derangement from atmospheric causes.When any disturbance\ndoes take place, until it can be overcome it amounts simply to a\ngeneral signal for operating the road with extreme caution.But with\nrailroads, as everywhere else in life, it is the normal condition of\naffairs for which provision must be made, while the dangers incident\nto exceptional circumstances must be met by exceptional precautions.As long as things are in their normal state, that is, probably,\nduring nineteen days out of twenty, the electric signals have now\nthrough several years of constant trial proved themselves a reliable\nsafeguard.It can hardly admit of doubt that in the near future they\nwill be both further perfected and generally adopted.In their management of switches, especially at points of railroad\nconvergence where a heavy traffic is concentrated and the passage\nof trains or movement of cars and locomotives is unceasing,\nthe English are immeasurably in advance of the Americans; and,\nindeed, of all other people.In fact, in this respect the American\nmanagers have shown themselves slow to learn, and have evinced an\nindisposition to adopt labor-saving appliances which, considering\ntheir usual quickness of discernment in that regard, is at first\nsight inexplicable.Having always been accustomed to the old and\nsimple methods, just so long as they can through those methods\nhandle their traffic with a bearable degree of inconvenience and\nexpense, they will continue to do so.That their present method is\nmost extravagant, just as extravagant as it would be to rent two\nhouses or to run two steam engines where one, if properly used,\ncould be made to suffice, admits of demonstration;--but the waste is\nnot on the surface, and the necessity for economy is not imperative.The difference of conditions and the difference in results may be\nmade very obvious by a comparison.Take, for instance, London and\nBoston--the Cannon street station in the one and the Beach street\nstation in the other.The concentration of traffic at London is so\ngreat that it becomes necessary to utilize every foot of ground\ndevoted to railroad purposes to the utmost possible extent.Not\nonly must it be packed with tracks, but those tracks must never be\nidle.The incessant train movement at Cannon street has already\nbeen referred to as probably the most extraordinary and confusing\nspectacle in the whole wide circle of railroad wonders.The result\nis that in some way, at this one station and under this single roof,\nmore trains must daily be made to enter and leave than enter and\nleave, not only the Beach street station, but all the eight railroad\nstations in Boston combined.[15]\n\n  [15] "It has been estimated that an average of 50,000 persons were,\n  in 1869, daily brought into Boston and carried from it, on three\n  hundred and eighty-five trains, while the South Eastern railway of\n  London received and despatched in 1870, on an average, six hundred\n  and fifty trains a day, between 6 A.M.carrying from\n  35,000 to 40,000 persons, and this too without the occurrence of a\n  single train accident during the year.On one single exceptional\n  day eleven hundred and eleven trains, carrying 145,000 persons, are\n  said to have entered and left this station in the space of eighteen\n  hours."--_Third Annual Report, [1872] of Massachusetts Railroad\n  Commissioners, p.141._\n\n  The passenger movement over the roads terminating in Boston was\n  probably as heavy on June 17, 1875, as during any twenty-four hours\n  in their history.It was returned at 280,000 persons carried in\n  641 trains.About twice the passenger movement of the "exceptional\n  day" referred to, carried in something more than half the number of\n  trains, entering and leaving eight stations instead of one.During eighteen successive hours trains have been made to enter and\nleave this station at the rate of more than one in each minute.It\ncontains four platforms and seven tracks, the longest of which is\n720 feet.As compared with the largest station in Boston (the Boston\n& Providence), it has the same number of platforms and an aggregate\nof 1,500 (three-fifths) more feet of track under cover; it daily\naccommodates about nine times as many trains and four times as many\npassengers.Of it Barry, in his treatise on Railway Appliances (p.197), says: "The platform area at this station is probably minimised\nbut, the station accommodates efficiently a very large mixed traffic\nof long and short journey trains, amounting at times to as many as\n400 trains in and 400 trains out in a working day.[16]"\n\n  [16] The Grand Central Depot on 42d Street in New York City, has\n  nearly twice the amount of track room under cover of the Cannon\n  street station.The daily train movement of the latter would be\n  precisely paralleled in New York, though not equalled in amount, if\n  the 42d street station were at Trinity church, and, in addition to\n  the trains which now enter and leave it, all the city trains of the\n  Elevated road were also provided for there.The American system is, therefore, one of great waste; for, being\nconducted in the way it is--that is with stations and tracks\nutilized to but a fractional part of their utmost capacity--it\nrequires a large number of stations and tracks and the services of\nmany employés.Indeed it is safe to say that, judged by the London\nstandard, not more than two of the eight stations in Boston are at\nthis time utilized to above a quarter part of their full working\ncapacity; and the same is probably true of all other American\ncities.Both employés and the travelling public are accustomed to a\nslow movement and abundance of room; land is comparatively cheap,\nand the pressure of concentration has only just begun to make itself\nfelt.Accordingly any person, who cares to pass an hour during the\nbusy time of day in front of an American city station, cannot but\nbe struck, while watching the constant movement, with the primitive\nway in which it is conducted.Here are a multiplicity of tracks all\nconnected with each other, and cars and locomotives are being passed\nfrom one to another from morning to night.A constant shifting\nof switches is going on, and the little shunting engines never\nstand still.The switches, however, as a rule, are unprovided with\nsignals, except of the crudest description; they have no connection\nwith each other, and during thirty years no change has been made\nin the method in which they are worked.When one of them has to be\nshifted, a man goes to it and shifts it.To facilitate the process,\nthe monitor shunting engines are provided with a foot-board in front\nand behind, just above the track, upon which the yard hands jump,\nand are carried about from switch to switch, thus saving the time\nthey would occupy if they had to walk.A simpler arrangement could\nnot be imagined; anyone could devise it.The only wonder is that\neven a considerable traffic can be conducted safely in reliance upon\nit.Turning from Beach to Cannon street, it is apparent that the\ntrain movement which has there to be accommodated would fall into\ninextricable confusion if it was attempted to manage it in the way\nwhich has been described.The number of trains is so great and\nthe movement so rapid and intricate, that not even a regiment of\nemployés stationed here and there at the signals and switches could\nkeep things in motion.From time to time they would block, and then\nthe whole vast machine would be brought to a standstill until order\ncould be re-established.The difficulty is overcome in a very simple\nway, by means of an equally simple apparatus.The control over\nthe numerous switches and corresponding signals, instead of being\ndivided up among many men stationed at many points, is concentrated\nin the hands of two men occupying a single gallery, which is\nelevated across the tracks in front of the station and commanding\nthe approaches to it, much as the pilot-house of an American steamer\ncommands a view of the course before it.From this gallery, by means\nof what is known as the interlocking system, every switch and signal\nin the yard below is moved; and to such a point of perfection has\nthe apparatus been carried, that any disaster from the misplacement\nof a switch or the display of a wrong signal is rendered impossible.Of this Cannon street apparatus Barry says, "there are here nearly\nseventy point and signal levers concentrated in one signal house;\nthe number of combinations which would be possible if all the\nsignal and point levers were not interlocked can be expressed only\nby millions.Of these only 808 combinations are safe, and by the\ninterlocking apparatus these 808 combinations are rendered possible,\nand all the others impossible."[17]\n\n  [17] _Railway Appliances_, p.It is not proposed to enter at any length into the mechanical\ndetails of this appliance, which, however, must be considered as one\nof the three or four great inventions which have marked epochs in\nthe history of railroad traffic.[18] As, however, it is but little\nknown in America, and will inevitably within the next few years find\nhere the widest field for its increased use, a slight sketch of its\ngradual development and of its leading mechanical features may not\nbe out of place.Prior to the year 1846 the switches and signals\non the English roads were worked in the same way that they are now\ncommonly worked in this country.As a train drew near to a junction,\nfor instance, the switchman stationed there made the proper track\nconnection and then displayed the signal which indicated what tracks\nwere opened and what closed, and which line had the right of way;\nand the engine-drivers acted accordingly.As the number of trains\nincreased and the movement at the junctions became more complicated,\nthe danger of the wrong switches being thrown or the wrong signals\ndisplayed, increased also.Mistakes from time to time would happen,\neven when only the most careful and experienced men were employed;\nand mistakes in these matters led to serious consequences.It,\ntherefore, became the practice, instead of having the switch or\nsignal lever at the point where the switch or signal itself was, as\nis still almost universally the case in this country, to connect\nthem by rods or wires with their levers, which were concentrated\nat some convenient point for working, and placed under the control\nof one man instead of several.So far as it went this change was\nan improvement, but no provision yet existed against the danger of\nmistake in throwing switches and displaying signals.The blunder of\nfirst making one combination of tracks and then showing the signal\nfor another was less liable to happen after the concentration of\nthe levers under one hand than before, but it still might happen at\nany time, and certainly would happen at some time.If all danger of\naccident from human fallibility was ever to be eliminated a far more\ncomplicated mechanical apparatus must be devised.In response to\nthis need the system of interlocking was gradually developed, though\nnot until about the year 1856 was it brought to any considerable\ndegree of perfection.The whole object of this system is to\nrender it impossible for a switchman, whether because he is weary\nor agitated or actually malicious or only inexperienced, to give\ncontrary signals, or to break his line in one way and to give the\nsignal for its being broken in another way.To bring this about the\nlevers are concentrated in a cabin or gallery, and placed side by\nside in a frame, their lower ends connecting with the switch-points\nand signals by means of rods and wires.Beneath this frame are one\nor more long bars, extending its entire length under it and parallel\nwith it.These are called locking bars; for, being moved to the\nright or left by the action of the levers they hold these levers in\ncertain designated positions, nor do they permit them to occupy any\nother.In this way what is termed the interlocking is effected.The\napparatus, though complicated, is simplicity itself compared with\na clock or a locomotive.The complication, also, such as it is,\narises from the fact that each situation is a problem by itself, and\nas such has to be studied out and provided for separately.This,\nhowever, is a difficulty affecting the manufacturer rather than the\noperator.To the latter the apparatus presents no difficulty which\na fairly intelligent mechanic cannot easily master; while for the\nformer the highly complicated nature of the problem may, perhaps,\nbest be inferred from the example given by Mr.Barry, the simplest\nthat can offer, that of an ordinary junction where a double-track\nbranch-road connects with its double-track main line.There would\nin this case be of necessity two switch levers and four signal\nlevers, which would admit of sixty-four possible combinations."The\nsignal might be arranged in any of sixteen ways, and the points\nmight occupy any of four positions, irrespective of the position\nof the signals.Of the sixty-four combinations thus possible\nonly thirteen are safe, and the rest are such as might lure an\nengine-driver into danger."[18] A sufficiently popular description of this apparatus also,\n  illustrated by cuts, will be found in Barry\'s excellent little\n  treatise on _Railway Appliances_, already referred to, published by\n  Longmans & Co.as one of their series of text-books of science.Originally the locking bar was worked through the direct action of\ncertain locks, as they were called, between which the levers when\nmoved played to and fro.These locks were mere bars or plates of\niron, some with inclined sides, and others with sides indented or\nnotched.At one end they were secured on a pivot to a fixed bar\nopposite to and parallel with the movable locking bar, while their\nother ends were made fast to the locking bar; whence it necessarily\nfollowed that, as certain of the levers were pushed to and fro\nbetween them, the action of these levers on the inclined sides of\nthe locks could by a skilful combination be made to throw other\nlevers into the notches and indentations of other locks, thus\nsecuring them in certain positions, and making it impossible for\nthem to be in any other positions.The apparatus which has been described, though a great improvement\non anything which had preceded it, was still but a clumsy affair,\nand naturally the friction of the levers on the locks was so great\nthat they soon became worn, and when worn they could not be relied\nupon to move the switch-points with the necessary accuracy.The new\nappliance of safety had, therefore, as is often the case, introduced\na new and very considerable danger of its own.The signals and\nswitches, it was true, could no longer disagree, but the points\nthemselves were sometimes not properly set, or, owing to the great\nexertion required to work it, the interlocking gear was strained.This difficulty resulted in the next and last improvement, which\nwas a genuine triumph of mechanical ingenuity.To insure the proper\nlength of stroke being made in moving the lever--that is to make\nit certain in each case that the switch points were brought into\nexactly the proper position--two notches were provided in the slot,\nor quadrant, as it is called, in which the lever moved, and, when\nit was thrown squarely home, and not until then, a spring catch\ncaught in one or other of these notches.This spring was worked by\na clasp at the handle of the lever, and the whole was called the\nspring catch-rod.By a singularly ingenious contrivance, the process\nof interlocking was transferred from the action of the levers and\nthe keys to these spring catch-rods, which were made to work upon\neach other, and thus to become the medium through which the whole\nprocess is effected.The result of this improvement was that, as\nthe switchman cannot move any lever until the spring-catch rod is\nfastened, except for a particular movement, he cannot, do what he\nwill, even begin any other movement than that one, as the levers\ncannot be started.On the other hand, it may be said that, by means\nof this improvement, the mere "intention of the signal-man to move\nany lever, expressed by his grasping the lever and so raising the\nspring catch-rod, independently of his putting his intention in\nforce, actuates all the necessary locking.[19]"\n\n  [19] In regard to the interlocking system as then in use in England,\n  Captain Tyler in his report as head of the railway inspecting\n  department of the Board of Trade, used the following language in\n  his report on the accidents during 1870."When the apparatus is\n  properly constructed and efficiently maintained, the signalman\n  cannot make a mistake in the working of his points and signals which\n  shall lead to accident or collision, except only by first lowering\n  his signal and switching his train forward, then putting up his\n  signal again as it approaches, and altering the points as the driver\n  comes up to, or while he is passing over them.Such a mistake was\n  actually made in one of the cases above quoted.It is, of course,\n  impossible to provide completely for cases of this description; but\n  the locking apparatus, as now applied, is already of enormous value\n  in preventing accidents; and it will have a still greater effect\n  on the general safety of railway travelling as it becomes more\n  extensively applied on the older lines.Without it, a signalman in\n  constantly working points and signals is almost certain sooner or\n  later to make a mistake, and to cause an accident of a more or less\n  serious character; and it is inexcusable in any railway company to\n  allow its mail or express trains to run at high speed through facing\n  points which are not interlocked efficiently with the signals, by\n  which alone the engine-drivers in approaching them can be guided.There is however, very much yet to be effected in different parts of\n  the country in this respect.And it is worth while to record here,\n  in illustration of the difficulties that are sometimes met with by\n  the inspecting officers, that the Midland Railway Company formally\n  protested in June, 1866, against being compelled to apply such\n  apparatus before receiving sanction for the opening of new lines\n  of railway.They stated that in complying with the requirements in\n  this respect of the Board of Trade, they \'_were acting in direct\n  opposition to their own convictions, and they must, so far as lay in\n  their power, decline the responsibility of the locking system_.\'"To still further perfect the appliance a simple mechanism has\n  since 1870 been attached to the rod actuating the switch-bolt,\n  which prevents the signal-man from shifting the switch under a\n  passing train in the manner suggested by Captain Tyler in the above\n  extract.In fact it is no exaggeration to say that the interlocking\n  system has now been so studied, and every possible contingency so\n  thoroughly provided for, that in using it accidents can only occur\n  through a wilful intention to bring them about.In spite of any theoretical or fanciful objections which may be\nurged against it, this appliance will be found an indispensable\nadjunct to any really heavy junction or terminal train movement.For\nthe elevated railroads of New York, for instance, its early adoption\nproved a necessity.As for questions of temperature, climate,\netc., as affecting the long connecting rods and wires which are an\nessential part of the system, objections based upon them are purely\nimaginary.Difficulties from this source were long since met and\novercome by very simple compensating arrangements, and in practice\noccasion no inconvenience.That rods may break, and that wires are\nat all times liable to get out of gear, every one knows; and yet\nthis fact is urged as a novel objection to each new mechanical\nimprovement.That a broken or disordered apparatus will always\noccasion a serious disturbance to any heavy train movement, may also\nbe admitted.The fact none the less remains that in practice, and\ndaily subjected through long periods of time to incomparably the\nheaviest train movement known to railroad experience, the rods of\nthe interlocking apparatus do not break, nor do its wires get out\nof gear; while by means of it, and of it alone, this train movement\ngoes unceasingly on never knowing any serious disturbance.[20]\n\n  [20] "As an instance of the possibility of preventing the mistakes\n  so often made by signal men with conflicting signals or with facing\n  points I have shown the traffic for a single day, and at certain\n  hours of that day, at the Cannon Street station of the South Eastern\n  Railway, already referred to as one of the _no-accident_ lines of\n  the year.The traffic of that station, with trains continually\n  crossing one another, by daylight and in darkness, in fog or in\n  sunshine, amounts to more than 130 trains in three hours in the\n  morning, and a similar number in the evening; and, altogether, to\n  652 trains, conveying more than 35,000 passengers in the day as\n  a winter, or 40,000 passengers a day as a summer average.It is\n  probably not too much to say, that without the signal and point\n  arrangements which have there been supplied, and the system of\n  interlocking which has there been so carefully carried out, the\n  signalmen could not carry on their duties _for one hour without\n  accident_."_Captain Tyler\'s report on accidents for 1870, p.35._\n\nIt is not, however, alone in connection with terminal stations and\njunctions that the interlocking apparatus is of value.It is also\nthe scientific substitute for the law or regulation compelling\ntrains to stop as a measure of precaution when they approach\ngrade-crossings or draw-bridges.It is difficult indeed to pass from\nthe consideration of this fine result of science and to speak with\npatience of the existing American substitute for it.If the former\nis a feature in the block system, the latter is a signal example of\nthe block-head system.As a device to avoid danger it is a standing\ndisgrace to American ingenuity; and, fortunately, as stopping is\ncompatible only with a very light traffic, so soon as the passage\nof trains becomes incessant a substitute for it has got to be\ndevised.In this country, as in England, that substitute will be\nfound in the interlocking apparatus.By means of it the draw-bridge,\nfor instance, can be so connected with the danger signals--which\nmay, if desired, be gates closing across the railroad tracks--that\nthe one cannot be opened except by closing the other.This is the\nmethod adopted in Great Britain not only at draws in bridges, but\nfrequently also in the case of gates at level road crossings.It\nhas already been noticed that in Great Britain accidents at draws\nin bridges seem to be unknown.Certainly not one has been reported\nduring the last nine years.The security afforded in this case\nby interlocking would, indeed, seem to be absolute; as, if the\napparatus is out of order, either the gates or the bridge would be\nclosed, and could not be opened until it was repaired.So also as\nrespects the grade-crossing of one railroad by another.Bringing\nall trains to a complete stop when approaching these crossings\nis a precaution quite generally observed in America, either as a\nmatter of statute law or running regulation; and yet during the six\nyears 1873-8 no less than 104 collisions were reported at these\ncrossings.In Great Britain during the nine years 1870-8 but nine\ncases of accidents of this description were reported, and in both\nthe years 1877 and 1878 under the head of "Accidents or Collisions\non Level Crossings of Railways," the chief inspector of the Board\nof Trade tersely stated that,--"No accident was inquired into under\nthis head.[21]" The interlocking system there affords the most\nperfect protection which can be devised against a most dangerous\npractice in railroad construction to which Americans are almost\nrecklessly addicted.It is, also, matter of daily experience that\nthe interlocking system does afford a perfect practical safeguard\nin this case.Every junction of a branch with a double track\nroad involves a grade-crossing, and a grade-crossing of the most\ndangerous character.On the Metropolitan Elevated railroad of New\nYork, at 53d street, there is one of these junctions, where, all\nday long, trains are crossing at grade at the rate of some twenty\nmiles an hour.These trains never stop, except when signalled so\nto do.The interlocking apparatus, however, makes it impossible\nthat one track should be open except when the other is closed.An\naccident, therefore, can happen only through the wilful carelessness\nof the engineer in charge of a train;--and in the face of wilful\ncarelessness laws are of no more avail than signals.If a man in\ncontrol of a locomotive wishes to bring on a collision he can always\ndo it.Unless he wishes to, however, the interlocking apparatus\nnot only can prevent him from so doing, but as a matter of fact\nalways does.The same rule which holds good at junctions would hold\ngood at level crossings.There is no essential difference between\nthe two.By means of the interlocking apparatus the crossing can\nbe so blocked at any desired distance from it in such a way that\nwhen one track is open the other must be closed;--unless, indeed,\nthe apparatus is out of order, and then both would be closed.The precaution in this case, also, is absolute.Unlike the rule\nas to stopping, it does not depend on the caution or judgment of\nindividuals;--there are the signals and the obstructions, and\nif they are not displayed on one road they are on the other.So\nsuperior is this apparatus in every respect--as regards safety as\nwell as convenience--to the precaution of coming to a stop, that, as\nan inducement to introduce an almost perfect scientific appliance,\nit would be very desirable that states like Massachusetts and\nConnecticut compelling the stop, should except from the operation\nof the law all draw-bridges or grade-crossings at which suitable\ninterlocking apparatus is provided.Surely it is not unreasonable\nthat in this case science should have a chance to assert itself.[21] "As affecting the safe working of railways, the level crossing\n  of one railway by another is a matter of very serious import.Even when signalled on the most approved principles, they are a\n  source of danger, and, if possible, should always be avoided.At\n  junctions of branch or other railways the practice has been adopted\n  by some companies in special cases, to carry the off line under or\n  over the main line by a bridge.This course should generally be\n  adopted in the case of railways on which the traffic is large, and\n  more expressly where express and fast trains are run."_Report on\n  Accidents on Railways of the United Kingdom during 1877, p.35._\n\nIn any event, however, the general introduction of the interlocking\napparatus into the American railroad system may be regarded as a\nmere question of the value of land and concentration of traffic.So long as every road terminating in our larger cities indulges,\nat whatever unnecessary cost to its stockholders, in independent\nstation buildings far removed from business centres, the train\nmovement can most economically be conducted as it now is.The\nexpense of the interlocking apparatus is avoided by the very simple\nprocess of incurring the many fold heavier expense of several\nstation buildings and vast disconnected station grounds.If,\nhowever, in the city of Boston, for instance, the time should come\nwhen the financial and engineering audacity of the great English\ncompanies shall be imitated,--when some leading railroad company\nshall fix its central passenger station on Tremont street opposite\nthe head of Court street, just as in London the South Eastern\nestablished itself on Cannon street, and then this company carrying\nits road from Pemberton Square by a tunnel under Beacon Hill and the\nState-house should at the crossing of the Charles radiate out so as\nto afford all other roads an access for their trains to the same\nterminal point, thus concentrating there the whole daily movement of\nthat busy population which makes of Boston its daily counting-room\nand market-place,--then, when this is attempted, the time will have\ncome for utilizing to its utmost capacity every available inch of\nspace to render possible the incessant passage of trains.Then also\nwill it at last be realized that it is far cheaper to use a costly\nand intricate apparatus which enables two companies to be run into\none convenient station, than it is to build a separate station, even\nat an inconvenient point, to accommodate each company.In March, 1825, there appeared in the pages of the _Quarterly\nReview_ an article in which the writer discussed that railway\nsystem, the first vague anticipation of which was then just\nbeginning to make the world restless.He did this, too, in a very\nintelligent and progressive spirit, but unfortunately secured for\nhis article a permanence of interest he little expected by the\nuse of one striking illustration.He was peculiarly anxious to\ndraw a distinct line of demarcation between his own very rational\nanticipations and the visionary dreams of those enthusiasts who\nwere boring the world to death over the impossibilities which they\nclaimed that the new invention was to work.Among these he referred\nto the proposition that passengers would be "whirled at the rate\nof eighteen or twenty miles an hour by means of a high pressure\nengine," and then contemptuously added,--"We should as soon expect\nthe people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off upon one\nof Congreve\'s _ricochet_ rockets, as trust themselves to the mercy\nof such a machine, going at such a rate; their property perhaps they\nmay trust."Under the circumstances, the criticism was a perfectly reasonable\none.The danger involved in going at such a rate of speed and the\nimpossibility of stopping in time to avoid a sudden danger, would\nnaturally suggest themselves to any one as insuperable objections\nto the new system for any practical use.Some means of preserving\na sudden and powerful control over a movement of such unheard of\nrapidity would almost as a matter of course be looked upon as a\ncondition precedent.Yet it is a most noticeable fact in the history\nof railroad development that the improvement in appliances for\ncontrolling speed by no means kept pace with the increased rate of\nspeed attained.Indeed, so far as the possibility of rapid motion\nis concerned, there is no reason to suppose that the _Rocket_\ncould not have held its own very respectably by the side of a\npassenger locomotive of the present day.It will be remembered\nthat on the occasion of the Manchester & Liverpool opening, Mr.Huskisson after receiving his fatal injury was carried seventeen\nmiles in twenty-five minutes.Since then the details of locomotive\nconstruction have been simplified and improved upon, but no great\nchange has been or probably will be effected in the matter of\nvelocity;--as respects that the maximum was practically reached\nat once.Yet down to the year 1870 the brake system remained very\nmuch what it was in 1830.Improvements in detail were effected,\nbut the essential principles were the same.In case of any sudden\nemergency, the men in charge of the locomotive had no direct control\nover the vehicles in the train; they communicated with them by the\nwhistle, and when the signal was heard the brakes were applied as\nsoon as might be.When a train is moving at the rate of forty miles\nan hour, by no means a great speed for it while in full motion, it\npasses over fifty-eight feet each second;--at sixty miles an hour it\npasses over eighty-eight feet.Under these circumstances, supposing\nan engine driver to become suddenly aware of an obstruction on the\ntrack, as was the case at Revere, or of something wrong in the train\nbehind him, as at Shipton, he had first himself to signal danger,\nand to this signal the brakemen throughout the train had to respond.Each operation required time, and every second of time represented\nmany feet of space.It was small matter for surprise, therefore,\nthat when in 1875 they experimented scientifically in England, it\nwas ascertained that a train of a locomotive and thirteen cars\nmoving at a speed of forty-five miles an hour could not be brought\nto a stand in less than one minute, or before it had traversed a\ndistance of half a mile.The same result it will be remembered was\narrived at by practical experience in America, where both at Angola\nand at Port Jervis,[22] it was found impossible to stop the trains\nin less than half-a-mile, though in each case two derailed cars were\ndragging and plunging along at the end of them.[22] _Ante_, pp.The need of a continuous train-brake, operated from the locomotive\nand under the immediate control of the engine-driver, had been\nemphasized through years by the almost regular recurrence of\naccidents of the most appalling character.In answer to this need\nalmost innumerable appliances had been patented and experimented\nwith both in Europe and in America.Prior to 1869, however,\nthese had been almost exclusively what are known as emergency\nbrakes;--that is, although the trains were equipped with them and\nthey were operated from the locomotives, they were not relied upon\nfor ordinary use, but were held in reserve, as it were, against\nspecial exigencies.The Hudson River railroad train at the Hamburg\naccident was thus equipped.Practically, appliances which in the\noperation of railroads are reserved for emergencies are usually\nfound of little value when the emergency occurs.Accordingly no\ncontinuous brake had, prior to the development of Westinghouse\'s\ninvention, worked its way into general use.Patent brakes had\nbecome a proverb as well as a terror among railroad mechanics,\nand they had ceased to believe that any really desirable thing of\nthe sort would ever be perfected.Westinghouse, therefore, had a\nmost unbelieving audience to encounter, and his invention had to\nfight hard for all the favor it won; nor did his experience with\nmaster mechanics differ, probably, much from Miller\'s.His first\npatents were taken out in 1869, and he early secured the powerful\naid of the Pennsylvania road for his invention.The Pullman Car\nCompany, also, always anxious to avail themselves of every appliance\nof safety as well as of comfort, speedily saw the merits of the\nnew brake and adopted it; but, as they merely furnished cars and\nhad nothing to do with the locomotives that pulled them, their\nsupport was not so effective as that of the great railroad company.Naturally enough, also, great hesitation was felt in adopting so\ncomplicated an appliance.It added yet another whole apparatus to\na thing which was already overburdened with machinery.There was,\nalso, something in the delicacy and precision of the parts of this\nnew contrivance,--in its air-pump and reservoirs and long connecting\ntubes with their numerous valves,--which was peculiarly distasteful\nto the average practical railroad mechanic.It was true that the\nidea of transmitting power by means of compressed air was by no\nmeans new,--that thousands of drills were being daily driven by\nit wherever tunnelling was going on or miners were at work,--yet\nthe application of this familiar power to the wheels of a railroad\ntrain seemed no less novel than it was bold.It was, in the first\nplace, evident that the new apparatus would not stand the banging\nand hammering to which the old-fashioned hand-brake might safely\nbe subjected; not indeed without deranging that simple appliance,\nbut without incurring any very heavy bill for repairs in so doing.Accordingly the new brake was at first carelessly examined and\npatronizingly pushed aside as a pretty toy,--nice in theory no\ndoubt, but wholly unfitted for rough, every-day use.As it was\ntersely expressed during a discussion before the Society of Arts\nin London, as recently as May, 1877,--"It was no use bringing out\na brake which could not be managed by ordinary officials,--which\nwas so wonderfully clever that those who had to use it could not\nunderstand it."A line of argument by the way, which, as has been\nalready pointed out, may with far greater force be applied to the\nlocomotive itself; and, indeed, unquestionably was so applied\nabout half a century ago by men of the same calibre who apply it\nnow, to the intense weariness and discouragement no doubt of the\nlate George Stephenson.Whether sound or otherwise, however, few\nmore effective arguments against an appliance can be advanced; and\nagainst the Westinghouse brake it was advanced so effectively,\nthat even as late as 1871, although largely in use on western\nroads, it had found its way into Massachusetts only as an ingenious\ndevice of doubtful merit.It was in August, 1871, that the Revere\ndisaster occurred, and the Revere disaster, as has been seen,\nwould unquestionably have been averted had the colliding train\nbeen provided with proper brake power.This at last called serious\nattention there to the new appliance.Even then, however, the mere\nsuggestion of something better being in existence than the venerable\nhand-brakes in familiar use did not pass without a vigorous protest;\nand at the meeting of railroad officials, which has already been\nreferred to as having been called by the state commissioners\nafter the accident, one prominent gentleman, when asked if the\nroad under his charge was equipped with the most approved brake,\nindignantly replied that it was,--that it was equipped with the\ngood, old-fashioned hand-brake;--and he then proceeded to vehemently\nstake his professional reputation on the absolute superiority of\nthat ancient but somewhat crude appliance over anything else of the\nsort in existence.Nevertheless, on this occasion also, the great\ndynamic force which is ever latent in first-class railroad accidents\nagain asserted itself.Even the most opinionated of professional\nrailroad men, emphatically as he might in public deny it, quietly\nyielded as soon as might be.In a surprisingly short time after the\nexhibition of ignorance which has been referred to, the railroads in\nMassachusetts, as it has already been shown, were all equipped with\ntrain-brakes.[23]\n\n  [23] Page 157.In its present improved shape it is safe to say that in all those\nrequisites which the highest authorities known on the subject have\nlaid down as essential to a model train brake, the Westinghouse\nstands easily first among the many inventions of the kind.It is\nnow a much more perfect appliance than it was in 1871, for it was\nthen simply atmospheric and continuous in its action, whereas it\nhas since been made automatic and self-regulating.So far as its\nfundamental principle is concerned, that is too generally understood\nto call for explanation.By means of an air-pump, attached to the\nboiler of the locomotive and controlled by the engine-driver, an\natmospheric force is brought to bear, through tubes running under\nthe cars, upon the break blocks, pressing them against the wheels.The hand of the engine-driver is in fact on every wheel in the\ntrain.This application of power, though unquestionably ingenious\nand, like all good things, most simple and obvious when once\npointed out, was originally open to one great objection, which was\npersistently and with great force urged against it.The parts of the\napparatus were all delicate, and some injury or derangement of them\nwas always possible, and sometimes inevitable.The chief advantage\nclaimed for the brake was, however, that complete dependence could\nbe placed upon it in the regular movement of trains.It was obvious,\ntherefore, that if such dependence was placed upon it and any\nderangement did occur, the first intimation those in charge of the\ntrain would have that something was wrong might well come in the\nshape of a failure of the brake to act, and a subsequent disaster.Both in Massachusetts and in Connecticut, at the crossing of one\nrailroad by another at the same level in the former state and in the\napproach to draws in bridges in the latter, a number of cases of\nthis failure of the original Westinghouse non-automatic brake to act\ndid in point of fact occur.Fortunately they, none of them, resulted\nin disaster.This, however, was mere good luck, as was illustrated\nin the case of the accident of November 11, 1876, at the Communipaw\nFerry on the New Jersey Central.The train was there equipped with\nthe ordinary train brake.It reached Jersey City on time shortly\nafter 4 P.M., but, instead of slacking up, it ran directly through\nthe station and freight offices, carrying away the walls and\nsupports, and the locomotive then plunged into the river beyond.The baggage and smoking car followed but fortunately lodged on the\nlocomotive, thus blocking the remainder of the train.Fortunately no\none was killed, and no passengers were seriously injured.Again, on the Metropolitan Elevated railroad in New York city, on\nthe evening of June 23, 1879, one of the trains was delayed for a\nfew moments at the Franklin street station.Meanwhile the next train\ncame along, and, though the engine-driver of this following train\nsaw the danger signals and endeavored to stop in time, he found his\nbrake out of order, and a collision ensued resulting in the injury\nof one employé and the severe shattering of a passenger coach and\nlocomotive.It was only a piece of good fortune that the first\nof these accidents did not result in a repetition of the Norwalk\ndisaster and the second in that of Revere.It so chanced that it was the Smith vacuum brake which failed to\nwork at Communipaw, and the Eames vacuum which failed to work at\nFranklin street.It might just\nas well have been the original Westinghouse.The difficulty lay, not\nin the maker\'s name, but in the imperfect action of the brake; and\nsuch significant intimations are not to be disregarded.The chances\nare naturally large that the failure of the continuous brake to act\nwill not at once occur under just those circumstances which will\nentail a serious disaster and heavy loss of life; that, however, if\nsuch intimations as these are disregarded, it will sooner or later\nso occur does not admit of doubt.But the possibility that upon some given occasion it might fail to\nwork was not the only defect in the original Westinghouse; it might\nwell be in perfect order and in full action even, and then suddenly,\nas the result of derailment or separation of parts, the apparatus\nmight be broken, and at once the shoes would drop from the wheels,\nand the vehicles of the disabled train would either press forward,\nor, on an incline, stop and run backwards until their unchecked\nmomentum was exhausted.This appears to have been the case at\nWollaston, and contributed some of its most disastrous features to\nthat accident.To obviate these defects Westinghouse in 1872 invented what he\ntermed a triple valve attachment, by means of which, if the\nthing can be so expressed, his brake was made to always stand at\ndanger.That is, in case of any derangement of its parts, it was\nautomatically applied and the train stopped.The action of the brake\nwas thus made to give notice of anything wrong anywhere in the\ntrain.A noticeable case of this occurred on the Midland railway in\nEngland, when on the November 22, 1876, as the Scotch express was\napproaching the Heeley station, at a speed of some sixty miles an\nhour, the hind-guard felt the automatic brake suddenly self-applied.The forward truck of a Pullman car in the middle of the train had\nleft the rails; the front part of the train broke the couplings\nand went on, while the rear carriages, acted upon by the automatic\nbrakes, came to a stand immediately behind the Pullman, which\nfinally rested on its side across the opposite track.On the other hand, as the Scotch express on the\nNorth Eastern road was approaching Morpeth, on March 25, 1877, at\na speed of some twenty-five miles an hour, the locomotive for some\nreason left the track.The train was not equipped with an automatic\nbrake, and the carriages in it accordingly pressed forward upon\neach other until three of them were so utterly destroyed as to be\nindistinguishable.Five passengers lost their lives; the remains of\none of whom, together with the wheels of a carriage, were afterwards\ntaken out from the tank of the tender, into which they had been\ndriven by the force of the shock.The theoretical objection to the automatic brake is obvious.In\ncase of any derangement of its machinery it applies itself, and,\nshould these derangements be of frequent occurrence, the consequent\nstoppage of trains would prove a great annoyance, if not a source\nof serious danger.This objection is not sustained by practical\nexperience.The triple valve, so called, is the only complicated\nportion of the automatic brake, and this valve is well protected\nand not liable to get out of order.[24] Should it become deranged\nit will stop the working of the brake on that car alone to which it\nbelongs; and it will become deranged so as to set the brake only\nfrom causes which would render the non-automatic brake inoperative.When anything of this sort occurs, it stops the train until the\ndefect is remedied.The returns made to the English Board of\nTrade enable us to know just how frequently in actual and regular\nservice these stoppages occur, and what they amount to.Take, for\ninstance, the North Eastern and the Caledonian railways.During the last six months of 1878 the first\nran 138,000 train miles with it, in the course of which there\nwere eight delays or stoppages of some three to five minutes each\noccasioned by the action of the triple-valve; being in round numbers\none occasion of delay in 17,000 miles of train movement.On the\nCaledonian railway, during the same period, four brake failures, due\nto the action of the triple-valve, were reported in runs aggregating\nover 62,000 miles, being about one failure to 15,000 miles.These\nfailures moreover occasioned delays of only a few minutes each, and,\nwhere the cause of the difficulty was not so immediately apparent\nthat it could at once be remedied, the brake-tubes of the vehicle\non which the difficulty occurred were disconnected, and the trains\nwent on.[25] One of these stoppages, however, resulted in a serious\naccident.As a train on the Caledonian road was approaching the\nWemyss Bay junction on December 14th, in a dense fog, the engine\ndriver, seeing the signals at danger, undertook to apply his brake\nslightly, when it went full on, stopping the train between the\ndistant and home signals, as they are called in the English block\nsystem.After the danger signal was lowered, but before the brake\ncould be released, the signal-man allowed a following train to enter\nupon the same block section, and a collision followed in which some\nthirteen passengers were slightly injured.This accident, however,\nas the inspecting officer of the Board of Trade very properly found,\nwas due not at all to the automatic brake, but to "carelessness\non the part of the signal-man, who disregarded the rules for the\nworking of the block telegraph instruments," and to the driver\nof the colliding train, who "disobeyed the company\'s running\nregulations."It gives an American, however, a realizing sense of\none of the difficulties under which those crowded British lines are\noperated, to read that in this case the fog was "so thick that the\ntail-lamp was not visible from an approaching train for more than a\nfew yards."[24] Speaking of the modifications introduced into his brake by\n  Westinghouse since 1874, Mr.Thomas E. Harrison, civil engineer\n  of the North Eastern Railway Company in a communication to the\n  directors of that company of April 24, 1879, recommending the\n  adoption by it of the Westinghouse, and subsequently ordered to\n  be printed for the use of Parliament, thus referred to the triple\n  valve: "As the most important [of these modifications] I will\n  particularly draw your attention to the "triple-valve" which has\n  been made a regular bugbear by the opponents of the system, and has\n  been called complicated, delicate, and liable to get out of order,\n  etc.* * * It is, in fact, as simple a piece of mechanism as well\n  can be imagined, certain in its action, of durable materials, easily\n  accessible to an ordinary workman for examination or cleaning, and\n  there is nothing about it that can justify the term complication; on\n  the contrary, it is a model of ingenuity and simplicity."[25] During the six months ending June 30, 1879, some 300 stops due\n  to some derangement of the apparatus of the Westinghouse brake were\n  reported by ten companies in runs aggregating about two million\n  miles.Being one stop to 6,600 miles run.Very many of these stops\n  were obviously due to the want of familiarity of the employés with\n  an apparatus new to them, but as a rule the delays occasioned did\n  not exceed a very few minutes; of 82 stoppages, for instance,\n  reported on the London, Brighton & South Coast road, the two longest\n  were ten minutes each and the remainder averaged some three or four\n  minutes.After the application of the triple valve had made it automatic,\nthere remained but one further improvement necessary to render\nthe Westinghouse a well-nigh perfect brake.A superabundance of\nself-acting power had been secured, but no provision was yet made\nfor graduating the use of that power so that it should be applied\nin the exact degree, neither more nor less, which would soonest\nstop the train.This for two reasons is mechanically a matter of\nno little importance.As is well known a too severe application of\nbrakes, no matter of what kind they are, causes the wheels to stand\nstill and slide upon the rails.This is not only very injurious to\nrolling stock, the wheels of which are flattened at the points which\nslide, but, as has long been practically well-known to those whose\nbusiness it is to run locomotives, when once the wheels begin to\nslide the retarding power of the brakes is seriously diminished.In order, therefore, to secure the maximum of retarding power, the\npressure of the brake-blocks on the revolving wheels should be very\ngreat when first applied, and just sufficient not to slide them; and\nshould then be diminished, _pari passu_ with the momentum of the\ntrain, until it wholly stops.Familiar as all this has long been\nto engine-drivers and practical railroad mechanics, yet it has not\nbeen conceded in the results of many scientific inquiries.In the\nreport of one of the Royal Commissions on Accidents, for instance,\nit was asserted that the momentum of a train was retarded more by\nthe action of sliding than of slowly revolving wheels; and again,\nas recently as in May, 1877, in a scientific discussion in London\nat one of the meetings of the Society of Arts, a gentleman, with\nthe letters C. E. appended to his name, ventured the surprising\nassertion that "no brake could do more than skid the wheels of\na train, and all continuous brakes professed to do this, and he\nbelieved did so about equally well."Now, what it is here asserted\nno brake can do is exactly what the perfect brake will be made to\ndo,--and what Westinghouse\'s latest improvement, it is claimed,\nenables his brake to do.It much more than "skids the wheels," by\nmeasuring out exactly that degree of power necessary to hold the\nwheels just short of the skidding point, and in this way always\nexerts the maximum retarding force.This is brought about by means\nof a contrivance which allows the air to leak out of the brake\ncylinders so as to exactly proportion the pressure of the blocks\non the wheels to the speed with which the latter are revolving.In other, and more scientific, language the force with which the\nbrake-blocks are pressed upon the wheels is made to adjust itself\nautomatically as the "coefficient of dynamic friction augments with\nthe reduction of train speed."It hardly needs to be said that in\nthis way the power of the brake is enormously increased.In America the superiority of the Westinghouse over any other\ndescription of train-brake has long been established through that\nlarge preponderance of use which in such matters constitutes the\nfinal and irreversible verdict.[26] In Europe, however, and\nespecially in Great Britain, ever since the Shipton-on-Cherwell\naccident in 1874, the battle of the brakes, as it may not\ninappropriately be called, has waxed hotter and hotter; and not only\nhas this battle been extremely interesting in a scientific way, but\nit has been highly characteristic, and at times enlivened by touches\nof human nature which were exceedingly amusing.[26] In Massachusetts, for instance, where no official pressure\n  in favor of any particular brake was brought to bear, out of 473\n  locomotives equipped with train-brakes 361 have the Westinghouse,\n  which is also applied to 1,363 out of 1,669 cars.Of these, however,\n  79 locomotives and 358 cars are equipped with both the atmospheric\n  and the vacuum brakes.The English battle of the brakes may be said to have fairly opened\nwith the official report from Captain Tyler on the Shipton accident,\nin reference to which he expressed the opinion, which has already\nbeen quoted in describing the accident, that "if the train had\nbeen fitted with continuous brakes throughout its whole length\nthere is no reason why it should not have been brought to rest\nwithout any casuality."The Royal Commission on railroad accidents\nthen took the matter up and called for a series of scientifically\nconducted experiments.These took place under the supervision of\ntwo engineers appointed by the Commission, who were aided by a\ndetail of officers and men from the royal engineers.Eight brakes\ncompeted, and a train, consisting of a locomotive and thirteen\ncars, was specially prepared for each.With these trains some\nseventy runs were made, and their results recorded and tabulated;\nthe experiments were continued through six consecutive working\ndays.Of the brakes experimented with three were American in their\norigin,--Westinghouse\'s automatic and vacuum, and Smith\'s vacuum.The remainder were English, and were steam, hydraulic, and air\nbrakes; among them also was one simple emergency brake.The result\nof the trials was a very decided victory for the Westinghouse\nautomatic, and upon its performances the Commission based its\nconclusion that trains ought to be so equipped that in cases of\nemergency they could be brought to rest, when travelling on level\nground at 50 miles an hour, within a distance of 275 yards; with\nan allowance of distance in cases of speed greater or less than\n50 miles nearly proportioned to its square.These allowances they\ntabulated as follows:--\n\n  At 60 miles per hour, stopping distance within 400 yards.\n  "55        "            "           "        340   "\n  "  50        "            "           "        275   "\n  "  45        "            "           "        220   "\n  "  40        "            "           "        180   "\n  "  35        "            "           "        135   "\n  "  30        "            "           "        100   "\n\nTo appreciate the enormous advance in what may be called stopping\npower which these experiments revealed, it should be added that\nthe first series of experiments made at Newark were with trains\nequipped only with the hand-brake.The average speed in these\nexperiments was 47 miles, and with the train-brake, according to the\nforegoing tabulation, the stop should have been made in about 250\nyards; in reality it was made in a little less than five times that\ndistance, or 1120 yards; in other words the experiments showed that\nthe improved appliances had more than quadrupled the control over\ntrains.It has already been noticed that in the cases of the Angola\nand the Port Jervis disasters, as well as in that at Shipton, the\ntrains ran some 2,700 feet before they could be stopped.Under the\nEnglish tabulations above given, in the results of which certain\nrecent improvements do not enter, a train running into the 42d\nStreet Station in New York, at a speed of forty-five miles an hour\nwhen under the entrance arches, would be stopped before it reached\nthe buffers at the end of the covered tracks.The Royal Commission experiments were followed in May and June,\n1877, by yet others set on foot by the North Eastern Railway\nCompany for the purpose of making a competitive test of the\nWestinghouse automatic and the Smith\'s vacuum brakes.At this trial\nalso the average stop at a speed of 50 miles an hour was effected\nin 15 seconds, and within a distance of 650 feet.Other series\nof experiments with similar results were, about the same time,\nconducted under the auspices of the Belgian and German governments,\nof which elaborate official reports were made.The result was that\nat last, under date of August 30, 1877, the Board of Trade issued\na circular to the railway companies in which it called attention to\nthe fact that, notwithstanding all the discussion which had taken\nplace and the elaborate official trials which the government had set\non foot, there had "apparently been no attempt on the part of the\nvarious companies to take the first step of agreeing upon what are\nthe requirements which, in their opinion, are essential to a good\ncontinuous brake."In other words, the Board found that, instead of\nbecoming better, matters were rapidly becoming worse.Each company\nwas equipping its rolling stock with that appliance in which its\nofficers happened to be interested as owners or inventors, and when\ncarriages thus equipped passed from the tracks of one road onto\nthose of another the result was a return to the old hand-brake\nsystem in a condition of impaired efficiency.The Board accordingly\nnow proceeded to narrow down the field of selection by specifying\nthe following as what it considered the essentials of a good\ncontinuous brake:--\n\n     _a._ "The brakes to be efficient in stopping trains,\n     instantaneous in their actions, and capable of being applied\n     without difficulty by engine-drivers or guards._b._ "In case of accident, to be instantaneously self-acting._c._ "The brakes to be put on and taken off (with facility) on\n     the engine and on every vehicle of a train._d._ "The brakes to be regularly used in daily working._e._ "The materials employed to be of a durable character, so as\n     to be easily maintained and kept in order."These requirements pointed about as directly as they could to the\nWestinghouse, to the exclusion of all competing brakes.Not more\nthan one other complied with them in all respects, and many made\nno pretence of complying at all.Then followed what may be termed\nthe battle royal of the brakes, which as yet shows no signs of\ndrawing to a close.As the avowed object of the Board of Trade was\nto introduce, one brake, to the necessary exclusion of all others,\nthroughout the railroad system of Great Britain, the magnitude of\nthe prize was not easy to over-estimate.The weight of scientific\nand official authority was decidedly in favor of the Westinghouse\nautomatic, but among the railroad men the Smith vacuum found\nthe largest number of adherents.It failed to meet three of the\nrequirements of the Board of Trade, in that it was neither automatic\nnor instantaneous in its action, while the materials employed in\nit were not of a durable character.It was, on the other hand, a\nbrake of unquestioned excellence, while it commended itself to the\njudgment of the average railroad official by its simplicity, and to\nthat of the average railroad director by its apparent cheapness.Any\none could understand it, and its first cost was temptingly small.The real struggle in Great Britain, therefore, has been, and now\nis, between these two brakes; and the fact that both of them are\nAmerican has been made to enter largely into it, and in a way also\nwhich at times lent to the discussion an element of broad humor.For instance, the energetic agent of the Smith vacuum, feeling\nhimself aggrieved by some statement which appeared in the _Times_,\nresponded thereto in a circular, in the composition of which he\ncertainly evinced more zeal than either judgment or literary skill.This circular and its author were then referred to by the editors\nof _Engineering_, a London scientific journal, in the following\nslightly _de haut en bas_ style:--\n\n     "It is not a little remarkable, and it is a fact not harmonious\n     with the feelings of English engineers, that the two brakes\n     recommending themselves for adoption are of American origin.* * * Now we cannot wonder, considering what our past experience\n     has been in many of our dealings with Americans, that this\n     feeling of distrust and prejudice exists.It is not merely\n     sentimental, it is founded on many and untoward and costly\n     experiences of the past, and the fear of similar experiences in\n     the future.And when we see the representative of one of these\n     systems adopting the traditional policy of his country, and\n     meeting criticism with abuse--abuse of men pre-eminent in the\n     profession, and journals which he apparently forgets are neither\n     American nor venal--we do not wonder that our railway engineers\n     feel a repugnance to commit themselves."The superiority of the British over the American controversialist,\nas respects courtesy and restraint in language, being thus\nsatisfactorily established, it only remained to illustrate it.This, however, had already been done in the previous May; for at\nthat time it chanced that Captain Tyler, having retired from his\nposition at the head of the railway inspectors department of the\nBoard of Trade, was considering an offer which Mr.Westinghouse had\nmade him to associate himself with the company owning the brakes\nknown by that name.Before accepting this offer, Captain Tyler\ntook advantage of a meeting of the Society of Arts to publicly\ngive notice that he was considering it.This he did in a really\nadmirable paper on the whole subject of continuous brakes, at the\nclose of which a general discussion was invited and took place, and\nin the course of it the innate superiority of the British over any\nother kind of controversialist, so far at least as courtesy and a\ndelicate refraining from imputations is concerned, received pointed\nillustration.Houghton, C. E., took\noccasion to refer to the paper he had read as "an elaborate puff\nto the Westinghouse brake, with which he [Tyler] was, as he told,\nconnected, or about to be."Steele proceeded to say\nthat:--\n\n     "On receiving the invitation to be present at the meeting, he\n     had been somewhat afraid that Captain Tyler was going to lose\n     his fine character for impartiality by throwing in his lot with\n     the brake-tinkers, but it came out that not only was he going to\n     do that, but actually going to be a partner in a concern.* * *\n     The speaker then proceeded to discuss the Westinghouse brake,\n     which he called the Westinghouse and Tyler brake, designating\n     it as a jack-in-the-box, a rattle trap, to please and decoy,\n     and not an invention at all.No engineer had a hand in its\n     manufacture.It was the discovery of some Philadelphia barber\n     or some such thing.This was\n     a brake which had all sorts of pretensions.It had not worked\n     well, but whenever there was any row about its not working\n     well, they got the papers to praise it up, and that was how the\n     papers were under the thumb, and would not speak of any other.* * * He thought it would not do for railway companies to take\n     a bad brake, and Captain Tyler and Mr.Westinghouse be able\n     to make their fortunes by floating a limited company for its\n     introduction.They had heard of Emma mines and Lisbon tramways,\n     and such like, and he felt it would not be well to stand by and\n     allow this to be done."All of which was not only to the point, but finely calculated to\nshow the American inventors and agents who were present the nice and\nmutually respectful manner in which such discussions were carried on\nby all Englishmen.Though the avowed adhesion of Sir Henry Tyler to the Westinghouse\nwas a most important move in the war of the brakes, it did not\nprove a decisive one.The complete control of the field was too\nvaluable a property to be yielded in deference to that, or any other\nname without a struggle; and, so to speak, there were altogether\ntoo many ins and outs to the conflict.Back door influences had\neverywhere to be encountered.The North Western, for instance, is\nthe most important of the railway companies of the United Kingdom.The locomotive superintendent of that company was the part inventor\nand proprietor of an emergency brake which had been extensively\nadopted by it on its rolling stock, but which wholly failed to meet\nthe requirements laid down in its circular by the Board of Trade.Immediately after issuing that circular the Board of Trade called\nthe attention of the company to this fact in connection with an\naccident which had recently occurred, and in very emphatic language\npointed out that the brakes in question could not "in any reasonable\nsense of the word be called continuous brakes," and that it was\nclear that the circular requirements were "not complied with by the\nbrake-system of the London & North Western Railway Company;" in case\nthat company persisted in the use of that brake, the secretary of\nthe Board went on to say, "in the event of a casualty occurring,\nwhich an efficient system of brakes might have prevented, a heavy\npersonal responsibility will rest upon those who are answerable for\nsuch neglect."This was certainly language tolerably direct in its\nimport.As such it was calculated to cause those to whom it was\naddressed to pause in their action.The company, however, treated it\nwith a superb disregard, all the more contemptuous because veiled\nin language of deferential civility.They then quietly went on\napplying their locomotive superintendent\'s emergency brake to their\nequipment, until on the 30th of June, 1879, they returned no less\nthan 2,052 carriages fitted with it; that being by far the largest\nnumber returned by any one company in the United Kingdom.A more direct challenge to the Board of Trade and to Parliament\ncould not easily have been devised.To appreciate how direct it\nwas, it is necessary to bear in mind that in its circular of August\n30, 1877, in which the requirements of a satisfactory train-brake\nwere laid down, the Board of Trade threw out to the companies\nthe very significant hint, that they "would do well to reflect\nthat if a doubt should arise that from a conflict of interest or\nopinion, or from any other cause, they [the companies] are not\nexerting themselves, it is obvious that they will call down upon\nthemselves an interference which the Board of Trade, no less than\nthe companies, desire to avoid."In his general report on the\naccidents of the year 1877, the successor of Captain Tyler expressed\nthe opinion that "sufficient information and experience would now\nappear to be available, and the time is approaching when the railway\ncompanies may fairly be expected to come to a decision as to which\nof the systems of continuous brakes is best calculated to fulfil the\nrequisite conditions, and is most worthy of general adoption."At\nthe close of another year, however, the official returns seemed to\nindicate that, while but a sixth part of the passenger locomotives\nand a fifth part of the carriages in use on the railroads of the\nUnited Kingdom were yet equipped with continuous brakes at all, a\nconcurrence of opinion in favor of any one system was more remote\nthan ever.During the six months ending December 31, 1878, but 127\nadditional locomotives out of about 4000, and 1,200 additional\ncarriages out of some 32,000 were equipped; of which 70 locomotives\nand 530 carriages had been equipped with the Smith vacuum, which in\nthree most important respects failed to comply with the Board of\nTrade requirements.Under these circumstances the Board of Trade\nwas obviously called upon either to withdraw from the position it\nhad taken, or to invite that "interference" in its support to which\nin its circular of August, 1877 it had so portentously referred.It\ndecided to do the latter, and in March, 1879 the government gave an\nintimation in the House of Lords that early Parliamentary action was\ncontemplated.As it is expressed, the railway companies are to "be\nrelieved of their indecision."In Great Britain, therefore, the long battle of the brakes would\nseem to be drawing to its close.The final struggle, however,\nwill be a spirited one, and one which Americans will watch with\nconsiderable interest,--for it is in fact a struggle between two\nAmerican brakes, the Westinghouse and the Smith vacuum.Of the\n907 locomotives hitherto equipped with the continuous brakes no\nless than 819 are equipped with one or the other of these American\npatents, besides over 4,464 of the 9,919 passenger carriages.The\nremaining 3,857 locomotives and 30,000 carriages are the prize of\nvictory.As the score now stands the vacuum brake is in almost\nexactly twice the use of its more scientific rival.The weight\nof authority and experience, and the requirements of the Board of\nTrade, are, however, on the opposite side.As deduced from the European scientific tests and the official\nreturns, the balance of advantages would seem to be as follows:--In\nfavor of the vacuum are its superficial simplicity, and possible\neconomy in first cost:--In favor of the Westinghouse automatic are\nits superior quickness in application, the greater rapidity in\nits stopping power, the more durable nature of its materials, the\nsmaller cost in renewal, its less liability to derangement, and\nabove all its self-acting adjustment.The last is the point upon\nwhich the final issue of the struggle must probably turn.The use\nof any train-brake which is not automatic in its action, as has\nalready been pointed out, involves in the long run disaster,--and\nultimate serious disaster.The mere fact that the brake is generally\nso reliable,--that ninety-nine times out of the hundred it works\nperfectly,--simply makes disaster certain by the fatal confidence\nit inspires.Ninety-nine times in a hundred the brake proves\nreliable;--nine times in the remaining ten of the thousand, in which\nit fails, a lucky chance averts disaster;--but the thousandth time\nwill assuredly come, as it did at Communipaw and on the New York\nElevated railway, and, much the worst of all yet, at Wollaston.Soon or late the use of non-automatic continuous brakes will most\nassuredly, if they are not sooner abandoned, be put an end to\nby the occurrence of some not-to-be forgotten catastrophe of the\nfirst magnitude, distinctly traceable to that cause.Meanwhile that\nautomatic brakes are complicated and sometimes cause inconvenience\nin their operation is most indisputable.This is an objection, also,\nto which they are open in common with most of the riper results of\nhuman ingenuity;--but, though sun-dials are charmingly simple, we do\nnot, therefore, discard chronometers in their favor; neither do we\ninsist on cutting our harvests with the scythe, because every man\nwho may be called upon to drive a mowing machine may not know how\nto put one together.Daniel travelled to the bathroom.But what Sir Henry Tyler has said in respect\nto this oldest and most fallacious, as well as most wearisome, of\nobjections covers the whole ground and cannot be improved upon.After referring to the fact that simplicity in construction and\nsimplicity in working were two different things, and that, almost\ninvariably, a certain degree of complication in construction is\nnecessary to secure simplicity in working,--after pointing this out\nhe went on to add that,--\n\n     "Simplicity as regards the application of railway brakes is\n     not obtained by the system now more commonly employed of\n     brake-handles to be turned by different men in different\n     parts of the train; but is obtained when, by more complicated\n     construction an engine-driver is able easily in an instant to\n     apply ample brake-power at pleasure with more or less force\n     to every wheel of his train; is obtained when, every time an\n     engine-driver starts, or attempts to start his train, the brake\n     itself informs him if it is out of order; and is still more\n     obtained when, on the occasion of an accident and the separation\n     of a coupling, the brakes will unfailingly apply themselves on\n     every wheel of the train without the action of the engine-driver\n     or guards, [brakemen], and before even they have time to realize\n     the necessity for it.This is true simplicity in such a case,\n     and that system of continuous brakes which best accomplishes\n     such results in the shortest space of time is so far preferable\n     to all others."THE RAILROAD JOURNEY RESULTING IN DEATH.One day in May, 1847, as the Queen of Belgium was going from\nVerviers to Brussels by rail, the train in which she was journeying\ncame into collision with another train going in the opposite\ndirection.There was naturally something of a panic, and, as\nroyalty was not then accustomed to being knocked about with\nrailroad equality, some of her suite urged the queen to leave the\ntrain and to finish her journey by carriage.The contemporaneous\ncourt reporter then went on to say, in that language which is\nso peculiarly his own,--"But her Majesty, as courageously as\ndiscreetly, declined to set that example of timidity, and she\nproceeded to Brussels by the railway."In those days a very\nexaggerated idea was universally entertained of the great danger\nincident to travel by rail.Even then, however, had her Majesty, who\nwas doubtless a very sensible woman, happened to be familiar with\nthe statistics of injuries received by those traveling respectively\nby rail and by carriage, she certainly never on any plea of danger\nwould have been induced to abandon her railroad train in order to\ntrust herself behind horse-flesh.By pursuing the course urged\nupon her, the queen would have multiplied her chances of accident\nsome sixty fold.Strange as the statement sounds even now, such\nwould seem to have been the fact.In proportion to the whole number\ncarried, the accidents to passengers in "the good old days of\nstage-coaches" were, as compared to the present time of the railroad\ndispensation, about as sixty to one.This result, it is true, cannot\nbe verified in the experience either of England or of this country,\nfor neither the English nor we possess any statistics in relation\nto the earlier period; but they have such statistics in France,\nstretching over the space of more than forty years, and as reliable\nas statistics ever are.If these French statistics hold true in New\nEngland,--and considering the character of our roads, conveyances,\nand climate, their showing is more likely to be in our favor than\nagainst us,--if they simply hold true, leaving us to assume that\nstage-coach traveling was no less safe in Massachusetts than in\nFrance, then it would follow that to make the dangers of the rail\nof the present day equal to those of the highway of half a century\nback, some eighty passengers should annually be killed and some\neleven hundred injured within the limits of Massachusetts alone.These figures, however, represent rather more than fifty times the\nactual average, and from them it would seem to be not unfair to\nconclude that, notwithstanding the great increase of population and\nthe yet greater increase in travel during the last half-century,\nthere were literally more persons killed and injured each year in\nMassachusetts fifty years ago through accidents to stage-coaches\nthan there are now through accidents to railroad trains.The first impression of nine out of ten persons in no way connected\nwith the operations of railroads would probably be found to be\nthe exact opposite to this.A vague but deeply rooted conviction\ncommonly prevails that the railroad has created a new danger;\nthat because of it the average human being\'s hold on life is more\nprecarious than it was.The first point-blank, bald statement to the\ncontrary would accordingly strike people in the light not only of a\nparadox, but of a somewhat foolish one.Investigation, nevertheless,\nbears it out.The fact is that when a railroad accident comes, it is\napt to come in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever in relation\nto it.It is heralded like a battle or an earthquake; it fills\ncolumns of the daily press with the largest capitals and the most\nharrowing details, and thus it makes a deep and lasting impression\non the minds of many people.When a multitude of persons, traveling\nas almost every man now daily travels himself, meet death in such\nsudden and such awful shape, the event smites the imagination.People seeing it and thinking of it, and hearing and reading of\nit, and of it only, forget of how infrequent occurrence it is.It\nwas not so in the olden time.Every one rode behind horses,--if not\nin public then in private conveyances,--and when disaster came it\ninvolved but few persons and was rarely accompanied by circumstances\nwhich either struck the imagination or attracted any great public\nnotice.In the first place, the modern newspaper, with its perfect\nmachinery for sensational exaggeration, did not then exist,--having\nitself only recently come in the train of the locomotive;--and, in\nthe next place, the circle of those included in the consequences of\nany disaster was necessarily small.For\nweeks and months the vast machinery moves along, doing its work\nquickly, swiftly, safely; no one pays any attention to it, while\nmillions daily make use of it.It is as much a necessity of their\nlives as the food they eat and the air they breathe.Suddenly,\nsomehow, and somewhere,--at Versailles, at Norwalk, at Abergele, at\nNew Hamburg, or at Revere,--at some hitherto unfamiliar point upon\nan insignificant thread of the intricate iron web, an obstruction is\nencountered, a jar, as it were, is felt, and instantly, with time\nfor hardly an ejaculation or a thought, a multitude of human beings\nare hurled into eternity.It is no cause for surprise that such an\nevent makes the community in which it happens catch its breadth;\nneither is it unnatural that people should think more of the few who\nare killed, of whom they hear so much, than of the myriads who are\ncarried in safety and of whom they hear nothing.Yet it is well to\nbear in mind that there are two sides to that question also, and in\nno way could this fact be more forcibly brought to our notice than\nby the assertion, borne out by all the statistics we possess, that,\nirrespective of the vast increase in the number of those who travel,\na greater number of passengers in stage-coaches were formerly\neach year killed or injured by accidents to which they in no way\ncontributed through their own carelessness, than are now killed\nunder the same conditions in our railroad cars.In other words, the\nintroduction of the modern railroad, so far from proportionately\nincreasing the dangers of traveling, has absolutely diminished them.It is not, after all, the dangers but the safety of the modern\nrailroad which should excite our special wonder.What is the average length of the railroad journey resulting in\ndeath by accident to a prudent traveler?--What is the average length\nof one resulting in some personal injury to him?--These are two\nquestions which interest every one.Few persons, probably, start\nupon any considerable journey, implying days and nights on the\nrail, without almost unconsciously taking into some consideration\nthe risks of accident.Visions of collision, derailment, plunging\nthrough bridges, will rise unbidden.Even the old traveler who\nhas enjoyed a long immunity is apt at times, with some little\napprehension, to call to mind the musty adage of the pitcher and\nthe well, and to ask himself how much longer it will be safe for\nhim to rely on his good luck.A hundred thousand miles, perhaps,\nand no accident yet!--Surely, on every doctrine of chances, he\nnow owes to fate an arm or a leg;--perhaps a life.The statistics\nof a long series of years enable us, however, to approximate with\na tolerable degree of precision to an answer to these questions,\nand the answer is simply astounding;--so astounding, in fact,\nthat, before undertaking to give it, the question itself ought to\nbe stated with all possible precision.It is this:--Taking all\npersons who as passengers travel by rail,--and this includes all\ndwellers in civilized countries,--what number of journeys of the\naverage length are safely accomplished, to each one which results\nin the death or injury of a passenger from some cause over which he\nhad no control?--The cases of death or injury must be confined to\npassengers, and to those of them only who expose themselves to no\nunnecessary risk.When approaching a question of this sort, statisticians are apt to\nassume for their answers an appearance of mathematical accuracy.It is needless to say that this is a mere affectation.The best\nresults which can be arrived at are, after all, mere approximations,\nand they also vary greatly year by year.The body of facts from\nwhich conclusions are to be deduced must cover not only a definite\narea of space, but also a considerable lapse of time.Even Great\nBritain, with its 17,000 miles of track and its hundreds of millions\nof annual passenger journeys, shows results which, one year with\nanother, vary strangely.For instance, during the four years\nanterior to 1874, but one passenger was killed, upon an average, to\neach 11,000,000 carried; while in 1874 the proportion, under the\ninfluence of a succession of disasters, suddenly doubled, rising to\none in every 5,500,000; and then again in 1877, a year of peculiar\nexemption, it fell off to one in every 50,000,000.The percentage of\nfatal casualties to the whole number carried was in 1847-9 five fold\nwhat it was in 1878.If such fluctuations reveal themselves in the\nstatistics of Great Britain, those met with in the narrower field of\na single state in this country might well seem at first glance to\nset all computation at defiance.During the ten years, for example,\nbetween 1861 and 1870, about 200,000,000 passengers were returned\nas carried on the Massachusetts roads, with 135 cases of injury to\nindividuals.Then came the year of the Revere disaster, and out of\n26,000,000 carried, no less than 115 were killed or injured.Seven\nyears of comparative immunity then ensued, during which, out of\n240,000,000 carried, but two were killed and forty-five injured.In other words, through a period of ten years the casualties were\napproximately as one to 1,500,000; then during a single year they\nrose to one in 250,000, or a seven-fold increase; and then through\na period of seven years they diminished to one in 3,400,000, a\ndecrease of about ninety per cent.Taking, however, the very worst of years,--the year of the\nRevere disaster, which stands unparalleled in the history of\nMassachusetts,--it will yet be found that the answer to the question\nas to the length of the average railroad journey resulting in death\nor in injury will be expressed, not in thousands nor in hundreds\nof thousands of miles, but in millions.During that year some\n26,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the limits of the\nstate, and each journey averaged a distance of about 13 miles.It\nwould seem, therefore, that, even in that year, the average journey\nresulting in death was 11,000,000 miles, while that resulting either\nin death or personal injury was not less than 3,300,000.The year 1871, however, represented by no means a fair average.On the contrary, it indicated what may fairly be considered an\nexcessive degree of danger, exciting nervous apprehensions in the\nbreasts of those even who were not constitutionally timid.To reach\nwhat may be considered a normal average, therefore, it would be\nmore proper to include a longer period in the computation.Take,\nfor instance, the nine years, 1871-79, during which alone has\nany effort been made to reach statistical accuracy in respect to\nMassachusetts railroad accidents.During those nine years, speaking\nin round numbers and making no pretence at anything beyond a\ngeneral approximation, some 303,000,000 passenger journeys of 13\nmiles each have been made on the railroads and within the state.Of these 51 have resulted in death and 308 in injuries to persons\nfrom causes over which they had no control.The average distance,\ntherefore, traveled by all, before death happened to any one, was\nabout 80,000,000 miles, and that travelled before any one was either\ninjured or killed was about 10,800,000.The Revere disaster of 1871, however, as has been seen, brought\nabout important changes in the methods of operating the railroads\nof Massachusetts.Consequently the danger incident to railroad\ntraveling was materially reduced; and in the next eight years\n(1872-9) some 274,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the\nlimits of the state.The Wollaston disaster of October, 1878, was\nincluded in this period, during which 223 persons were injured and\n21 were killed.The average journey for these years resulting in any\ninjury to a passenger was close upon 15,000,000 miles, while that\nresulting in death was 170,000,000.But it may fairly be asked,--What, after all, do these figures\nmean?--They are, indeed, so large as to exceed comprehension; for,\nafter certain comparatively narrow limits are passed the practical\ninfinite is approached, and the mere adding of a few more ciphers\nafter a numeral conveys no new idea.On the contrary, the piling up\nof figures rather tends to weaken than to strengthen a statement,\nfor to many it suggests an idea of ridiculous exaggeration.Indeed,\nwhen a few years ago a somewhat similar statement to that just made\nwas advanced in an official report, a critic undertook to expose\nthe fallacy of it in the columns of a daily paper by referring to a\ncase within the writer\'s own observation in which a family of three\npersons had been killed on their very first journey in a railroad\ncar.It is not, of course, necessary to waste time over such a\ncriticism as this.Railroad accidents continually take place, and\nin consequence of them people are killed and injured, and of these\nthere may well be some who are then making their first journey by\nrail; but in estimating the dangers of railroad traveling the much\nlarger number who are not killed or injured at all must likewise be\ntaken into consideration.Any person as he may be reading this page\nin a railroad car may be killed or injured through some accident,\neven while his eye is glancing over the figures which show how\ninfinitesimal his danger is; but the chances are none the less as a\nmillion to one that any particular reader will go down to his grave\nuninjured by any accident on the rail, unless it be occasioned by\nhis or her own carelessness.Admitting, therefore, that ill luck or hard fortune must fall to\nthe lot of certain unascertainable persons, yet the chances of\nincurring that ill fortune are so small that they are not materially\nincreased by any amount of traveling which can be accomplished\nwithin the limits of a human life.So far from exhausting a fair\naverage immunity from accident by constant traveling, the statistics\nof Massachusetts during the last eight years would seem to indicate\nthat if any given person were born upon a railroad car, and remained\nupon it traveling 500 miles a day all his life, he would, with\naverage good fortune, be somewhat over 80 years of age before he\nwould be involved in any accident resulting in his death or personal\ninjury, while he would attain the highly respectable age of 930\nyears before being killed.Even supposing that the most exceptional\naverage of the Revere year became usual, a man who was killed by\nan accident at 70 years of age should, unless he were fairly to be\naccounted unlucky, have accomplished a journey of some 440 miles\nevery day of his life, Sundays included, from the time of his birth\nto that of his death; while even to have brought him within the\nfair liability of any injury at all, his daily journey should have\nbeen some 120 miles.Under the conditions of the last eight years\nhis average daily journey through the three score years and ten to\nentitle him to be killed in an accident at the end of them would be\nabout 600 miles.THE RAILROAD DEATH RATE.In connection with the statistics of railroad casualties it is not\nwithout interest to examine the general vital statistics of some\nconsiderable city, for they show clearly enough what a large degree\nof literal truth there was in the half jocose proposition attributed\nto John Bright, that the safest place in which a man could put\nhimself was inside a first-class railroad carriage of a train in\nfull motion.Take the statistics of Boston, for instance, for the\nyear 1878.During the four years 1875-8, it will be remembered, a\nsingle passenger only was killed on the railroads of Massachusetts\nin consequence of an accident to which he by his own carelessness\nin no way contributed.[27] The average number of persons annually\ninjured, not fatally, during those years was about five.[27] This period did not include the Wollaston disaster, as the\n  Massachusetts railroad year closes on the last day of September.The\n  Wollaston disaster occurred on the 8th of October, 1878, and was\n  accordingly included in the next railroad year.Yet during the year 1878, excluding all cases of mere injury of\nwhich no account was made, no less than 53 persons came to their\ndeaths in Boston from falling down stairs, and 37 more from falling\nout of windows; seven were scalded to death in 1878 alone.In the\nyear 1874 seventeen were killed by being run over by teams in\nthe streets, while the pastime of coasting was carried on at a\ncost of ten lives more.During the five years 1874-8 there were\nmore persons murdered in the city of Boston alone than lost their\nlives as passengers through the negligence of all the railroad\ncorporations in the whole state of Massachusetts during the nine\nyears 1871-8; though in those nine years were included both the\nRevere and the Wollaston disasters, the former of which resulted\nin the death of 29, and the latter of 21 persons.Neither are the\ncomparative results here stated in any respect novel or peculiar\nto Massachusetts.Years ago it was officially announced in France\nthat people were less safe in their own houses than while traveling\non the railroads; and, in support of this somewhat startling\nproposition, statistics were produced showing fourteen cases of\ndeath of persons remaining at home and there falling over carpets,\nor, in the case of females, having their garments catch fire, to ten\ndeaths on the rail.Even the game of cricket counted eight victims\nto the railroad\'s ten.It will not, of course, be inferred that the cases of death or\ninjury to passengers from causes beyond their control include\nby any means all the casualties involved in the operation of the\nrailroad system.On the contrary, they include but a very small\nportion of them.The experience of the Massachusetts roads during\nthe seven years between September 30, 1871, and September 30,\n1878, may again be cited in reference to this point.During that\ntime there were but 52 cases of injury to passengers from causes\nover which they had no control, but in connection with the entire\nworking of the railroad system no less than 1,900 cases of injury\nwere reported, of which 1,008 were fatal; an average of 144 deaths a\nyear.Of these cases, naturally, a large proportion were employés,\nwhose occupation not only involves much necessary risk, but whose\nfamiliarity with risk causes them always to incur it even in the\nmost unnecessary and foolhardy manner.During the seven years 293\nof them were killed and 375 were reported as injured.Nor is it\nsupposed that the list included by any means all the cases of injury\nwhich occurred.About one half of the accidents to employés are\noccasioned by their falling from the trains when in motion, usually\nfrom freight trains and in cold weather, and from being crushed\nbetween cars while engaged in coupling them together.From this last\ncause alone an average of 27 casualties are annually reported.One\nfact, however, will sufficiently illustrate how very difficult it is\nto protect this class of men from danger, or rather from themselves.As is well known, on freight trains they are obliged to ride on the\ntops of the cars; but these are built so high that their roofs come\ndangerously near the bottoms of the highway bridges, which cross\nthe track sometimes in close proximity to each other.Accordingly\nmany unfortunate brakemen were killed by being knocked off the\ntrains as they passed under these bridges.With a view to affording\nthe utmost possible protection against this form of accident, a\nstatute was passed by the Massachusetts legislature compelling the\ncorporations to erect guards at a suitable distance from every\noverhead bridge which was less than eighteen feet in the clear\nabove the track.These guards were so arranged as to swing lightly\nacross the tops of the cars, giving any one standing upon them a\nsharp rap, warning him of the danger he was in.This warning rap,\nhowever, so annoyed the brakemen that the guards were on a number of\nthe roads systematically destroyed as often as they were put up; so\nthat at last another law had to be passed, making their destruction\na criminal offense.The brakemen themselves resisted the attempt\nto divest their perilous occupation of one of its most insidious\ndangers.In this respect, however, brakemen differ in no degree from the\nrest of the community.On all hands railroad accidents seem to\nbe systematically encouraged, and the wonder is that the list of\ncasualties is not larger.In Massachusetts, for instance, even in\nthe most crowded portions of the largest cities and towns, not\nonly do the railroads cross the highways at grade, but whenever new\nthoroughfares are laid out the people of the neighborhood almost\ninvariably insist upon their crossing the railroads at a grade\nand not otherwise.Not but that, upon theory and in the abstract,\nevery one is opposed to grade-crossings; but those most directly\nconcerned always claim that their particular crossing is exceptional\nin character.In vain do corporations protest and public officials\nargue; when the concrete case arises all neighborhoods become alike\nand strenuously insist on their right to incur everlasting danger\nrather than to have the level of their street broken.During the\nlast seven years to September 30, 1878, 191 persons have been\ninjured, and 98 of them fatally injured, at these crossings in\nMassachusetts, and it is certain as fate that the number is destined\nto annually increase.What the result in a remote future will be, it\nis not now easy to forecast.One thing only would seem certain: the\ntime will come when the two classes of traffic thus recklessly made\nto cross each other will at many points have to be separated, no\nmatter at what cost to the community which now challenges the danger\nit will then find itself compelled to avoid.The heaviest and most regular cause of death and injury involved\nin the operation of the railroad system yet remains to be referred\nto; and again it is recklessness which is at the root of it, and\nthis time recklessness in direct violation of law.The railroad\ntracks are everywhere favorite promenades, and apparently even\nresting-places, especially for those who are more or less drunk.In Great Britain physical demolition by a railroad train is also a\nsomewhat favorite method of committing suicide, and that, too, in\nthe most deliberate and cool-blooded manner.Cases have not been\nuncommon in which persons have been seen to coolly lay themselves\ndown in front of an advancing train, and very neatly effect their\nown decapitation by placing their necks across the rail.In England\nalone, during the last seven years, there have been no less than 280\ncases of death reported under the head of suicides, or an average\nof 40 each year, the number in 1878 rising to 60.In America these\ncases are not returned in a class by themselves.Under the general\nhead of accidents to trespassers, however, that is, accidents to\nmen, women and children, especially the latter, illegally lying,\nwalking, or playing on the tracks or riding upon the cars,--under\nthis head are regularly classified more than one third of all\nthe casualties incident to working the Massachusetts railroads.During the last seven years these have amounted to an aggregate\nof 724 cases of injury, no less than 494 of which were fatal.Of\ncourse, very many other cases of this description, which were not\nfatal, were never reported.And here again the recklessness of the\npublic has received further illustration, and this time in a very\nunpleasant way.Certain corporations operating roads terminating\nin Boston endeavored at one time to diminish this slaughter by\nenforcing the laws against walking on railroad tracks.A few\ntrespassers were arrested and fined, and then the resentment of\nthose whose wonted privileges were thus interfered with began to\nmake itself felt.Obstructions were found placed in the way of night\ntrains.The mere attempt to keep people from risking their lives\nby getting in the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of\npassengers in imminent jeopardy.Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective means of keeping\nrailroad tracks from becoming foot-paths, and thus at once putting\nan end to the largest item in the grand total of the expenditure\nof life incident to the operation of railroads, is that secured\nby the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional corollary to its\nmethod of ballasting.That superb organization, every detail of\nwhose wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all interested\nin the operation of railroads, has a roadway peculiar to itself.A principal feature in this is a surface of broken stone ballast,\ncovering not only the space between the rails, but also the interval\nbetween the tracks as well as the road-bed on the outside of each\ntrack for a distance of some three feet.It resembles nothing so\nmuch as a newly macadamized highway.That, too, is its permanent\ncondition.To walk on the sharp and uneven edges of this broken\nstone is possible, with a sufficient expenditure of patience and\nshoe-leather; but certainly no human being would ever walk there\nfrom preference, or if any other path could be found.Not only is\nit in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked upon as better than\nany other, but it confounds the tramp.Its systematic adoption in\ncrowded, suburban neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a double\npurpose.It would secure to the corporations permanent road-beds\nexclusively for their own use, and obviate the necessity of arrests\nor futile threats to enforce the penalties of the law against\ntrespassers.It seems singular that this most obvious and effective\nway of putting a stop to what is both a nuisance and a danger has\nnot yet been resorted to by men familiar with the use of spikes and\nbroken glass on the tops of fences and walls.Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate, the loss of life\nincident to the working of the railroad system is not excessive, nor\nis it out of proportion to what might reasonably be expected.It is\nto be constantly borne in mind, not only that the railroad performs\na great function in modern life, but that it also and of necessity\nperforms it in a very dangerous way.A practically irresistible\nforce crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a\nwild rate of speed, going hither and thither, across highways and\nby-ways and along a path which is in itself a thoroughfare,--such an\nagency cannot be expected to work incessantly and yet never to come\nin contact with the human frame.Naturally, however, it might be a\nvery car of Juggernaut.Is it so in fact?--To demonstrate that it\nis not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison between\nthe statistics of railroad accidents and those which necessarily\noccur in the experience of all considerable cities.Take again those\nof Boston and of the railroad system of Massachusetts.These for the\npurpose of illustration are as good as any, and in their results\nwould only be confirmed in the experience of Paris as compared with\nthe railroad system of France, or in that of London as compared with\nthe railroad system of Great Britain.During the eight years between\nSeptember 30, 1870, and September 30, 1878, the entire railroad\nsystem of Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives, apart\nfrom all cases of injury which did not prove fatal.The returns in\nthis respect also may be accepted as reasonably accurate, as the\ndeaths were all returned, though the cases of merely personal injury\nprobably were not.During the ten\nyears, 1868-78, 2,587 cases of death from accidental causes, or 259\na year, were recorded as having taken place in the city of Boston.In other words, the annual average of deaths by accident in the city\nof Boston alone exceeds that consequent on running all the railroads\nof the state by eighty per cent.Unless, therefore, the railroad\nsystem is to be considered as an exception to all other functions of\nmodern life, and as such is to be expected to do its work without\ninjury to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a very\nheavy indictment against it.AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.Up to this point, the statistics and experience of Massachusetts\nonly have been referred to.This is owing to the fact that the\nrailroad returns of that state are more carefully prepared and\ntabulated than are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,\nmore satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.The\nterritorial area from which the statistics are in this case derived\nis very limited, and it yet remains to compare the results deduced\nfrom them with those derived from the similar experience of other\ncommunities.This, however, is not an easy thing to do; and, while\nit is difficult enough as respects Europe, it is even more difficult\nas respects America taken as a whole.This last fact is especially\nunfortunate in view of the circumstance that, in regard to railway\naccidents, the United States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a\nmost undesirable reputation.Foreign authorities have a way of\nreferring to our "well-known national disregard of human life," with\na sort of complacency, at once patronizing and contemptuous, which\nis the reverse of pleasing.Judging by the tone of their comments,\nthe natural inference would be that railroad disasters of the worst\ndescription were in America matters of such frequent occurrence\nas to excite scarcely any remark.As will presently be made very\napparent, this impression, for it is only an impression, can, so\nfar as the country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved nor\ndisproved, from the absence of sufficient data from which to argue.As respects Massachusetts, however, and the same statement may\nperhaps be made of the whole belt of states north of the Potomac and\nthe Ohio, there is no basis for it.There is no reason to suppose\nthat railroad traveling is throughout that region accompanied by any\npeculiar or unusual degree of danger.The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing the results\ndeduced from equally complete statistics of different countries,\nlies in the variety of the arbitrary rules under which the\ncomputations in making them up are effected.As an example in\npoint, take the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of\nMassachusetts.They are in each case prepared with a great deal\nof care, and the results deduced from them may fairly be accepted\nas approximately correct.As respects accidents, the number of\ncases of death and of personal injury are annually reported, and\nwith tolerable completeness, though in the latter respect there is\nprobably in both cases room for improvement.The whole comparison\nturns, however, on the way in which the entire number of passengers\nannually carried is computed.In Great Britain, for instance, in\n1878, these were returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,\nand in Massachusetts at 34,000,000.By dividing these totals by\nthe number of cases of death and injury reported as occurring\nto passengers from causes beyond their control, we shall arrive\napparently at a fair comparative showing as to the relative safety\nof railroad traveling in the two communities.The result for that\nparticular year would have been that while in Great Britain one\npassenger in each 23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600\ninjured from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts none\nwere killed and only one in each 14,000,000 was in any way injured.Unfortunately, however, a closer examination reveals a very great\nerror in the computation, affecting every comparative result drawn\nfrom it.In the English returns no allowance whatever is made\nfor the very large number of journeys made by season-ticket or\ncommutation passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the contrary,\neach person of this class enters into the grand total as making two\ntrips each day, 156 trips on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on\neach annual.Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of season tickets\nwere returned by the railway companies of Great Britain.How many\nof these were quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does not\nappear.If they were all annual travelers, no less than 261,000,000\njourneys should be added to the 565,000,000 in the returns, in order\nto arrive at an equal basis for a comparison between the foreign\nand the American roads: this method, however, would be manifestly\ninaccurate, so it only remains, in the absence of all reliable data,\nand for the purpose of comparison solely, to strike out from the\nMassachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket passages, which at\nonce reduces by over 3,000,000 the number of journeys to each case\nof injury.As season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed to\ndanger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers, no result is\napproximately accurate which leaves them out of the computation.At\npresent, however, the question relates not to the positive danger or\nsafety of traveling by rail, but to its relative danger in different\ncommunities.Allowance for this discrepancy can, however, be made by adding to\nthe English official results an additional nineteen per cent., that,\naccording to the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion\nof the season-ticket to other passengers on the roads of Great\nBritain.Taking then the Board of Trade returns for the eight\nyears 1870-7, it will be found that during this period about one\npassenger in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been killed\nin railroad accidents, and about one in each 436,000 injured.This may be assumed as a fair average for purpose of comparison,\nthough it ought to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of\ncasualties to passengers shows a decided tendency to decrease, and\nduring the years 1877-8 the percentages of killed fell from one in\n15,000,000 to one in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in\n436,000 to one in 766,000.The aggregates from which these results\nare deduced are so enormous, rising into the thousands of millions,\nthat a certain degree of reliance can be placed on them.In the\ncase of Massachusetts, however, the entire period during which the\nstatistics are entitled to the slightest weight includes only eight\nyears, 1872-9, and offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys,\nor but about forty per cent.of those included in the British\nreturns of the single year 1878.During these years the killed in\nMassachusetts were one in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in\neach 1,230,000;--or, while the killed in the two cases were very\nnearly in the same proportion,--respectively one in 14.5, and one in\n13, speaking in millions,--the British injured were really three to\none of the Massachusetts.The equality as respects the killed in this comparison, and the\nmarked discrepancy as respects the injured is calculated at first\nsight to throw doubts on the fullness of the Massachusetts returns.There seems no good reason why the injured should in the one case\nbe so much more numerous than in the other.This, however, is\nsusceptible on closer examination of a very simple and satisfactory\nexplanation.In case of accident the danger of sustaining slight\npersonal injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in Great\nBritain.This is due to the heavier and more solid construction\nof the American passenger coaches, and their different interior\narrangement.This fact, and the real cause of the large number of\nslightly injured,--"shaken" they call it,--in the English railroad\naccidents is made very apparent in the following extract from Mr.Calcroft\'s report for 1877;--\n\n     "It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents to\n     railway trains are attended with less serious consequences\n     in proportion to the solidity of construction of passenger\n     carriages.The accomodation and internal arrangements of\n     third-class carriages, however, especially those used in\n     ordinary trains, are defective as regards safety and comfort,\n     as compared with many carriages of the same class on foreign\n     railways.The first-class passenger, except when thrown against\n     his opposite companion, or when some luggage falls upon him, is\n     generally saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or\n     padded linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and\n     third-class passenger is generally thrown with violence against\n     the hard wood-work.If the second and third-class carriages\n     had a high padded back lining, extending above the head of the\n     passenger, it would probably tend to lesson the danger to life\n     and limb which, as the returns of accidents show, passengers\n     in carriages of this class are much exposed to in train\n     accidents."[28]\n\n [28] _General Report to the Board of Trade upon the accidents which\n  have occurred on the Railways of the United Kingdom during the year\n  1877, p.37._\n\nIn 1878 the passenger journeys made in the second and third class\ncarriages of the United Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made\nin first class carriages;--or, expressed in millions, there were\nbut 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.There can be very little\nquestion indeed that if, during the last ten years, thirteen out\nof fourteen of the passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been\ncarried in narrow compartments with wooden seats and unlined sides\nthe number of those returned as slightly injured in the numerous\naccidents which occurred would have been at least three-fold larger\nthan it was.If it had not been ten-fold larger it would have been\nsurprising.The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply to passengers\nkilled in accidents for which they are in no degree responsible.When, however, the question reverts to the general cost in life\nand limb at which the railroad systems are worked and the railroad\ntraffic is carried on to the entire communities served, the\ncomparison is less favorable to Massachusetts.Taking the eight\nyears of 1871-8, the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,\nand 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for the same\nyears included 1,165 deaths, with only 1,044 cases of injury; in\nthe one case a total of 39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209\nthe other.It will, however be noticed that while in the British\nreturns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold those of death, in\nthe Massachusetts returns the deaths exceed the cases of injury.This fact in the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion\non the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.As a matter of\npractical experience it is well known that cases of injury almost\ninvariably exceed those of death, and the returns in which the\ndisproportion is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents\nitself, are probably the most full and reliable.Taking, therefore,\nthe deaths in the two cases as the better basis for comparison, it\nwill be found that the roads of Great Britain in the grand result\naccomplished seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts with\nless than eight times as many casualties; had the proportion between\nthe results accomplished and the fatal injuries inflicted been\nmaintained, but 536 deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in\nthe Massachusetts returns.The reason of this difference in result\nis worth looking for, and fortunately the statistical tables are\nin both cases carried sufficiently into detail to make an analysis\npossible; and this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very\nclearly that while, for those directly connected with the railroads,\neither as passengers or as employés, the Massachusetts system\nin its working involves relatively a less degree of danger than\nthat of Great Britain, yet for the outside community it involves\nvery much more.Take, for instance, the two heads of accidents\nat grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers, which have been\nalready referred to.In Great Britain highway grade-crossings\nare discouraged.The results of the policy pursued may in each case be read\nwith sufficient distinctness in the bills of mortality.During the\nyears 1872-7, of 1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of\nMassachusetts, no less than 200 occurred at highway grade crossings.Had the accidents of this description in Great Britain been equally\nnumerous in proportion to the larger volume of the traffic of that\ncountry, they would have resulted in over 3,000 cases of death or\npersonal injury; they did in fact result in 586 such cases.In\nMassachusetts, again, to walk at will on any part of a railroad\ntrack is looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable\nright of every member of the community, irrespective of age, sex,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.Accordingly, during the\nsix years referred to, this right was exercised at the cost of life\nor limb to 591 persons,--one in four of all the casualties which\noccurred in connection with the railroad system.In Great Britain\nthe custom of using the tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to\nexist, but, so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced\nin perpetual terror of the law.Accordingly, instead of some 9,000\ncases of death or injury from this cause during these six years,\nwhich would have been the proportion under like conditions in\nMassachusetts, the returns showed only 2,379.These two are among\nthe most constant and fruitful causes of accident in connection with\nthe railroad system of America.In great Britain their proportion\nto the whole number of casualties which take place is scarcely a\nseventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.Here they constitute\nvery nearly fifty per cent.of all the accidents which occur; there\nthey constitute but a little over seven.There is in this comparison\na good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if American\nlegislators would but take it in; for this is one matter the public\npolicy in regard to which can only be fixed by law.When we pass from Great Britain to the continental countries of\nEurope, the difficulties in the way of any fair comparison of\nresults become greater and greater.The statistics do not enter\nsufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation apparent.It is generally conceded that, where a due degree of caution is\nexercised by the passenger, railroad traveling in continental\ncountries is attended with a much less degree of danger than in\nEngland.When we come to the returns, they hardly bear out this\nconclusion; at least to the degree commonly supposed.Nowhere is human life more carefully guarded than in\nthat country; yet their returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers\ntransported on the French railroads during the eleven years 1859-69,\nno less than 65 were killed and 1,285 injured from causes beyond\ntheir control; or one in each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one\nin 10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every 674,000 injured\nas compared with one in each 330,000 in the other country.During\nthe single year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried\non the French lines, at a general cost to the community of 2,416\ncasualties, of which 295 were fatal.In Massachusetts, during the\nfour years 1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried, at\na reported cost of 1,158 casualties.This showing might well be\nconsidered favorable to Massachusetts did not the single fact that\nher returns included more than twice as many deaths as the French,\nwith only a quarter as many injuries, make it at once apparent that\nthe statistics were at fault.Under these circumstances comparison\ncould only be made between the numbers of deaths reported; which\nwould indicate that, in proportion to the work done, the railroad\noperations of Massachusetts involved about twice and a half more\ncases of injury to life and limb than those of the French service.Mary went to the hallway.As respects Great Britain the comparison is much more favorable, the\nreturns showing an almost exactly equal general death-rate in the\ntwo countries in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume\nof Great Britain being about four times that of France, while its\ndeath-rate by railroad accidents was as 1,100 to 295.With the exception of Belgium, however, in which country the\nreturns cover only the lines operated by the state, the basis\nhardly exists for a useful comparison between the dangers of injury\nfrom accident on the continental railroads and on those of Great\nBritain and America.The several systems are operated on wholly\ndifferent principles, to meet the needs of communities between\nwhose modes of life and thought little similarity exists.The\ncontinental trains are far less crowded than either the English or\nthe American, and, when accidents occur, fewer persons are involved\nin them.The movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation\nand at lower rates of speed, so that there is a grain of truth in\nthe English sarcasm that on a German railway "it almost seems as\nif beer-drinking at the stations were the principal business, and\ntraveling a mere accessory."Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads of Great\nBritain, it remains to be seen whether the evil reputation of the\nAmerican roads as respects accidents is wholly deserved.Is it\nindeed true that the danger to a passenger\'s life and limbs is so\nmuch greater in this country than elsewhere?--Locally, and so far\nas Massachusetts at least is concerned, it certainly is not.How\nis it with the country taken as a whole?--The lack of all reliable\nstatistics as respects this wide field of inquiry has already been\nreferred to.We do not know with\naccuracy even the number of miles of road operated; much less the\nnumber of passengers annually carried.As respects accidents, and\nthe deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some information may be\ngathered from a careful and very valuable, because the only record\nwhich has been preserved during the last six years in the columns of\nthe _Railroad Gazette_.It makes, of course, no pretence at either\nofficial accuracy or fullness, but it is as complete probably as\ncircumstances will permit of its being made.During the five years\n1874-8 there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,\nresulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of injury;--being an\naverage of 969 accidents a year, resulting in 232 deaths and 930\ncases of injury.These it will be remembered are casualties directly\nresulting either to passengers or employés from train accidents.No account is taken of injuries sustained by employés in the\nordinary operation of the roads, or by members of the community\nnot passengers.In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and\nemployés constitute one-half of the whole, but a very small portion\nof the injuries reported as sustained by either passengers or\nemployés are the consequence of train accidents,--not one in three\nin the case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.In\nfact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons reported in Massachusetts\nin the nine years 1870-8, but 271, or less than twelve per cent.,\nbelonged to the class alone included in the reports of the _Railroad\nGazette_.In England during the four years 1874-7 the proportion\nwas larger, being about twenty-five instead of twelve per cent.For\nAmerica at large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly the\nmost nearly correct, and the probabilities would seem to be that\nthe annual average of injuries to persons incident to operating the\nrailroads of the United States is not less than 10,000, of which at\nleast 1,200 are due to train accidents.Of these about two-thirds\nmay be set down as sustained by passengers, or, approximately, 800 a\nyear.It remains to be ascertained what proportion this number bears to\nthe whole number carried.There are no reliable statistics on this\nhead any more than on the other.Nothing but an approximation of\nthe most general character is possible.The number of passengers\nannually carried on the roads of a few of the states is reported\nwith more or less accuracy, and averaging these the result would\nseem to indicate that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000\npassengers annually carried on the roads of all the states.There\nis something barbarous about such an approximation, and it is\ndisgraceful that at this late day we should in America be forced\nto estimate the passenger movement on our railroads in much the\nsame way that we guess at the population of Africa.We are in this respect far in the rear of civilized\ncommunities.Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation\nto our present annual passenger movement, it will be observed that\nit is as nearly as may be half that of Great Britain.In Great\nBritain, in 1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from\naccidents to trains, and 675 in 1877.The average of the last eight\nyears has been 1,226.If, therefore, the approximation of 800 a\nyear for America is at all near the truth, the percentage would seem\nto be considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics\nof Great Britain.Meanwhile it is to be noted that while in Great\nBritain about 25 cases of injury are reported to each one of death,\nin America but four cases are reported to each death--a discrepancy\nwhich is extremely suggestive.Perhaps, however, the most valuable\nconclusion to be drawn from these figures is that in America we as\nyet are absolutely without any reliable railroad statistics on this\nsubject at all.Taken as a whole, however, and under the most favorable showing,\nit would seem to be a matter of fair inference that the dangers\nincident to railroad traveling are materially greater in the United\nStates than in any country of Europe.How much greater is a question\nwholly impossible to answer.So that when a statistical writer\nundertakes to show, as one eminent European authority has done, that\nin a given year on the American roads one passenger in every 286,179\nwas killed, and one in every 90,737 was injured, it is charitable\nto suppose that in regard to America only is he indebted to his\nimagination for his figures.Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory degree of\nprecision the nature of the accidents in the two countries, with\na view to drawing inferences from them.Without attempting to do\nso it maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports for the\nlast five years, 1874-8, include inquiries into 755 out of 11,585\naccidents, the total number of every description reported as having\ntaken place.Meanwhile the _Railroad Gazette_ contains mention of\n4,846 reported train accidents which occurred in America during\nthe same five years.Of these accidents, 1,310 in America and 81\nin Great Britain were due to causes which were either unexplained\nor of a miscellaneous character, or are not common to the systems\nof the two countries.In so far as the remainder admitted of\nclassification, it was somewhat as follows:--\n\n                                   GREAT BRITAIN.Accidents due to\n\n    Defects in permanent way

                              2  "   "\n\n  [29] During these five years there were in Great Britain four cases\n  of collision between locomotives or trains at level crossings of one\n  railroad by another; in America there were 79.The probable cause of\n  this discrepancy has already been referred to (_ante pp.The above record, though almost valueless for any purpose of exact\ncomparison, reveals, it will be noticed, one salient fact.Out of\n755 English accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of\ncollisions--whether head collisions, rear collisions, or collisions\non sidings or at junctions.In other words, to collisions of some\nsort between trains were due considerably more than half (54 per\ncent.)of the accidents which took place in Great Britain, while\nonly 88, or less than 13 per cent.of the whole, were due to\nderailments from all causes.In America on the other hand, while\nof the 3,763 accidents recorded, 1,324, or but one-third part (35\nper cent.)were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per\ncent., were classed under the head of derailments, due to defects\nin the permanent way.During the the six years 1873-8 there were\nin all 1698 cases of collision of every description between trains\nreported as occurring in America to 1495 in the United Kingdom; but\nwhile in America the derailments amounted to no less than 4016, or\nmore than twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they were\nbut 817, or a little more than half their number.It has already\nbeen noticed that the most disastrous accidents in America are apt\nto occur on bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest\nthemselves.Under the heading\nof "Failures of Tunnels, Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there\nwere returned in that country during the six years 1873-8 only 29\naccidents in all; while during the same time in America, under the\nheads of broken bridges or tressels and open draws, the _Gazette_\nrecorded no less than 165.These figures curiously illustrate the\ndifferent manner in which the railroads of the two countries have\nbeen constructed, and the different circumstances under which they\nare operated.The English collisions are distinctly traceable to\nconstant overcrowding; the American derailments and bridge accidents\nto inferior construction of our road-beds.Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish the dangers\nof the rail?--What more can be done?--Few persons realize what a\ntremendous pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down upon\nthose whose business it is to operate railroads.A great accident is\nnot only a terrible blow to the pride and prestige of a corporation,\nnot only does it practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved\nin it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.Juries\nproverbially have little mercy for railroad corporations, and, when\na disaster comes, these have practically no choice but to follow the\nscriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries quickly.The\nRevere catastrophe, for instance, cost the railroad company liable\non account of it over half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula\naccident over $600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000.A few years ago\nin England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for damages sustained\nthrough the death of a single individual.During the five years,\n1867-71, the railroad corporations of Great Britain paid out over\n$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned by accidents.In\nview, merely, of such money consequences of disaster, it would be\nmost unnatural did not each new accident lead to the adoption of\nbetter appliances to prevent its recurrence.[30]\n\n  [30] The other side of this proposition has been argued with\n  much force by Mr.William Galt in his report as one of the Royal\n  Commission of 1874 on Railway Accidents.Galt\'s individual\n  report bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as\n  a matter of actual experience, the principle of self-interest on\n  the part of the railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient\n  safeguard against accidents.However it may be in theory, he\n  contends that, taking into consideration the great cost of the\n  appliances necessary to insure safety to the public on the one side,\n  and the amount of damages incident to a certain degree of risk on\n  the other side, the possible saving in expenditure to the companies\n  by assuming the risk far exceeds the loss incurred by an occasional\n  accident.The companies become, in a word, insurers of their\n  passengers,--the premium being found in the economies effected by\n  not adopting improved appliances of recognized value, and the losses\n  being the damages incurred in case of accident.He treats the whole\n  subject at great length and with much knowledge and ability.His\n  report is a most valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a\n  closer government supervision over railroads as a means of securing\n  an increased safety from accident.To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents, and the\nfinal conclusion to be drawn from the statistics which have been\npresented.That conclusion briefly stated is that the charges of\nrecklessness and indifference so generally and so widely advanced\nagainst those managing the railroads cannot for an instant be\nsustained.After all, as was said in the beginning of the present\nvolume, it is not the danger but the safety of the railroad which\nshould excite our special wonder.If any one doubts this, it is\nvery easy to satisfy himself of the fact,--that is, if by nature\nhe is gifted with the slightest spark of imagination.It is but\nnecessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station and to\nlook at an express train dashing by.There are few sights finer;\nfew better calculated to quicken the pulse.The glare of the head-light, the rush and throb of the\nlocomotive,--the connecting rod and driving-wheels of which seem\ninstinct with nervous life,--the flashing lamps in the cars, and\nthe final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish almost\nas soon as they are seen,--all this is well calculated to excite\nour admiration; but the special and unending cause for wonder is\nhow, in case of accident, anything whatever is left of the train.As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable\nthat something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must\nnecessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter\nand irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the\nneighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth\nat a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two\nslender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how\nwhen, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like\nthis was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned\nfor himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should\nas soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon\none of Congreve\'s _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the\nmercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham\nexclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen\nmiles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they\nwrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer\nand correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the\nfirst nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of\nimagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into\nan immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the\nless a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the\nday and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement\nis going on.It depends for its even action\non every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance\nof thousands of employés to the condition of the atmosphere, the\nheat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in\nconstant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of\nconditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of\nmovement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,\nof the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their\nlives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing\nat once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the\nintricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more\ncreditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight\nthan the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele,

and at last, "Yes."For some time he read to\nhimself, nodding."Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?""Take," the padre ordered, "this one; left half?""The right half--might be\n\'rice-scoop,\' But that\'s nonsense."Subtract this twisted character \'Lightning\' from each, and we\'ve made\nthe crooked straight.Here\'s the\nsense of his message, I take it."And he read off, slowly:--\n\n"A Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted\nat her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come\nquickly, day or night.--O.W.""That won\'t help," he said curtly.With the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured\nout on the highest slab of the landing-steps.Across the river, to be\nsure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the\nnorth--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny\nbasket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a\ngreen rag.Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless,\nyet seeming to watch.Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to\nwhere, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the\nmarsh.On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up\nlike a thin black toadstool.He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry,\nsummoning help from further inland.Other hats presently came bobbing\ntoward him, low down among the marsh.Puffs of white spurted out from\nthe mud.And as Heywood dodged back through the gate, and Nesbit\'s rifle\nanswered from his little fort on the pony-shed, the distant crack of the\nmuskets joined with a spattering of ooze and a chipping of stone on the\nriver-stairs."Covered, you see," said Heywood, replacing the bar."Last resort,\nperhaps, that way.Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood\nready here."The shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a\nsignal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the\nnoise of last night broke out afresh.The sun lowered through a brown,\nburnt haze, the night sped up from the ocean, covering the sky with\nsudden darkness, in which stars appeared, many and cool, above the\ntorrid earth and the insensate turmoil.So, without change but from\npause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in\nthe siege.One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt\narrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust.The\npaper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and\nheel-prints: "Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely."And still\nnothing happened to explain the warning.That night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate\nwith four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close\nunder the wall, and would soon become intolerable.He had returned\nsafely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt,\nand a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the\ndefenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under\nwhat in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was\nKempner\'s grave.He was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and\nmade him stoop."I was coming," he said, "to find you.The first night, I saw coolies\nworking in the clay-pit."They\'re keeping such a racket outside," he muttered; and then, half to\nhimself: "It certainly is.Rudie, it\'s--it\'s as if poor Kempner\nwere--waking up."The two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight.CHAPTER XIX\n\n\nBROTHER MOLES\n\nThis new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph\ninto a state of sullen resignation.What was the use now, he thought\nindignantly, of all their watching and fighting?The ground, at any\nmoment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot.He waited for his\nfriend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words.Instead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary."Now we know what\nthe beasts have up their sleeve.He sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a\nBuddha."That\'s why they\'ve all been lying doggo," he continued."And then their\nbad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don\'t care, you see,\nwhether they pot us or not.They\'d rather make one clean sweep, and\n\'blow us at the moon.\'Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they\'re digging,\nthey\'re not blowing.While he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last\ngiving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices.In this\ndiluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark\nhospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials."If it weren\'t for that," he said quietly, "I shouldn\'t much care.Except for the women, this would really be great larks."Then, as a\nshadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: "Ah\nPat!Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!"The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other\nshadows.They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust."Those noises have stopped, down there," he said to Rudolph; and rising,\ngave his orders briefly.The coolies were to dig, strike into the\nsappers\' tunnel, and report at once: "Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let\'s\ntake a holiday.A solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast\nfaint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with\nwater from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness.Heywood\nstooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely\ninto a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content."Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the\ncompradore reports.For a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep.Through the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken\nshadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the\nstars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling.The flutter of his\nleathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still\ndrenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne,\nbroken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a\nbullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers."Queer," mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch."The beggar puts\none shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he\'s\nthinking about?Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts.Wonder what they\'re all"--He put back his cigar, mumbling."Handful of\npoor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round.And all\nthe rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same\nold way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams\nthey had in Marco Polo\'s day."The end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he\nmight have been asleep.Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking.This\nbrief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there\nand wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge.Some quiet\ninfluence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him.It was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more.He had\nfelt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in\nclearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any\nlater harm.With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were\nbrightly interwoven.For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait,\na single comrade in a happy army.Through a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving\nquietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place.Her hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady\nfingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass.With dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent\nMedea, intent on some white magic."Aren\'t you coming," called Heywood, "to sit with us awhile?""Can\'t, thanks," she replied, without looking up.She moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled\nback at him as from a crypt, and said:--\n\n"Have _you_ been hurt?""I\'ve no time," she laughed, "for lazy able-bodied persons."And she was\ngone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men.With her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another\nfigure, scuffing slowly toward the light.The compradore, his robes lost\nin their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with\ndownward sweep.The two friends rose, and followed him down the\ncourtyard.In passing out, they discovered the padre\'s wife lying\nexhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all\nthe width.Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to\nwhich Rudolph caught the answer.Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly.I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith."Earle," said the young man, gently, "there ought to be no\nneed.Under the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph\'s arm, and\nhalting, shook with quiet merriment.Loose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised\nmound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night.Kempner\'s grave had not been quieter.The compradore stood whispering:\nthey had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were\ngone out to eat their chow."We\'ll see, anyway," said Heywood, stripping off his coat.He climbed\nover the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared.In the long\nmoment which followed, the earth might have closed on him.Once, as\nRudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint\nmomentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and\nshoulders burrowed up again."Big enough hole down there," he reported, swinging clear, and sitting\nwith his feet in the shaft.Three sacks of powder stowed\nalready, so we\'re none too soon.--One sack was leaky.I struck a match,\nand nearly blew myself to Casabianca.""It\ngives us a plan, though.Rudie: are you game for something rather\nfoolhardy?Be frank, now; for if you wouldn\'t really enjoy it, I\'ll give\nold Gilly Forrester his chance."said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy.This is all ours, this part, so!"Give me half a\nmoment start, so that you won\'t jump on my head."And he went wriggling\ndown into the pit.An unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness,\nenveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping,\ncrawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel.Large enough, perhaps,\nfor two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut,\nthrough earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth\nfloor by many hands and bare knees.In\nthe small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he\nbumped Heywood\'s elbow."Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say."The speaker\npatted the ground with quick palms, groping.This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow.I say, Rudie, feel\nabout.I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it\nwas."How\'s the old forearm I gave you?Equal to hauling a\nsack out?Sweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph\'s, and guided it\nto where a powder-bag lay."Now, then, carry on," he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel,\nflung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load."Carry\nthese out--far as we dare--touch \'em off, you see, and block the\npassage.We can use this hole afterward,\nfor listening in, if they try--"\n\nHe cut the sentence short.Their tunnel had begun to <DW72> gently\ndownward, with niches gouged here and there for the passing of\nburden-bearers.Rudolph, toiling after, suddenly found his head\nentangled between his leader\'s boots.An odd little squeak of\nsurprise followed, a strange gurgling, and a succession of rapid shocks,\nas though some one were pummeling the earthen walls."Got the beggar," panted Heywood.Roll clear, Rudie,\nand let us pass.Collar his legs, if you can, and shove."Squeezing past Rudolph in his niche, there struggled a convulsive bulk,\nlike some monstrous worm, too large for the bore, yet writhing.Bare\nfeet kicked him in violent rebellion, and a muscular knee jarred\nsquarely under his chin.He caught a pair of naked legs, and hugged\nthem dearly."Not too hard," called Heywood, with a breathless laugh."Poor\ndevil--must think he ran foul of a genie."Indeed, their prisoner had already given up the conflict, and lay under\nthem with limbs dissolved and quaking."Pass him along," chuckled his captor.Prodded into action, the man stirred limply, and crawled past them\ntoward the mine, while Heywood, at his heels, growled orders in the\nvernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity.In this order they gained\nthe shaft, and wriggled up like ferrets into the night air.Rudolph,\nstanding as in a well, heard a volley of questions and a few timid\nanswers, before the returning legs of his comrade warned him to dodge\nback into the tunnel.Again the two men crept forward on their expedition; and this time the\nleader talked without lowering his voice."That chap," he declared, "was fairly chattering with fright.Coolie, it\nseems, who came back to find his betel-box.The rest are all outside\neating their rice.They stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at\nfirst easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously\nup a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came\nhard in the stifled burrow."Far enough," said Heywood, puffing.Rudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new\nspirit, a spirit of daring.He would try, down here in the bowels of the\nearth, to emulate his friend."But let us reconnoitre," he objected."It will bring us to the clay-pit\nwhere I saw them digging.Let us go out to the end, and look."By his tone, he was proud of the amendment.I say, I didn\'t really--I didn\'t _want_ poor old\nGilly down here, you know."Sandra travelled to the bathroom.They crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait\nlittle gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay.Suddenly, as the incline once more became a level, they saw a glimmering\nsquare of dusky red, like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet\ncloth.This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader,\nuntil they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut\nportal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with\nwhat seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers.Between\nshadowy mounds of loose earth flickered the light of a fire, small and\ndistant, round which wavered the inky silhouettes of men, and beyond\nwhich dimly shone a yellow face or two, a yellow fist clutched full of\nboiled rice like a snowball.Beyond these, in turn, gleamed other little\nfires, where other coolies were squatting at their supper.Heywood\'s voice trembled with joyful excitement."Look,\nthese bags; not sand-bags at all!Wait a bit--oh, by Jove, wait a bit!"He scurried back into the hill like a great rat, returned as quickly and\nswiftly, and with eager hands began to uncoil something on the clay\nthreshold."Do you know enough to time a fuse?""Neither do I.\nPowder\'s bad, anyhow.Here, quick, lend me a\nknife."He slashed open one of the lower sacks in the bulkhead by the\ndoor, stuffed in some kind of twisted cord, and, edging away, sat for an\ninstant with his knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight."How long,\nRudie, how long?""Too long, or too short, spoils\neverything."Now lie across," he ordered, "and shield the tandstickor."With a\nsudden fuff, the match blazed up to show his gray eyes bright and\ndancing, his face glossy with sweat; below, on the golden clay, the\ntwisted, lumpy tail of the fuse, like the end of a dusty vine.Darkness\nfollowed, quick and blinding.A rosy, fitful coal sputtered, darting out\nshort capillary lines and needles of fire.If it blows up, and caves the earth on\nus--" Heywood ran on hands and knees, as if that were his natural way of\ngoing.Rudolph scrambled after, now urged by an ecstasy of apprehension,\nnow clogged as by the weight of all the hill above them.If it should\nfall now, he thought, or now; and thus measuring as he crawled, found\nthe tunnel endless.When at last, however, they gained the bottom of the shaft, and were\nhoisted out among their coolies on the shelving mound, the evening\nstillness lay above and about them, undisturbed.The fuse could never\nhave lasted all these minutes."Gone out," said Heywood, gloomily.He climbed the bamboo scaffold, and stood looking over the wall.Rudolph\nperched beside him,--by the same anxious, futile instinct of curiosity,\nfor they could see nothing but the night and the burning stars.Underground again, Rudie, and try our first plan.""The Sword-Pen looks to set off his mine\nto-morrow morning."He clutched the wall in time to save himself, as the bamboo frame leapt\nunderfoot.Outside, the crest of the <DW72> ran black against a single\nburst of flame.The detonation came like the blow of a mallet on\nthe ribs.Heywood jumped to the ground, and in a\npelting shower of clods, exulted:--\n\n\n"He looked again, and saw it was\nThe middle of next week!"He ran off, laughing, in the wide hush of astonishment.CHAPTER XX\n\n\nTHE HAKKA BOAT\n\n"Pretty fair," Captain Kneebone said.This grudging praise--in which, moreover, Heywood tamely acquiesced--was\nhis only comment.On Rudolph it had singular effects: at first filling\nhim with resentment, and almost making him suspect the little captain of\njealousy; then amusing him, as chance words of no weight; but in the\nunreal days that followed, recurring to convince him with all the force\nof prompt and subtle fore-knowledge.It helped him to learn the cold,\nsalutary lesson, that one exploit does not make a victory.The springing of their countermine, he found, was no deliverance.It had\ntwo plain results, and no more: the crest of the high field, without,\nhad changed its contour next morning as though a monster had bitten it;\nand when the day had burnt itself out in sullen darkness, there burst on\nall sides an attack of prolonged and furious exasperation.The fusillade\nnow came not only from the landward sides, but from a long flotilla of\nboats in the river; and although these vanished at dawn, the fire never\nslackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly\nspotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down.On the night\nfollowing, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded\nwith the blows of battering-rams.By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet\nthe little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven\nhead was trimmed still closer and redder by a bullet, and for Gilbert\nForrester, who showed--with the grave smile of a man when fates are\nplayful--two shots through his loose jacket.He was the only man to smile; for the others, parched by days and\nsweltered by nights of battle, questioned each other with hollow eyes\nand sleepy voices.One at a time, in patches of hot shade, they lay\ntumbled for a moment of oblivion, their backs studded thickly with\nobstinate flies like the driven heads of nails.As thickly, in the dust,\nempty Mauser cartridges lay glistening."And I bought food," mourned the captain, chafing the untidy stubble on\nhis cheeks, and staring gloomily down at the worthless brass."I bought\nchow, when all Saigong was full o\' cartridges!"The sight of the spent ammunition at their feet gave them more trouble\nthan the swarming flies, or the heat, or the noises tearing and\nsplitting the heat.Even Heywood went about with a hang-dog air,\nspeaking few words, and those more and more surly.Once he laughed, when\nat broad noonday a line of queer heads popped up from the earthwork on\nthe knoll, and stuck there, tilted at odd angles, as though peering\nquizzically.Both his laugh, however, and his one stare of scrutiny were\nfilled with a savage contempt,--contempt not only for the stratagem, but\nfor himself, the situation, all things."Dummies--lay figures, to draw our fire.he added, wearily "we couldn\'t waste a shot at \'em now even if they\nwere real."They knew, without being told,\nthat they should fire no more until at close quarters in some\nfinal rush."Only a few more rounds apiece," he continued."Our friends outside must\nhave run nearly as short, according to the coolie we took prisoner in\nthe tunnel.But they\'ll get more supplies, he says, in a day or two.What\'s worse, his Generalissimo Fang expects big reinforcement, any day,\nfrom up country."Perhaps he\'s lying," said Captain Kneebone, drowsily."Wish he were," snapped Heywood."That case," grumbled the captain, "we\'d better signal your Hakka boat,\nand clear out."Again their hollow eyes questioned each other in discouragement.It was\nplain that he had spoken their general thought; but they were all too\nhot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety.Thus, in stupor or\ndoubt, they watched another afternoon burn low by invisible degrees,\nlike a great fire dying.Another breathless evening settled over all--at\nfirst with a dusty, copper light, widespread, as though sky and land\nwere seen through smoked glass; another dusk, of deep, sad blue; and\nwhen this had given place to night, another mysterious lull.Midnight drew on, and no further change had come.Mary went to the garden.Prowlers, made bold by\nthe long silence in the nunnery, came and went under the very walls of\nthe compound.In the court, beside a candle, Ah Pat the compradore sat\nwith a bundle of halberds and a whetstone, sharpening edge after edge,\nplacidly, against the time when there should be no more cartridges.Heywood and Rudolph stood near the water gate, and argued with Gilbert\nForrester, who would not quit his post for either of them."But I\'m not sleepy," he repeated, with perverse, irritating serenity.And that river full of their boats?--Go away."While they reasoned and wrangled, something scraped the edge of the\nwall.They could barely detect a small, stealthy movement above them, as\nif a man, climbing, had lifted his head over the top.Suddenly, beside\nit, flared a surprising torch, rags burning greasily at the end of a\nlong bamboo.The smoky, dripping flame showed no man there, but only\nanother long bamboo, impaling what might be another ball of rags.The\ntwo poles swayed, inclined toward each other; for one incredible instant\nthe ball, beside its glowing fellow, shone pale and took on human\nfeatures.Black shadows filled the eye-sockets, and gave to the face an\nuncertain, cavernous look, as though it saw and pondered.How long the apparition stayed, the three men could not tell; for even\nafter it vanished, and the torch fell hissing in the river, they stood\nbelow the wall, dumb and sick, knowing only that they had seen the head\nof Wutzler.Heywood was the first to make a sound--a broken, hypnotic sound, without\nemphasis or inflection, as though his lips were frozen, or the words\ntorn from him by ventriloquy."We must get the women--out of here."Afterward, when he was no longer with them, his two friends recalled\nthat he never spoke again that night, but came and went in a kind of\nsilent rage, ordering coolies by dumb-show, and carrying armful after\narmful of supplies to the water gate.The word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must\nhold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile\nboats should leave the river."If," said Gilly to Rudolph, while they\nstood thinking under the stars, "if his boat is still there, now that\nhe--after what we saw."At dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river\non the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the\nfarther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag\nand the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat.Even then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed\nout--that her sailors would keep their agreement.And when he had piled,\non the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty\nrose.One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but\nthe other would never be ferried down any stream known to man.He lay\ndying, and the padre could not leave him.All the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because\ndeath, never punctual, now kept them waiting.The flutter of birds,\namong the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over\nthe eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and\nblurred through the dancing heat.A torrid westerly breeze came\nfitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse."Next we\'ll lose the ebb, too, be\n\'anged."Noon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the\ncourtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet."We may go now," he said gravely, "in a few minutes."No more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their\ncounter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered.Captain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and\nlighted the fire on the steps.But not one of the burial party turned\nhis head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as\nthe padre\'s resonant bass continued.When it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove.The captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to\nsee through the smoke that poured into his face.The Hakka boat had, indeed, vanished from her moorings.On the bronze\ncurrent, nothing moved but three fishing-boats drifting down, with the\nsmoke, toward the marsh and the bend of the river, and a small junk that\ntoiled up against wind and tide, a cluster of naked sailors tugging and\nshoving at her heavy sweep, which chafed its rigging of dry rope, and\ngave out a high, complaining note like the cry of a sea-gull."She\'s gone," repeated Captain Kneebone.But the compradore, dragging his bundle of sharp halberds, poked an\ninquisitive head out past the captain\'s, and peered on all sides through\nthe smoke, with comical thoroughness.He dodged back, grinning and\nducking amiably."Moh bettah look-see," he chuckled; "dat coolie come-back, he too muchee\nwaitee, b\'long one piecee foolo-man."Whoever handled the Hakka boat was no fool, but by working\nupstream on the opposite shore, crossing above, and dropping down with\nthe ebb, had craftily brought her along the shallow, so close beneath\nthe river-wall, that not till now did even the little captain spy her.The high prow, the mast, now bare, and her round midships roof, bright\ngolden-thatched with leaves of the edible bamboo, came moving quiet as\nsome enchanted boat in a calm.The fugitives by the gate still thought\nthemselves abandoned, when her beak, six feet in air, stole past them,\nand her lean boatmen, prodding the river-bed with their poles, stopped\nher as easily as a gondola.The yellow steersman grinned, straining at\nthe pivot of his gigantic paddle."Remember _you_ in my will, too!"And the grinning lowdah nodded, as though he understood.They had now only to pitch their supplies through the smoke, down on the\nloose boards of her deck.Then--Rudolph and the captain kicking the\nbonfire off the stairs--the whole company hurried down and safely over\nher gunwale: first the two women, then the few huddling converts, the\nwhite men next, the compradore still hugging his pole-axes, and last of\nall, Heywood, still in strange apathy, with haggard face and downcast\neyes.He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm,\nand in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling,\nnervous and wide awake.He looked to neither right nor left, met nobody\'s eye.The rest of the\ncompany crowded into the house amidships, and flung themselves down\nwearily in the grateful dusk, where vivid paintings and mysteries of\nrude carving writhed on the fir bulkheads.But Heywood, with his dog and\nthe captain and Rudolph, sat in the hot sun, staring down at the\nramshackle deck, through the gaps in which rose all the stinks of the\nsweating hold.The boatmen climbed the high slant of the bow, planted their stout\nbamboos against their shoulders, and came slowly down, head first, like\nstraining acrobats.As slowly, the boat began to glide past the stairs.Thus far, though the fire lay scattered in the mud, the smoke drifted\nstill before them and obscured their silent, headlong transaction.Now,\nthinning as they dropped below the corner of the wall, it left them\nnaked to their enemies on the knoll.At the same instant, from the marsh\nahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an\ninstantaneous mushroom.He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland.They had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole\nchance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn.Heywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing.The face of his friend, by torchlight above the\nwall, had struck him dumb.Now that he spoke, his companions saw,\nexposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a\nframework as on a bier.Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass.Above, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to\nscramble at the sentinel\'s halloo, there sat on a white pony the\nbright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen.Heywood\'s hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of\ncontrol."Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom--\nPoussin\'s picture in the Vatican.--I can\'t stand this, you chaps!"He snatched blindly at his gun, caught instead one of the compradore\'s\nhalberds, and without pause or warning, jumped out into the shallow\nwater.He ran splashing toward the bank, turned, and seemed to waver,\nstaring with wild eyes at the strange Tudor weapon in his hand.Then\nshaking it savagely,--\n\n"This will do!"He wheeled again, staggered to his feet on dry ground, and ran swiftly\nalong the eastern wall, up the rising field, straight toward his mark.Of the men on the knoll, a few fired and missed, the others, neutrals to\ntheir will, stood fixed in wonder.Four or five, as the runner neared,\nsprang out to intercept, but flew apart like ninepins.The watchers in\nthe boat saw the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun, the\nfrightened pony swerve, and his rider go down with the one sweep of that\nHomeric blow.The last they saw of Heywood, he went leaping from sight over the\ncrest, that swarmed with figures racing and stumbling after.The unheeded sentinel in the marsh fled, losing his great hat, as the\nboat drifted round the point into midstream.CHAPTER XXI\n\n\nTHE DRAGON\'S SHADOW\n\nThe lowdah would have set his dirty sails without delay, for the fair\nwind was already drooping; but at the first motion he found himself\ndeposed, and a usurper in command, at the big steering-paddle.Captain\nKneebone, his cheeks white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble\nof his beard, had taken charge.In momentary danger of being cut off\ndownstream, or overtaken from above, he kept the boat waiting along the\noozy shore.Puckering his eyes, he watched now the land, and now the\nriver, silent, furtive, and keenly perplexed, his head on a swivel, as\nthough he steered by some nightmare chart, or expected some instant and\ntransforming sight.Not until the sun touched the western hills, and long shadows from the\nbank stole out and turned the stream from bright copper to vague\niron-gray, did he give over his watch.He left the tiller, with a\nhopeless fling of the arm."Do as ye please," he growled, and cast himself down on deck by the\nthatched house."Go on.--I\'ll never see _him_ again.--The heat, and\nall--By the head, he was--Go on.He sat looking straight before him, with dull eyes that never moved;\nnor did he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the matting sail, slowly\nhoisted above him.The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly\nastern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the\nwind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:--\n\n\n"Ay-ly-chy-ly\nAh-ha-aah!"To the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long,\nmonotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts.Through the rhythm, presently,\nbroke a sound of small-arms,--a few shots, quick but softened by\ndistance, from far inland.The captain stirred, listened, dropped his head, and sat like stone.To\nRudolph, near him, the brief disturbance called up another evening--his\nfirst on this same river, when from the grassy brink, above, he had\nfirst heard of his friend.Now, at the same place, and by the same\nlight, they had heard the last.It was intolerable: he turned his back\non the captain.Inside, in the gloom of the painted cabin, the padre\'s\nwife began suddenly to cry.After a time, the deep voice of her husband,\nspeaking very low, and to her alone, became dimly audible:--\n\n"\'All this is come upon us; yet have we not--Our heart is not turned\nback, neither have our steps declined--Though thou hast sore broken us\nin the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.\'"The little captain groaned, and rolled aside from the doorway."All very fine," he muttered, his head wrapped in his arms."But that\'s\nno good to me.Whether she heard him, or by chance, Miss Drake came quietly from\nwithin, and found a place between him and the gunwale.He did not rouse;\nshe neither glanced nor spoke, but leaned against the ribs of\nsmooth-worn fir, as though calmly waiting.When at last he looked up, to see her face and posture, he gave an angry\nstart."And I thought," he blurted, "be \'anged if sometimes I didn\'t think you\nliked him!"Her dark eyes met the captain\'s with a great and steadfast clearness."No," she whispered; "it was more than that."The captain sat bolt upright, but no longer in condemnation.For a long\ntime he watched her, marveling; and when finally he spoke, his sharp,\ndomineering voice was lowered, almost gentle.I never\nmeant--Don\'t ye mind a rough old beggar, that don\'t know that hasn\'t one\nthing more between him and the grave.And that,\nnow--I wish\'t was at the bottom o\' this bloomin\' river!"They said no more, but rested side by side, like old friends joined\ncloser by new grief.Flounce, the terrier, snuffing disconsolately about\nthe deck, and scratching the boards in her zeal to explore the shallow\nhold, at last grew weary, and came to snuggle down between the two\nsilent companions.Not till then did the girl turn aside her face, as\nthough studying the shore, which now melted in a soft, half-liquid band\nas black as coal-tar, above the luminous indigo of the river.Suddenly Rudolph got upon his feet, and craning outboard from gunwale\nand thatched eaves, looked steadily forward into the dusk.A chatter of\nangry voices came stealing up, in the pauses of the wind.He watched and\nlistened, then quickly drew in his head.Two or three of the voices hailed together, raucously.The steersman,\nleaning on the loom of his paddle, made neither stir nor answer.They\nhailed again, this time close aboard, and as it seemed, in rage.Glancing contemptuously to starboard, the lowdah made some negligent\nreply, about a cargo of human hair.His indifference appeared so real,\nthat for a moment Rudolph suspected him: perhaps he had been bought\nover, and this meeting arranged.The\nvoices began to drop astern, and to come in louder confusion with\nthe breeze.But at this point Flounce, the terrier, spoiled all by whipping up\nbeside the lowdah, and furiously barking.Hers was no pariah\'s yelp: she\nbarked with spirit, in the King\'s English.For answer, there came a shout, a sharp report, and a bullet that ripped\nthrough the matting sail.The steersman ducked, but clung bravely to his\npaddle.Men tumbled out from the cabin, rifles in hand, to join Rudolph\nand the captain.Astern, dangerously near, they saw the hostile craft, small, but listed\nheavily with crowding ruffians, packed so close that their great wicker\nhats hung along the gunwale to save room, and shone dim in the obscurity\nlike golden shields of vikings.A squat, burly fellow, shouting, jammed\nthe yulow hard to bring her about."Save your fire," called Captain Kneebone.As he spoke, however, an active form bounced up beside the squat man at\nthe sweep,--a plump, muscular little barefoot woman in blue.She tore\nthe fellow\'s hands away, and took command, keeping the boat\'s nose\npointed up-river, and squalling ferocious orders to all on board.This small, nimble, capable creature\ncould be no one but Mrs.Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning,\nlong ago....\n\nThe squat man gave an angry shout, and turned on her to wrest away the\nhandle.With great violence, yet with a\nneat economy of motion, the Pretty Lily took one hand from her tiller,\nlong enough to topple him overboard with a sounding splash.Her passengers, at so prompt and visual a joke, burst into shrill,\ncackling laughter.Yet more shrill, before their mood could alter, the\nPretty Lily scourged them with the tongue of a humorous woman.She held\nher course, moreover; the two boats drifted so quickly apart that when\nshe turned, to fling a comic farewell after the white men, they could no\nmore than descry her face, alert and comely, and the whiteness of her\nteeth.Her laughing cry still rang, the overthrown leader still\nfloundered in the water, when the picture blurred and vanished.Down the\nwind came her words, high, voluble, quelling all further mutiny aboard\nthat craft of hers.The tall padre eyed Rudolph with sudden interest,\nand laid his big hand on the young man\'s shoulder."No," answered Rudolph, and shook his head, sadly."We owe that to--some\none else."Later, while they drifted down to meet the sea and the night, he told\nthe story, to which all listened with profound attention, wondering at\nthe turns of fortune, and at this last service, rendered by a friend\nthey should see no more.They murmured awhile, by twos and threes huddled in corners; then lay\nsilent, exhausted in body and spirit.The river melted with the shore\ninto a common blackness, faintly hovered over by the hot, brown, sullen\nevening.Unchallenged, the Hakka boat flitted past the lights of a\nwar-junk, so close that the curved lantern-ribs flickered thin and sharp\nagainst a smoky gleam, and tawny faces wavered, thick of lip and stolid\nof eye, round the supper fire.A greasy, bitter smell of cooking floated\nafter.Then no change or break in the darkness, except a dim lantern or\ntwo creeping low in a sampan, with a fragment of talk from unseen\npassers; until, as the stars multiplied overhead, the night of the land\nrolled heavily astern and away from another, wider night, the stink of\nthe marshes failed, and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and\nsea-room, the voyagers knew that they had gained the roadstead.Ahead,\nfar off and lustrous, a new field of stars hung scarce higher than\ntheir gunwale, above the rim of the world.The lowdah showed no light; and presently none was needed, for--as the\nshallows gave place to deeps--the ocean boiled with the hoary,\ngreen-gold magic of phosphorus, that heaved alongside in soft explosions\nof witch-fire, and sent uncertain smoky tremors playing through the\ndarkness on deck.Rudolph, watching this tropic miracle, could make out\nthe white figure of the captain, asleep near by, under the faint\nsemicircle of the deck-house; and across from him, Miss Drake, still\nsitting upright, as though waiting, with Flounce at her side.Landward,\nagainst the last sage-green vapor of daylight, ran the dim range of the\nhills, in long undulations broken by sharper crests, like the finny back\nof leviathan basking.Over there, thought Rudolph, beyond that black shape as beyond its\nguarding dragon, lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire, with\nuncounted lives going on, ending, beginning, as though he, and his sore\nloss, and his heart vacant of all but grief, belonged to some\nunheard-of, alien process, to Nature\'s most unworthy trifling.This\nboatload of men and women--so huge a part of his own experience--was\nlike the tiniest barnacle chafed from the side of that dark,\nserene monster.Rudolph stared long at the hills, and as they faded, hung his head.From that dragon he had learned much; yet now all learning was but loss.Of a sudden the girl spoke, in a clear yet guarded voice, too low to\nreach the sleepers.It will be good for\nboth of us."Rudolph crossed silently, and stood leaning on the gunwale beside her."I thought only," he answered, "how much the hills looked so--as a\ndragon."The trembling phosphorus half-revealed her face, pale and\nstill."I was thinking of that, in a way.It reminded me of what he\nsaid, once--when we were walking together."To their great relief, they found themselves talking of Heywood, sadly,\nbut freely, and as it were in a sudden calm.Their friendship seemed,\nfor the moment, a thing as long established as the dragon hills.Years\nafterward, Rudolph recalled her words, plainer than the fiery wonder\nthat spread and burst round their little vessel, or the long play of\nheat-lightning which now, from time to time, wavered instantly along the\neastern sea-line."To go on with life, even when we\nare alone--You will go on, I know.And again she said: "Yes,\nsuch men as he are--a sort of Happy Warrior."And later, in her slow and\nlevel voice: "You learned something, you say.Isn\'t that--what I\ncall--being invulnerable?When a man\'s greater than anything that\nhappens to him--"\n\nSo they talked, their speech bare and simple, but the pauses and longer\nsilences filled with deep understanding, solemnized by the time and the\nplace, as though their two lonely spirits caught wisdom from the night,\nscope from the silent ocean, light from the flickering East.The flashes, meanwhile, came faster and prolonged their glory, running\nbehind a thin, dead screen of scalloped clouds, piercing the tropic sky\nwith summer blue, and ripping out the lost horizon like a long black\nfibre from pulp.The two friends watched in silence, when Rudolph rose,\nand moved cautiously aft.So long as the boiling witch-fire\nturned their wake to golden vapor, he could not be sure; but whenever\nthe heat-lightning ran, and through the sere, phantasmal sail, the\nlookout in the bow flashed like a sharp silhouette through wire\ngauze,--then it seemed to Rudolph that another small black shape leapt\nout astern, and vanished.He stood by the lowdah, watching anxiously.Time and again the ocean flickered into view, like the floor of a\nmeasureless cavern; and still he could not tell.But at last the lowdah\nalso turned his head, and murmured.Their boat creaked monotonously,\ndrifting to leeward in a riot of golden mist; yet now another creaking\ndisturbed the night, in a different cadence.Another boat followed them,\nrowing fast and gaining.In a brighter flash, her black sail fluttered,\nunmistakable.Rudolph reached for his gun, but waited silently.Some chance fisherman, it might be, or any small craft holding the same\ncourse along the coast.Still, he did not like the hurry of the sweeps,\nwhich presently groaned louder and threw up nebulous fire.The\nstranger\'s bow became an arrowhead of running gold.And here was Flounce, ready to misbehave once more.Before he could\ncatch her, the small white body of the terrier whipped by him, and past\nthe steersman.This time, however, as though cowed, she began to\nwhimper, and then maintained a long, trembling whine.Beside Rudolph, the compradore\'s head bobbed up.And in his native tongue, Ah Pat grumbled\nsomething about ghosts.A harsh voice hailed, from the boat astern; the lowdah answered; and so\nrapidly slid the deceptive glimmer of her bow, that before Rudolph knew\nwhether to wake his friends, or could recover, next, from the shock and\necstasy of unbelief, a tall white figure jumped or swarmed over\nthe side.sounded the voice of Heywood, gravely.With fingers\nthat dripped gold, he tried to pat the bounding terrier.She flew up at\nhim, and tumbled back, in the liveliest danger of falling overboard.In a daze, Rudolph gripped the wet and shining hands,\nand heard the same quiet voice: "Rest all asleep, I suppose?To-morrow will do.--Have you any money on you?Toss that\nfisherman--whatever you think I\'m worth.He really rowed like steam,\nyou know."Rudolph flung his purse into the other boat.When he turned, this man\nrestored from the sea had disappeared.But he had only stolen forward,\ndog in arms, to sit beside Miss Drake.So quietly had all happened, that\nnone of the sleepers, not even the captain, was aware.Rudolph drew near\nthe two murmuring voices.\n\n"--Couldn\'t help it, honestly," said Heywood."Can\'t describe, or\nexplain.Just something--went black inside my head, you know.""No: don\'t recall seeing a thing, really, until I pitched away\nthe--what happened to be in my hands.Losing your\nhead, I suppose they call it.The girl\'s question recalled him from his puzzle."I ran, that\'s all.--Oh,\nyes, but I ran faster.--Not half so many as you\'d suppose.Most of \'em\nwere away, burning your hospital.Hence those stuffed hats, Rudie, in the trench.--Only three\nof the lot could run.I merely scuttled into the next bamboo, and kept\non scuttling.Oh, yes, arrow in the\nshoulder--scratch.Of course, when it came dark, I stopped running, and\nmade for the nearest fisherman."But," protested Rudolph, wondering, "we heard shots.""Yes, I had my Webley in my belt.I _told_ you: three of\nthem could run."The speaker patted the terrier in his lap."My dream,\neh, little dog?You _were_ the only one to know.""No," said the girl: "I knew--all the time, that--"\n\nWhatever she meant, Rudolph could only guess; but it was true, he\nthought, that she had never once spoken as though the present meeting\nwere not possible, here or somewhere.Recalling this, he suddenly but\nquietly stepped away aft, to sit beside the steersman, and smile in\nthe darkness.He did not listen, but watched the phosphorus\nwelling soft and turbulent in the wake, and far off, in glimpses of the\ntropic light, the great Dragon weltering on the face of the waters.The\nshape glimmered forth, died away, like a prodigy."Ich lieg\' und besitze."And yet," thought the young man, "I have one pearl from his hoard."That girl was right: like Siegfried tempered in the grisly flood, the\nraw boy was turning into a man, seasoned and invulnerable.Heywood was calling to him:--\n\n"You must go Home with us.I\'ve made a wonderful plan--with\nthe captain\'s fortune!A small white heap across the deck began to rise."How often," complained a voice blurred with sleep, "how often must I\ntell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart\'s all--Good God!"At the captain\'s cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof\nbegan to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with\nsleepy cries of joy.To the philosophic workman,\nthen, well read in revolutionary literature from Marx to Kropotkin,\nthe standing army presents itself simply as a capitalist tool, a\nbulwark of the employing class against trade unionism.The industrial\nstruggle is uncomplicated by sentimentality.Patriotic stampedes to the\nconservative side are unknown.Strikes are\nfrequent, and the protection of "blackleg" labourers is in the hands\nof the garrison.That is the theme of this "romantic military play."Mari, a second lieutenant, refuses to serve on strike duty.He is a\nweak but sincere idealist; his head full of humanitarian enthusiasm,\nhis rooms stocked with anti-militarist pamphlets.He will leave the\narmy rather than order his men to fire on the factory workers.Around\nhim stand the members of the military caste, linked together by\ntradition and family relationship.His father is a colonel in the same\nregiment; the father of his fiancée, Martha, is commanding officer.One\nfriend he has: an army doctor named Berens, who has infected himself\nwith cancer serum in attempting to discover a cure for the disease,\nand passes for a drunkard because he keeps the symptoms in check by\nalcohol.Here a parallel is drawn between military bravery and the\ncivilian courage of the scientist.Mari is put under arrest, but the affair is kept secret in order to\navoid a scandal.He can only be reinstated by full withdrawal and\napology.Martha comes to him and implores him to withdraw.He can plead the excitement of the moment\nin excuse, and the matter will be settled honorably.A friendly discussion of the point with his superior\nofficers is interrupted by a volley in the street outside.The troops\nhave fired upon the mob, and the son of the shoemaker over the way\nhas been shot.Mari sends in his papers; but a newspaper has published the facts of\nthe case, and he is met with the disgrace of immediate dismissal from\nthe army.She must marry a soldier; civilian\nlife with a dismissed lieutenant was not in the bond.So Mari suffers\nanother disillusionment, and the end of the play sees him setting\nout from home, while the old shoemaker is left to lament for his son.A warm heart, a weakness for rhetoric,\nand--a study in vacillation.In Ora et Labora Heijermans is less rhetorical; rather, one suspects,\nfor lack of a mouthpiece.His peasants bear their fate, if not in\nsilence, with almost inarticulate resignation.They are too hungry to\nwaste words.Moreover, there is no visible enemy to denounce, no Coat\nof Mail, no racial prejudice, no insatiate capitalism.Winter is the\nvillain of the piece.This is indeed naturalism, in the literal sense;\nhumanity devoured by Nature.Everything is frost-bound: the canal,\nthe soil, the very cattle.When the last cow upon the farm dies of disease, its throat\nis cut so that it can be sold to the butcher.All hopes are centred\nin the father of the family, who is to sell the carcase in the town;\nbut he spends the money and returns home drunk.As a last resort,\nhis son Eelke enlists in the army for six years\' colonial service,\nleaving Sytske, the girl he was about to marry.His advance pay buys\nfuel and food, but the lovers part with a hopeless quarrel, and the\nold peasants are left wrangling over the money he has brought.Allerzielen (1906) is a later work.A village pastor finds a woman\nin a state of collapse upon his threshold.He takes her in, and she\ngives birth to a child.She is a stranger in the district, Rita by\nname.The child is sent into the village to be nursed, while the\npastor gives up his own room to the mother.She recovers slowly, and\nmeanwhile the peasants set their tongues to work upon the scandal.A good village housewife is\nsuckling a bastard.The pastor is housing an outcast, and shows no\nsign of sending her about her business.Dimly and distantly the Bishop is said to be considering\nthe facts.... Amid alarums and excursions the affair pursues its\ncourse.The village passes from astonishment to ribaldry, from ribaldry\nto stone-throwing.The pastor speaks gently of Christian charity and\nsouls to be saved, but fails to appease his parishioners.They are\nhot upon the scent in a heresy-hunt.If they could see within the\nparsonage walls, they would yelp still louder.For Rita proves to be\nan unblushing hedonist.No prayers for her, when the birth-pangs are\nonce over; no tears, no repentance.She sings gaily in her room while\nthe pastors argue about duty and morals.She\ninvades the study to enjoy a view of sunlight, clouds and sea.She\nfinds the waves more musical than the wheezing of the church organ.If\nonly the child were with her, her happiness would be complete.But the child is neglected by its foster mother.The pastor is driven from his church by the Bishop, and leaves\nthe broken windows of the parsonage to his successor.Rita and he\nare both homeless now.And then the child\'s father comes,--another\nhedonist.Its body lies in\nunconsecrated ground, but the vows of love are renewed at the\ngraveside.All roads are\nopen to the spirits of the free.The pastor can only offer a hopeless\n"Farewell" as the two set out upon their way.But Rita calls after,\n"No,--no!It matters nothing that this gospel of Life has often been\npreached.Heijermans has caught the spirit of it as well as the\nletter.His characters say and do nothing particularly original;\nnothing that would even pass for originality by reason of its\nmanner.He works in vivid contrasts, without a shade of paradox.He\nfigures the opposed forces of Reaction and Revolution in religion,\nin statecraft, in economics, in all human relationships, with a\nsimplicity of mind which would draw a smile from the forever up-to-date\n"intellectual."Reaction is a devilish superstition; Revolution\na prophetic angel pointing the way to the promised land.The one\nis false, the other true.There is no disputing the point, since\ntruth and falsehood are absolute terms.Perhaps the secret is that\nHeijermans never tires of his own philosophy.He is content to see it\nfirmly planted on the ground; he does not demand that it should walk\nthe tight-rope or turn somersaults as an intellectual exercise.He\nhas accepted a view of life which some call materialistic, and others\npositivist, or scientific, or humanitarian; but for him it is simply\nhumane,--founded upon social justice and human need.A philosophy, however, does not make a dramatist.In the plays I\nhave already described Heijermans shows his power of translating\nthe world-struggle of thought into the dramatic clash of will, but\nit is upon "The Good Hope" (Op Hoop van Zegen) that his reputation\nchiefly depends.He chooses a great subject; not merely the conflict\nof shipowners and fishermen in the struggle for existence, but the\nsea-faring life and the ocean itself.Truly "a sea-piece"; tempestuous,\npowerful.From the opening\nscene, with the old men\'s tale of sharks, to the night of the storm\nin the third act, when the women and children huddle in Kneirtje\'s\ncottage for shelter, the story is always the same.The sea is the\nsymbol of Fate.It takes a father here, a brother there.It seizes\nGeert and Barend alike; the one going aboard carelessly, the other\nscreaming resistance.Sometimes it plays with its victims on shore,\nmaking no sign, leaving months of hope to end in despair.In a more\nmerciful mood it sends children running through the village to cry\n"\'n Ball op!as an overdue ship is signalled from the\ncoastguard tower.And there an echo of the sea-ballad now and again;\nwhen raps are heard upon the door at the height of the storm, or\na flapping curtain blows out the lamp, or a pallid face is seen at\nthe window....\n\nIn sheer force of theatrical construction "The Good Hope" is still\nmore striking.The play is\nfull of natural rather than violent coincidence.Barend has always\nfeared death by drowning, and he makes his first and last voyage in\na leaky trawler.His father sank in a wreck, and it is his mother,\nunable to maintain the household, who persuades him to go.She fears\nthe disgrace of his refusal after the papers are signed, but he is\ndragged aboard by the harbour police.His brother Geert sets out\nproudly enough, singing the Marseillaise and preaching rebellion;\nbut he sinks far away, impotent, unheard, and leaves his sweetheart\nto bear a fatherless child.Old Cobus can only reflect, "We take\nthe fishes, and God takes us."That is perhaps the most dramatic\nthread of all,--the parallel of fate.The struggle for existence on\nland drives men to the fishing-boats and the Dogger Bank.From the\nminnows to leviathan, there is no escape."We take the fishes, and\nGod takes us."A gale of wind and rain whistles through the play,\nsweeping the decks of life, tossing men out into the unknown.The ship-owner, Bos, is frankly\na villain.He knows "The Good Hope" is unseaworthy, but he allows her\nto sail.True, the warning comes from a drunken ship\'s carpenter,\nbut he understands the risks.The ship is\nwell insured....\n\nIt is implied, then, that shipowners are unscrupulous scoundrels,\nand fishermen their unhappy victims.Here is a bias which makes\nthe actual tragedy no more impressive.Good ships, as well as bad,\nmay perish in a storm.Nature is cruel enough without the help of\nman.The problem of the big fish and the little fish is one of size,\nnot of morality.Even sharks may possibly rejoice in an amiable\ntemperament.It can only be said that Heijermans has here chosen the\nright motive for his own particular type of drama.He knows that, humanly speaking, in every conflict\nbetween employers and employed, the men are right and the masters\nwrong.Impossible to redress the balance by individual virtue or\nkindliness.The masters stand for the exploiting system; for capital,\nfor insurance, for power, for law and order and possession.Their\nrisks are less and their temptations greater.Even from the standpoint\nof abstract justice, a dishonest employer may fairly be set against\na drunken labourer or a gaol-bird fisherman.The one is no less\nnatural than the other.But Heijermans goes beyond all finicking\nconsiderations of this sort.He seeks to destroy and rebuild, not\nto repair or adjust.He avoids mere naturalism; the "conscientious\ntranscription of all the visible and repetition of all the audible"\nis not for him.And here he is undoubtedly justified, not only by\nhis own experience, but by that of other dramatists.There was no\ninspiration in the movement towards mere actuality on the stage.It\nsickened of its own surfeit of "life."Its accumulated squalor became\nintolerable.It was choked by its own irrelevance, circumscribed\nby its own narrowness.For naturalism is like a prison courtyard;\nit offers only two ways of escape.One is the poet\'s upward flight,\nthe other the revolutionist\'s battering-ram.Heijermans has chosen\nhis own weapon, and used it well.He has given us "The Good Hope,"\nnot as a mere pitiful study in disillusionment, but as a tragic symbol\nof human effort in the conquest of despair.Kneirtje, a fisherman\'s widow.Geert   }\n    Barend  }  her sons.Daantje, from the Old Men\'s Home.Mees, Marietje\'s betrothed.The Drama is laid in a North Sea fishing village.THE GOOD HOPE\n\n                    A Drama of the Sea in Four Acts.[Kneirtje\'s home, a poor living-room.At the left, two wall bedsteads\nand a door;

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Another resident of this country gives the opposite or more favourable\nview.The Sultan is the head of the orthodox religion of the Mussulmen of the\nWest, and more firmly established on his throne than the Sultan of the\nOttomans.His influence, as a sovereign Shereef, spreads throughout\nWestern Barbary and Central Africa, wherever there is a Mussulman to be\nfound.In the event of an enemy appearing in the shape of a Christian,\nor Infidel, all would unite, including the most disjointed and hostile\ntribes against the common foe of Islamism.The Sultan, upon an emergency or insurrection in his own empire, by the\npolitic distribution of titles of _Marabout_ (often used as a species of\ndegree of D.D.)and other honours attached to the Shereefian Parasol,\ncan likewise easily excite one chief against another, and consolidate\nhis power over their intestine divisions.His Moorish Majesty, at any\nrate, has always actual possession in his favour; and, whether he really\ngoverns the whole Empire or not, or to the extent which he has presumed\nto mark out its boundaries, he can always proclaim to his disjointed\nprovinces that he does so govern it and exercise authority; and, in\ngeneral, he does succeed in making both his own people and foreign\nnations believe in his pretensions, and acknowledge his power.The truth lies, perhaps, between these extremes.The Shereefs once\npretended to exercise authority over all Western Sahara as far as\nTimbuctoo, that is to say, all that region of the great desert lying\nwest of the Touaricks.The account of the expedition of the Shereef Mohammed, who penetrated as\nfar as Wadnoun, and which took place more than three centuries ago, as\nrelated by Marmol, leaves no doubt of the ancient ambition of the\nsovereign of Morocco.And although this pretension has now been given\nup, they still claim sovereignty over the oases of Touat, a month\'s\njourney in the Sahara.Formerly, indeed, the authority of the Maroquine\nSultans over Touat and the south appears to have been more real and\neffective.Diego de Torres relates that, in his time, the Shereefs maintained a\nforce of ten thousand cavalry in the provinces of Draha, Tafilett and\nJaguriri, and Monsieur Mouette counts Touat as one of the provinces of\nthe Empire.The Sheikh Haj Kasem, in the itinerary which he dictated to\nMonsieur Delaporte, says that, about forty years ago, Agobli and\nTaoudeni depended on Morocco.This, however, is what the people of\nGhadames told me, whilst they admitted that the oases neither did\ncontain a single officer of the Emperor, nor did the people pay his\nShereefian Highness the smallest impost.The Sultan\'s authority is now\nindeed purely nominal, and the French look forward to the time when\nthese fine and centrally placed oases will form "une dependance de\nl\'Algerie."The only countries in the South which now pay a regular impost to the\nEmperor, are Tafilett, limited to the valley of Fez, Wad-Draha as far as\nthe lake Ed-Debaia, and Sous.The countries of Sidi, Hashem, and Wadnoun\nnominally acknowledge the Emperor, and occasionally send a present; but\nthe most mountainous, between Sous and Wad-Draha, which has been called\nGuezoula or Gouzoula, and is said to be peopled by a Berber race, sprang\nfrom the ancient Gelulir, is entirely independent.In the north and west\nare also many quasi-independent tribes, but still the Emperor keeps up a\nsort of authority over them; and, if nothing more, is content simply\nwith being called their Sultan.Maroquine Moors call their country El-Gharb, "The West," and sometimes\nMogrel-el-Aksa, that is "The far West:" [8] the name seems to have\noriginated something in the same way among the Saracenic conquerors, as\nthe "Far West" with the Anglo-Americans, arising from an apprehensive\nfeeling of indefinite extent of unexplored country.Among the Moors\ngenerally, Morocco is now often called, "Blad Muley Abd Errahman", or\n"Country of the Sultan Muley Abd Errahman."The northwestern portion of\nMorocco was first conquered; Morocco Proper, Sous and Tafilett were\nadded with the progress of conquest.But scarcely a century has elapsed\nsince their union under one common Sultan, whilst the diverse population\nof the four States are solely kept together by the interests and\nfeelings of a common religion.The Maroquine Empire, with its present limits, is bounded on the north\nby the Mediterranean Sea and the Straits of Gibraltar, on the west by\nthe Atlantic Ocean and the Canary and Madeira Islands, on the south by\nthe deserts of Noun Draha and the Sahara, on the east by Algeria, the\nAtlas, and Tafilett, on the borders of Sahara beyond their eastern\n<DW72>s.The greatest length from north to south is about five hundred\nmiles, with a breadth from east to west varying considerably at an\naverage of two hundred, containing an available or really _dependent_\nterritory of some 137,400 square miles, or nearly as large as Spain; and\nthe whole is situate between the 28 deg.Monsieur\nBenou, in his "Description Geographique de l\'Empire de Maroc" says\nMorocco "comprend une superficie d\'environ 5,775 myriametres carres, un\npeu plus grande, par consequant, que celle de la France, qui equivaut a\n5,300."This then is the available and immediate territory of Morocco,\nnot comprising distant dependencies, where the Shereefs exercise a\nprecarious or nominal sovereignty.Previously to particularizing the population of Morocco, I shall take\nthe liberty of introducing some general observations on the whole of the\ninhabitants of North Africa, and the manner in which this country was\nsuccessively peopled and conquered.Greek and Roman classics contain\nonly meagre and confused notions of the aborigines of North Africa,\nalthough they have left us a mass of details on the Punic wars, and the\nstruggles which ensued between the Romans and the ancient Libyans,\nbefore the domination of the Latin Republic could be firmly established.Herodotus cites the names of a number of people who inhabited North\nAfrica, mostly confining himself to repeat the fables or the more\ninteresting facts, of which they were the object.The nomenclature of Strabo is neither so extensive, nor does it contain\nmore precise or correct information.He mentions the celebrated oasis of\nAmmonium and the nation of the Nasamones.Farther west, behind Carthage\nand the Numidians, he also notices the Getulians, and after them the\nGaramantes, a people who appear to have colonized both the oasis of\nGhadames and the oases of Fezzan.Ptolemy makes the whole of the\nMauritania, including Algeria and Morocco, to be bounded on the south by\ntribes, called Gaetuliae and Melanogaeluti, on the south the latter\nevidently having contracted alliance of blood with the <DW64>s.According to Sallust, who supports himself upon the authority of\nHeimpsal, the Carthaginian historian, "North Africa was first occupied\nby Libyans and Getulians, who were a barbarous people, a heterogeneous\nmass, or agglomeration of people of different races, without any form of\nreligion or government, nourishing themselves on herbs, or devouring the\nraw flesh of animals killed in the chase; for first amongst these were\nfound Blacks, probably some from the interior of Africa, and belonging\nto the great <DW64> family; then whites, issue of the Semitic stock, who\napparently constituted, even at that early period, the dominant race or\ncaste.Later, but at an epoch absolutely unknown, a new horde of\nAsiatics," says Sallust, "of Medes, Persians, and Armenians, invaded the\ncountries of the Atlas, and, led on by Hercules, pushed their conquests\nas far as Spain."[9]\n\nThe Persians, mixing themselves with the former inhabitants of the\ncoast, formed the tribes called Numides, or Numidians (which embrace the\nprovinces of Tunis and Constantina), whilst the Medes and the Armenians,\nallying themselves with the Libyans, nearer to Spain, it is pretended,\ngave existence to a race of Moors, the term Medes being changed into\nthat of Moors.[10]\n\nAs to the Getulians confined in the valleys of the Atlas, they resisted\nall alliance with the new immigrants, and formed the principal nucleus\nof those tribes who have ever remained in North Africa, rebels to a\nforeign civilization, or rather determined champions of national\nfreedom, and whom, imitating the Romans and Arabs, we are pleased to\ncall Barbarians or Berbers (Barbari Braber [11]), and whence is derived\nthe name of the Barbary States.But the Romans likewise called the\naboriginal tribes of North Africa, Moors, or Mauri, and some contend\nthat Moors and Berbers are but two different names for the aboriginal\ntribes, the former being of Greek and the latter of African origin.The\nRomans might, however, confound the African term berber with barbari,\nwhich latter they applied, like the Greeks, to all strangers and\nforeigners.The revolutions of Africa cast a new tribe of emigrants upon\nthe North African coast, who, if we are to believe the Byzantine\nhistorian, Procopius, of the sixth century, were no other than\nCanaanites, expelled from Palestine by the victorious arms of Joshua,\nwhen he established the Israelites in that country.Procopius affirms\nthat, in his time, there was a column standing at Tigisis, on which was\nthis inscription:--"We are those who fled from the robber Joshua, son of\nNun."[12] Now whether Tigisis was in Algeria, or was modern Tangier, as\nsome suppose, it is certain there are several traditions among the\nBerber tribes of Morocco, which relate that their ancestors were driven\nout of Palestine.Also, the Berber historian, Ebn-Khal-Doun, who\nflourished in the fourteenth century, makes all the Berbers descend from\none Bar, the son of Mayigh, son of Canaan.However, what may be the\ntruths of these traditions of Sallust or Procopius, there is no\ndifficulty in believing that North Africa was peopled by fugitive and\nroving tribes, and that the first settlers should be exposed to be\nplundered by succeeding hordes; for such has been the history of the\nmigrations of all the tribes of the human race.But the most ancient historical fact on which we can depend is, the\ninvasion, or more properly, the successive invasions of North Africa by\nthe Phoenicians.Their definite establishment on these shores took place\ntowards the foundation of Carthage, about 820 years before our era.Yet\nwe know little of their intercourse or relations with the aboriginal\ntribes.When the Romans, a century and a half before Christ, received,\nor wrested, the rule of Africa from the Phoenicians, or Carthaginians,\nthey found before them an indigenous people, whom they indifferently\ncalled Moors, Berbers, or Barbarians.A part of these people were called\nalso Nudides, which is perhaps considered the same term as nomades.Some ages later, the Romans, too weak to resist a vigorous invasion of\nother conquerors, were subjugated by the Vandals, who, during a century,\nheld possession of North Africa; but, after this time, the Romans again\nraised their heads, and completely expelled or extirpated the Vandals,\nso that, as before, there were found only two people or races in Africa:\nthe Romans and the Moors, or aborigines.Towards the middle of the seventh century after Christ, and a few years\nafter the death of Mahomet, the Romans, in the decline of their power,\nhad to meet the shock of the victorious arms of the Arabians, who poured\nin upon them triumphant from the East; but, too weak to resist this new\ntide of invasion, they opposed to them the aborigines, which latter were\nsoon obliged to continue alone the struggle.The Arabian historians, who recount these wars, speak of _Roumi_ or\nRomans (of the Byzantine empire) and the Braber--evidently the\naboriginal tribes--who promptly submitted to the Arabs to rid themselves\nof the yoke of the Romans; but, after the retreat of their ancient\nmasters, they revolted and remained a long time in arms against their\nnew conquerors--a rule of action which all subjugated nations have been\nwont to follow.Were we English now to attempt to expel the French from\nAlgeria, we, undoubtedly, should be joined by the Arabs; but who would,\nmost probably, soon also revolt against us, were we to attempt to\nconsolidate our dominion over them.In the first years of the eighth century, and at the end of the first\ncentury of the Hegira, the conquering Arabs passed over to Spain, and,\ninasmuch as they came from Mauritania, the people of Spain gave them the\nname of Moors (that of the aborigines of North Africa), although they\nhad, perhaps, nothing in common with them, if we except their Asiatic\norigin.Another and most singular name was also given to these Arab\nwarriors in France and other parts of Europe--that of Saracens--whose\netymology is extremely obscure.[13] From this time the Spaniards have\nalways given the names of Moors (_los Moros_), not only to the Arabs of\nSpain, but to all the Arabs; and, confounding farther these two\ndenominations, they have bestowed the name of _Moros_ upon the Arabs of\nMorocco and those in the environs of Senegal.The Arabs who invaded Northern Africa about 650, were all natives of\nAsia, belonging to various provinces of Arabia, and were divided into\nIsmaelites, Amalekites, Koushites, &c. They were all warriors; and it is\nconsidered a title of nobility to have belonged to their first irruption\nof the enthusiastic sons of the Prophet.A second invasion took place towards the end of the ninth century--an\nepoch full of wars--during which, the Caliph Kaim transported the seat\nof his government from Kairwan to Cairo, ending in the complete\nsubmission of Morocco to the power of Yousef Ben Tashfin.One cannnot\nnow distinguish which tribe of Arabs belong to the first or the second\ninvasion, but all who can shew the slightest proof, claim to belong to\nthe first, as ranking among a band of noble and triumphant warriors.After eight centuries of rule, the Arabs being expelled from Spain, took\nrefuge in Barbary, but instead of finding the hospitality and protection\nof their brethren, the greater part of them were pillaged or massacred.The remnant of these wretched fugitives settled along the coast; and it\nis to their industry and intelligence that we owe the increase, or the\nfoundation of many of the maritime cities.Here, considered as strangers\nand enemies by the natives, whom they detested, the new colonists sought\nfor, and formed relations with Turks and renegades of all nations,\nwhilst they kept themselves separate from the Arabs and Berbers.This,\nthen, is the _bona-fide_ origin of the people whom we now generally call\nMoors.History furnishes us with a striking example of how the expelled\nArabs of Spain united with various adventurers against the Berber and\nNorth African Arabs.In the year 1500, a thousand Andalusian cavaliers,\nwho had emigrated to Algiers, formed an alliance with the Barbarossas\nand their fleet of pirates; and, after expelling the native prince,\nbuilt the modern city of Algiers.And such was the origin of the\nAlgerine Corsairs.The general result of these observations would, therefore, lead us to\nconsider the Moors of the Romans, as the Berbers or aborigines of North\nAfrica, and the Moors of the Spaniards, as pure Arabians; and if,\nindeed, these Arabian cavaliers marshalled with them Berbers, as\nauxiliaries, for the conquest of Spain, this fact does not militate\nagainst the broad assumption.The so-called Moors of Senegal and the Sahara, as well as those of\nMorocco, are chiefly a mixture of Berbers, Arabs and <DW64>s; but the\npresent Moors located in the northern coast of Africa, are rather the\ndescendants from the various conquering nations, and especially from\nrenegades and Christian slaves.The term Moors is not known to the natives themselves.The people speak\ndefinitely enough of Arabs and of various Berber tribes.The population\nof the towns and cities are called generally after the names of these\ntowns and cities, whilst Tuniseen and Tripoline is applied to all the\ninhabitants of the great towns of Tunis and Tripoli.Europeans resident\nin Barbary, as a general rule, call all the inhabitants of towns--Moors,\nand the peasants or people residents in tents--Arabs.But, in Tripoli, I\nfound whole villages inhabited by Arabs, and these I thought might be\ndistinguished as town Arabs.Then the mountains of Tripoli are covered\nwith Arab villages, and some few considerable towns are inhabited by\npeople who are _bona-fide_ Arabs.Finally, the capitals of North Africa\nare filled with every class of people found in the country.The question is then where shall we draw the line of distinction in the\ncase of nationalities?or can we, with any degree of precision, define\nthe limits which distinguish the various races in North Africa?With\nregard to the Blacks or <DW64> tribes, there can be no great difficulty.The Jews are also easily distinguished from the rest of the people as\nwell by their national features as by their dress and habits or customs\nof living.But, when we come to the Berbers, Arabs, Moors and Turks, we\ncan only distinguish them in their usual and ordinary occupations and\nmanners of life.Whenever they are intermixed, or whenever they change\ntheir position, that is to say, whenever the Arab or Berber comes to\ndwell in a town, or a Moor or a Turk goes to reside in the country,\nadopting the Arab or Berber dress and mode of living, it is no longer\npossible to distinguish the one from the other, or mark the limitation\nof races.And since it is seen that the aborigines of Northern Africa consisted,\nwith the exception of the <DW64> tribes, of the Asiatics of the Caucasian\nrace or variety, many of whom, like the Phoenicians, have peopled\nvarious cities and provinces of Europe, it is therefore not astonishing\nwe should find all the large towns and cities of North Africa, where the\nhuman being becomes _policed_, refined and civilized sooner than in\nremote and thinly-inhabited districts, teeming with a population, which\nat once challenges an European type, and a corresponding origin with the\ngreat European family of nations.North Africa is wonderfully homogeneous in the matter of religion.The\npeople, indeed, have but one religion.Even the extraneous Judaism is\nthe same in its Deism--depression of the female--circumcision and many\nof the religious customs, festivals and traditions.And this has a\nsurprising effect in assimilating the opposite character and sharpest\npeculiarities of various races of otherwise distinct and independant\norigin.The population of Morocco presents five distant races and classes of\npeople; Berbers, Arabs, Moors, Jews and <DW64>s.Turks are not found in\nMorocco, and do not come so far west; but sons of Turks by Moorish women\nin Kouroglies are included among the Moors, that have emigrated from\nAlgeria.Maroquine Berbers, include the varieties of the Amayeegh [14]\nand the Shelouh, who mostly are located in the mountains, while the\nArabs are settled on the plains.The Moors are the inhabitants of towns and cities, consisting of a\nmixture of nearly all races, a great proportion of them being of the\ndescendants of the Moors expelled from Spain.All these races have been,\nand will still be, farther noticed in the progress of the work.The\nproximate amount of this population is six millions.The greater number\nof the towns and cities are situate on the coast, excepting the three or\nfour capitals, or imperial cities.The other towns of the interior\nshould be considered rather as forts to awe neighbouring tribes, or as\nmarket villages (_souks_), where the people collect together for the\ndisposal and exchange of their produce.Numerous tribes, located in the\nAtlas, escape the notice of the imposts of imperial authority.Their\nvarieties and amount of population are equally unknown.In the immense\ngroup of Gibel Thelge (snowy mountains), some of the tribes are said to\nhave their faces shaved, like Christians, and to wear boots.We can\nunderstand why a people inhabiting a cold region of rain and mists and\nperpetual snow should wear boots; but as to their shaving like\nChristians, this is rather vague.But it is not impossible the Atlas\ncontains the descendants of some European refugees.The nature of the soil and climate of Morocco are not unlike those of\nSpain and Portugal; and though Morocco does not materially differ from\nother parts of Barbary, its greater extent of coast on the Atlantic,\nalong which the tradewind of the north coast blows nine months out of\ntwelve, and its loftier ridges of the Atlas, so temper its varied\nsurface of hill and plain and vast declivities that, together with the\nabsence of those marshy districts which in hot climates engender fatal\ndisease, this country may be pronounced, excepting perhaps Tunis, the\nmost healthy in all Africa.In the northern provinces, the climate is nearly the same as that of\nSpain; in the southern there is less rain and more of the desert heat,\nbut this is compensated for by the greater fertility in the production\nof valuable staple articles of commerce.Nevertheless, Morocco has its\nextremes of heat and cold, like all the North African coast.The most striking object of this portion of the crust of the globe, is\nthe vast Atlas chain of mountains [15], which traverses Morocco from\nnorth-east to south-west, whose present ascertained culminating point,\nMiltsin, is upwards of 15,000 feet above the level of the sea, or equal\nto the highest peaks of the Pyrenees.The Maroquine portion of the Atlas\ncontains its highest peaks, which stretch from the east of Tripoli to\nthe Atlantic Ocean, at Santa Cruz; and we find no mountains of equal\nheight, except in the tenth degree of North latitude, or 18,000 miles\nsouth, or 30,000 south, south-east.The Rif coast has a mountainous\nchain of some considerable height, but the Atlantic coast offers chiefly\nridges of hills.The coasts of Morocco are not much indented, and\nconsequently have few ports, and these offer poor protection from the\nocean.The general surface of Morocco presents a large ridge or lock, with two\nimmense declivities, one sloping N.W.to the ocean, with various rivers\nand streams descending from this enormous back-bone of the Atlas, and\nthe other fulling towards the Sahara, S.E., feeding the streams and\naffluents of Wad Draha, and other rivers, which are lost in the sands of\nthe Desert.This shape of the country prevents the formation of those\nvast _Sebhahas_, or salt lakes, so frequent in Algeria and the south of\nTunis.We are acquainted only with two lakes of fresh or sweet\nwater--that of Debaia, traversed by Wad Draha,--and that of\nGibel-Akhder, which Leo compares to Lake Bolsena.The height of the\nmountains, and the uniformity of their <DW72>s, produce large and\nnumerous rivers; indeed, the most considerable of all North Africa.These rivers of the North are shortest, but have the largest volume of\nwater; those of the South are larger, but are nearly dry the greater\npart of the year.Some abound\nwith fish, particularly the Shebbel, or Barbary salmon.It is neither so\nrich nor so large as our salmon, and is whitefleshed; it tastes\nsomething like herring, but is of a finer and more delicate flavour.They are abundant in the market of Mogudor.The Shebbel, converted by\nthe Spaniards Sabalo, is found in the Guadalquivir.The products of the soil are nearly the same as in other parts of\nBarbary.On the plains, or in the open country, the great cultivation is\nwheat and barley; in suburban districts, vegetables and fruits are\npropagated.In a commercial point of view, the North exports cattle,\ngrain, bark, leeches, and skins; and the South exports gums, almonds,\nostrich-feathers, wax, wool, and skins, as principle staple produce.When the rains cease or fail, the cultivation is kept up by irrigation,\nand an excellent variety of fruits and esculent vegetables are produced;\nindeed, nearly all the vegetables and fruit-trees of Southern Europe are\nhere abundantly and successfully cultivated, besides those peculiar to\nan African clime and soil.In the south, grows a tree peculiar to this\ncountry, the Eloeondenron Argan, so called from its Arabic name Argan.This tree produces fruit resembling the olive, whose egg-shaped, brown,\nsmooth and very hard stone, encloses a flat almond, of a white colour,\nand of a very disagreeable taste, which, when crushed, produces a rancid\noil, used commonly as a substitute for olive-oil.The tree itself is\nbushy and large, and sometimes grows of the size to a wide-spreading\noak.Not far from Mogador are several Argan forests.The level country\nof the north is covered with forests of dwarfish oak; some bear sweet,\nand others bitter acorns, and also the cork-tree, whose bark is a\nconsiderable object of commerce.In the Atlas, has been found the\nmagnificent cedar of Lebanon.This tree has also been met with in\nAlgeria, but only on the mountains, some forty thousand feet above the\nlevel of the sea.In the South there is, of course, growing in all its Saharan vigour, the\nnoble date-palm, and by its side, squats the palmetto, or dwarf-palm (in\nArabic _dauma_).Of trees and plants, the usual tinzah, and snouber or\npine of Aleppo, are used for preparing the fine leathers of Morocco.Many plants are also deleteriously employed for exciting intoxication,\nor inflaming the passions.Morocco has its mines of gold, silver, lead, iron, tin, sulphur,\nmineral, salt, and antimony; but nearly all are neglected, or unworked.Government will not encourage the industry of the people, for fear of\nexciting the cupidity of foreigners.A Frenchman, a short time ago,\nreported a silver mine in the south, and Government immediately bribed\nhim to make another statement that there was no such mine.At Elala and\nStouka, in the province of Sous, are several rich silver mines.Gold is\nfound in the Atlas and the Lower Sous.But this country is especially\nrich in copper mines.A great number of ancient and modern authors speak\nof these mines, which are situate in the mountainous country comprised\nbetween Aghadir, Morocco, Talda, Tamkrout, and Akka.The mines most\nworked, are those of Tedsi and Afran.At the foot of the Atlas, near\nTaroudant, is a great quantity of sulphur.In the neighbourhood of\nMorocco, saltpetre is found.In the province of Abda is an extensive\nsalt lake, and salt has been exported from this country to Timbuctoo.Of\nprecious stones, some fine specimens of amethyst have been discovered.There are scarcely any animals peculiar to Morocco, or which are not\nfound in other parts of North Africa.Davidson mentions some curious\nfacts relative to the desert horse; "_sherb-errech_, wind-bibber, or\ndrinker of the wind," a variety of this animal, which is not to be met\nwith in the Saharan regions of Tunis, or Tripoli.This horse is fed only on camel\'s milk, and is principally used for\nhunting ostriches, which are run down by it, and then captured.[16] The\n_sherb-errech_ will continue running three or four days together without\nany food.It is a slight and spare-formed animal, mostly in wretched\ncondition, with ugly thick legs, and devoid of beauty as a horse.Division of Morocco into kingdoms or States, and zones or regions.--\nDescription of the towns and cities on the Maroquine coasts of the\nMediterranean and Atlantic waters.--The Zafarine Isles.--Melilla.--\nAlhucemas.--Penon de Velez.--Tegaza.--Provinces of Rif and Garet.--\nTetouan.--Ceuta.--Arzila.--El Araish.--Mehedia.--Salee.--Rabat.--\nFidallah.--Dar-el-Beidah.--Azamour.--Mazagran.--Saffee.--Waladia.Morocco has been divided into States, or kingdoms by Europeans, although\nsuch divisions scarcely exist in the administration of the native\nprinces.The ancient division mentioned by Leo was that of two large\nprovinces of Morocco and Fez, separated by the river Bouragrag, which\nempties itself into the sea between Rabat and Salee; and, indeed, for\nseveral centuries, these districts were separated and governed by\nindependent princes.Tafilett always, and Sous occasionally, were united\nto Morocco, while Fez itself formed a powerful kingdom, extending itself\neastward as far as the gates of Tlemsen.The modern division adopted by several authors, is--\n\nNorthern, or the kingdom of Fez.Eastern, or the Province of Tafilett.Some add to this latter, the Province of Draha.Then, a great number of districts are enumerated as comprehended in\nthese large and general divisions; but the true division of all\nMussulman States is into tribes.There is besides another, which more\napproaches to European government, viz, into kaidats, or jurisdictions.The name of a district is usually that of its chief tribe, and mountains\nare denominated after the tribes that inhabit them.There is, of course,\na natural division, sometimes called a dividing into zones or specific\nregions, which has already been alluded to in enumerating the natural\nresources of Morocco, and which besides corresponds with the present\npolitical divisions.I. The North of the Atlas: coming first, the Rif, or mountainous region,\nwhich borders the Mediterranean from the river Moulwia to Tangier,\ncomprising the districts of Hashbat west, and Gharet and Aklaia east.Then the intermediate zone of plains and hills, which extends from the\nmiddle course of the Moulwia to Tangier on one coast, and to Mogador on\nthe other.The Central Region, or the great chain of the Atlas.The Deren [17]\nof the natives, from the frontiers of Algeria east to Cape Gheer, on the\nsouth-west.This includes the various districts of the Gharb, Temsna,\nBeni Hasan, Shawia, Fez, Todla, Dukala, Shragno, Abda, Haha, Shedma,\nKhamna, Morocco, &c.\n\nIII.South of the Atlas: or quasi-Saharan region, comprising the various\nprovinces and districts of Sous, Sidi Hisham, Wadnoun, Guezoula, Draha\n(Draa), Tafilett, and a large portion of the Sahara, south-east of the\nAtlas.As to statistics of population I am inclined fully to admit the\nstatement of Signor Balbi that, the term of African statistics ought to\nbe rejected as absurd.Count Hemo de Graeberg, who was a long time Consul\nat Tangier, and wrote a statistical and geographical account of the\nempire of Morocco, states the number of the inhabitants of the town of\nMazagran to be two thousand.Elton who resided there several months,\nassured me it does not contain more than one hundred.Another gentleman\nwho dwelt there says, three hundred.This case is a fair sample of the\nstyle in which the statistics of population in Morocco are and have been\ncalculated.Before the occupation of Algeria by the French, all the cities were\nvulgarly calculated at double, or treble their amount of population.This has also been the case even in India, where we could obtain, with\ncare, tolerably correct statistics.The prejudices of oriental and\nAfrico-eastern people are wholly set against statistics, or numbering\nthe population.No mother knows the age of her own child.It is\nill-omened, if not an affront, to ask a man how many children he has;\nand to demand the amount of the population of a city, is either\nconstructed as an infringement upon the prerogative of the omnipotent\nCreator, who knows how many people he creates, and how to take care of\nthem, or it is the question of a spy, who is seeking to ascertain the\nstrength or weakness of the country.Europeans can, therefore, rarely\nobtain any correct statistical information in Morocco: all is proximate\nand conjectural.[18] I am anxious, nevertheless, to give some\nparticulars respecting the population, in order that we may really have\na proximate idea of the strength and resources of this important\ncountry.In describing the towns and cities of the various provinces, I\nshall divide them into,\n\n1.Other towns and remarkable places in the interior [19].The towns and ports, on the Mediterranean, are of considerable interest,\nbut our information is very scanty, except as far as relates to the\n_praesidios_ of Spain, or the well-known and much frequented towns of\nTetuan and Tangier.Near the mouth of the Malwia (or fifteen miles distant), is the little\ntown of Kalat-el-wad, with a castle in which the Governor resides.Whether the river is navigable up to this place, I have not been able to\ndiscover.The water-communication of the interior of North Africa is not\nworth the name.Zaffarinds or Jafarines, are three isles lying off the\nwest of the river Mulweeah, at a short distance, or near its mouth.These belong to Spain, and have recently been additionally fortified,\nbut why, or for what reason, is not so obvious.Opposite to them, there\nis said to be a small town, situate on the mainland.The Spaniards, in\nthe utter feebleness and decadence of their power, have lately dubbed\nsome one or other "Captain-general of the Spanish possessions, &c. in\nNorth Africa."Melilla or Melilah is a very ancient city, founded by the Carthaginians,\nbuilt near a cape called by the Romans, _Rusadir_ (now Tres-Forcas) the\nname afterwards given to the city, and which it still retains in the\nform of Ras-ed-Dir, (Head of the mountain).This town is the capital of\nthe province of Garet, and is said to contain 3,000 souls.It is situate\namidst a vast tract of fine country, abounding in minerals, and most\ndelicious honey, from which it is pretended the place receives its name.On an isle near, and joined to the mainland by a draw-bridge, is the\nSpanish _praesidio_, or convict-settlement called also Melilla,\ncontaining a population of 2,244 according to the Spanish, but Rabbi and\nGraeberg do not give it more than a thousand.At a short distance,\ntowards the east, is an exceedingly spacious bay, of twenty-two miles in\ncircumference, where, they say, a thousand ships of war could be\nanchored in perfect safety, and where the ancient galleys of Venice\ncarried on a lucrative trade with Fez.Within the bay, three miles\ninland, are the ruins of the ancient city of Eazaza, once a celebrated\nplace.Alhucemos, is another small island and _praesidio_ of the Spaniards,\ncontaining five or six hundred inhabitants; it commands the bay of the\nsame name, and is situate at the mouth of the river Wad Nechor, where\nthere is also the Islet of Ed-Housh.Near the bay, is the ancient\ncapital, Mezemma, now in ruins; it had, however, some commercial\nimportance in the times of Louis XIV., and carried on trade with France.Penon de Velez is the third _praesidio_-island, a convict settlement of\nthe Spaniards on this coast, and a very strong position, situate\nopposite the mouths of the river Gomera, which disembogues in the\nMediterranean.So\nfar as natural resources are concerned, Penon de Velez is a mere rock,\nand a part of the year is obliged to be supplied with fresh water from\nthe mainland.Immediately opposite to the continent is the city of\nGomera (or Badis), the ancient Parientina, or perhaps the Acra of\nPtolemy, afterwards called Belis, and by the Spaniards, Velez de la\nGomera.The name Gomera, according to J.A.Conde, is derived from the\ncelebrated Arab tribe of the Gomeres, who flourished in Africa and Spain\nuntil the last Moorish kings of Granada.Count Graberg pretends Gomera\nnow contains three thousand inhabitants!whilst other writers, and of\nlater date, represent this ancient city, which has flourished and played\nan important part through many ages, as entirely abandoned, and the\nabode of serpents and hyaenas.Gellis is a small port, six miles east of\nVelez de Gomera.Tegaza is a small town and port, at two miles or less from the sea near\nPescadores Point, inhabited mostly by fishermen, and containing a\nthousand souls.The provinces of Rif and Garet, containing these maritime towns are rich\nand highly cultivated, but inhabited by a warlike and semi-barbarous\nrace of Berbers, over whom the Emperor exercises an extremely precarious\nauthority.Among these tribes, Abd-el-Kader sought refuge and support\nwhen he was obliged to retire from Algeria, and, where he defied all the\npower of the Imperial government for several months.Had the Emir\nchosen, he could have remained in Rif till this time; but he determined\nto try his strength with the Sultan in a pitch battle, which should\ndecide his fate.The savage Rifians assemble for barter and trade on market-days, which\nare occasions of fierce and incessant quarrels among themselves, when it\nis not unusual for two or three persons to be left dead on the spot.Should any unfortunate vessel strike on these coasts, the crew find\nthemselves in the hands of inhuman wreckers.No European traveller has\never visited these provinces, and we may state positively that\njourneying here is more dangerous than in the farthest wastes of the\nSahara.Spanish renegades, however, are found among them, who have\nescaped from the _praesidios_, or penal settlements.The Rif country is\nfull of mines, and is bounded south by one of the lesser chains of the\nAtlas running parallel with the coast.Forests of cork clothe the\nmountain-<DW72>s; the Berbers graze their herds and flocks in the deep\ngreen valleys, and export quantities of skins.Tetuan, the Yagath of the Romans, situate at the opening of the Straits\nof Gibraltar, four or five miles from the sea, upon the declivity of a\nhill and within two small ranges of mountains, is a fine, large, rich\nand mercantile city of the province of Hasbat.It has a resident\ngovernor of considerable power and consequence, the name of the present\nfunctionary being Hash-Hash, who has long held the appointment, and\nenjoys great influence near the Sultan.Half a mile east of the city\npasses from the south Wad Marteen, (the Cus of Marmol) which disembogues\ninto the sea; on its banks is the little port of Marteen or Marteel, not\nquite two miles distant from the coast, and about three from the city,\nwhere a good deal of commerce is carried on, small vessels, laden with\nthe produce of Barbary, sailing thence to Spain, Gibraltar, and even\nFrance and Italy.The population of Tetouan is from nine to twelve\nthousand souls, including, besides Moors and Arabs, four thousand Jews,\ntwo thousand <DW64>s, and eight thousand Berbers.The streets are\ngenerally formed into arcades, or covered bazaars.The Jews have a separate quarter; their women are celebrated for their\nbeauty.The suburbs are adorned with fine gardens, and olive and vine\nplantations.Orange groves, or rather orange forests, extend for miles\naround, yielding their golden treasures.A great export of oranges could\nbe established here, which might be conveyed overland to India.Altogether, Tetuan is one of the most respectable coast-cities of\nMorocco, though it has no port immediately adjoining it.Its\nfortifications are only strong enough to resist the attack of hostile\nBerbers.The town is about two-thirds of a day\'s journey from Tangier,\nsouth-east.A fair day\'s journey would be, in Morocco, upwards of thirty\nEnglish miles, but a good deal depends upon the season of the year when\nyou travel.Ceuta is considered to be Esilissa of Ptolemy, and was once the capital\nof Mauritania Tingitana.The Arabs call it Sebat and Sebta, _i.e._,\n"seven," after the Romans, who called it _Septem fratres_, and the\nGreeks the same, apparently on account of the seven mountains, which are\nin the neighbourhood.Ceuta, or Sebta, is evidently the modern form of\nthis classic name.It is a very ancient city and celebrated fortress,\nsituate fourteen miles south of Gibraltar, nearly opposite to it, as a\nspecies of rival stronghold, and placed upon a peninsula, which detaches\nitself from the continent on the east, and turns then to the north.The\ncity extends over the tongue of land nearest the continent; the citadel\noccupies Monte-del-Acho, called formerly Jibel-el-Mina, a name still\npreserved in Almina, a suburb to the south-east.In the beginning of the eighth century, Ceuta, which was inhabited by\nthe Goths, passed into the hands of the Arabs, who made it a point of\ndeparture for the expeditions into Spain.It was conquered by the\npowerful Arab family of the Ben-Hamed, one of whom, called Mohammed\nEdris, invaded Spain, and, after several conquests, was proclaimed King\nof Cordova, in A.D.1,000,\n\nOn 21st of August, 1415, the Portuguese conquered it, and it was the\nfirst place which they occupied in Africa.In 1578, at the death of Don\nSebastian, Ceuta passed with Portugal and the rest of the colonies into\nthe power of Spain; and when, in 1640, the Portuguese recovered their\nindependence, the Spaniards were left masters of Ceuta, which continues\nstill in their hands, but is of no utility to them except as a\n_praesidio_, which makes the fourth penal settlement possessed by them\non this coast.Ceuta contains a garrison of two or three thousand men.The free\npopulation amounts to some five or six thousand.It has a small and\ninsecure port.Here is the famed Gibel Zaterit, "Monkey\'s promontory,"\nor "Ape\'s Hill," which has occasioned the ingenious fable, that,\ninasmuch as there are no monkeys in any part of Europe except Gibraltar,\ndirectly opposite to this rock, where also monkeys are found, there must\nnecessarily be a subterranean passage beneath the sea, by which they\npass and re-pass to opposite sides of the Straits, and maintain a\nfriendly and uninterrupted intercourse between the brethren of Africa\nand Europe.Anciently, the mountains hereabouts formed the African\npillars of Hercules opposite to Gibraltar, which may be considered the\nEuropean pillar of that respectable hero of antiquity.Passing Tangier after a day\'s journey, we come to Arzila or Asila, in\nthe province of Hasbat, which is an ancient Berber city, and which, when\nconquered by the Romans, was named first Zilia and afterwards Zulia,\n_Constantia Zilis_.It is placed on the naked shores of the Atlantic,\nand has a little port.Whilst possessed by the Portuguese, it was a\nplace of considerable strength, but its fortifications being, as usual,\nneglected by the Moors, are now rapidly decaying.[20] The population is\nabout one thousand.The next\ntown on the Atlantic, after another day\'s journey southwards, is El\nAraish, _i.e._, the trellices of vines; vulgarly called Laratsh.This\ncity replaces the ancient Liscas or Lixus and Lixa, whose ruins are\nnear.The Arabs call it El-Araish Beai-Arous, _i.e._, the vineyards of\nthe Beni-Arous, a powerful tribe, who populate the greater part of the\ndistrict of Azgar, of which it is the capital and the residence of the\nGovernor.It was, probably, built by this tribe about 1,200 or 1,300,\nAD.El-Araish contains a population of 2,700 Moors, and 1,300 Jews, or\n4,000 souls; but others give only 2,000 for the whole amount, of which\n250 are Jews.The town is situate upon\na small promontory stretching into the sea, and along the mouth of the\nriver Cos, or Luccos (Loukkos), which forms a secure port, but of so\ndifficult access, that vessels of two hundred tons can scarcely enter\nit.In winter, the roadstead is very bad; [21] the houses are\nsubstantially built; and the fortifications are good, because made by\nthe Spaniards, who captured this place in 1610, but it was re-taken by\nMuley Ishmael in 1689.In the\nenvirons, cotton is cultivated, and charcoal is made from the Araish\nforest of cork-trees.El-Araish exports cork, wool, skins, bark, beans,\nand grain, and receives in exchange iron, cloth, cottons, muslins, sugar\nand tea.The lions and panthers of the mountains of Beni Arasis\nsometimes descend to the plains to drink, or carry off a supper of a\nsheep or bullock.Azgar, the name of this district, connects it with one\nof the powerful tribes of the Touaricks; and, probably, a section of\nthis tribe of Berbers were resident here at a very early period (at the\nsame time the Berber term _ayghar_ corresponds to the Arabic _bahira_,\nand signifies "plain.")The ancient Lixus deserves farther mention on account of the interest\nattached to its coins, a few of which remain, although but very recently\ndeciphered by archeologists.There are five classes of them, and all\nPhoenician, although the city now under Roman rule, represents the\nvineyard riches of this part of ancient Mauritania by two bunches of\ngrapes, so that, after nearly three thousand years, the place has\nretained its peculiarity of producing abundant vines, El-Araish, being\n"the vine trellices;" others have stamped on them "two ears of corn" and\n"two fishes," representing the fields of corn waving on the plains of\nMorocco, and the fish (shebbel especially) which fills its northern\nrivers.Strabo says:--"Mauritania generally, excepting a small part desert, is\nrich and fertile, well watered with rivers and washed with lakes;\nabounding in all things, and producing trees of great dimensions."Another writer adds "this country produces a species of the vine whose\ntrunk the extended arms of two men cannot embrace, and which yields\ngrapes of a cubit\'s length.""At this city," says Pliny, "was the palace\nof Antaeus, and his combat with Hercules and the gardens of Hesperides."Mehedia or Mamora, and sometimes, Nuova Mamora, is situate upon the\nnorth-western <DW72> of a great hill, some four feet above the sea, upon\nthe left bank of the mouth of the Sebon, and at the edge of the\ncelebrated plain and forest of Mamora, belonging to the province of\nBeni-Hassan.According to Marmol, Mamora was built by Jakob-el-Mansour\nto defend the embouchure of the river.It was captured by the Spaniards\nin 1614, and retaken by the Moors in 1681.The Corsairs formerly took\nrefuge here.It is now a weak and miserable place, commanded by an old\ncrumbling-down castle.There are five or six hundred fishermen,\noccupying one hundred and fifty cabins, who make a good trade of the\nShebbel salmon; it has a very small garrison.The forest of Mamora,\ncontains about sixty acres of fine trees, among which are some splendid\noaks, all suitable for naval construction.Salee or Sala, a name which this place bore antecedently to the Roman\noccupation, is a very ancient city, situate upon the right bank of the\nriver Bouragrag, and near its mouth.This place was captured in 1263, by\nAlphonso the Wise, King of Castille, who was a short time after\ndispossessed of his conquest by the King of Fez; and the Moorish Sultans\nhave kept it to the present time, though the city itself has often\nattempted to throw off the imperial yoke.The modern Salee is a large\ncommercial and well-fortified city of the province of Beni-Hassan.Its\nport is sufficiently large, but, on account of the little depth of\nwater, vessels of large burden cannot enter it.The houses and public\nplaces are tolerably well-built.The town is fortified by a battery of\ntwenty-four pieces of cannon fronting the sea, and a redoubt at the\nentrance of the river.What navy the Maroquines have, is still laid up\nhere, but the dock-yard is now nearly deserted, and the few remaining\nships are unserviceable.The population, all of whom are Mahometans, are\nnow, as in Corsair times, the bitterest and most determined enemies of\nChristians, and will not permit a Christian or Jew to reside among them.The amount of this population, and that of Rabat, is thus given,\n\n  _Salee Rabat_\n  Graeberg         23,000    27,000\n  Washington       9,000    21,000\n  Arlett          14,000    24,000\n\nbut it is probably greatly exaggerated.A resident of this country reduces the population of Salee as low as two\nor three thousand.For many years, the port of Salee was the rendezvous\nof the notorious pirates of Morocco, who, together with the city of\nRabat, formed a species of military republic almost independent of the\nSultan; these Salee rovers were at once the most ferocious and\ncourageous in the world.Time was, when these audacious freebooters lay\nunder Lundy Island in the British Channel, waiting to intercept British\ntraders!"Salee," says Lempriere, "was a place of good commerce, till,\naddicting itself entirely to piracy, and revolting from the allegiance\nto its Sovereign, Muley Zidan, that prince in the year 1648, dispatched\nan embassy to King Charles 1, of England, requesting him to send a\nsquadron of men-of-war to lie before the town, while he attacked by\nland."This request being acceded to, the city was soon reduced, the\nfortifications demolished, and the leaders of the rebellion put to\ndeath.The year following, the Emperor sent another ambassador to\nEngland, with a present of Barbary horses and three hundred Christian\nslaves.Rabat, or Er-Rabat, and on some of the foreign maps Nuova Sale, is a\nmodern city of considerable extent, densely populated, strong and\nwell-built, belonging to the province of Temsna.It is situated on the\ndeclivity of a hill, opposite to Salee, on the other side of the river,\nor left side of the Bouragrag, which is as broad as the Thames at\nLondon Bridge, and might be considered as a great suburb, or another\nquarter of the same city.It was built by the famous Yakob-el-Mansour,\nnephew of Abd-el-Moumen, and named by him Rabat-el-Fatah, _i.e._, "camp\nof victory," by which name it is now often mentioned.The walls of Rabat enclose a large space of ground, and the town is\ndefended on the seaside by three forts, erected some years ago by an\nEnglish renegade, and furnished with ordnance from Gibraltar.Among the\npopulation are three or four thousand Jews, some of them of great wealth\nand consequence.The merchants are active and intelligent, carrying on\ncommerce with Fez, and other places of the interior, as also with the\nforeign ports of Genoa, Gibraltar, and Marseilles.In the middle ages,\nthe Genoese had a great trade with Rabat, but this trade is now removed\nto Mogador, Many beautiful gardens and plantations adorn the suburbs,\ndeserving even the name of "an earthly paradise."The Moors of Rabat are mostly from Spain, expelled thence by the\nSpaniards.The famous Sultan, Almanzor, intended that Rabat should be\nhis capital.His untenanted mausoleum is placed here, in a separate and\nsacred quarter.This prince, surnamed "the victorious," (Elmansor,) was\nhe who expelled the Moravedi from Spain.He is the Nero of Western\nAfrica, as Keatinge says, their "King Arthur."Tradition has it that\nElmansor went in disguise to Mecca, and returned no more.Mankind love\nthis indefinite and obscure end of their heroes.Moses went up to the\nmountain to die there in eternal mystery.At a short distance from Rabat\nis Shella, or its ruins, a small suburb situated on the summit of a\nhill, which contains the tombs of the royal family of the Beni-Merini,\nand the founder of Rabat, and is a place of inviolate sanctity, no\ninfidel being permitted to enter therein.Monsieur Chenier supposes\nShella to have been the site of the metropolis of the Carthaginian\ncolonies.Of these two cities, on the banks of the Wad-Bouragrag, Salee was,\naccording to D\'Anville, always a place of note as at the present time,\nand the farthest Roman city on the coast of the Atlantic, being the\nfrontier town of the ancient Mauritania Tingitana.Some pretend that all\nthe civilization which has extended itself beyond this point is either\nMoorish, or derived from European colonists.The river Wad-Bouragrag is\nsomewhat a natural line of demarcation, and the products and animals of\nthe one side differ materially from those of the other, owing to the\nnumber and less rapid descent of the streams on the side of the north,\nand so producing more humidity, whilst the south side, on the contrary,\nis of a higher and drier soil.Fidallah, or Seid Allah, _i.e_., "grace," or "gift of God," is a\nmaritime village of the province of Temsa, founded by the Sultan\nMohammed in 1773.It is a strong place, and surrounded with walls.Fidallah is situated on a vast plain, near the river Wad Millah, where\nthere is a small port, or roadstead, to which the corsairs were wont to\nresort when they could not reach Salee, long before the village was\nbuilt, called Mersa Fidallah.The place contains a thousand souls,\nmostly in a wretched condition.Sidi Mohammed, before he built Mogador,\nhad the idea of building a city here; the situation is indeed\ndelightful, surrounded with fertility.Dar-el-Beida (or Casa-Blanco, "white house,") is a small town, formerly\nin possession of the Portuguese, who built it upon the ruins of Anfa or\nAnafa, [22] which they destroyed in 1468.They, however, scarcely\nfinished it when they abandoned it in 1515.Dar-el-Beida is situate on\nthe borders of the fertile plains of the province of Shawiya, and has a\nsmall port, formed by a river and a spacious bay on the Atlantic.The\nRomans are said to have built the ancient Anafa, in whose time it was a\nconsiderable place, but now it scarcely contains above a thousand\ninhabitants, and some reduce them to two hundred.Sidi Mohammed\nattempted this place, and the present Sultan endeavoured to follow up\nthese efforts.A little commerce with Europe is carried on here.The bay\nwill admit of vessels of large burden anchoring in safety, except when\nthe wind blows strong from the north-west.Casa Blanco is two days\njourney from Rabat, and two from Azamor, or Azemmour, which is an\nancient and fine city of the province of Dukaila, built by the Amazigh\nBerbers, in whose language it signifies "olives."It is situate upon a\nhill, about one hundred feet above the sea, and distant half a mile from\nthe shore, not far from the mouth of the Wad-Omm-er-Rbia (or Omm-Erbegh)\non its southern bank, and is everywhere surrounded by a most fertile\nsoil.Azamor contains now about eight or nine hundred inhabitants, but\nformerly was much more populated.The Shebbel salmon is the principal\ncommerce, and a source of immense profit to the town.The river is very\ndeep and rapid, so that the passage with boats is both difficult and\ndangerous.It is frequently of a red colour, and charged with slime like\nthe Nile at the period of its inundations.The tide is felt five or six\nleagues up the river, according to Chenier.Formerly, vessels of every\nsize entered the river, but now its mouth has a most difficult bar of\nsand, preventing large vessels going up, like nearly all the Maroquine\nports situate on the mouths, or within the rivers.Azamor was taken by the Portuguese under the command of the Duke of\nBraganza in 1513 who strengthened it by fortifications, the walls of\nwhich are still standing; but it was abandoned a century afterwards, the\nIndies having opened a more lucrative field of enterprise than these\nbarren though honourable conquests on the Maroquine coast.This place is\nhalf a day\'s journey, or about fourteen miles from Mazagran, _i.the\nabove Amayeeghs, an extremely ancient and strong castle, erected on a\npeninsula at the bottom of a spacious and excellent bay.It was rebuilt\nby the Portuguese in 1506, who gave it the name of Castillo Real.The\nsite has been a centre of population from the remotest period, chiefly\nBerbers, whose name it still bears.The Arabs, however, call it\nEl-Bureeja, i.e., "the citadel."The Portuguese abandoned it in 1769;\nMazagran was the last stronghold which they possessed in Morocco.The\ntown is well constructed, and has a wall twelve feet thick, strengthened\nwith bastions.There is a small port, or dock, on the north side of the\ntown, capable of admitting small vessels, and the roadstead is good,\nwhere large vessels can anchor about two miles off the shore.Its\ntraffic is principally with Rabat, but there is also some export trade\nto foreign parts.[23] After\nproceeding two days south-west, you arrive at Saffee, or properly\nAsafee, called by the natives Asfee, and anciently Soffia or Saffia, is\na city of great antiquity, belonging to the province of Abda, and was\nbuilt by the Carthaginians near Cape Pantin.Its site lies between two\nhills, in a valley which is exposed to frequent inundations.The\nroadstead of Saffee is good and safe during summer, and its shipping\nonce enabled it to be the centre of European commerce on the Atlantic\ncoast.The population amounts to about one thousand, including a number\nof miserable Jews.The walls of Saffee are massy and high.The\nPortuguese captured this city in 1508, voluntarily abandoning it in\n1641.The country around is not much cultivated, and presents melancholy\ndeserts; but there is still a quantity of corn grown.About forty miles\ndistant, S.E., is a large salt lake.Saffee is one and a half day\'s\njourney from Mogador.Equidistant between Mazagran and Saffee is the small town of El-Waladia,\nsituate on an extensive plain.Persons report that near this spot is a\nspacious harbour, or lagune, sufficiently capacious to contain four or\nfive hundred sail of the line; but, unfortunately, the entrance is\nobstructed by some rocks, which, however, it is added, might easily be\nblown up.The lagune is also exposed to winds direct for the ocean.The\ntown, enclosed within a square wall, and containing very few\ninhabitants, is supposed to have been built in the middle of the\nseventeenth century by the Sultan Waleed.Daniel journeyed to the garden.This brings us to Mogador, which, with Aghadir, have already been\ndescribed.CHAPTER V.\n\nDescription of the Imperial Cities or Capitals of the Empire.--\nEl-Kesar.--Mequinez.--Fez.--Morocco.--The province of Tafilett, the\nbirth-place of the present dynasty of the Shereefs.The royal or capitals of the interior now demand our attention, which\nare El-Kesar, Mequinez, Fez, and Morocco.El-Kesar, or Al-Kesar, [24] styled also El-Kesue-Kesar, is so named and\ndistinguished because it owes its enlargement to the famous Sultan of\nFez, Almansor, who improved and beautified it about the year 1180, and\ndesigned this city as a magazine and rendezvous of troops for the great\npreparations he was making at the time for the conquest of Granada.El-Kesar is in the province of the Gharb, and situate on the southern\nbank of the Luccos; here is a deep and rapid stream, flowing W.The town is nearly as large as Tetuan, but the streets are dirty and\nnarrow, and many of the houses in a ruinous condition, This fortified\nplace was once adorned by some fifteen mosques, but only two or three\nare now fit for service.The population does not exceed four or five\nthousand souls, and some think this number over-estimated.The surrounding country is flat meadowland, but flooded after the rains,\nand producing fatal fevers, though dry and hot enough in summer.The\nsuburban fields are covered with gardens and orchards.It was at\nEl-Kesar, where, in A.D.1578, the great battle of The Three Kings came\noff, because, besides the Portuguese King, Don Sebastian, two Moorish\nprinces perished on this fatal day.But one of them, Muley Moluc, died\nvery ill in a litter, and was not killed in the fight; his death,\nhowever, was kept a secret till the close of the battle, in order that\nthe Moors might not be discouraged.With their prince, Don Sebastian,\nperished the flower of the Portuguese nobility and chivalry of that\ntime.War, indeed, was found "a dangerous game" on that woeful day: both\nfor princes and nobles, and many a poor soul was swept away\n\n  "Floating in a purple tide."But the "trade of war" has been carried on ever since, and these\nlessons, written in blood, are as useless to mankind as those dashed off\nby the harmless pen of the sentimental moralist.El-Kesar is placed in\nLatitude, 35 deg.1 10" N.; Longitude, 5 deg.49\' 30" W.\n\nMequinez, [25] in Arabic, Miknas (or Miknasa), is a royal residence, and\ncity of the province of Fez, situate upon a hill in the midst of a\nwell-watered and most pleasant town, blessed with a pure and serene air.The city of Miknas is both large and finely built, of considerable\ninterest and of great antiquity.It was founded by the tribe of Berbers\nMeknasab, a fraction of the Zenatah, in the middle of the tenth century,\nand called Miknasat, hence is derived its present name.The modern town\nis surrounded with a triple wall thirteen feet high and three thick,\nenclosing a spacious area.This wall is mounted with batteries to awe\nthe Berbers of the neighbouring mountains.The population amounts to\nabout twenty thousand souls, (some say forty or fifty thousand) in which\nare included about nine thousand <DW64> troops, constituting the greater\nportion of the Imperial guard.Two thousand of these black troops are in\ncharge of the royal treasures, estimated at some fifty millions of\ndollars, and always increasing.These treasures consist of jewels, bars\nof gold and silver, and money in the two precious metals, the greater\npart being Spanish and Mexican dollars.The inhabitants are represented as being the most polished of the Moors,\nkind and hospitable to strangers.The palace of the Emperor is extremely\nsimple and elegant, all the walls of which are _embroidered_ with the\nbeautiful stucco-work of Arabesque patterns, as pure and chaste as the\nfinest lace.The marble for the pillars was furnished from the ruins\nadjacent, called Kesar Faraoun, "Castle of Pharoah" (a name given to\nmost of the old ruins of Morocco, of whose origin there is any doubt).During the times of piracy, there was here, as also at Morocco, a\nSpanish hospitium for the ransom and recovery of Christian slaves.Even\nbefore Mequinez was constituted a royal city, it was a place of\nconsiderable trade and riches.Nothing of any peculiar value has been\ndiscovered among the extensive and ancient ruins about a mile distant,\nand which have furnished materials for the building of several royal\ncities; they are, however, supposed to be Roman.Scarcely a day\'s\njourney separates Mequinez from Fez.It is not usual for two royal\ncities to be placed so near together, but which must render their\nfortunes inseparable.According to some, the name Fas, which signifies in Arabia\na pickaxe, was given to it because one was found in digging its\nfoundations.Others derive it from Fetha, silver.It is no longer the\nmarvellous city described by Leo Africanus, yet its learning, wealth,\nand industry place it in the first rank of the cities of Morocco.During\nthe eighth century, the Arabs, masters of Tunis, of all Algeria, and the\nmaritime cities of Morocco, seemed to think only of invading Europe and\nconsolidating their power in Spain; but at this epoch, a descendant of\nAli and Fatima, Edris Ben Abdalluh, quitted Arabia, passed into Morocco,\nand established himself at Oualili, the capital, where he remained till\nhis death, and where he was buried.His character was generally known\nand venerated for its sanctity, and drew upon him the affectionate\nregard of the people, and all instinctively placed themselves near him\nas a leader of the Faithful, likely to put an end to anarchy, and\nestablish order in the Mussulman world.His son, Edris-Ben-Edris, who\ninherited his virtues and influence, offering a species of ancient\nprototype to Abd-el Kader and his venerable father, Mahadin, was the\nfirst _bona-fide_ Mussulman sovereign of the Maroquine empire, and\nfounded Fez.Fez is a most ancient centre of population, and had long been a famed\ncity, before Muley Edris, in the year A.D.807 (others in 793), gave it\nits present form and character.From that period, however, Fez [26] dates its modern celebrity and rank\namong the Mahometan capitals of the world, and especially as being the\nsecond city of Islamism, and the "palace of the Mussulmen Princes of the\nWest."That the Spanish philologists should make Fut, of the Prophet\nNahum, to be the ancient capital of Fez, is not remarkable, considering\nthe numerous bands of emigrants, who, emerging from the coast, wandered\nas far as the pillars of Hercules; and, besides, in a country like North\nAfrica, the theatre of so many revolutions, almost every noted city of\nthe present period has had its ancient form, from which it has been\nsuccessively changed.The modern capital is placed in a valley upon the gentle <DW72> of\nseveral hills by which it is surrounded, and whose heights are crowned\nwith lovely gardens breathing odoriferous sweets.Close by is a little\nriver, or a branch of the Tebou, named Wad-el-Juhor, or "streamlet,"\nwhich supplies the city with excellent water.The present buildings are divided into old and new Fez.The streets are\nso narrow that two men on horseback could scarcely ride abreast; they\nare, besides, very dark, and often arched over.Colonel Scott represents\nsome of the streets, however, as a mile in length.The houses are high,\nbut not handsome.The shops are numerous and much frequented, though not\nvery fine in appearance.Fez contains no less than seven hundred\nmosques, fifty of which are superb, and ornamented with fine columns of\nmarble; there is, besides, a hundred or more of very small and ill-built\nmosques, or rather, houses of prayer.The most famous of these temples\nof worship is El-Karoubin (or El-Karouiin), supported by three hundred\npillars.In this is preserved the celebrated library of antiquity,\nwhere, it is pretended, ancient Greek and Latin authors are to be found\nin abundance with the lost books of Titus Livy.[27] But the mosque the more\nfrequented and venerated, is that dedicated to the founder of the city,\nMuley Edris, whose ashes repose within its sacred enclosure.So\nexcessive is this "hero-worship" for this great sultan, that the people\nconstantly invoke his name in their prayers instead of that of the\nDeity.The mausoleum of this sacro-santo prince is inviolable and\nunapproachable.The university of Fez was formally much celebrated, but\nlittle of its learning now remains.Its once high-minded orthodox mulahs\nare now succeeded by a fanatic and ignorant race of marabouts.Nevertheless, the few _hommes de lettres_ found in Morocco are\ncongregated here, and the literature of the empire is concentrated in\nthis city.Seven large public schools are in full activity, besides\nnumbers of private seminaries of instruction.The low humour of the\ntalebs, and the fanaticism of the people, are unitedly preserved and\ndeveloped in this notorious doggerel couplet, universally diffused\nthroughout Morocco:--\n\n  _Ensara fee Senara\n  Elhoud fee Sefoud_\n\n  "Christians on the hook\n  Jews on the spit," or\n\n  "Let Christians be hooked,\n  And let Jews be cooked."The great division of the Arabic into eastern and western dialects makes\nlittle real difference in a practical point of view.The Mogrebbin, or\nwestern, is well understood by all travellers, and, of course, by all\nscholars from the East.The palace of the Sultan is not large, but is handsome.There are\nnumerous baths, and an hospital for the mad or incurable.The population\nwas estimated, not long ago, at 88,000 souls, of which there were 60,000\nMoors and Arabs (the Moors being chiefly immigrants from Spain), 10,000\nBerbers, 8,000 Jews, and 10,000 <DW64>s.But this amount has been\nreduced to 40,000, or even 30,000; and the probability is, the present\npopulation of Fez does not by any means, exceed 50,000, if it reaches\nthat number.Nearly all the Jews reside in the new city, which, by its\nposition, dominates the old one.The inhabitants of Fez, in spite of\ntheir learning and commerce, are distinguished for their fanaticism; and\nan European, without an escort of troops, cannot walk in the streets\nunless disguised.It was lately the head-quarters of the fanatics who\npreached "the holy war," and involved the Emperor in hostilities with\nthe French.The immense trade of every kind carried on at Fez gives it almost the\nair of an European city.In the great square, called Al-Kaisseriah, is\nexhibited all the commerce of Europe and Africa--nay, even of the whole\nworld.The crowd of traffickers here assemble every day as at a fair.Fez has two annual caravans; one leaves for Central Africa, or\nTimbuctoo; and another for Mecca, or the caravan of pilgrims.The two\ngreat stations and rendezvous points of the African caravan are Tafilett\nand Touat.The journey from Fez to Timbuctoo occupies about ninety days.The Mecca caravan proceeds the same route as far as Touat, and then\nturns bank north-east to Ghadames, Fezzan, and Angelah, and thence to\nAlexandria, which it accomplishes in four or five, to six months.All\ndepends on the inclination of the Shereef, or Commandant, of the\ncaravan; but the journey from Fez to Alexandria cannot, by the quickest\ncaravan, be accomplished in much less time than three months and a half,\nor one hundred days.The value of the investments in this caravan has\nbeen estimated at a million of dollars; for the faithful followers of\nthe Prophet believe, with us, that godliness is profitable in the life\nthat now is, as well as in that which is to come.Fez is surrounded with a vast wall, but which is in decay.It applies almost to every Moorish city and public building in\nNorth Africa.And yet the faith of the false prophet is as strong as\never, and with time and hoary age seems to strike its roots deeper into\nthe hearts of its simple, but enthusiastic and duped devotees!The city has seven gates, and two castles, at the east and west, form\nits main defence.These castles are very ancient, and are formed and\nsupported by square walls about sixty feet in front, Ali Bey says,\nsubterraneous passages are reported to exist between these castles and\nthe city; and, whenever the people revolt against the Sultan, cannon are\nplanted on the castles with a few soldiers as their guard.The\nfortifications, or Bastiles, of Paris, we see, therefore, were no new\ninvention of Louis Philippe to awe the populace.The maxims of a subtle\npolicy are instructive in despotism of every description.The constituted authorities of Fez are like those of every city of\nMorocco.The Governor is the lieutenant of the sovereign, exercising the\nexecutive power; the Kady, or supreme judge, is charged with the\nadministration of the law, and the Al-Motassen fixes the price of\nprovisions, and decides all the questions of trade and customs.There\nare but few troops at Fez, for it is not a strong military possession;\non the contrary, it is commanded by accessible heights and is exposed to\na _coup-de-main_.Fez, indeed, could make no _bona-fide_ resistance to an European army.The manufactures are principally woollen haiks, silk handkerchiefs,\nslippers and shoes of excellent leather, and red caps of felt, commonly\ncalled the fez; the first fabrication of these red caps appears to have\nbeen in this city.The Spanish Moorish immigrants introduced the mode of\ndressing goat and sheep-skins, at first known by the name of Cordovan\nfrom Cordova; but, since the Moorish forced immigration, they have\nacquired the celebrated name of Morocco.The chief food of the people is\nthe national Moorish dish of _cuscasou_, a fine grained paste, cooked by\nsteam, with melted fat, oil, or other liquids poured upon the dish, and\nsometimes garnished with pieces of fowl and other meat.A good deal of\nanimal food is consumed, but few vegetables.The climate is mild in the\nwinter, but suffocating with heat in the summer.This city is placed in\nlatittude 34 deg.6\' 3" N. longitude 4 deg.Morocco, or strictly in Arabic, _Maraksh_, which signifies "adorned,"\nis the capital of the South, and frequently denominated the capital of\nthe Empire, but it is only a _triste_ shadow of its former greatness.It\nis sometimes honoured with the title of "the great city," or "country."Morocco occupies an immense area of ground, being seven miles in\ncircumference, the interior of which is covered with heaps of ruins or\nmore pleasantly converted into gardens.Morocco was built in 1072 or\n1073 by the famous Yousel-Ben-Tashfin, King of Samtuna, and of the\ndynasty of the Almoravedi, or Marabouts.Its site is that of an ancient\ncity, Martok, founded in the remotest periods of the primitive Africans,\nor aboriginal Berbers, in whose language it signifies a place where\neverything good and pleasant was to be found in abundance.Bocanum Hermerum of the Ancients was also near the site of this capital,\nMorocco attained its greatest prosperity shortly after its foundation,\nand since then it has only declined.In the twelfth century, under the\nreign of Jakoub Almanzor, there were 10,000 houses and 700,000 souls,\n(if indeed we can trust their statistics); but, at the present time,\nthere are only some forty to fifty thousand inhabitants, including 4,000\nShelouhs and 5,000 Jews.Ali Bey, in 1804, estimates its population at\nonly 30,000, and Captain Washington in 1830 at 80, or 100,000.This vast\ncity lies at the foot of the Atlas, or about fourteen miles distant,\nspread over a wide and most lovely plain of the province of Rhamma,\nwatered by the river Tensift, six miles from the gates of the capital.The mosques are numerous and rich, the principal of which are\nEl-Kirtubeeah, of elegant architecture with an extremely lofty minaret;\nEl-Maazin, which is three hundred years old, and a magnificent building;\nand Benious, built nearly seven hundred years ago of singular\nconstruction, uniting modern and ancient architecture.The mosque of the\npatron saint is Sidi Belabbess.Nine gates open in the city-walls; these\nare strong and high, and flanked with towers, except on the south east\nwhere the Sultan\'s palace stands.The streets are crooked, of uneven\nwidth, unpaved, and dirty in winter, and full of dust in summer.The Kaessaria, or\ncommercial quarter, is extensive, exhibiting every species of\nmanufacture and natural product.The manufactures of this, as of other large places, are principally,\nsilks, embroidery, and leather.The merchants of Mogador have magazines\nhere; this capital has also its caravans, which trade to the interior,\npassing through Wadnoun to the south.The Imperial palace is without the city and fortified with strong walls.There are large gardens attached, in one of which the Emperor receives\nhis merchants and the diplomatic agents.The air of the country, at the\nfoot of the Atlas, is pure and salubrious.The city is well supplied\nwith water from an aqueduct, connecting it with the river Tensift, which\nflows from the gorges of the Atlas.But the inhabitants, although they\nenjoy this inestimable blessing in an African climate, are not famous\nfor their cleanliness; Morocco, if possessing any particular character,\nstill must be considered as a commercial city, for its learning is at a\nvery low ebb.Its interior wears a deeply dejected, nay a profoundly\ngloomy aspect."Horrendum incultumque specus."and the European merchants, when they come up here are glad to get away\nas soon as possible.Outside the city, there is a suburb appropriated to lepers, a\nLazar-house of leprosy, which afflicting and loathsome disease descends\nfrom father to son through unbroken generations; the afflicted cannot\nenter the city, and no one dare approach their habitations.The Emperor\nusually resides for a third portion of his time at Morocco the rest at\nFez and Mequinez.Whenever his Imperial Highness has anything\ndisagreeable with foreign European powers, he comes down from Fez to\nMorocco, to get out of the way.Occasionally, he travels from town to\ntown of the interior, to awe by his presence the ever restless\ndisaflfection of the tribes, or excite their loyalty for the Shereefian\nthrone.35" 30\', W.\n\nTafilett consists of a group of towns or villages, situate on the\nsouth-eastern side of the Atlas, which may he added to the royal cities,\nbeing inhabited in part by the Imperial family, and is the birth-place\nof their sovereign power--emphatically called Beladesh-Sherfa, "country\nof the Shereefs."The country was anciently called Sedjelmasa, and\nretained this name up to 1530 A.D., when the principal city acquired the\napellation of Tafilett, said to be derived from an Arab immigrant,\ncalled Filal, who improved the culture of dates, and whose name on this\naccount, under the Berber form of Tafilett, was given to a plantation of\ndates cultivated by him, and then passed to the surrounding districts.At the present time, Tafilett consists of a group of fortified or\ncastle-built villages, environed by walls mounted with square towers,\nwhich extend on both sides of the river Zig.There is also a castle, or\nrather small town, upon the left side of the river, called by the\nordinary name of Kesar, which is in the hands of the Shereefs, and\ninhabited entirely by the family of the Prophet.The principal and most\nflourishing place was a long time called Tafilett, but is now according\nto Callie, Ghourlan, and the residence of the Governor of the province\nof Ressant, a town distinguished by a magnificent gateway surrounded\nwith various  Dutch tiles, symmetrically arranged in a diamond\npattern.This traveller calls the district of Tafilett, Afile or Afilel.It is probable that from the rains of the ancient Sedjelmasa, some of\nthe modern villages have been constructed.The towns and districts of\nTafilett once formed an independent kingdom.The present population has\nbeen estimated at some ten thousand, but this is entirely conjectural.Callie mentions the four towns of Ghourlan, L\'Eksebi, Sosso and Boheim\nas containing eleven or twelve thousand souls.The soil of Tafilett is\nlevel, composed of sand of an ashy grey, productive of corn, and all\nsorts of European fruits and vegetables.The natives have fine sheep,\nwith remarkably white wool.The manufactures, which are in woollen and\nsilk, are called Tafiletes.Besides being a rendezvous of caravans, radiating through all parts of\nthe Sahara, Tafilett is a great mart of traffic in the natural products\nof the surrounding countries.A fine bridge spans the Zig, built by a\nSpaniard.When the Sultan of Morocco finds any portion of his family\ninclined to be naughty, he sends them to Tafilett, as we are wont to\nsend troublesome people to "Jericho."This, at any rate, is better than\ncutting off their heads, which, from time immemorial, has been the\ninvariable practice of African and Oriental despots.The Maroquine\nprinces may be thankful they have Tafilett as a place of exile.The\nEmperors never visit Tafilett except as dethroned exiles.A journey to\nsuch a place is always attended with danger; and were the Sultan to\nescape, he would find, on his return, the whole country in revolt.Regarding these royal cities, we sum up our observations.The destinies\nof Fez and Mequinez are inseparable.United, they contain one hundred\nthousand inhabitants, the most polished and learned in the Empire.Fez\nis the city of arts and learning, that is of what remains of the once\nfamous and profound Moorish doctors of Spain.Mequinez is the strong\nplace of the Empire, an emporium of arms and imperial Cretsures.The two cities are the capitals of two kingdoms,\nnever yet amalgamated.Mary moved to the bathroom.The present dynasty belongs not to Fez, but to\nMorocco; though a dynasty of Shereefs, they are Shereefs of the south,\nand African blood flows in their veins.The Sultan generally is obliged to give a preference to Fez for a\nresidence, because his presence is necessary to maintain the allegiance\nof the north country, and to curb its powerful warparty, his son in the\nmeanwhile being left Governor during his absence.But all these royal\ncities are on the decline, the "sere and yellow leaf" of a well nigh\ndefunct civilization.Morocco is a huge shell of its former greatness, a\nmonster of Moresque dilapidations.France may awaken the slumbering\nenergies of the population of these once flourishing and august cities,\nbut left to themselves they are powerless, sinking under their own\nweight and uncouth encumbrances, and will rise no more till\nreconstructed by European hands.Description of the towns and cities of the Interior, and those of the\nKingdom of Fez.--Seisouan.--Wazen.--Zawiat.--Muley

the\ninterior, with some other remarkable places.First, these distinguished and well ascertained places in the kingdom of\nFez.Seisouan, or Sousan, is the capital of the Rif province, situate also on\nthe borders of the province of the Habat, and by the sources of a little\nriver which runs into the Mediterranean, near Cape Mazari.The town is\nsmall, but full of artizans and merchants.The country around is\nfertile, being well irrigated with streams.Sousan is the most\nbeautifully picturesque of all the Atlas range.Sofou, or Sofron, is a fine walled city, southeast of Fez, situate upon\nthe river Guizo; in a vast and well-watered plain near, are rich mines\nof fossil salt.Wazen, or Wazein, in the province of Azgar, and the region of the Gharb,\nis a small city without Walls, celebrated for being the residence of\nthe High Priest, or Grand Marabout of the Empire.This title is\nhereditary, and is now (or up to lately) possessed by the famous\nSidi-el-Haj-el-Araby-Ben-Ali, who, in his district, lives in a state of\nnearly absolute independence, besides exercising great influence over\npublic affairs.This saint, or priest, has, however, a rival at Tedda.The two popes together pretend to decide the fate of the Empire.The\ndistricts where these Grand Marabouts reside, are without governors,\nand the inhabitants pay no tribute into the imperial coffers, they are\nruled by their two priests under a species of theocracy.The Emperor\nnever attempts or dares to contest their privileges.Occasionally they\nappear abroad, exciting the people, and declaiming against the vices of\nthe times.His Moorish Majesty then feels himself ill at ease, until\nthey retire to their sanctuaries, and employs all his arts to effect\nthe object, protesting that he will be wholly guided by their councils\nin the future administration of the Empire.With this humiliation of\nthe Shereefs, they are satisfied, and kennel themselves into their\nsanctum-sanctorums.Zawiat-Muley-Driss, which means, retirement of our master, Lord Edris\n(Enoch) and sometimes called Muley Edris, is a far famed city of the\nprovince of Fez, and placed at the foot of the lofty mountains of\nTerhoun, about twenty-eight miles from Fez, north-west, amidst a most\nbeautiful country, producing all the necessaries and luxuries of human\nlife.The site anciently called Tuilet, was perhaps also the Volubilis\nof the ancients.Here is a sanctuary dedicated to the memory of Edris,\nprogenitor and founder of the dynasty of Edrisiti.The population, given by Graeberg, is nine thousand, but this is\nevidently exaggerated.Not far off, towards the west, are some\nmagnificent ruins of an ancient city, called Kesar Faraoun, or "Castle\nof Pharoah."Dubdu, called also Doubouton, is an ancient, large city, of the district\nof Shaous, and once the residence of an independent prince, but now\nfallen into decay on account of the sterility of its site, which is upon\nthe sides of a barren mountain.Dubdu is three days\' journey southeast\nof Fez, and one day from Taza, in the region of the Mulweeah.Taza is\nthe capital of the well-watered district of Haiaina, and one of the\nfinest cities in Morocco, in a most romantic situation, placed on a rock\nwhich is shaped like an island, and in presence of the lofty mountains\nof Zibel Medghara, to the south-west.Perhaps it is the Babba of the\nancients; a river runs round the town.The houses and streets are\nspacious, and there is a large mosque.The air is pure, and provisions\nare excellent.The population is estimated at ten or twelve thousand,\nwho are hospitable, and carry on a good deal of commerce with Tlemsen\nand Fez.Taza is two days from Fez, and four from Oushda.Oushda is the well-known frontier town, on the north-east, which\nacquired some celebrity during the late war.It is enclosed by the walls\nof its gardens, and is protected by a large fortress.The place contains\na population of from six hundred to one thousand Moors and Arabs.There\nis a mosque, as well as three chapels, dedicated to Santous.The houses,\nbuilt of clay, are low and of a wretched appearance; the streets are\nwinding, and covered with flints.The fortress, where the Kaed resides,\nis guarded in ordinary times by a dozen soldiers; but, were this force\nincreased, it could not be defended, in consequence of its dilapidated\ncondition.A spring of excellent water, at a little distance from\nOushda, keeps up the whole year round freshness and verdure in the\ngardens, by means of irrigation.Oushda is a species of oasis of the Desert of Angad, and the aridity of\nthe surrounding country makes these gardens appear delicious, melons,\nolives, and figs being produced in abundance.John went to the hallway.The distance between Tlemsen and Oushda is sixteen leagues, or about\nsixteen hours\' march for troops; Oushda is also four or five days from\nOran, and six days from Fez.The Desert commences beyond the Mulweeah,\nat more than forty leagues from Tlemsen.Like the Algerian Angad, which\nextends to the south of Tlemsen, it is of frightful sterility,\nparticularly in summer.In this season, one may march for six or eight\nhours without finding any water.It is impossible to carry on military\noperations in such a country during summer.On this account, Marshal\nBugeaud soon excavated Oushda and returned to the Tlemsen territory.Aghla is a town, or rather large village, of the district of Fez, where\nthe late Muley Suleiman occasionally resided.It is situated along the\nriver Wad Vergha, in a spacious and well-cultivated district.A great\nmarket of cattle, wool, and bees\'-wax, is held in the neighbourhood.The\ncountry abounds in lions; but, it is pretended, of such a cowardly race,\nthat a child can frighten them away.Hence the proverb addressed to a\npusillanimous individual, "You are as brave as the lions of Aghla, whose\ntails the calves eat."The Arabs certainly do occasionally run after\nlions with sticks, or throw stones at them, as we are accustomed to\nthrow stones at dogs.Nakhila, _i.e._, "little palm," is a little town of the province of\nTemsna, placed in the river Gueer; very ancient, and formerly rich and\nthickly populated.A great mart, or souk, is annually held at this\nplace.It is the site of the ancient Occath.Meshru Khaluf, _i.e._, "ford, or watering-place of the wild-boar," in\nthe district of the Beni-Miskeen, is a populated village, and situated\non the right bank of the Ovad Omm-Erbergh, lying on the route of many of\nthe chief cities.Here is the ford of Meshra Khaluf, forty-five feet\nwide, from which the village derives its name.On the map will be seen many places called Souk.The interior tribes\nresort thither to purchase and exchange commodities.The market-places\nform groups of villages.It is not a part of my plan to give any\nparticular description of them.Second, those places distinguished in the kingdom of Morocco, including\nSous, Draha, and Tafilett.Tefza, a Berber name, which, according to some, signifies "sand," and to\nothers, "a bundle of straw," is the capital of the province of Todla,\nbuilt by the aborigines on the <DW72> of the Atlas, who surrounded it\nwith a high wall of sandstone (called, also, Tefza.)At two miles east\nof this is the smaller town of Efza, which is a species of suburb,\ndivided from Tefza by the river Derna.The latter place is inhabited\ncertainly by Berbers, whose women are famous for their woollen works and\nweaving.Tefza is also celebrated for its native black and white woollen\nmanufactures.The population of the two places is stated at upwards of\n10,000, including 2,000 Jews.Pitideb, or Sitideb, is another fine town in the neighbourhood, built by\nthe Amazirghs on the top of a high mountain.The inhabitants are\nesteemed the most civilized of their nation, and governed by their own\nelders and chiefs, they live in a state of almost republican\nindependence.Some good native manufactures are produced, and a large\ncommerce with strangers is carried on.The women are reputed as being\nextremely fair and fascinating.Ghuer, or Gheu, (War, _i.e._, "difficult?")is a citadel, or rather a\nstrong, massive rock, and the most inaccessible of all in Morocco,\nforming a portion of the mountains of Jedla, near the sources of the Wad\nOmm-Erbegh.This rocky fort is the residence of the supreme Amrgar, or\nchief of the Amazirghs, who rendered himself renowned through the empire\nby fighting a pitch-battle with the Imperial troops in 1819.Such chiefs\nand tribes occasion the weakness of the interior; for, whenever the\nSultan has been embroiled with European Powers, these aboriginal\nAmazirghs invariably seized the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and\nancient grudges.The Shereefs always compound with them, if they can,\nthese primitive tribes being so many centres of an _imperium imperio_,\nor of revolt and disaffection.Tijijet in the province of Dukkalah, situate on the left bank of the\nriver Omm-Erbegh, along the route from Fez to Morocco, is a small town,\nbut was formerly of considerable importance.A famous market for grain is held here, which is attended by the tribe\nof the Atlas: the country abounds in grain and cattle of the finest\nbreed.Bulawan or Bou-el-Awan, "father of commodious ways or journeys," is a\nsmall town of 300 houses, with an old castle, formerly a place of\nconsequence; and lying on an arm of the river Omm-Erbegh _en route_ from\nMorocco to Salee and Mequinez and commanding the passage of the river.It is 80 miles from Morocco, and 110 from Salee.On the opposite side of\nthe river, is the village of Taboulaunt, peopled mostly with Jews and\nferrymen.Soubeit is a very ancient city on the left bank of the Omm-Erbegh,\nsurrounded with walls, and situate twenty miles from El-Medina in a\nmountainous region abounding with hares; it is inhabited by a tribe of\nthe same name, or probably Sbeita, which is also the name of a tribe\nsouth of Tangier.Meramer is a city built by the Goths on a fertile plain, near Mount\nBeni-Megher, about fourteen miles east of Saffee, in the province of\nDukkala, and carrying on a great commerce in oil and grain.El-Medina is a large walled populous city of merchants and artizans, and\ncapital of the district of Haskowra; the men are seditious, turbulent\nand inhospitable; the women are reputed to be fair and pretty, but\ndisposed, when opportunity offers, to confer their favours on strangers.There is another place four miles distant of nearly the same name.Tagodast is another equally large and rich city of the province of\nHaskowra crowning the heights of a lofty mountain surrounded by four\nother mountains, but near a plain of six miles in extent, covered with\nrich vegetation producing an immense quantity of Argan oil, and the\nfinest fruits.This place contains about 7,000 inhabitants, who are a noble and\nhospitable race.Besides, Argan oil, Tagodast is celebrated for its red\ngrapes, which are said to be as large as hen\'s eggs--the honey of\nTagodast is the finest in Africa.Dimenet or Demnet is a considerable town, almost entirely populated by\nthe Shelouhs and Caraaite Jews; it is situate upon the <DW72>s of a\nmountain of the same name, or Adimmei, in the district of Damnat,\nfifteen miles distant from Wad Tescout, which falls into the Tensift.The inhabitants are reputed to be of a bad and malignant character, but,\nnevertheless, learned in Mussulman theology, and fond of disputing with\nforeigners.Orthodoxy and morality are frequently enemies of one\nanother, whilst good-hearted and honest people are often hetherodox in\ntheir opinions.Aghmat, formerly a great and flourishing city and capital of the\nprovince of Rhamna, built by the Berbers, and well fortified--is now\nfallen into decay, and consists only of a miserable village inhabited by\nsome sixty families, among which are a few Jews--Aghmat lies at the foot\nof Mount Atlas, on the road which conducts to Tafilett, near a river of\nthe same name, and in the midst of a fine country abounding in orchards\nand vine-yards; Aghmat was the first capital of the Marabout dynasty.Fronga is a town densely populated almost entirely by Shelouhs and Jews,\nlying about fifteen miles from the Atlas range upon an immense plain\nwhich produces the finest grain in Morocco.Tednest, the ancient capital of the province of Shedmah, and built by\nthe Berbers, is deliciously placed upon a paridisical plain, and was\nonce the residence of the Shereefs.It contains a population of four\nthousand souls, one thousand eight hundred being Jews occupied with\ncommerce, whilst the rest cultivate the land.This is a division of\nlabour amongst Mahometans and Israelites not unfrequent in North Africa.But, as in Europe, the Jew is the trader, not the husbandman.Tekoulet is a small and pretty town, rising a short distance from the\nsea, by the mouth of the stream Dwira, in the province of Hhaha.The\nwater is reckoned the best in the province, and the people are honest\nand friendly; the Jews inhabit one hundred houses.Tesegdelt, is another city of the province of Hhaha, very large and\nrich, perched high upon a mountain, and that fortified by nature.The\nprincipal mosque is one of the finest in the empire.Tagawost is a city, perhaps the most ancient, and indeed the largest of\nthe province of Sous.It is distant ten miles from the great river Sous,\nand fifty from the Atlas.The suburbs are surrounded with huge blocks of\nstone.Togawost contains a number of shops and manufactories of good\nworkmen, who are divided into three distinct classes of people, all\nengaged in continual hostilities with one another.The men are, however,\nhonest and laborious, while the women are pretty and coquettish.Augustine, whom the Mahometans have dubbed a Marabout, was\nborn in this city.Their trade is with the Sahara and Timbuctoo.Fedsi is another considerable city, anciently the capital of Sous,\nreclining upon a large arm of the river Sous, amidst a fruitful soil,\nand contains about fourteen thousand inhabitants, who are governed by\nrepublican institutions.It is twenty miles E.N.E.Beneali is a town placed near to the source of the river Draha, in the\nAtlas.It is the residence of the chief of the Berbers of Hadrar, on the\nsouthern Atlas.Beni-Sabih, Moussabal, or Draha, is the capital of the province of\nDraha, and a small place, but populated and commercial.On the river of\nthe same name, was the Draha of ancient geography.Tatta and Akka, are two towns or villages of the province of Draha,\nsituate on the southern confines of Morocco, and points of rendezvous\nfor the caravans in their route over the Great Desert.Tatta is four days direct east from Akka, and placed in 28 deg.Akka consists of two hundred houses,\ninhabited by Mussulmen, and fifty by Jews.The environs are highly\ncultivated.Akka is two days east of Wadnoun, situate on a plain at the\nfoot of Gibel-Tizintit, and is placed in 28 deg.Messa is, according to Graeberg, a walled city, built\nby the Berbers, not far from the river Sous, and divided like nearly all\nthe cities of Sous, into three parts, or quarters, each inhabited by\nrespective classes of Shelouhs, Moors, and Jews.Cities are also divided\nin this manner in the provinces of Guzzala and Draha.The sea on the\ncoast of Sous throws up a very fine quantity of amber.The town is named Assah, and\ndistant about two miles from the sea, there being a few scattered houses\non each side of the river, to within half a mile of the sea.The place\nis of no importance, famed only for having near it a market on Tuesday,\nto which many people resort.Assah is\nalso the name of the district though which the Sous river flows.The\nBas-el-wad (or head of the river) is very properly the name of the upper\npart of the river; when passing through Taroudant it takes the name of\nSous.Fifteen miles from Assah is the town of Aghoulon, containing about\nsix hundred people.Talent, or Tilin, the difference only is the adding of the Berber\ntermination.The other consonants are the same, perhaps, as Mr.It is a strong city, and capital of the province\nof Sous-el-Aksa, or the extreme part of Sous.This province is sometimes\ncalled Tesset, or Tissert.A portion of it is also denominated\nBlad-Sidi-Hasham, and forms a free and quasi-independant state, founded\nin 1810 by the Emir Hasham, son of the Shereef Ahmed Ben Mousa.This\nprince was the bug-bear of Captain Riley.The district contains upwards\nof twenty-five thousand Shelouhs and industrious Arabs.Talent is the\nresidence of the prince, and is situate on the declivity of a hill, not\nfar from the river Wad-el-Mesah, or Messa, and a mile from Ilekh, or\nIlirgh, a populous village, where there is a famous sanctuary, resorted\nto by the Mahometans of the surrounding regions, of the name of Sidi\nHamed-ou-Mousa, (probably Ben Mousa).The singularity of this sacred\nvillage is, that Jews constitute the majority of the population.But\nthey seem absolutely necessary to the very existence of the Mussulmen of\nNorth Africa, who cannot live without them, or make profitable exchange\nof the products of the soil, or of native industry, for European\narticles of use and luxury.Shtouka, or Stuka, is, according to some, a large town or village; or,\nas stated by Davidson, a _district_.The fact is, many African districts\nare called by the name of a principal town or village in them, and _vice\nversa_.This place stands on the banks of the Wad-el-Mesah, and is\ninhabited by some fifteen hundred Shelouhs, who are governed by a\nSheikh, nearly independent of Morocco.On Talent and Shtouka, Mr."There is no town called\nStuka; it is a district; none that I can find called Talent; there is\nTilin.The Mesah flows through Stuka, in which district are twenty\nsettlements, or rather towns, some of which are large.They are known in\ngeneral by the names of the Sheikhs who inhabit them.I stopped at\nSheikh Hamed\'s.Tilin was distant from this spot a day\'s journey in the\nmountains towards the source of the river.If by Talent, Tissert is\nmeant, Oferen (a town) is distant six miles."On the province of Sous generally, Don J.A.Conde has this note:--\n\n"In this region (Sous) near the sea, is the temple erected in honour of\nthe prophet Jonas; it was there he was cast out of the belly of the\nwhale."This temple, says Assed Ifriki, is made of the bones of whales\nwhich perish on this coast.A little further on, he alludes to the\nbreaking of horses, and being skilful in bodily exercises, for the Moors\nand Numidians have always been renowned in that respect.In the lesser and more remote towns, I have followed generally the\nenumeration of Count Graeberg, but there are many other places on the\nmaps, with varieties of names or differences of position.Our geography\nof the interior of Morocco, especially in the South, is still very\nobscure, and I have only selected those towns and places of whose\npresent existence there is no question.My object, in the above\nenumeration, has been simply to give the reader a proximate estimate of\nthe population and resources of this country.Of the strength and number\nof the tribes of the interior, we know scarcely anything.The names of\nthe towns and villages of the South, so frequently beginning and ending\nwith T., sufficiently indicate the preponderance of the Berber\npopulation, under the names of Shelouh or Amazirgh, whilst the great\nerror of writers has been to represent the Arabs as more numerous than\nthis aboriginal population.Monsieur E. Renou, in his geographical description of the Empire of\nMorocco (Vol.of the "Exploration Scientifique," &c.)foolishly\nobserves that there is no way of arriving at correct statistics of this\nempire, except by comparing it with Algeria; and then remarks, which is\ntrue enough, "Malheureusement, la population de l\'Algerie n\'est pas\nencore bien connue."When, however, he asserts that the numbers of\npopulation given by Jackson and Graeberg are gross, and almost\nunpardonable exaggerations, given at hazard, I am obliged to agree with\nhim from the personal experience I had in Morocco, and these Barbary\ncountries generally.Jackson makes the whole of the population to amount to almost fifteen\nmillions, or nearly two thirds more than it probably amounts to.Graeberg\nestimates it at eight millions and a half.But how, or why, or\nwherefore, such estimates are made is not so easy to determine.Certain\nit is, that the whole number of cities which I have enumerated, scarcely\nrepresent one million of inhabitants.But for those who like to see\nsomething more definite in statistics, however exaggerated may be the\nestimate, I shall give the more moderate calculations of Graeberg, those\nof Jackson being beyond all rhyme or reason.Graeberg thus classifies and\nestimates the population.Amazirghs, Berbers, and Touaricks       2,300,000\n  Amazirghs, Shelouhs and Arabs           1,450,000\n  Arabs, mixed Moors, &c.3,550,000\n  Arabs pure, Bedouins, &c.740,000\n  Israelites, Rabbinists, and Caraites      339,500\n  <DW64>s, Fullans, and Mandingoes          120,000\n  Europeans and Christians                      300\n  Renegades                                     200\n                                         ----------\n                Total                     8,500,000\n\nIf two millions are deducted from this amount, perhaps the reader will\nhave something like a probable estimate of the population of Morocco.It\nis hardly correct to classify Moors as mixed Arabs, many of them being\nsimply descendants of the aboriginal Amazirghs.I am quite sure there\nare no Touaricks in the Empire of Morocco.Of the Maroquine Sahara, I have only space to mention the interesting\ncluster of oases of Figheegh, or Figuiq.Shaw mentions them as "a knot\nof villagers," noted for their plantations of palm-trees, supplying the\nwestern province of Algeria with dates.We have now more ample\ninformation of Figheegh, finding this Saharan district to consist of an\nagglomeration of twelve villages, the more considerable of which are\nMaiz, counting eight hundred houses, El-Wadghir five hundred, and Zenega\ntwelve hundred.The others vary from one or two hundred houses.The\nvillages are more or less connected together, never farther apart than a\nquarter of a league, and placed on the descent of Wal-el-Khalouf ("river\nof the wild boar") whence water is procured for the gardens, containing\nvarieties of fruit-trees and abundance of date-palms, all hedged round\nwith prickly-pears.Madder-root and tobacco are also cultivated, besides\nbarley sufficient for consumption.The Wad-el-Khalouf is dry, except in winter, but its bed is bored with\ninexhaustible wells, whose waters are distributed among the gardens by\nmeans of a _clepsydra_, or a vessel which drops so much water in an\nhour.The ancients measured time by the dropping of water, like the\nfalling of sand in the hour-glass.Some of the houses in these villages have two stories, and are well\nbuilt; each place has its mosque, its school, its kady, and its sheikh,\nand the whole agglomeration of oases is governed by a Sheikh Kebir,\nappointed by the Sultan of Morocco.These Saharan villages are eternally\nin strife with one another, and sometimes take up arms.On this account,\nthey are surrounded by crenated walls, defended by towers solidly built.The immediate cause of discord here is water, that precious element of\nall life in the desert.But the imaginations of the people are not\nsatisfied with this simple reason, and they are right, for the cause\nlies deeply in the human heart.They say, however, their ancestors were\ncursed by a Marabout, to punish them for their laxity in religion, and\nthis was his anathema, "God make you, until the day of judgment, like\nwool-comber\'s cards, the one gnawing the other!"Their wars, in fact, are most cruel, for they destroy the noble and\nfruitful palms, which, by a tacit convention, are spared in other parts\nof the Sahara when these quarrels proceed to bloodshed.They have,\nbesides, great tact in mining, and their reputation as miners has been a\nlong time established.But, happily, they are addicted to commerce and\nvarious branches of industry, as well as war, having commercial\nrelations with Fez, Tafilett and Touat, and the people are, therefore,\ngenerally prosperous.London Jew-boys.--Excursion to the Emperor\'s garden, and the Argan\nForests.--Another interview with the Governor of Mogador on the\nAnti-Slavery Address.--Opinion of the Moors on the Abolition of Slavery.We have at times imported into Mogador a stray London Jew or so, of the\nlower lemon-selling sort.These lads from the Minories, are highly\nexasperated against the Moors for treating them with so much contempt.Indeed, a high-spirited London Jew-boy will not stop at Mogador, though\nthe adult merchant will, to get money, for mankind often learn baseness\nwith age, and pass to it through a golden door.One of these Jew-boys,\nbeing cursed by a man, naturally cursed him again, "an eye for an eye, a\ntooth for a tooth."Willshire did not think so; and, on the\ncomplaint of the Moor, the British Consul threw the British Jew-boy into\na Moorish prison, where he remained for some days.This is one more\ninstance of the disadvantage of having commercial consuls, where\neverything is sacrificed to keep on good terms with government\nauthorities.A fire happened the other night, breaking out in the house of one of the\nrich Jewish merchants; but it was soon extinguished, the houses being\nbuilt chiefly of mortar and stone, with very little wood.The Governor\ngot up, and went to the scene of "conflagration;" he cracked a few jokes\nwith the people and went home to bed.The Moors were sorry the fire did\nnot extend itself, wanting to have an opportunity of appropriating a few\nof the merchant\'s goods.Elton, with other friends, to spend the day\nin the pleasant valley of the Saneeates-Sultan, (Garden of the Emperor)\nsometimes called Gharset-es-Sultan, three or four hours\' ride south from\nMogador.The small river of Wad-el-Kesab, (overlooked by the village of\nDeeabat, where watch-dogs were barking apparently all day long as well\nas night), lay in our way, and was with difficulty forded, heavy rain\nhaving fallen up the country, though none on the coast.These Barbary\nstreams are very deceptive, illustrating the metaphor of the book of\nJob, "deceitful as a brook."To-day, their beds are perfectly dry;\nto-morrow, a sheet of turbid water dashing and foaming to the ocean,\ncovers them and the country round, whilst the immediate cause is\nconcealed.Abrupt and sudden overflowings occur in all rivers having\ntheir source in mountains.The book of Job may also refer to the\ndisappointment of Saharan travellers, who, on arriving weary and\nthirsty, dying for water, at the stream of the Desert, find it dried up,\nand so perish.The country in the valley of the Emperor\'s garden offers nothing\nremarkable.Bushes of underwood covering sandy mounds, a few palmettos\nand Argan trees, in which wild doves fluttered and flew about, were all\nthat broke the monotony of a perfect waste.There were no cultivated\nlands hereabouts, and I was told that a great part of Morocco presents\nthis desolate aspect.We visited, however, the celebrated Argan tree,\nwhich the people pretend was planted by the lieutenant of the Prophet,\nthe mighty Okba, who, having spurred his horse in the roaring rebellious\nsurge of the Atlantic, wept and wailed before Heaven that there were no\nmore nations in whose heart to plunge his awful scimitar--so teaching\nthem the mercy of God!the old hoary tree, with a most peaceful\npatriarchal look, seemed to belie the honour, stretching out its broad\nsinewy arm to shelter a hundred people from the darting fires of an\nAfrican sun.A more noble object of inanimate nature is not to be\ncontemplated than a large and lofty branching tree; in its boughs and\nleaves, endlessly varying, matted together and intersecting each other,\nwe see the palpable image of infinity.But in the dry and hot climate of\nAfrica, this tree is a luxury which cannot be appreciated in Europe.We sat under its fresh shade awhile, gazing with security at the bright\nfires of the sun, radiating over and through all visible nature.To\ncheck our enthusiasm, we had strewn at our feet old broken bottles and\ncrockery, the _debris_ and classic relics of former visitors, who were\nequally attentive to creature-comforts as to the grandeur of the Argan\nmonarch of the surrounding forest.The Emperor\'s garden contains a well of water and a few fruit-trees, on\nthe trunk of one of which, a fine fig-tree, were carved, in durable\nbark, the names of European visitors.Among the rest, that of a famous\n_belle_, whose gallant worshippers had cut her name over all its broad\ntrunk, though they may have failed to cut their own on the plastic and\nindia-rubber tablet of the fair one\'s heart.This carving on the\nfig-tree is the sum of all that Europeans have done in Morocco during\nseveral ages.We rather adopt Moorish habits, and descend to their\nanimal gratifications than inculcate our own, or the intellectual\npleasures of Christian nations.European females brought up in this\ncountry, few excepted, adopt with gusto the lascivious dances of the\nMooresses; and if this may be said of them, what may we not think of the\nmale class, who frequently throw off all restraint in the indulgence of\ntheir passions?While reposing under the umbrageous shade of the Argan tree, a Moor\nrelated to us wondrous sprite and elfin tales of the forests of of these\nwilds.At one period, the Argan woods were full of enchantresses, who\nprevented good Mussulmen from saying their prayers, by dancing before\nthem in all their natural charms, to the sounds of melodious and\nvoluptuous music; and if a poor son of the Prophet, perchance, passed\nthis way at the stated times of prayer, he found it impossible to attend\nto his devotions, being pestered to death by these naughty houries.On another occasion, when it was high summer and the sun burnt every\nleaf of the black Argan foliage to a yellow red, and whilst the arid\nearth opened her mouth in horrid gaps, crystal springs of water were\nseen to bubble forth from the bowels of the earth, and run in rills\namong _parterres_ of roses and jessamines.The boughs of the Argan tree\nalso suddenly changed into _jereeds_ of the date-palm burdened with\nluscious fruit; but, on weary travellers descending to slake their\nparching thirst and refresh themselves, they fell headlong into the\ngaping holes of the ground, and disappeared in the abyss of the dark\nentrails of the world.These Argan forests continued under the fearful ban of the enchantress\nand wicked jinns, until a holy man was brought from the farthest desert\nupon the back of a flying camel, who set free the spell-bound wood by\ntying on each bewitched tree a small piece of cork bark on which was\ninscribed the sacred name of the Deity.The legends of these haunted\nArgan forests remind us of the enchanted wood of Tasso, whose\nenchantment was dissolved by the gallant knight, Rinaldo, and which\nenabled the Crusaders to procure wood for the machines of war to assault\nand capture the Holy City.Two quotations will shew the universality and\npermanence of superstition, begotten of human hopes and fears.Such is\nthe beautiful imagery devoted to superstitious musings, by the\nillustrious bard:--\n\n  "While, like the rest, the knight expects to hear\n  Loud peals of thunder breaking on his ear,\n  A dulcet symphony his sense invades,\n  Of nymphs, or dryads, warbling through the shades.Soft sighs the breeze, soft purls the silver rill.The feathered choir the woods with music fill;\n  The tuneful swan in dying notes complains;\n  The mourning nightingale repeats her strains,\n  Timbrels and harps and human voices join,\n  And in one concert all the sounds combine!"Then for the streamlets and flowerets--\n\n  "Where\'er he treads, the earth her tribute pours,\n  In gushing springs, or voluntary flowers.Here blooms the lily; there the fragrant rose;\n  Here spouts a fountain; there a riv\'let flows;\n  From every spray the liquid manna trills,\n  And honey from the softening bark distills.Again the strange the pleasing sound he hears,\n  Of plaints and music mingling in his ears;\n  Yet naught appears that mortal voice can frame.Nor harp, nor timbrel, whence the music came."I had another interview with the Governor on Anti-Slavery subjects.Treppass accompanied me, and assisted to interpret.His Excellency was\nvery condescending, and even joked about his own slaves, asking me how\nmuch I would give him for them.He then continued:--"I am happy to see\nyou before your departure.Whilst you have been here, I have heard\nnothing of your conduct but what was just and proper.You are a quiet\nand prudent man, [28] and I am sorry I could not assist you in your\nbusiness (abolition).The Sultan will be glad that you and I have not\nquarrelled, but are friends."I then asked His Excellency if a person\nwere to come direct from our Government, with larger powers and\npresents, he would have a better chance of success.The Governor\nreplied, "Not the least whatever.You have done all that could have been\ndone.We look at the subject, not the persons.The Sultan will never\nlisten to anybody on this subject.You may cut off his head, but cannot\nconvince him.If all the Christians of the world were to come and take\nthis country, then, of course, the Mussulmen would yield the question to\nsuperior force, to the decree of God, but not till then."Myself.--"How is it, Sidi, that the Bey of Tunis, and the Imaum of\nMuscat have entered into engagements with Christians for the suppression\nof slavery, they being Mussulmen?"The Governor.--"I\'ll tell you; we Mussulmen are as bad as you Christians.Some of our people go to one mosque,\nand will not go to another.They are foolish (_mahboul_).So it is with\nthe subject of slaves.Some are with you, but most are with me.The Bey\nof Tunis, and the Imaum have a different opinion from us.They think\nthey are right, and we think we are right; but we are as good as they."Myself.--"Sidi, does not the Koran encourage the abolition of slavery,\nand command it as a duty to all pious Mussulmen?"The Governor.--"No, it does not command it, but those who voluntarily\nliberate their slaves are therein commended, and have the blessing of\nGod on them."[29]\n\nMyself.--"Sidi, is it in my power to do anything for you in London?"The Governor.--"Speak well of me, that is all.Tell your friends I did\nall I could for you."I may mention the opinions of the more respectable Moors, as to the\nmission.They said, "If you had managed your mission well, the Sultan\nwould have received your Address; your Consul is slack; the French\nConsul is more active, because he is not the Sultan\'s merchant.Our\nSultan must receive every person, even a beggar, because God receives\nall.You would not have obtained the liberation of our slaves, but the\nSultan would have promised you everything.All that emanates from the\nEnglish people is good this we are certain of; but it would have been\nbetter had you come with letters from the Bey of Tunis, shewing what had\nbeen done in that country."Treppass is also of the opinion, that a\ndeputation of several persons, accompanied with some presents for the\nEmperor and his ministers, would have produced a better effect, by\nmaking an appearance of shew and authority, suitable to the ideas of the\npeople.[30] If coming direct from Government, it would have greater\nweight.He thinks, besides, there are a good number of Moors who are favourable\nto abolition.Of the connexion between the east and Morocco, he says,\nall the Barbary States look up to the Sultan of Constantinople as to a\ngreat authority, and during the last few years, an active\ncorrespondence, on religious matters, has been carried on between\nMorocco and Constantinople, chiefly through a celebrated doctor of the\nname of Yousef.If the Turkish Sultan, therefore, would _bona-fide_\nabolish the slave-markets, I have no doubt this would produce an\nimpression in Morocco favourable to abolition.During the time I was in Morocco, I distributed some Arabic tracts,\ntranslated from the English by Professor Lee of Cambridge, on the\nabolition of slavery.A few Arabic Bibles and Hebrew New Testaments were\nalso placed at my disposal for circulation by the Societies.I also\nwrote an Anti-slavery circular to the British merchants of Mogador, on\nLord Brougham\'s Act.El-Jereed, the Country of Dates.--Its hard soil.--Salt Lake.Its vast\nextent.--Beautiful Palm-trees.--The Dates, a staple article of Food.--\nSome Account of the Date-Palm.--Made of Culture.--Delicious Beverage.--\nTapping the Palm.--Meal formed from the Dates.--Baskets made of the\nBranches of the Tree.--Poetry of the Palm.--Its Irrigation.--\nPalm-Groves.--Collection of Tribute by the "Bey of the Camp."El-Jereed, or Belad-el-Jereed, the country of dates, or literally, the\ncountry of the palm branches, is a part of the Sahara, or the hot dry\ncountry lying in the immediate vicinity of the Great Desert.Its\nprincipal features of soil and climate offer nothing different from\nother portions of the Sahara, or the Saharan regions of Algeria and\nMorocco.The Belad-el-Jereed, therefore, may be properly called the\nTunisian Sahara.Shaw observes generally of Jereed:--"This part of the\ncountry, and indeed the whole tract of land which lies between the\nAtlantic and Egypt, is by most of the modern geographers, called\nBiledulgerid, a name which they seem to have borrowed from\nBloid-el-Jeridde, of the Arabians, who merely signify the dry country;\nthough, if we except the Jeridde, a small portion of it which is situate\non this side of Lesser Syrtis, and belongs to the Tunisians, all the\nrest of it is known by no other general name than the Sahara or Sahra,\namong those Arabs, at least, whom I have conversed with."Besides the grand natural feature of innumerable lofty and branching\npalms, whose dark depending slender leaves, are depicted by the Arabian\npoet as hanging gracefully like the dishevelled ringlets of a beautiful\nwoman in distress, there is the vast salt lake, El-Sibhah, or literally\nthe "salt plain," and called by some modern geographers the\nSibhah-el-Soudeeat, or Lake of Marks, from having certain marks made of\nthe trunks of the palm, to assist the caravans in their marches across\nits monotonous samelike surface.This vast lake, or salt plain, was divided by the ancients into three\nparts, and denominated respectively, Palus Tritonis, Palus Pallas, and\nPalus Libya.The first is derived from the river Triton, which according\nto Ptolemy and other ancient geographers, is made to pass through this\nlake in its course to the sea, but which is the present river Ghobs,\nwhere it falls into the Mediterranean.The name Pallas is derived from\nthe tradition of Pallas having accompanied Sesostris in his Asiatic\nexpeditions with the Lybian women, and she may have been a native of the\nJereed.The lake measures from north-east to south-west about seventy\nEnglish miles, with a third of the breadth, but it is not one collection\nof water; there being several dry places, like so many islands,\ninterspersed over its surface, depending however, as to their number and\nextent upon the season of the year, and upon the quantity of water in\nthe particular season."At first, on crossing it," says a tourist, "the grass and bushes become\ngradually scarcer; then follows a tract of sand, which some way beyond,\nbecomes in parts covered with a thin layer of salt.This, as you\nadvance, is thicker and more united; then we find it a compact and\nunbroken mass or sheet, which can, however, be penetrated by a sword, or\nother sharp instrument, and here it was found to be eleven inches in\ndepth; and finally in the centre, it became so hard, deep, and\nconcentrated, as to baffle all attempts at breaking its surface except\nwith a pickaxe.Mary went back to the bedroom.The horse\'s shoe, in fact, makes no impression upon its\nstone-like surface."The salt of the lake is considerably weaker than that of the sea, and\nnot adapted for preserving provisions, though its flavour is very\nagreeable; it is not exported, nor made in any way an article of\ncommerce.The Jereed, from the existence in it of a few antiquities, such as\npieces of granite and marble, and occasionally a name or a classic\ninscription, is proved to have been in the possession of the Romans, and\nundoubtedly of the Carthaginians before them, who could have had no\ndifficulty in holding this flat and exposed country.The trade and resources of this country consist principally in dates.The quantity exported to other parts of the Regency, as well as to\nforeign countries, where their fine quality is well known, is in round\nnumbers on an average from three to four thousand quintals per annum.But in Jereed itself, twenty thousand people live six months of the year\nentirely on dates."A great number of poles," says Sir Grenville Temple, "are arranged\nacross the rooms at the height of eight or nine feet from the ground,\nand from these are suspended rich and large bunches of dates, which\ncompose the winter store of the inhabitants; and in one corner of the\nroom is one or more large earthern jars about six or seven feet high,\nalso filled with dates pressed close together, and at the bottom of the\njar is a cock, from which is drawn the juice in the form of a thick\nluscious syrup.It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more\npalatable than this\'sweet of sweets.\'"As we are writing of the country of dates, _par excellence_, I must\nneeds give some description of the palm, but it will be understood that\nthe information is Tunisian, or collected in Tunis, and may differ in\nsome respects from details collected in other parts of North Africa.The\ndate-palm abounds in the maritime as well as in the inland districts of\nNorth Africa.They are usually propagated from shoots of full grown\ntrees, which if transplanted and taken care of, will yield in six or\nseven years, whilst those raised immediately from the stone require\nsixteen years to produce fruit.The date-palm is male and female, or _dioecious_, and requires\ncommunication, otherwise the fruit is dry and insipid.The age of the\npalm, in its greatest vigour, is about thirty years, according to the\nTunisians, after planting, and will continue in vigour for seventy\nyears, bearing anually fifteen or twenty clusters of dates, each of them\nfifteen or twenty pounds in weight; after this long period, they begin\ngradually to wither away.But the Saharan Tripolitans will tell you that\nthe date-palm does not attain its age of full vigour till it reaches a\nhundred years, and then will flourish two or or three centuries before\nit withers!The only culture requisite, is to be well watered at the roots once in\nfour or five days, and to have the lower boughs cut off when they begin\nto droop and wither.Much rain, however, injures the dates, and we know\nthat the countries in which they flourish, are mostly without rain.In\nmany localities in Africa, date-palms can never be watered in the dry\nseason; it is nevertheless observable that generally wherever a palm\ngrows and thrives water may usually be obtained by boring.The sap, or\nhoney of the palm is a delicious and wholesome beverage when drunk quite\nfresh; but if allowed to remain for some hours, it acquires a sharp\ntaste, something like cider, and becomes very intoxicating.It is called\npoetically _leghma_, "tears" of the dates.When a tree is found not to\nproduce much fruit, the head is cut off, and a bowl or cavity scooped\nout of the summit, in which the rising sap is collected, and this is\ndrunk in its pure state without any other preparation.If the tree be\nnot exhausted by draining, in five or six months it grows afresh; and,\nat the end of two or three years, may again be cut or tapped.The palm\nis capable of undergoing this operation five or six times, and it may be\neasily known how often a tree has been cut by the number of rings of a\nnarrow diameter which are seen towards its summit; but, if the sap is\nallowed to flow too long, it will perish entirely at the end of a year.This sap, by distillation, produces an agreeable spirit called _Araky_\nor _Arak_: from the fruit also the Jews distil a spirit called _bokka_,\nor what we should call _toddy_.It is usual for persons of distinction\nto entertain their friends upon a marriage, or the birth of a child,\nwith this pure sap, and a tree is usually tapped for the purpose.It\nwould appear that tapping the palm was known to the ancients, for a\ncornelian _intaglio_ of Roman antiquity, has been found in the Jereed,\nrepresenting a tree in this state, and the jars in which the juice was\nplaced.Dates are likewise dried in the sun, and reduced into a kind of meal,\nwhich will keep for any length of time, and which thus becomes a most\nvaluable resource for travellers crossing the deserts, who frequently\nmake it their only food, moistening a handful of it with a little water.Certain preparations are made of the male plant, to which medicinal\nvirtues are attributed; the younger leaves, eaten with salt, vinegar,\nand oil, make an excellent salad.The heart of the tree, which lies at\ntop between the fruit branches, and weighs from ten to twenty pounds, is\neaten only on grand occasions, as those already mentioned, and possesses\na delicious flavour between that of a banana and a pine-apple.The palm, besides these valuable uses to which it is applied,\nsuperseding or supplying the place of all other vegetables to the tribes\nof the Jereed, is, nevertheless, still useful for a great variety of\nother purposes.The most beautiful baskets, and a hundred other\nnick-nackery of the wickery sort are made of its branches; ropes are\nmade and vestments wove from the long fibres, and its wood, also, when\nhardened by age, is used for building.Indeed, we may say, it is the all\nand everything of the Jereed, and, as it is said of the camel and the\ndesert, _the palm is made for the Jereed, and the Jereed is made for the\npalm_.The Mussulmen make out a complete case of piety and superstition in the\npalm, and pretend that _they are made for the palm, and the palm is made\nfor them_, alleging that, as soon as the Turks conquered Constantinople,\nthe palm raised its graceful flowing head over the domes of the former\ninfidel city, whilst when the Moors evacuated Spain, the palm pined\naway, and died."God," adds the pious Mussulman, "has given us the palm;\namongst the Christians, it will not grow!"But the poetry of the palm is\nan inseparable appendage in the North African landscape, and even town\nscenery.The Moor and the Arab, whose minds are naturally imbued with\nthe great images of nature, so glowingly represented also in the sacred\nleaves of the Koran, cannot imagine a mosque or the dome-roof of a\nhermitage, without the dark leaf of the palm overshadowing it; but the\nserenest, loveliest object on the face of the landscape is _the lonely\npalm_, either thrown by chance on the brow of some savage hill or\nplanted by design to adorn some sacred spot of mother-earth.I must still give some other information which I have omitted respecting\nthis extraordinary tree.And, after this, I further refer the reader to\na Tour in the Jereed of which some details are given in succeeding\npages.A palm-grove is really a beautiful object, and requires scarcely\nless attention than a vineyard.The trees are generally planted in a\n_quincunx_, or at times without any regular order; but at distances from\neach other of four or five yards.The situation selected is mostly on\nthe banks of some stream or rivulet, running from the neighbouring\nhills, and the more abundant the supply of water, the healthier the\nplants and the finer the fruit.For this tree, which loves a warm\nclimate, and a sandy soil, is yet wonderfully improved by frequent\nirrigation, and, singularly, the _quality_ of the water appears of\nlittle consequence, being salt or sweet, or impregnated with nitre, as\nin the Jereed.Irrigation is performed in the spring, and through the whole summer.The\nwater is drawn by small channels from the stream to each individual\ntree, around the stalk and root of which a little basin is made and\nfenced round with clay, so that the water, when received, is detained\nthere until it soaks into the earth.(All irrigation is, indeed,\neffected in this way.)As to the abundance of the plantations, the fruit\nof one plantation alone producing fifteen hundred camels\' loads of\ndates, or four thousand five hundred quintals, three quintals to the\nload, is not unfrequently sold for one thousand dollars.Besides the\nJereed, Tafilett, in Morocco, is a great date-country.Jackson says,\n"We found the country covered with most magnificent plantations, and\nextensive forests of the lofty date, exhibiting the most elegant and\npicturesque appearance that nature on a plain surface can present to the\nadmiring eye.In these forests, there is no underwood, so that a\nhorseman may gallop through them without impediment."Our readers will see, when they come to the Tour, that this description\nof the palm-groves agrees entirely with that of Mr.I have already mentioned that the palm is male and female, or,\nas botanists say, _dioecious_; the Moors, however, pretend that the palm\nin this respect is just like the human being.The _female_ palm alone\nproduces fruit and is cultivated, but the presence or vicinity of the\n_male_ is required, and in many oriental countries there is a law that\nthose who own a palm-wood must have a certain number of _male_ plants in\nproportion.In Barbary they seem to trust to chance, relying on the male\nplants which grow wild in the Desert.They hang and shake them over the\nfemale plants, usually in February or March.Koempfe says, that the male\nflowers, if plucked when ripe, and cautiously dried, will even, in this\nstate, perform their office, though kept to the following year.The Jereed is a very important portion of the Tunisian territory,\nGovernment deriving a large revenue from its inhabitants.It is visited\nevery year by the "Bey of the Camp," who administers affairs in this\ncountry as a sovereign; and who, indeed, is heir-apparent to the\nTunisian throne.Immediately on the decease of the reigning Bey, the\n"Bey of the Camp" occupies the hereditary beylick, and nominates his\nsuccessor to the camp and the throne, usually the eldest of the other\nmembers of the royal family, the beylick not being transmitted from\nfather to son, only on the principle of age.At least, this has been the\ngeneral rule of succession for many years.The duties of the "Bey of the Camp" is to visit with a "flying-camp,"\nfor the purpose of collecting tribute, the two circuits or divisions of\nthe Regency.I now introduce to the reader the narrative of a Tour to the Jereed,\nextracted from the notebooks of the tourists, together with various\nobservations of my own interspersed, and some additional account of\nToser, Nefta, and Ghafsa.Tour in the Jereed of Captain Balfour and Mr.Reade.--Sidi Mohammed.--\nPlain of Manouba.--Tunis.--Tfeefleeah.--The Bastinado.--Turkish\nInfantry.--Kairwan.--Sidi Amour Abeda.--Saints.--A French Spy--\nAdministration of Justice.--The Bey\'s presents.--The Hobara.--Ghafsa.Hot streams containing Fish.--Snakes.--Incantation.--Moorish Village.The tourists were Captain Balfour, of the 88th Regiment, and Mr.Richard\nReade, eldest son of Sir Thomas Reade.The morning before starting from Tunis they went to the Bardo to pay\ntheir respects to Sidi Mohammed, "Bey of the Camp," and to thank him for\nhis condescending kindness in taking them with him to the Jereed.The\nBey told him to send their baggage to Giovanni, "Guarda-pipa," which\nthey did in the evening.At nine A. M. Sidi Mohammed left the Bardo under a salute from the guns,\none of the wads of which nearly hit Captain Balfour on the head.The Bey\nproceeded across the plain of Manouba, mounted on a beautiful bay\ncharger, in front of the colours, towards Beereen, the greater part of\nthe troops of the expedition following, whilst the entire plain was\ncovered with baggage-camels, horses, mules, and detached parties of\nattendants, in glorious confusion.The force of the camp consisted of--Mamelukes\n  of the Seraglio, superbly mounted               20\n\n  Mamelukes of the Skeefah, or those who\n  guard the entrance of the Bey\'s\n  palace, or tent, and are all Levantines         20\n\n  Boabs, another sort of guard of the Bey,\n  who are always about the Bey\'s\n  tent, and must be of this country               20\n\n  Turkish Infantry                               300\n  Spahis, o. mounted Arab guards                 300\n  Camp followers (Arabs)                       2,000\n                                               -----\n             Total                             2,660\n\nThis is certainly not a large force, but in several places of the march\nthey were joined for a short time by additional Arab troops, a sort of\nhonorary welcome for the Bey.As they proceeded, the force of the\ncamp-followers increased; but, in returning, it gradually decreased, the\nparties going home to their respective tribes.We may notice the total\nabsence of any of the new corps, the Nithalm.This may have been to\navoid exciting the prejudices of the people; however, the smallness of\nthe force shows that the districts of the Jereed are well-affected.The\nsummer camp to Beja has a somewhat larger force, the Arabs of that and\nother neighbouring districts not being so loyal to the Government.Besides the above-named troops, there were two pieces of artillery.The\nband attendant on these troops consisted of two or three flageolets,\nkettle-drums, and trumpets made of cow-horns, which, according to the\nreport of our tourists, when in full play produced the most diabolical\ndiscord.After a ride of about three hours, we pitched our tents at Beereen.Through the whole of the route we marched on an average of about four\nmiles per hour, the horses, camels, &c., walking at a good pace.The\nTurkish infantry always came up about two hours after the mounted\ntroops.Immediately on the tents being pitched, we went to pay our\nrespects to the Bey, accompanied by Giovanni, "Guardapipa," as\ninterpreter.His Highness received us very affably, and bade us ask for\nanything we wanted.Afterwards, we took some luncheon with the Bey\'s\ndoctor, Signore Nunez Vaise, a Tuscan Jew, of whose kindness during our\nwhole tour it is impossible to speak too highly.The doctor had with him\nan assistant, and tent to himself.Haj Kador, Sidi Shakeer, and several\nother Moors, were of our luncheon-party, which was a very merry one.About half-way to Beereen, the Bey stopped at a marabet, a small square\nwhite house, with a dome roof, to pay his devotions to a great Marabout,\nor saint, and to ask his parting blessing on the expedition.They told\nus to go on, and joined us soon after.Two hours after us, the Turkish\nAgha arrived, accompanied with colours, music, and some thirty men.The\nBey received the venerable old gentleman under an immense tent in the\nshape of an umbrella, surrounded with his mamelukes and officers of\nstate.After their meeting and saluting, three guns were fired.The Agha\nwas saluted every day in the same manner, as he came up with his\ninfantry after us.We retired for the night at about eight o\'clock.The form of the whole camp, when pitched, consisting of about a dozen\nvery large tents, was as follows:--The Bey\'s tent in the centre, which\nwas surrounded at a distance of about forty feet with those of the\nBash-Hamba [31] of the Arabs, the Agha of the Arabs, the Sahab-el-Tabah,\nHaznadar or treasurer, the Bash-Boab, and that of the English tourists;\nthen further off were the tents of the Katibs and Bash-Katib, the\nBash-Hamba of the Turks, the doctors, and the domestics of the Bey, with\nthe cookery establishment.Among the attendants of the Bey were the\n"guarda-pipa," guard of the pipe, "guarda-fusile," guard of the gun,\n"guarda-cafe," guard of the coffee, "guarda-scarpe," guard of the shoes,\n[32] and "guarda-acqua," guard of water.A man followed the Bey about\nholding in his hand a golden cup, and leading a mule, having two paniers\non its back full of water, which was brought from Tunis by camels.Sandra moved to the bathroom.There\nwas also a story-teller, who entertained the Bey every night with the\nmost extraordinary stories, some of them frightfully absurd.The Bey did\nnot smoke--a thing extraordinary, as nearly all men smoke in Tunis.None of his ladies ever accompany him in\nthese expeditions.The tents had in them from twenty to fifty men each.Our tent consisted\nof our two selves, a Boab to guard the baggage, two Arabs to tend the\nhorses and camels, and another Moor of all work, besides Captain\nBalfour\'s Maltese, called Michael.The first night we found very cold; but having abundance of clothing, we\nslept soundly, in spite of the perpetual wild shoutings of the Arab\nsentries, stationed round the camp, the roaring and grumbling of the\ncamels, the neighing and coughing of the horses, all doing their utmost\nto drive away slumber from our eyelids.We halted on the morrow, which gave us an opportunity of getting a few\nthings from Tunis which we had neglected to bring.But before returning,\nwe ate some sweetmeats sent us by the guarda-pipa, with a cup of coffee.The guarda-pipa is also a dragoman interpreter of his Highness, and a\nGenoese by birth, but now a renegade.In this country they do not know\nwhat a good breakfast is; they take a cup of coffee in the morning\nearly, and wait till twelve or one o\'clock, when they take a hearty\nmeal, and then sup in the evening, late or early, according to the\nseason.Before returning to Tunis, we called upon his Highness, and told\nhim our object.We afterwards called to see the Bey every morning, to\npay our respects to him, as was befitting on these occasions.His\nHighness entered into the most familiar conversation with us.On coming back again from Tunis, it rained hard, which continued all\nnight.In the evening the welcome news was proclaimed that the tents\nwould not be struck until daylight: previously, the camp was always\nstruck at 3 o\'clock, about three hours before daylight, which gave rise\nto great confusion, besides being without shelter during the coldest\npart of the night (three hours before sun-rise) was a very serious trial\nfor the health of the men.The reason, however, was, to enable the\ncamels to get up to the new encampment; their progress, though regular\nand continual, is very slow.Of a morning the music played off the _reveil_ an hour before sunrise.The camp presented an animated appearance, with the striking of tents,\npacking camels, mounting horses, &c. We paid our respects to his\nHighness, who was sitting in an Arab tent, his own being down.The music\nwas incessantly grating upon our ears, but was in harmony with the\nirregular marching and movements of the Arabs, one of them occasionally\nrushing out of the line of march, charging, wheeling about, firing,\nreloading, shouting furiously, and making the air ring with his cries.The order of march was as follows:--The Bey mounts, and, going along\nabout one hundred yards from the spot, he salutes the Arab guards, who\nfollow behind him; then, about five or six miles further, overtaking the\nTurkish soldiers, who, on his coming up, are drawn up on each side of\nthe road, his Highness salutes them; and then afterwards the\nwater-carriers are saluted, being most important personages in the dry\ncountries of this circuit, and last of all, the gunners; after all\nwhich, the Bey sends forward a mameluke, who returns with the Commander,\nor Agha of the Arabs, to his Highness.This done, the Bey gallops off to\nthe right or left from the line of march, on whichsoever side is most\ngame--the Bey going every day to shoot, whilst the Agha takes his place\nand marches to the next halting-place.One morning the Bey shot two partridges while on horseback.Rade, "he is the best shot on horseback I ever saw--he seldom\nmissed his game."As Captain B. was riding along with the doctor, they\nremarked a cannon-ball among some ruins; but, being told a saint was\nburied there, they got out of the way as quick as if a deadly serpent\nhad been discovered.Stretching away to the left, we saw a portion of\nthe remains of the Carthaginian aqueduct.The march was only from six to\neight miles, and the encampment at Tfeefleeah.At day-break, at noon, at\n3 o\'clock, P.M.and at sunset, the Muezzen called from outside and near\nthe door of the Bey\'s tent the hour of prayer.An aide-de-camp also\nproclaimed, at the same place, whether we should halt, or march, on the\nmorrow, The Arabs consider fat dogs a great delicacy, and kill and eat\nthem whenever they can lay hands upon them.Captain B. was fortunate in\nnot bringing his fat pointer, otherwise he would have lost him.The\nArabs eat also foxes and wolves, and many animals of the chase not\npartaken of by us.The French in Algiers kill all the fat cats, and turn\nthem into hares by dexterous cooking.The mornings and evenings we found\ncold, but mid-day very hot and sultry.We left Tfeefleeah early, and went in search of wild-boar; found only\ntheir tracks, but saw plenty of partridges and hares; the ground being\ncovered with brushwood and heath, we soonae lost sight of them.The Arabs\nwere seen on a sudden running and galloping in all directions, shouting\nand pointing to a hill, when a huge beast was put up, bristling and\nbellowing, which turned out to be a hyaena.He was shot by a mameluke, Si\nSmyle, and fell in a thicket, wallowing in his blood.He was a fine\nfellow, and had an immense bead, like a bull-dog.They put him on a\nmule, and carried him in triumph to the Bey.When R. arrived at the\ncamp, the Bey sent him the skin and the head as a present, begging that\nhe would not eat the brain.There is a superstitious belief among the\nMoors that, if a person eats the brain of a hyaena he immediately becomes\nmad.The hyaena is not the savage beast commonly represented; he rarely\nattacks any person, and becomes untameably ferocious by being only\nchained up.He is principally remarkable for his stupidity when at large\nin the woods.The animal abounds in the forests of the Morocco Atlas.Our tourists saw no lions _en route_, or in the Jereed; the lion does\nnot like the sandy and open country of the plain.Very thick brushwood,\nand ground broken with rocks, like the ravines of the Atlas, are his\nhaunts.Several Arabs were flogged for having stolen the barley of which they\nhad charge.The bastinado was inflicted by two inferior mamelukes,\nstanding one on each side of the culprit, who had his hands and his feet\ntied behind him.In general, it may be said that bastinadoing in Tunis\nis a matter of form, many of the strokes ordered to be inflicted being\nnever performed, and those given being so many taps or scratches.It is\nvery rare to see a man bleeding from the bastinado; I (the author) never\ndid.It is merely threatened as a terror; whilst it is not to be\noverlooked, that the soles of the feet of Arabs, and the lower classes\nin this country, are like iron, from the constant habit of going\nbarefoot upon the sharpest stones.Severe punishments of any kind are\nrarely inflicted in Tunis.The country was nearly all flat desert, with scarcely an inhabitant to\ndissipate its savage appearance.The women of a few Arab horsehair tents\n(waterproof when in good repair) saluted us as we passed with their\nshrill looloos.We passed the\nruins of several towns and other remains.The camels were always driven\ninto camp at sunset, and hobbled along, their two fore-legs being tied,\nor one of them being tied up to the knee, by which the poor animals are\nmade to cut a more melancholy figure than with their usual awkward gait\nand moody character.We continued our march about ten miles in nearly a southern direction,\nand encamped at a place called Heelet-el-Gazlen.One morning shortly after starting, we came to a small stream with very\nhigh and precipitous banks, over which one arch of a fine bridge\nremained, but the other being wanting, we had to make a considerable\n_detour_ before we could cross; the carriages had still greater\ndifficulty.Here we have an almost inexcusable instance of the\ndisinclination of the Moors to repairs, for had the stream been swollen,\nthe camp would have been obliged to make a round-about march by the way\nof Hamman-el-Enf, of some thirty miles; and all for the want of an arch\nwhich would scarcely cost a thousand piastres!This stream or river is\nthe same as that which passes near Hamman-el-Enf, and the extensive\nplain through which it meanders is well cultivated, with douwars, or\ncircular villages of the Arabs dotted about.We saw hares, but, the\nground being difficult running for the dogs, we caught but few.Bevies\nof partridges got up, but we were unprepared for them.In the evening,\nthe Bey sent a present of a very fine bay horse to R. Marched about ten\nmiles, and halted at Ben Sayden.The following day after starting, we left the line of march to shoot;\nsaw one boar, plenty of foxes and wolves, and we put up another hyaena,\nbut the bag consisted principally of partridges, the red-legged\npartridge or _perdix ruffa_, killed, by the Bey, who is a dead-shot.Our\nride lay among hills; there was very little water, which accounted for\nthe few inhabitants.After dinner, went out shooting near Jebanah, and\nbagged a few partridges, but, not returning before the sun went down,\nthe Bey sent a dozen fellows bawling out our names, fearing some harm\nhad befallen us.On leaving the hills, there lay stretched at our feet a boundless plain,\non which is situate Kairwan, extending also to Susa, and leagues around.North Africa, is a country of hills and plains--such was the case along\nour entire route.We saw a large herd of gazelles feeding, as well as\nseveral single ones, but they have the speed of the greyhound, so we did\nnot grace our supper with any.Saw several birds called Kader, about the\nsize of a partridge, but we shot none.A good many hares and partridges\neither crossed our path or whirred over our heads.Passed over a running\nstream called Zebharah, where we saw the remains of an ancient bridge,\nbut in the place where the baggage went over there was a fine one in\ngood repair.Here was a small dome-topped chapel, called Sidi Farhat, in\nwhich are laid the ashes of a saint.We had seen many such in the hills;\nindeed these gubbah abound all over Barbary, and are placed more\nfrequently on elevations.We noticed particularly the 300 Turkish\ninfantry; they were irregulars with a vengeance, though regulars\ncompared to the Arabs.On overtaking them, they drew up on each side,\nand some dozen of them kept up a running sham fight with their swords\nand small wooden and metal shields before the Bey.The officers kissed\nthe hand of the Bey, and his treasurer tipped their band, for so we must\ncall their tumtums and squeaking-pipes.This ceremony took place every\nmorning, and they were received in the camp with all the honours.They\nkept guard during the night, and did all they could to keep us awake by\ntheir eternal cry of "Alleya," which means, "Be off," or "Keep your\ndistance!"These troops had not been recruited for eight years, and will\nsoon die off; and yet we see that the Bey treats these remnants of the\nonce formidable Turkish Tunisian Janissaries with great respect; of\ncourse, in an affair with the Arabs, their fidelity to the Bey would be\nmost unshaken.As we journeyed onward, we saw much less vegetation and very little\ncultivation.An immense plain lay before and around us, in which,\nhowever, there was some undulating ground.Passed a good stone bridge;\nwere supplied with water near a large Arab encampment, around which were\nmany droves of camels; turned up several hares, partridges, and\ngazelles.One of the last gave us a good chase, but the greyhounds\ncaught him; in the first half mile, he certainly beat them by a good\nhalf of the instance, but having taken a turn which enabled the dogs to\nmake a short cut, and being blown, they pulled the swift delicate\ncreature savagely down.There were several good courses after hares,\nthough her pursuers gave puss no fair play, firing at her before the\ndogs and heading her in every possible way.Prince Pueckler\nMuskau was the fourth when he visited it in 1835.The town is clean, but\nmany houses are in ruins.The greater part of a regiment of the Nitham\nare quartered here.The famous mosque, of course, we were not allowed to\nenter, but many of its marble pillars and other ornaments, we heard from\nGiovanni, were the spoils of Christian churches and Pagan temples.The\nhouse of the Kaed was a good specimen of dwellings in this country.Going along a street, we were greatly surprised at seeing our\nattendants, among whom were Si Smyle (a very intelligent and learned\nman, and who taught Mr.R. Arabic during the tour) and the Bash-Boab,\njumping off their horses, and, running up to an old-looking Moor, and\nthen seizing his hand, kissed it; and for some time they would not leave\nthe ragged ruffian-like saint.At last, having joined us, they said he was Sidi Amour Abeda, a man of\nexceeding sanctity, and that if the Bey had met the saint, his Highness\nmust have done the same.The saint accompanied us to the Kaed\'s house;\nand, on entering, we saw the old Kaed himself, who was ill and weeping\non account of the arrival of his son, the commander of a portion of the\nguards of the camp.We went up stairs, and sat down to some sweetmeats\nwhich had been prepared for us, together with Si Smyle and Hamda, but,\nas we were commencing, the saint, who was present, laid hold of the\nsweets with his hands, and blessed them, mumbling _bismillas_ [33] and\nother jargon.We afterwards saw a little house, in course of erection by\norder of the Bey, where the remains of Sidi Amour Abeda are to be\ndeposited at his death, so that the old gentleman can have the pleasure\nof visiting his future burial-place.In this city, a lineal descendant\nof the Prophet, and a lucky guesser in the way of divining, are the\nessential ingredients in the composition of a Moorish saint.Saints of\none order or another are as thick here as ordinary priests in Malta,\nwhom the late facetious Major Wright was accustomed to call\n_crows_--from their black dress--but better, cormorants, as agreeing\nwith their habits of fleecing the poor people.Sidi Amour Abeda\'s hands\nought to be lily-white, for every one who meets him kisses them with\ndevout and slavering obeisance.The renegade doctor of the Bey told us\nthat the old dervish now in question would like nothing better than to\nsee us English infidels burnt alive.Fanaticism seems to be the native\ngrowth of the human heart!We afterwards visited the Jabeah, or well, which they show as a\ncuriosity, as also the camel which turns round the buckets and brings up\nthe water, being all sanctified, like the wells of Mecca, and the\ndrinking of the waters forming an indispensable part of the pilgrimage\nto all holy Mohammedan cities.We returned to the Kaed\'s, and sat down to a capital dinner.The old\nGovernor was a great fanatic, and when R. ran up to shake hands with\nhim, the mamelukes stopped R. for fear he might be insulted.We visited\nthe fortress, which was in course of repair, our _cicerone_ being Sidi\nReschid, an artillery-officer.We then returned to the camp, and found\nSanta Maria, the French officer, had arrived, who, during the tour,\nemployed himself in taking sketches and making scientific observations.He was evidently a French spy on the resources of the Bey.It was given\nout, however, that he was employed to draw charts of Algiers, Tunis, and\nTripoli, by his Government.He endeavoured to make himself as unpopular\nas some persons try to make themselves agreeable, being very jealous of\nus, and every little thing that we had he used to cry for it and beg it\nlike a child, sometimes actually going to the Bey\'s tent in person, and\nasking his Highness for the things which he saw had been given to us.We went to see his Highness administer justice, which he always did,\nmorning and evening, whilst at Kairwan.There were many plaintiffs, but\nno defendants brought up; most of them were turned out in a very summary\nmanner.To some, orders were given, which we supposed enabled them to\nobtain redress; others were referred to the kadys and chiefs.The Bey,\nbeing in want of camels, parties were sent out in search of them, who\ndrove in all the finest that they could find, which were then marked\n("taba,") _a la Bey_, and immediately became the Bey\'s property.It was\na curious sight to see the poor animals thrown over, and the red-hot\niron put to their legs, amidst the cries and curses of their late\ndifferent owners--all which were not in the least attended to, the wants\nof the Bey, or Government, being superior on such occasions of\nnecessity, or what not, to all complaint, law, or justice.About two\nhundred changed hands in this way.The Bey of Tunis has an immense number of camels which he farms out.He\nhas overseers in certain districts, to whom he gives so many camels;\nthese let them out to other persons for mills and agricultural labours,\nat so much per head.The overseers annually render an account of them to\nGovernment, and, when called upon, supply the number required.At this\ntime, owing to a disorder which had caused a great mortality, camels had\nbeen very scarce, and this was the reason of the extensive seizure just\nmentioned.If an Arab commits manslaughter, his tribe is mulcted\nthirty-three camels; and, as the crime is rather common in the Bedouin\ndistricts, the Bey\'s acquisition in this way is considerable.A few\nyears ago, a Sicilian nobleman exported from Tunis to Sicily some eighty\ncamels, the duty for which the Bey remitted.The camel, if ever so\nhealthy and thriving in the islands of the Mediterranean, could never\nsupersede the labour of mules.The camel is only useful where there are\nvast plains to travel, as in North Africa, Arabia, Persia, Australasia,\nand some parts of the East Indies.A hundred more Arabs joined, who passed in a single file before the Bey\nfor inspection: they came rushing into the camp by twos and threes,\nfiring off their long guns.We crossed large plains, over which ran troops of gazelles, and had many\ngallops after them; but they go much faster than the greyhound, and,\nunless headed and bullied, there is little chance of taking them, except\nfound asleep.On coming on a troop unawares, R. shot one, which the dogs\ncaught.R. went up afterwards to cut its throat _a la Moresque_, when he\nwas insulted by an Arab.R. noticed the fellow, and afterwards told the\nBey, who instantly ordered him to receive two hundred bastinadoes, and\nto be put in chains; but, just as they had begun to whip him, R. went up\nand generously begged him off.This is the end of most bastinados in the\ncountry.We passed a stream which they said had swallowed up some\npersons, and was very dangerous.A muddy stream, they add, is often very\nfatal to travellers.The Bey surprised Captain B. by sending him a\nhandsome black horse as a present; he also sent a grey one to the\nFrenchman, who, when complaining of it, saying that it was a bad one, to\nthe Bey\'s mamelukes, his Highness sent for it, and gave him another.Under such circumstances, Saint Mary ought to have looked very foolish.The Bey shot a kader, a handsome bird, rather larger than a partridge,\nwith black wings, and flies like a plover.We had a large\nhawking-establishment with us, some twenty birds, very fine falconry,\nwhich sometimes carried off hares, and even attacked young goat-kids.Marched to a place called Gilma, near which the road passes through an\nancient town.Shaw says, "Gilma, the ancient Cilma, or Oppidum\nChilmanenense, is six leagues to the east-south-east of Spaitla.We have\nhere the remains of a large city, with the area of a temple, and some\nother fragments of large buildings.According to the tradition of the\nArabs, this place received its name in consequence of a miracle\npretended to have been wrought by one of their marabouts, in bringing\nhither the river of Spaitla, after it was lost underground.For Ja Elma\nsignifies, in their language, \'The water comes!\'an expression we are to\nimagine of surprise at the arrival of the stream."During our tour, the mornings were generally cold.We proceeded about\ntwenty miles, and encamped near a place called Wady Tuckah.This river\ncomes from the hills about three or four miles off, and when the camp\narrives at Kairwan, the Bey sends an order to the Arabs of the district\nto let the water run down to the place where the tents are pitched.When\nwe arrived, the water had just come.We saw warrens of hares, and caught\nmany with the dogs.Troops of gazelles were also surprised; one was\nfired at, and went off scampering on three legs.The hawks caught a\nbeautiful bird called hobara, or habary, [34] about the size of the\nsmall hen-turkey, lily white on the back, light brown brindle, tuft of\nlong white feathers on its head, and ruffle of long black feathers,\nwhich they stretch out at pleasure, with a large grey eye.A curious\nprickly plant grows about here, something like a dwarf broom, if its\nleaves were sharp thorns, it is called Kardert.The Bey made R. a\npresent of the hobara.One day three gazelles were caught, and also a fox, by R.\'s greyhound,\nwhich behaved extremely well, and left the other dogs in the rear, every\nnow and then attacking him in the hind-quarters.Saw seven or eight\nhobaras, but too windy for the hawks to be flown.Captain B. chased a\ngazelle himself, and had the good fortune to catch him.As soon as an\nArab secures an animal, he immediately cuts its throat, repeating\n"Bismillah, Allah Akbar," "In the name (of God), God is great."We marched seventeen miles to a place called Aly Ben Own, the name of\nthe saint buried close by.The plain we crossed must have been once\nthickly inhabited, as there were many remains.We were joined by more\nArabs, and our force continued to augment.The Bey, being in want of\nhorses, the same system of seizing them was adopted as with the camels.One splendid morning that broke over our encampment we had an\nopportunity of witnessing Africa\'s most gorgeous scenery.[35] Plenty of\nhobaras; they fly like a goose.The hawks took two or three of them,\nalso some hares.The poor hare does not know what to make of the hawks;\nafter a little running, it gives itself up for death, only first dodging\nout of the bird\'s pounce, or hiding itself in a tuft of grass or a bush,\nbut which it is not long allowed to do, for the Arabs soon drive it out\nfrom its vain retreat.The hawk, when he seizes the hare with one claw,\ncatches hold of any tuft of grass or irregularity of the ground with the\nother; a strong leather strap is also fastened from one leg to the\nother, to prevent them from being pulled open or strained.We came upon\na herd of small deer, called ebba, which are a little larger than the\ngazelle, but they soon bounded beyond our pursuit, leaving us scarcely\ntime to admire their delicate make and unapproachable speed.We crossed a range of hills into another plain, at the extremity of\nwhich lies Ghafsa.The surface was naked, with the exception of tufts of\nstrong, rushy grass, almost a sure indication of hares, and of which we\nstarted a great number.We saw another description of bird, called\nrhaad, [36] with white wings, which flew like a pigeon, but more\nswiftly.Near our tract were the remains of a large tank of ancient\nRoman construction.Marched fourteen or fifteen\nmiles to Zwaneah, which means "little garden," though there is no sign\nof such thing, unless it be the few oranges, dates, and pomegranates\nwhich they find here.We had water from a tank of modern construction;\nsome remains were close to the camp, the ancient cistern and stone duct\nleading from the hills.We had two thousand camels with the camp and\nfollowing it, for which not a single atom of provender is carried, the\ncamels subsisting scantily upon the coarse grass, weeds or thorns, which\nthe soil barely affords.The camel is very fond of sharp, prickly\nthorns.You look upon the animal, with its apparently most tender mouth,\nchopping the sharpest thorns it can find, full of amazement!Some of the\nchiefs who have lately joined us, have brought their wives with them,\nriding on camels in a sort of palanquin or shut-up machine.These\npalanquins have a kind of mast and shrouds, from which a bell is slung,\ntinkling with the swinging motion of the camel.This rude contrivance\nmakes the camel more than ever "the ship of the Desert."Several fine\nhorses were brought in as presents to the Bey, one a very fine mare.Our next march was towards Ghafsa, about twenty miles off.We were\njoined by a considerable number of fresh Arabs, who "played at powder,"\nand kept firing and galloping before the Bey the whole day; some of them\nmanaged themselves and their arms and horses with great address,\nbalancing the firelock on their heads, firing it, twisting it round,\nthrowing it into the air, and catching it again, and all without once\nlosing the command of their horses.An accident happened amidst the fun;\ntwo of the parties came in contact, and one of them received a dreadful\ngash on the forehead.The dresses of some of them were very rich, and\nlooked very graceful on horseback.A ride over sand-hills brought us in\nview of the town, embedded in olive and date-trees, looking fresh and\ngreen after our hot and dusty march; it lay stretched at the foot of a\nrange of hills, which formed the boundaries of another extensive plain.We halted at Ghafsa, [37] which is almost a mass of rubbish filled with\ndirty people, although there are plenty of springs about, principally\nhot and mineral waters.Sandra went to the kitchen.Although the Moors, by their religion, are\nenjoined the constant use of the bath, yet because they do not change\ntheir linen and other clothes, they are always very dirty.They do not,\nhowever, exceed the Maltese and Sicilians, and many other people of the\nneighbourhood, in filth, and perhaps the Moors are cleaner in their\nhahits than they.The Arabs are extremely disgusting, and their women\nare often seen in a cold winter\'s evening, standing with their legs\nextended over a smoky wood fire, holding up their petticoats, and\ncontinuing in this indelicate position for hours together.In these Thermae, or hot, sulphurous, and other mineral springs, is the\nphenomenon of the existence of fish and small snakes.These were\nobserved by our tourists, but I shall give three other authorities\nbesides them.Shaw says: "\'The Ouri-el-Nout,\' _i.e_., \'Well of Fish,\'\nand the springs of Ghasa and Toser, nourish a number of small fishes of\nthe mullet and perch kind, and are of an easy digestion.Of the like\nquality are the other waters of the Jereed, all of them, after they\nbecome cold, being the common drink of the inhabitants."Sir Grenville\nTemple remarks: "The thermometer in the water marked ninety-five\ndegrees; and, what is curious, a considerable number of fish is found in\nthis stream, which measure from four to six inches in length, and\nresemble, in some degree, the gudgeon, having a delicate flavour.Bruce\nmentions a similar fact, but he says he saw it in the springs of\nFeriana.Part of the ancient structure of these baths still exists, and\npieces of inscriptions are observed in different places."Honneger has made a sketch of this fish.The wood-cut represents it\none half the natural size:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe snake, not noticed by former tourists, has been observed by Mr.Honneger, which nourishes itself entirely upon the fish.The wood-cut\nrepresents the snake half its natural size:\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe fish and the snake live together, though not very amicably, in the\nhot-springs.Prince Puekler Muskau, who travelled in Tunis, narrates\nthat, "Near the ruins of Utica was a warm spring, in whose almost hot\nwaters we found several turtles, _which seemed to inhabit this basin_."However, perhaps, there is no such extraordinary difficulty in the\napprehension of this phenomenon, for "The Gulf Stream," on leaving the\nGulf of Mexico, "has a temperature of more than 27 deg.(centigrade), or\n80-6/10 degrees of Fahrenheit."[38]\n\nMany a fish must pass through and live in this stream.And after all,\nsince water is the element of fish, and is hotter or colder in all\nregions, like the air, the element of man, which he breathes, warmer or\ncooler, according to clime and local circumstances--there appear to be\nno physical objections in the way of giving implicit credence to our\ntourists.Water is so abundant, that the adjoining plain might be easily\nirrigated, and planted with ten thousand palms and forests of olives.God is bountiful in the Desert, but man wilfully neglects these aqueous\nriches springing up eternally to repair the ravages of the burning\nsimoum!In one of the groves we met a dervish, who immediately set about\ncharming our Boab.John went to the office.He began by an incantation, then seized him round the\nmiddle, and, stooping a little, lifted him on his shoulders, continuing\nthe while the incantation.He then put him on his feet again, and, after\nseveral attempts, appeared to succeed in bringing off his stomach\nsomething in the shape of leaden bullets, which he then, with an air of\nholy swagger, presented to the astonished guard of the Bey.The dervish\nnext spat on his patient\'s hands, closed them in his own, then smoothed\nhim down the back like a mountebank smooths his pony, and stroked also\nhis head and beard; and, after further gentle and comely ceremonies of\nthis sort, the charming of the charmer finished, and the Boab presented\nthe holy man with his fee.We dined at the Kaed\'s house; this\nfunctionary was a very venerable man, a perfect picture of a patriarch\nof the olden Scriptural times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.There was\nnot a single article of furniture in the room, except a humble sofa,\nupon which he sat.We inspected the old Kasbah at Ghafsa, which is in nearly a state of\nruin, and looked as if it would soon be down about our ears.It is an\nirregular square, and built chiefly of the remains of ancient edifices.It was guarded by fifty Turks, whose broken-down appearance was in\nperfect harmony with the citadel they inhabited.The square in a\nbuilding is the favourite form of the Moors and Mohammedans generally;\nthe Kaaba of Mecca, the _sanctum sanctorum_, is a square.The Moors\nendeavour to imitate the sacred objects of their religion in every way,\neven in the commonest affairs of human existence, whilst likewise their\ntroops of wives and concubines are only an earthly foretaste and an\nearnest of the celestial ladies they expect to meet hereafter.We saw them making oil, which was in a very primitive fashion.The\noil-makers were nearly all women.The olives were first ground between\nstones worked by the hands, until they became of the consistence of\npaste, which was then taken down to the stream and put into a wooden tub\nwith water.On being stirred up, the oil rises to the top, which they\nskim off with their hands and put into skins or jars; when thus skimmed,\nthey pass the grounds or refuse through a sieve, the water running off;\nthe stones and pulp are then saved for firing.But in this way much of\nthe oil is lost, as may be seen by the greasy surface of the water below\nwhere this rude process is going on.Among the oil-women, we noticed a\ngirl who would have been very pretty and fascinating had she washed\nherself instead of the olives.We entered an Arab house inhabited by\nsome twenty persons, chiefly women, who forthwith unceremoniously took\noff our caps, examined very minutely all our clothes with an excited\ncuriosity, laughed heartily when we put our hands in our pockets, and\nwished to do the same, and then pulled our hair, looking under our faces\nwith amorous glances.On the hill overlooking the town, we also met two\nwomen screaming frightfully and tearing their faces; we learned that one\nof them had lost her child.The women make the best blankets here with\nhandlooms, and do the principal heavy work.We saw some hobaras, also a bird called getah, smaller than a partridge,\nsomething like a ptarmigan, with its summer feathers, and head shaped\nlike a quail.The Bey sent two live ones to R., besides a couple of\nlarge jerboahs of this part, called here, _gundy_.They are much like\nthe guinea-pig, but of a sandy colour, and very soft and fine, like a\nyoung hare.The jerboahs in the neighbourhood of Tunis are certainly\nmore like the rat.The other day, near the south-west gates, we fell in\nwith a whole colony of them--which, however, were the lesser animal, or\nJerd species--who occupied an entire eminence to themselves, the\nsovereignty of which seemed to have been conceded to them by the Bey of\nTunis.They looked upon us as intruders, and came very near to us, as if\nasking us why we had the audacity to disturb the tranquillity of their\nrepublic.The ground here in many places was covered with a substance\nlike the rime of a frosty morning; it tastes like salt, and from it they\nget nitre.The water which we drank was\nbrought from Ghafsa: the Bey drinks water brought from Tunis.We marched\nacross a vast plain, covered with the salt just mentioned, which was\ncongealed in shining heaps around bushes or tufts of grass, and among\nwhich also scampered a few hares.We encamped at a place called\nGhorbatah.Close to the camp was a small shallow stream, on each side of\nwhich grew many canes; we bathed in the stream, and felt much refreshed.The evening was pleasantly cool, like a summer evening in England, and\nreminded us of the dear land of our birth.Numerous plains in North\nAfrica are covered with saline and nitrous efflorescence; to the\npresence of these minerals is owing the inexhaustible fertility of the\nsoil, which hardly ever receives any manure, only a little stubble being\noccasionally burnt.We saw flights of the getah, and of another bird called the gedur,\nnearly the same, but rather lighter in colour.When they rise from the\nground, they make a curious noise, something like a partridge.We were\nunusually surprised by a flight of locusts, not unlike grasshoppers, of\nabout two inches long, and of a reddish colour.Halted by the dry bed of a river, called Furfouwy.A pool supplied the\ncamp: in the mountains, at a distance, there was, however, a delicious\nspring, a stream of liquid pearls in these thirsty lands!A bird called\nmokha appeared now and then; it is about the size of a nightingale, and\nof a white light-brown colour.We seldom heard such sweet notes as this\nbird possesses.Its flying is beautifully novel and curious; it runs on\nthe ground, and now and then stops and rises about fifteen feet from the\nsurface, giving, as it ascends, two or three short slow whistles, when\nit opens its graceful tail and darts down to the ground, uttering\nanother series of melodious whistles, but much quicker than when it\nrises.We continued our march over nearly the same sort of country, but all was\nnow flat as far as the eye could see, the hills being left behind us.About eight miles from Furfouwy, we came to a large patch of date-trees,\nwatered by many springs, but all of them hot.Under the grateful shade\nof the lofty palm were flowers and fruits in commingled sweetness and\nbeauty.Here was the village of Dra-el-Hammah, surrounded, like all the\ntowns of the Jereed, with date-groves and gardens.The houses were most\nhumbly built of mud and bricks.After a scorching march, we encamped\njust beyond, having made only ten miles.Saw quantities of bright soft\nspar, called talc.Here also the ground was covered with a saline\neffloresence.Near us were put up about a dozen blue cranes, the only\nbirds seen to-day.A gazelle was caught, and others chased.We\nparticularly observed huge patches of ground covered with salt, which,\nat a distance, appeared just like water.Toser.--The Bey\'s Palace.--Blue Doves.--The town described.--Industry\nof the People.--Sheikh Tahid imprisoned and punished.--Leghorn.--The\nBoo-habeeba.--A Domestic Picture.--The Bey\'s Diversions.--The Bastinado.--\nConcealed Treasure.--Nefta.--The Two Saints.--Departure of Santa Maria.--\nSnake-charmers.--Wedyen.--Deer Stalking.--Splendid view of the Sahara.--\nRevolting Acts.--Qhortabah.--Ghafsa.--Byrlafee.--Mortality among the\nCamels--Aqueduct.--Remains of Udina.--Arrival at Tunis.--The Boab\'s\nWives.--Curiosities.--Tribute Collected.--Author takes leave of the\nGovernor of Mogador, and embarks for England.--Rough Weather.--Arrival\nin London.Leaving Dra-el-Hammah, after a hot march of five or six miles, we\narrived at the top of a rising ground, at the base of which was situate\nthe famous Toser, the head-quarters of the camp in the Jereed, and as\nfar as it goes.Behind the city was a forest of date-trees, and beyond\nthese and all around, as far as the eye could wander, was an\nimmeasurable waste--an ocean of sand--a great part of which we could\nhave sworn was water, unless told to the contrary.We were met, before\nentering Toser, with some five or six hundred Arabs, who galloped before\nthe Bey, and fired as usual.The people stared at us Christians with\nopen mouths; our dress apparently astonished them.At Toser, the Bey\nleft his tent and entered his palace, so called in courtesy to his\nHighness, but a large barn of a house, without any pretensions.We had\nalso a room allotted to us in this palace, which was the best to be\nfound in the town, though a small dark affair.Toser is a miserable\nassemblage of mud and brick huts, of very small dimensions, the beams\nand the doors being all of date-wood.The gardens, however, under the\ndate-trees are beautiful, and abundantly watered with copious streams,\nall of which are warm, and in one of which we bathed ourselves and felt\nnew vigour run through our veins.We took a walk in the gardens, and\nwere surprised at the quantities of doves fluttering among the\ndate-trees; they were the common blue or Barbary doves.In the environs\nof Mogador, these doves are the principal birds shot.Toser, or Touzer, the _Tisurus_ of ancient geography, is a considerable\ntown of about six thousand souls, with several villages in its\nneighbourhood.The impression of Toser made upon our tourists agrees with that of the\ntraveller, Desfontaines, who writes of it in 1784:--"The Bey pitched his\ntent on the right side of the city, if such can be called a mass of\n_mud-houses_."Shaw,\nwho says that "the villages of the Jereed are built of mud-walls and\nrafters of palm-trees."Evidently, however, some improvement has been\nmade of late years.The Arabs of Toser, on the contrary, and which very\nnatural, protested to the French scientific commission that Toser was\nthe finest city in El-Jereed.They pretend that it has an area as large\nas Algiers, surrounded with a mud wall, twelve or fifteen feet high, and\ncrenated.In the centre is a vast open space, which serves for a\nmarket-place.Toser has mosques, schools, Moorish baths--a luxury rare\non the confines of the Desert, fondouks or inns, &c. The houses have\nflat terraces, and are generally well-constructed, the greater part\nbuilt from the ruins of a Roman town; but many are now dilapidated from\nthe common superstitious cause of not repairing or rebuilding old\nhouses.The choice material for building is brick, mostly unbaked or\nsun-dried.Toser, situate in a plain, is commanded from the north-west by a little\nrocky mountain, whence an abundant spring takes its source, called\n_Meshra_, running along the walls of the city southward, divides itself\nafterwards in three branches, waters the gardens, and, after having\nirrigated the plantations of several other villages, loses itself in the\nsand at a short distance.The wells within the city of Toser are\ninsufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, who fetch water\nfrom Wad Meshra.The neighbouring villages are Belad-el-Ader, Zin,\nAbbus; and the sacred villages are Zaouweeat, of Tounseea, Sidi Ali Bou\nLifu, and Taliraouee.The Arabs of the open country, and who deposit\ntheir grain in and trade with these villages, are Oulad Sidi Sheikh,\nOulad Sidi Abeed, and Hammania.The dates of Toser are esteemed of the\nfinest quality.Walked about the town; several of the inhabitants are very wealthy.The\ndead saints are, however, here, and perhaps everywhere else in Tunis,\nmore decently lodged, and their marabets are real "whitewashed\nsepulchres."They make many burnouses at Toser, and every house presents\nthe industrious sight of the needle or shuttle quickly moving.We tasted\nthe leghma, or "tears of the date," for the first time, and rather liked\nit.On going to shoot doves, we, to our astonishment, put up a snipe.The weather was very hot; went to shoot doves in the cool of the\nevening.The Bey administers justice, morning and evening, whilst in the\nJereed.An Arab made a present of a fine young ostrich to the Bey, which\nhis Highness, after his arrival in Tunis, sent to R. The great man here\nis the Sheikh Tahid, who was imprisoned for not having the tribute ready\nfor the Bey.The tax imposed is equivalent to two bunches for each\ndate-tree.The Sheikh has to collect them, paying a certain yearly sum\nwhen the Bey arrives, a species of farming-out.It was said that he is\nvery rich, and could well find the money.The dates are almost the only\nfood here, and the streets are literally gravelled with their stones.Santa Maria again returned his horse to the Bey, and got another in its\nstead.He is certainly a man of _delicate_ feeling.This gentleman\ncarried his impudence so far that he even threatened some of the Bey\'s\nofficers with the supreme wrath of the French Government, unless they\nattended better to his orders.A new Sheikh was installed, a good thing\nfor the Bey\'s officers, as many of them got presents on the occasion.We blessed our stars that a roof was over our heads to shield us from\nthe burning sun.We blew an ostrich-egg, had the contents cooked, and\nfound it very good eating.They are sold for fourpence each, and it is\npretended that one makes an ample meal for twelve persons.We are\nsupplied with leghma every morning; it tastes not unlike cocoa-nut milk,\nbut with more body and flavour.R. very unwell, attributed it to his\ntaking copious draughts of the leghma.Rode out of an evening; there was\na large encampment of Arabs outside the town, thoroughly sun-burnt,\nhardy-looking fellows, some of them as black as <DW64>s.Many people in\nToser have sore eyes, and several with the loss of one eye, or nearly\nso; opthalmia, indeed, is the most prevalent disease in all Barbary.The\nneighbourhood of the Desert, where the greater part of the year the air\nis filled with hot particles of sand, is very unfavourable to the sight;\nthe dazzling whiteness of the whitewashed houses also greatly injures\nthe eyes.But the Moors pretend that lime-washing is necessary to the\npreservation of the houses from the weather, as well as from filth of\nall sorts.We think really it is useful, by preventing dirty people in\nmany cases from being eaten up by their own filth and vermin,\nparticularly the Jews, the Tunisian Jews being the dirtiest persons in\nthe Regency.The lime-wash is the grand _sanitary_ instrument in North\nAfrica.There are little birds that frequent the houses, that might be called\nJereed sparrows, and which the Arabs name boo-habeeba, or "friend of my\nfather;" but their dress and language are very different, having reddish\nbreasts, being of a small size, and singing prettily.Shaw mentions them\nunder the name of the Capsa-sparrow, but he is quite wrong in making\nthem as large as the common house-sparrow.He adds: "It is all over of a\nlark-colour, excepting the breast, which is somewhat lighter, and\nshineth like that of a pigeon.The boo-habeeba has a note infinitely\npreferable to that of the canary, or nightingale."He says that all\nattempts to preserve them alive out of the districts of the Jereed have\nfailed.R. has brought several home from that country, which were alive\nwhilst I was in Tunis.There are also many at the Bardo in cages, that\nlive in this way as long as other birds.Went to see the houses of the inhabitants: they were nearly all the\nsame, the furniture consisting of a burnouse-loom, a couple of\nmillstones, and a quantity of basins, plates, and dishes, hung upon the\nwalls for effect, seldom being used; there were also some skins of\ngrain.The beams across the rooms, which are very high, are hung with\nonions, dates, and pomegranates; the houses are nearly all of one story.Some of the women are pretty, with large long black eyes and lashes;\nthey colour the lower lid black, which does not add to their beauty,\nthough it shows the bewitching orb more fully and boldly.They were\nexceedingly dirty and ragged, wearing, nevertheless, a profusion of\near-rings, armlets, anclets, bracelets, and all sorts of _lets_, with a\nthousand talismanic charms hanging from their necks upon their ample\nbosoms, which latter, from the habit of not wearing stays, reach as low\ndown as their waists.They wrap up the children in swaddling-clothes,\nand carry them behind their backs when they go out.Two men were bastinadoed for stealing a horse, and not telling where\nthey put him; every morning they were to be flogged until they divulged\ntheir hiding-place.A man brought in about a foot of horse\'s skin, on which was the Bey\'s\nmark, for which he received another horse.This is always done when any\nanimal dies belonging to the Beys, the man in whose hands the animal is,\nreceiving a new one on producing the part of the skin marked.The Bey\nand his ministers and mamelukes amused themselves with shooting at a\nmark.The Bey and his mamelukes also took diversion in spoiling the appearance\nof a very nice young horse; they daubed hieroglyphics upon his shoulders\nand loins, and dyed the back where the saddle is placed, and the three\nlegs below the knee with henna, making the other leg look as white as\npossible.Another grey horse, a very fine one, was also cribbed.We may\nremark here, that there were very few fine horses to be met with, all\nthe animals looking poor and miserable, whilst these few fine ones fell\ninto the hands of the Bey.It is probable, however, that the Arabs kept\ntheir best and most beautiful horses out of the way, while the camp was\nmoving among them.The bastinadoes with which he\nhad been treated were inflicted on his bare person, cold water being\napplied thereto, which made the punishment more severe.After receiving\none hundred, he said he would shew his hiding-place; and some people\nbeing sent with him, dug a hole where he pointed out, but without coming\nto anything.This was done several times, but with the same effect.He\nwas then locked up in chains till the following morning.Millions of\ndollars lie buried by the Arabs at this moment in different parts of\nBarbary, especially in Morocco, perhaps the half of which will never be\nfound, the owners of them having died before they could point out their\nhoarded treasures to their relatives, as but a single person is usually\nin the secret.Money is in this way buried by tribes, who have nothing\nwhatever to fear from their sovereigns and their sheikhs; they do it\nfrom immemorial custom.It is for this reason the Arabs consider that\nunder all ancient ruins heaps of money are buried, placed there by men\nor demons, who hold the shining hoards under their invincible spell.They cannot comprehend how European tourists can undertake such long\njourneys, merely for the purpose of examining old heaps of stones, and\nmaking plans and pictures of such rubbish.When any person attempts to\nconvince the Arabs that this is the sole object, they only laugh with\nincredulity.Went to Nefta, a ride of about fourteen miles, lying somewhat nearer the\nSahara than Toser.The country on the right was undulating sand, on the\nleft an apparently boundless ocean, where lies, as a vast sheet of\nliquid fire, when the sun shines on it, the now long celebrated Palus\nLibya.In this so-called lake no water is visible, except a small marsh\nlike the one near Toser, where we went duck-shooting.Our party was very\nrespectable, consisting of the Agha of the Arabs, two or three of the\nBey\'s mamelukes, the Kaed of the Jereed, whose name is Braun, and fifty\nor sixty Arab guards, besides ourselves.On entering Nefta, the escort\nimmediately entered, according to custom, a marabet (that of Sidi Bou\nAly), Captain B. and R. meanwhile standing outside.There were two famous saints here, one of whom was a hundred years of\nage.The other, Sidi Mustapha Azouz, had the character of being a very\nclever and good man, which also his intelligent and benevolent\nappearance betokened, and not a fanatic, like Amour Abeda of Kairwan.There were at the time of our visit to him about two hundred people in\nhis courtyard, who all subsisted on his charities.We were offered\ndates, kouskousou, [39] and a seed which they call sgougou, and which\nhas the appearance of dried apple-seed.The Arabs eat it with honey,\nfirst dipping their fingers into the honey, and then into the seed,\nwhich deliciously sticks to the honey.The Sheikh\'s saint also\ndistributed beads and rosaries.He gave R. a bag of sgougou-seed, as\nwell as some beads.These two Sheikhs are objects of most religious\nveneration amongst all true believers, and there is nothing which would\nnot be done at their bidding.Nefta, the Negeta of the ancients, is the frontier town of the Tunisian\nterritories from the south, being five days\' journey, or about\nthirty-five or forty leagues from the oases of Souf, and fifteen days\'\nfrom Ghadumes.Nefta is not so much a town as an agglomeration of\nvillages, separated from one another by gardens, and occupying an extent\nof surface twice the size that of the city of Algiers.These villages\nare Hal Guema, Mesaba, Zebda Ouled, Sherif, Beni Zeid, Beni Ali, Sherfa,\nand Zaouweeah Sidi Ahmed.The position of Nefta and its environs is very picturesque.The principal source, which, under the name of Wad Nefta,\ntakes its rise at the north of the city, in the midst of a movement of\nearth, enters the villages of Sherfa and Sidi Ahmed; divides them in\ntwo, and fecundates its gardens planted with orange-trees, pomegranates,\nand fig-trees.The same spring, by the means of ducts of earth, waters a\nforest of date-trees which extends some leagues.A regulator of the\nwater (kaed-el-ma) distributes it to each proprietor of the plantation.The houses of Nefta are built generally of brick; some with taste and\nluxury; the interior is ornamented with Dutch tiles brought from Tunis.Each quarter has its mosque and school, and in the centre of the group\nof villages is a place called Rebot, on the banks of Wad Nefta, which\nserves for a common market.Here are quarters specially devoted to the\naristocratic landed proprietors, and others to the busy merchants.The\nShereefs are the genuine nobles, or seigneurs of Nefta, from among whom\nthe Bey is wont to choose the Governors of the city.The complexion of\nthe population is dark, from its alliance with Negress slaves, like most\ntowns advanced in the Desert.They\nare strict observers of the law, and very hospitable to strangers.Captain B., however, thought that, had he not been under the protection\nof the Bey, his head would not have been worth much in these districts.Every traveller almost forms a different opinion, and frequently the\nvery opposite estimate, respecting the strangers amongst whom he is\nsojourning.A few Jewish artizans have always been tolerated here, on\ncondition of wearing a black handkerchief round their heads, and not\nmount a horse, &c. Recently the Bey, however, by solemn decrees, has\nplaced the Jews exactly on the same footing of rights and privileges as\nthe rest of his subjects.Nefta is the intermediate _entrepot_ of commerce which Tunis pours\ntowards the Sahara, and for this reason is called by the Arabs, "the\ngate of Tunis;" but the restrictive system established by the Turks\nduring late years at Ghadumes, has greatly damaged the trade between the\nJereed and the Desert.The movement of the markets and caravans takes\nplace at the beginning of spring, and at the end of summer.Only a\nportion of the inhabitants is devoted to commerce, the rich landed\nproprietory and the Shereefs representing the aristocracy, lead the\ntranquil life of nobles, the most void of care, and, perhaps, the\nhappiest of which contemplative philosophy ever dreamed.The oasis of\nNefta, indeed, is said to be the most poetic of the Desert; its gardens\nare delicious; its oranges and lemons sweet; its dates the finest fruit\nin the "land of dates."Nearly all the women are pretty, of that beauty\npeculiar to the Oriental race; and the ladies who do not expose\nthemselves to the fierce sun of the day, are as fair as Mooresses.Santa Maria left for Ghabs, to which place there is not a correct route\nlaid down in any chart.There are three routes, but the wells of one are\nonly known to travellers, a knowledge which cannot be dispensed with in\nthese dry regions.The wells of the other two routes are known to the\nbordering tribes alone, who, when they have taken a supply of water,\ncover them up with sand, previously laying a camel-skin over the\nwell-mouth, to prevent the sand falling into the water, so that, while\ndying with thirst, you might be standing on a well and be none the\nwiser.The Frenchman has taken with him an escort of twelve men.The\nweather is cooler, with a great deal of wind, raising and darkening the\nsky with sand; even among the dategroves our eyes and noses were like so\nmany sand-quarries.Sheikh Tahib has been twice subjected to corporal punishment in the same\nway as before mentioned, with the addition of fifty, but they cannot\nmake him bleed as they wish.He declares he has not got the money, and\nthat he cannot pay them, though they cut him to pieces.As he has\ncollected a great portion of the tribute of the people, one cannot much\npity the lying rogue.We were amused with the snake-charmers.These gentry are a company under\nthe protection of their great saint Sidi Aysa, who has long gone\nupwards, but also is now profitably employed in helping the juggling of\nthese snake-mountebanks.These fellows take their snakes about in small\nbags or boxes, which are perfectly harmless, their teeth and poison-bags\nbeing extracted.They carry them in their bosoms, put them in their\nmouths, stuffing a long one in of some feet in length, twist them around\ntheir arms, use them as a whip to frighten the people, in the meanwhile\nscreaming out and crying unto their Heavenly protector for help, the\nbystanders devoutly joining in their prayers.The snake-charmers usually\nperform other tricks, such as swallowing nails and sticking an iron bar\nin their eyes; and they wear their hair long like women, which gives\nthem a very wild maniacal look.Three of the mamelukes and ourselves went to Wedyen, a town and\ndate-wood about eight miles from Toser, to the left.The date-grove is\nextensive, and there are seven villages in it of the same name.We slept\nin the house of the Sheikh, who complained that the Frenchman, in\npassing that way, had allowed his escort to plunder, and actually bound\nthe poor Sheikh, threatening him on his remonstrating.What conduct for\nChristians to teach these people!One morning before daylight, we were on horseback, and _en route_\ntowards the hills, for the purpose of shooting loted, as they call a\nspecies of deer found here.The ground in the neighbourhood of Wedyen is\ntossed about like a hay-field, and volcanic looking.About four miles\noff we struck into the rocks, on each side of our path, rising\nperpendicularly in fantastic shapes.On reaching the highest ground, the\nview was exceedingly wild.Much of the rock appeared as if it had only\njust been cooled from a state of fusion; there was also a quantity of\ntuffo rock, similar to that in the neighbourhood of Naples.The first\nanimal we saw was a wolf, which, standing on the sky-line of the\nopposite hill, looked gigantic.The deep valley between, however,\nprevented our nearer approach.We soon after came on a loted, who took to his heels, turning round a\nmass of rock; but, soon after, he almost met as, and we had a view of\nhim within forty yards.Several shots were fired at him without effect,\nand he at last made his escape, with a speed which defied all our\nattempts at following him.Dismounting, the Sheikh Ali, of the Arab\ntribe Hammama, who was with us, and who is the greatest deer-stalker in\nthe country, preceded us a little distance to look out for deer, the\nmarks of which were here very numerous.After a short time, an Arab\nbrought information of a herd of some thirty, with a good many young\nones; but our endeavours to have a shot at them were fruitless, though\none of the Arabs got near enough to loose the dogs at them, and a\ngreyhound was kicked over for his pains.We saw no more of them; but our\nwant of success was not surprising, silence not being in the least\nattended to, and our party was far too large.The Arabs have such a\nhorrible habit of vociferation, that it is a wonder they ever take any\ngame at all.About the hills was scattered a great variety of aromatic\nplants, quantities of shells, and whole oyster-beds, looking almost as\nfresh as if they had been found by the sea-side.On our return from Toser, we had an extensive view of the Sahara, an\nocean as far as the eye could see, of what one would have taken his oath\nwas water, the shores, inlets, and bays being clearly defined, but, in\nreality, nothing but salt scattered on the surface.Several islets were\napparently breaking its watery expanse, but these also were only heaps\nof sand raised from the surrounding flat.The whole country, hills,\nplains and deserts, gave us an idea as if the materials had been thrown\ntogether for manufacture, and had never been completed.Nevertheless\nthese savage deserts of boundless extent are as complete in their kind\nas the smiling meadows and fertile corn-fields of England, each being\nperfect in itself, necessary to the grand whole of creation, and forming\nan essential portion of the works of Divine Providence.The Sheikh Tahib\'s gardens were sold for 15,000 piastres, his wife also\nadded to this 1,000, and he was set at liberty.The dates have been\ncoming in to a great amount.The\nprincipal are:--Degalah, the most esteemed, which are very sweet and\nalmost transparent.Captain B. preferred the Trungah, another first-rate\nsort, which are plum-shaped, and taste something like a plum.There are\nalso the Monachah, which are larger than the other two, dryer and more\nmealy, and not so sweet as Degalah, and other sorts.The dates were very\nfine, though in no very great abundance, the superior state of ripeness\nbeing attributed to there only being a single day of rain during the\npast year in the Jereed.Rain is bad for the dates, but the roots of the\ntree cannot have too much water.The tent-pitchers of the camp went round and performed, in mask, actions\nof the most revolting description, some being dressed as women, and\ndancing in the most lascivious and indecent manner.One fellow went up\nto R., who was just on the point of knocking him down, when, seeing the\nTreasurer of the Bey cracking his sides with laughter, he allowed the\nbrute to go off under such high patronage.It was even said that these\nfellows were patronized by his Highness.But, on all Moorish feastdays,\nlascivious actions of men and women are an indispensable part of their\nentertainment.This is the worst side of the character of the Moors.The\nMoorish women were never so profligate as since the arrival of the\nFrench in Algeria.One of the greatest chiefs, Sultan Kaed, of the Hammama has just died.He was an extremely old man, and it is certain that people live to a\ngood old age in this burning clime.During his life, he had often\ndistinguished himself, and lastly against the French, before\nConstantina.Whilst in the hills one day, we came suddenly upon a set of\nArabs, about nine in number, who took to their heels on seeing us.A man\nhas just been killed near this place, probably by the same gang.For\nrobbery and murder, no hills could be better fitted, the passes being so\nintricate, and the winds and turns so sudden and sharp.The Sheikh Ali\nbrought in two loteds, a female and its young one, which he had shot.The head of the loted is like a deer\'s, but the eye is further up: it is\nabout a fallowdeer\'s size.The female has not the beard like a goat, but\nlong hair, reaching from the head to the bottom of the chest, and over\nthe fore-legs.These loteds were taken in consequence of an order from\nthe Bey, that they should not return without some.On our march back to Tunis, we encamped for two days by the foot of a\nrange of hills at Sheesheeah, about ten miles off.The water, brought\nfrom some distance, was bad and salt.We proceeded to Ghortabah, our old place.Two of the prisoners (about\ntwelve of whom we had with us), and one of the Turks, died from the\nexcessive heat.The two couriers that were sent with despatches for the\nGovernment were attacked near this place by the Arabs, and the horse of\none was so injured, that it was necessary to kill him; the man who rode\nthe horse was also shot through the leg.This was probably in revenge\nfor the exactions of the Bey of the Camp on the tribes.On our return to Ghafsa, we had rain, hail, and high wind, and\nexceedingly cold--a Siberian winter\'s day on the verge of the scorching\ndesert.The ground, where there was clay, very slippery; the camels\nreeled about as if intoxicated.The consequence was, it was long before\nthe tents came up, and we endured much from this sudden change of the\nweather.Our sufferings were, however, nothing as compared to others,\nfor during the day, ten men were brought in dead, from the cold (three\ndied four days before from heat), principally Turks; and, had there been\nno change in the temperature, we cannot tell how many would have shared\nthe same fate.Many of the camels, struggling against the clayey soil,\ncould not come up.Eight more men were shortly buried, and three were missing.The sudden\ntransition from the intense heat of the one day to the freezing cold of\nthe next, probably gave the latter a treble power, producing these\ndisastrous effects, the poor people being sadly ill-clad, and quite\nunprepared for such extreme rigour.Besides, on our arrival at the camp,\nall the money in Europe could not have purchased us the required\ncomforts, or rather necessaries, to preserve our health.We were exceedingly touched on hearing of the\ndeath of a little girl, whom we saw driven out of a kitchen, in which\nthe poor helpless little thing had taken refuge from the inclemency of\nthe weather.Santa Maria arrived from Ghabs without accident, having scarcely seen a\nsoul the whole of the way.He certainly was an enterprizing fellow,\nworthy of imitation.He calculated the distance from Ghabs to Toser at\n200 miles.There are a number of towns in the districts of Ghabs better\nbuilt than those of Nefta and Toser; Ghabs river is also full of water\nand the soil of the country is very fertile.The dates are not so good\nas those of the Jereed.Ghabs is about 130 miles from Ghafsa.We here\ntook our farewell of Santa Maria; he went to Beja, the head-quarters of\nthe summer-camp: thence, of course, he would proceed to Algiers, to give\nan account of his _espionage_.Next season, he said, he would go to\nTripoli and Ghadames; he had been many years in North Africa, and spoke\nArabic fluently.We next marched to Byrlafee, about twenty miles, and ninety-one from\nToser, where there are the ruins of an old town.The weather continued\ncold and most wintry.Here is a very ancient well still in use.Fragments of cornices and pillars are strewn about.The foundations of\nhouses, and some massive stone towers, which from their having a pipe up\nthe centre, must have had something to do with regulating the water, are\nall that remain.We had now much wind, but no rain.A great many camels and horses\nperished.Altogether, the number of camels that died on the return of\nthe camp, was 550.The price of a camel varies from 60 to 200 piastres.Many good ones were sold at the camp for eighty piastres each, or about\ntwo pounds ten shillings, English money.A good sheep was disposed of\nfor four or five piastres, or about three shillings.A horse in the extremities of nature, or near to\nthe _articulo mortis_, was sold for a piastre, eight pence; a camel, in\na like situation, was sold for a piastre and a half.A tolerably good\nhorse in Tunis sells at from 800 to 1000 piastres.There are the remains of an aqueduct at Gilma, and several other\nbuildings, the capitals of the pillars being elaborately worked.It is\nseen that nearly the entire surface of Tunis is covered with remains of\naqueducts, Roman, Christian, and Moorish.If railways be applied to this\ncountry--the French, are already talking about forming one from Algiers\nto Blidah, across the Mitidjah--unquestionably along the lines will be\nconstructed ducts for water, which could thus be distributed over the\nwhole country.Instead of the camels of the "Bey of the Camp" carrying\nwater from Tunis to the Jereed, the railway would take from Zazwan, the\nbest and most delicious water in the Regency, to the dry deserts of the\nJereed, with the greatest facility.As to railways paying in this\ncountry, the resources of Tunis, if developed, could pay anything.Marching onwards about eighteen miles, we encamped two or three beyond\nan old place called Sidi-Ben-Habeeba.A man murdered a woman from\njealousy in the camp, but made his escape.Almost every eminence we\npassed was occupied with the remains of some ancient fort, or temple.There was a good deal of corn in small detached patches, but it must be\nremembered, the north-western provinces are the corn-districts.In the course of the following three days, we reached Sidi-Mahammedeah,\nwhere are the magnificent remains of Udina.After about an hour\'s halt,\nand when all the tents had been comfortably pitched, the Bey astonished\nus with an order to continue our march, and we pursued our way to\nMomakeeah, about thirty miles, which we did not reach until after dark.We passed, for some three or four hours, through a flight of locusts,\nthe air being darkened, and the ground loaded with them.At a little\ndistance, a flight of locusts has the appearance of a heavy snow-storm.These insects rarely visit the capital; but, since the appearance of\nthose near Momakeeah, they have been collected in the neighbourhood of\nthe city, cooked, and sold among the people.Momakeeah is a countryhouse\nbelonging to the Bey, to whom, also, belongs a great portion of the land\naround.There is a large garden, laid out in the Italian style attached\nto this country-seat.On arriving at Tunis, we called at the Bardo as we passed, and saw the\nguard mounting.There was rather a fine band of military music; Moorish\nmusicians, but playing, after the European style, Italian and Moorish\nairs.We must give here some account of our Boab\'s domestic concerns.He\nboasted that he had had twenty-seven wives, his religion allowing four\nat once, which he had bad several times; he was himself of somewhat\nadvanced years.According to him, if a man quarrels with his wife, he\ncan put her in prison, but must, at the same time, support her.A\ncertain quantity of provision is laid down by law, and he must give her\ntwo suits, or changes, of clothes a year.But he must also visit her\nonce a week, and the day fixed is Friday.If the wife wishes to be\nseparated, and to return to her parents, she must first pay the money\nwhich he may demand, and must also have his permission, although he\nhimself may send her to her parents whenever he chooses, without\nassigning any reason.He retains the children, and he may marry again.The woman is generally expected to bring her husband a considerable sum\nin the way of dowry, but, on separation, she gets nothing back.This was\nthe Boab\'s account, but I think he has overdone the harshness and\ninjustice of the Mohammedan law of marriage in relating it to our\ntourists.It may be observed that the strict law is rarely acted upon,\nand many respectable Moors have told me that they have but one wife, and\nfind that quite enough.It is true that many Moors, especially learned\nmen, divorce their wives when they get old, feeling the women an\nembarrassment to them, and no wonder, when we consider these poor\ncreatures have no education, and, in their old age, neither afford\nconnubial pleasure nor society to their husbands.With respect to\ndivorce, a woman can demand by law and right to be separated from her\nhusband, or divorced, whenever he ill-treats her, or estranges himself\nfrom her.Eunuchs, who have the charge of the women, are allowed to\nmarry, although they cannot have any family.The chief eunuch of the\nBardo has the most revolting countenance.Our tourists brought home a variety of curious Jereed things: small\ndate-baskets full of dates, woollen articles, skins of all sorts, and a\nfew live animals.Sidi Mohammed also made them many handsome presents.Some deer, Jereed goats, an ostrich, &c., were sent to Mr.R. after his\nreturn, and both Captain B. and Mr.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.R. have had every reason to be\nextremely gratified with the hospitality and kind attentions of the "Bey\nof the Camp."It is very difficult to ascertain the amount of tribute collected in the\nJereed, some of which, however, was not got in, owing to various\nimpediments.Our tourists say generally:--\n\n  Camel-loads.[40]\n  Money, dollars, and piastres, (chiefly I\n  imagine, the latter.)23\n\n  Burnouses, blankets, and quilts, &c.6\n\n  Dates (these were collected at Toser,\n    and brought from Nefta and the surrounding\n    districts)                                     500\n                                                  ----\n                 Total                             529\n\n  It is impossible, with this statement\n    before us, to make out any exact\n    calculation of the amount of tribute.A cantar of dates varies from fifteen\n    to twenty-five shillings, say on an\n    average a pound sterling; this will\n    make the amount of the 500 camel-loads\n    at five cantars per load                    L2,500\n\n  Six camel-loads of woollen manufactures,\n    &c., at sixty pound per load, value            360\n                                                ------\n                   Total                        L2,860\n\nThe money, chiefly piastres, must be left to conjecture.Levy, a large merchant at Tunis, thinks the amount might be from 150 to\n200,000 piastres, or, taking the largest sum, L6,250 sterling:\n\n  Total amount of the tribute of the Jereed:\n  in goods                                      L2,860\n  Ditto, in money:                               6,250\n                                                ------\n                   Total                        L9,110\n\nTo this sum may be added the smaller presents of horses, camels, and\nother beasts of burden.*       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore leaving Mogador, in company with Mr.Willshire, I saw his\nExcellency, the Governor again, when I took formal leave of him.He\naccompanied me down to the port with several of the authorities, waiting\nuntil I embarked for the Renshaw schooner.Several of the Consuls, and\nnearly all the Europeans, were also present.On the whole, I was\nsatisfied with the civilities of the Moorish authorities, and offer my\ncordial thanks to the Europeans of Mogador for their attentions during\nmy residence in that city.A little circumstance shews the subjection of our merchants, the Consul\nnot excepted, to the Moorish Government.One of the merchants wished to\naccompany me on board, but was not permitted, on account of his\nengagements with the Sultan.A merchant cannot even go off the harbour to superintend the stowing of\nhis goods.Never were prisoners of war, or political offenders, so\nclosely watched as the boasted imperial merchants of this city.After setting sail, we were soon out of sight of Mogador; and, on the\nfollowing day, land disappeared altogether.During the next month, we\nwere at sea, and out of view of the shore.I find an entry in my\njournal, when off the Isle of Wight.We had had most tremendous weather,\nsuccessive gales of foul wind, from north and north-east.Our schooner\nwas a beautiful vessel, a fine sailer with a flat bottom, drawing little\nwater, made purposely for Barbary ports.She had her bows completely\nunder water, and pitched her way for twenty-five succeeding days,\nthrough huge rising waves of sea and foam.During the whole of this\ntime, I never got up, and lived on bread and water with a little\nbiscuit.Captain Taylor, who was a capital seaman, and took the most\naccurate observations, lost all patience, and, though a good methodist,\nwould now and then rush on deck, and swear at the perverse gale and\nwrathful sea.We took on board a fine barb for Mr.Elton, which died\nafter a few days at sea, in these tempests.I had a young vulture that\ndied a day before the horse, or we should have fed him on the carcase.[Illustration]\n\nAn aoudad which we conveyed on account of Mr.Willshire to London, for\nthe Zoological Society, outlived these violent gales, and was safely and\ncomfortably lodged in the Regent\'s Park.After my return from Africa, I\npaid my brave and hardy fellow-passenger a visit, and find the air of\nsmoky London agrees with him as well as the cloudless region of the\nMorocco Desert.The following account of the bombardment of Mogador by the French,\nwritten at the period by an English Resident may be of interest at the\npresent time.Mogador was bombarded on the 13th of August, 1844.Hostilities began at\n9 o\'clock A.M., by the Moors firing twenty-one guns before the French\nhad taken up their position, but the fire was not returned until 2 P.M.The \'Gemappes,\' 100; \'Suffren,\' 99; \'Triton,\' 80; ships of the line.\'Belle Poule,\' 60, frigate; \'Asmodee\' and \'Pluton,\' steamers, and some\nbrigs, constituted the bombarding squadron.The batteries were silenced,\nand the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving\nthe city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the\nnext morning, sacked and fired the city.On the 16th, nine hundred\nFrench were landed on the isle of Mogador.After a rude encounter with\nthe garrison, they took possession of it and its forts.Their loss was,\nafter twenty-eight hours\' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and\nas many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle\nkilled, besides the casualties in the city.The British Consul and his wife, and Mr.Robertson, with\nothers, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on\naccount of their liabilities to the Emperor.The escape of these people\nfrom destruction was most miraculous.The bombarding squadron reached on the 10th, the English frigate,\n\'Warspite,\' on the 13th, and the wind blowing strong from N.E., and\npreventing the commencement of hostilities, afforded opportunity to\nsave, if possible, the British Consul\'s family and other detained\nEuropeans; but, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of the\ncaptain of the \'Warspite\', nothing whatever could prevail upon the\nMoorish Deputy-Governor in command, Sidi Abdallah Deleero, to allow the\nBritish and other Europeans to take their departure.The Governor even\nperemptorily refused permission for the wife of the Consul to leave,\nupon the cruel sophism that, "The Christian religion asserts the husband\nand wife to be one, consequently," added the Governor, "as it is my\nduty, which I owe to my Emperor, to prevent the Consul from leaving\nMogador, I must also keep his wife."The fact is the Moors, in their stupidity, and perhaps in their revenge,\nthought the retaining of the British Consul and the Europeans might, in\nsome way or other, contribute to the defence of themselves, save the\ncity, or mitigate the havoc of the bombardment.At any rate, they would\nsay, "Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves."During the bombardment, the Moors for two hours fought well, but their\nbest gunner, a Spanish renegade, Omar Ei-Haj, being killed, they became\ndispirited and abandoned the batteries.The Governor and his troops,\nabout sunset, disgracefully and precipitately fled, followed by nearly\nall the Moorish population, thereby abandoning Mogador to pillage, and\nthe European Jews to the merciless wild tribes, who, though levied to\ndefend the town, had, for some hours past, hovered round it like droves\nof famished wolves.As the Governor fled out, terrified as much at the wild tribes as of the\nFrench, in rushed these hordes, led on by their desperate chiefs.These\nwretches undismayed, unmoved by the terrors of the bombarding ravages\naround, strove and vied with each other in the committal of every act of\nthe most unlicensed ferocity and depredation, breaking open houses,\nassaulting the inmates, murdering such as shewed resistance, denuding\nthe more submissive of their clothing, abusing women--particularly in\nthe Jewish quarter--to all which atrocities the Europeans were likewise\nexposed.At the most imminent hazard of their lives, the British Consul and his\nwife, with a few others, escaped from these ruffians.Truly providential\nwas their flight through streets, resounding with the most turbulent\nconfusion and sanguinary violence.It was late when the plunderers\nappeared before the Consulates, where, without any ceremony, by\nhundreds, they fell to work, breaking open bales of goods, ransacking\nplaces for money and other treasures; and, thus unsatisfied in their\nrapacity, they tore and burnt all the account-books and Consular\ndocuments.Other gangs fought over the spoil; some carrying off their booty, and\nothers setting it on fire.It was a real pandemonium of discord and\nlicentiousness.During the darkness, and in the midst of such scenes, it\nwas that the Consul and his wife threaded their precarious flight\nthrough the streets, and in their way were intercepted by a marauding\nband, who attacked them; tore off his coat; and, seizing his wife,\ninsisted upon denuding her, four or five daggers being raised to her\nthroat, expecting to find money concealed about their persons; nor would\nthe ruffians desist until they ascertained they had none, the Consul\nhaving prudently resolved to take no money with them.Fortunately, at\nthis juncture, his wife was able to speak, and in Arabic (being born\nhere, and daughter of a former Consul), therefore she could give force\nto her entreaties by appealing to them not to imbue their hands in the\nblood of their countrywomen.The chief of\nthe party undertook to conduct them to the water-port, when, coming in\ncontact with another party, a conflict about booty ensued, during which\nthe Consul\'s family got out of the town to a place of comparative\nsecurity.Incidents of a similar alarming nature attended the escape of Mr.Robertson, his wife, and four children; one, a baby in arms.Robertson, with a child in each hand, lost sight of Mrs.Robertson, with her infant and another child.Distracted by sad\nforebodings, poor Mr.Robertson forced his way to the water-port, but\nnot before a savage mountainer--riding furiously by him--aimed a\nsabre-blow at him to cut him down; but, as the murderous arm was poised\nabove, Mr.Robertson stooped, and, raising his arm at the time, warded\nit off; the miscreant then rode off, being satisfied at this cut at the\ndetested Nazarene.Another ruffian seized one of his little girls, a pretty child of nine\nyears old, and scratched her arm several times with his dagger, calling\nout _flous_ (money) at each stroke.Robertson\njoined his fainting wife, and the British Consul and his wife, with Mr.An old Moor never deserted the Consul\'s family,\n"faithful among the faithless;" and a Jewess, much attached to the\nfamily, abandoned them only to return to those allied to her by the ties\nof blood.Their situation was now still perilous, for, should they be discovered\nby the wild Berbers, they all might be murdered.This night, the 15th,\nwas a most anxious one, and their apprehensions were dreadful.Dawn of\nday was fast approaching, and every hour\'s delay rendered their\ncondition more precarious.Lucas, who never once\nfailed or lost his accustomed suavity and presence of mind amidst these\nimminent dangers, resolved upon communicating with the fleet by a most\nhazardous experiment.On his way from the town-gate to the water-port,\nhe noticed some deal planks near the beach.The idea struck him of\nturning these into a raft, which, supporting him, could enable their\nparty to communicate with the squadron.Lucas fetched the planks,\nand resolutely set to work.Taking three of them, and luckily finding a\nquantity of strong grass cordage, he arranged them in the water, and\nwith some cross-pieces, bound the whole together; and, besides, having\nfound two small pieces of board to serve him as paddles, he gallantly\nlaunched forth alone, and, in about an hour, effected his object, for he\nexcited the attention of the French brig, \'Canard,\' from which a boat\ncame and took him on board.The officers, being assured there were no Moors on guard at the\nbatteries, and that the Berbers were wholly occupied in plundering the\ncity, promptly and generously sent off a boat with Mr.Lucas to the\nrescue of the alarmed and trembling fugitives.The Prince de Joinville\nafterwards ordered them to be conveyed on board the \'Warspite.\'The\nself-devotedness, sagacity, and indefatigable exertions of the excellent\nyoung man, Mr.Lucas, were above all encomiums, and, at the hands of the\nBritish Government, he deserved some especial mark of favour.Levy (an English Jewess, married to a Maroquine Jew), and her\nfamily were left behind, and accompanied the rest of the miserable Jews\nand natives, to be maltreated, stripped naked, and, perhaps, murdered,\nlike many poor Jews.Amrem Elmelek, the greatest native merchant and\na Jew, died from fright.Carlos Bolelli, a Roman, perished during the\nsack of the city.Mogador was left a heap of ruins, scarcely one house standing entire,\nand all tenantless.In the fine elegiac bulletin of the bombarding\nPrince, "Alas!thy walls are riddled with bullets,\nand thy mosques of prayer blackened with fire!"Tangier trades almost exclusively with Gibraltar, between which place\nand this, an active intercourse is constantly kept up.The principal articles of importation into Tangier are, cotton goods of\nall kinds, cloth, silk-stuffs, velvets, copper, iron, steel, and\nhardware of every description; cochineal, indigo, and other dyes; tea,\ncoffee, sulphur, paper, planks, looking-glasses, tin, thread,\nglass-beads, alum, playing-cards, incense, sarsaparilla, and rum.The exports consist in hides, wax, wool, leeches, dates, almonds,\noranges, and other fruit, bark, flax, durra, chick-peas, bird-seed, oxen\nand sheep, henna, and other dyes, woollen sashes, haicks, Moorish\nslippers, poultry, eggs, flour, &c.\n\nThe value of British and foreign goods imported into Tangier in 1856\nwas: British goods, L101,773 6_s_., foreign goods, L33,793.The goods exported from Tangier during the same year was: For British\nports, L63,580 10_s_., for foreign ports, L13,683.The following is a statement of the number of British and foreign ships\nthat entered and cleared from this port during the same year.Entered:\nBritish ships 203, the united tonnage of which was 10,883; foreign ships\n110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Cleared: British ships 207, the united tonnage of which was 10,934;\nforeign ships 110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Three thousand head of cattle are annually exported, at a fixed duty of\nfive dollars per head, to Gibraltar, for the use of that garrison, in\nconformity with the terms of special grants that have, from time to\ntime, been made by the present Sultan and some of his predecessors.In\naddition to the above, about 2,000 head are, likewise, exported\nannually, for the same destination, at a higher rate of duty, varying\nfrom eight dollars to ten dollars per head.Gibraltar, also, draws from\nthis place large supplies of poultry, eggs, flour, and other kinds of\nprovisions.From the port of Mogador are exported the richest articles the country\nproduces, viz., almonds, sweet and bitter gums, wool, olive-oil, seeds\nof various kinds, as cummin, gingelen, aniseed; sheep-skins, calf, and\ngoat-skins, ostrich-feathers, and occasionally maize.The amount of exports in 1855 was: For British ports, L228,112 3_s_.2_d_., for foreign ports, L55,965 13_s_.The imports are Manchester cotton goods, which have entirely superseded\nthe East India long cloths, formerly in universal use, blue salampores,\nprints, sugar, tea, coffee, Buenos Ayres slides, iron, steel, spices,\ndrugs, nails, beads and deals, woollen cloth, cotton wool, and mirrors\nof small value, partly for consumption in the town, but chiefly for that\nof the interior, from Morocco and its environs, as far as Timbuctoo.The amount of imports in 1855 was: British goods, L136,496 7_s_.6_d_.,\nforeign goods L31,222 11_s_.The trade last year was greatly increased by the unusually large demand\nfor olive-oil from all parts, and there is no doubt that, under a more\nliberal Government, the commerce might be developed to a vast extent.The principal goods imported at Rabat are, alum, calico of different\nqualities, cinnamon, fine cloth, army cloth, cloves, copperas, cotton\nprints, raw cotton, sewing cotton, cutlery, dimity, domestics,\nearthenware, ginger, glass, handkerchiefs (silk and cotton), hardware,\nindigo, iron, linen, madder root, muslin, sugar (refined and raw), tea,\nand tin plate.The before-mentioned articles are imported partly for consumption in\nRabat and Sallee, and partly for transmission into the interior.The value of different articles of produce exported at Rabat during the\nlast five years amounts to L34,860 1_s_.There can be no doubt that the imports and exports at Rabat would\ngreatly increase, if the present high duties were reduced, and\nGovernment monopolies abolished.Large quantities of hides were exported\nbefore they were a Government monopoly: now the quantity exported is\nvery inconsiderable._Goods Imported_.--Brown Domestics, called American White, muslins, raw\ncotton, cotton-bales, silk and cotton pocket-handkerchiefs; tea, coffee,\nsugars, iron, copperas, alum; many other articles imported, but in very\nsmall quantities.A small portion of the importations is consumed at Mazagan and Azimore,\nbut the major portions in the interior.The amount of the leading goods exported in 1855 was:--Bales of wool,\n6,410; almonds, 200 serons; grain, 642,930 fanegas.No doubt the commerce of this port would be increased under better\nfiscal laws than those now established.But the primary and immediate thing to be looked after is the wilful\ncasting into the anchorage-ground of stone-ballast by foreigners.British masters are under control, but foreigners will persist, chiefly\nSardinian masters.THE END\n\n\n\n\n[1] The predecessor of Muley Abd Errahman.[2] On account, of their once possessing the throne, the Shereefs have a\npeculiar jealousy of Marabouts, and which latter have not forgotten\ntheir once being sovereigns of Morocco.The _Moravedi_ were "really a\ndynasty of priests," as the celebrated Magi, who usurped the throne of\nCyrus.The Shereefs, though descended from the Prophet, are not strictly\npriests, or, to make the distinction perfectly clear the Shereefs are to\nbe considered a dynasty corresponding to the type of Melchizdek, uniting\nin themselves the regal and sacerdotal authority, whilst the\n_Marabouteen_ were a family of priests like the sons of Aaron.Abd-el-Kader unites in himself the princely and sacerdotal authority\nlike the Shereefs, though not of the family of the Prophet.Mankind have\nalways been jealous of mere theocratic government, and dynasties of\npriests have always been failures in the arts of governing, and the\nEgyptian priests, though they struggled hard, and were the most\naccomplished of this class of men, could not make themselves the\nsovereigns of Egypt.[3] According to others the Sadia reigned before the Shereefs.[4] I was greatly astonished to read in Mr.Hay\'s "Western Barbary," (p.123), these words--"During one of the late rebellions, a beautiful young\ngirl was offered up as a propitiatory sacrifice, her throat being cut\nbefore the tent of the Sultan, and in his presence!"This is an\nunmitigated libel on the Shereefian prince ruling Morocco.First of all,\nthe sacrifice of human beings is repudiated by every class of\ninhabitants in Barbary.Such rites, indeed, are unheard of, nay,\nunthought of.If the Mahometan religion has been powerful in any one\nthing, it is in that of rooting out from the mind of man every notion of\nhuman sacrifice.It is this which makes the sacrifice of the Saviour\nsuch an obnoxious doctrine to Mussulmen.It is true enough, at times,\noxen are immolated to God, but not to Moorish princes, "to appease an\noffended potentate."One spring, when there was a great drought, the\npeople led up to the hill of Ghamart, near Carthage, a red heifer to be\nslaughtered, in order to appease the displeasure of Deity; and when the\nBey\'s frigate, which, a short time ago, carried a present to her\nBritannic Majesty, from Tunis to Malta, put back by stress of weather,\ntwo sheep were sacrificed to some tutelar saints, and two guns were\nfired in their honour.The companions of Abd-el-Kader in a storm, during\nhis passage from Oran to Toulon, threw handsful of salt to the raging\ndeep to appease its wild fury.But as to sacrificing human victims,\neither to an incensed Deity, or to man, impiously putting himself in the\nplace of God, the Moors of Barbary have not the least conception of such\nan enormity.It would seem, unfortunately, that the practice of the gentleman, who\ntravelled a few miles into the interior of Morocco on a horse-mission,\nhad been to exaggerate everything, and, where effect was wanting, not to\nhave scrupled to have recourse to unadulterated invention.But this\nstyle of writing cannot be defended on any principle, when so serious a\ncase is brought forward as that of sacrificing a human victim to appease\nthe wrath of an incensed sovereign, and that prince now living in\namicable relations with ourselves.[5] Graeberg de Hemso, whilst consul-general for Sweden and Sardinia (at\nMorocco!)concludes the genealogy of these Mussulman sovereigns with\nthis strange, but Catholic-spirited rhapsody:--\n\n"Muley Abd-ur-Bakliman, who is now gloriously and happily reigning, whom\nwe pray Almighty God, all Goodness and Power, to protect and exalt by\nprolonging his life, glory, and reign in this world and in the next; and\ngiving him, during eternity, the heavenly beatitude, in order that his\nsoul, in the same manner as flame to flame, river to sea, may be united\nwith his sweetest, most perfect and ineffable Creator.[6] Yezeed was half-Irish, born of the renegade widow of an Irish\nsergeant of the corps of Sappers and Miners, who was placed at the\ndisposition of this government by England, and who died in Morocco.On\nhis death, the facile, buxom widow was admitted, "nothing loath," into\nthe harem of Sidi-Mohammed, who boasted of having within its sacred\nenclosure of love and bliss, a woman from every clime.Here the daughter of Erin brought forth this ferocious tyrant, whose\nmaxim of carnage, and of inflicting suffering on humanity was, "My\nempire can never be well governed, unless a stream of blood flows from\nthe gate of the palace to the gate of the city."To do Yezeed justice,\nhe followed out the instincts of his birth, and made war on all the\nworld except the English (or Irish).Tully\'s Letters on Tripoli give a\ngraphic account of the exploits of Yezeed, who, to his inherent cruelty,\nadded a fondness for practical (Hibernian) jokes.His father sent him several times on a pilgrimage to Mecca to expiate\nhis crimes, when he amused, or alarmed, all the people whose countries\nhe passed through, by his terrific vagaries.One day he would cut off\nthe heads of a couple of his domestics, and play at bowls with them;\nanother day, he would ride across the path of an European, or a consul,\nand singe his whiskers with the discharge of a pistol-shot; another day,\nhe would collect all the poor of a district, and gorge them with a\nrazzia he had made on the effects of some rich over-fed Bashaw.The\nmultitude sometimes implored heaven\'s blessing on the head of Yezeed.at\nother times trembled for their own heads.Meanwhile, our European\nconsuls made profound obeisance to this son of the Shereef, enthroned in\nthe West.So the tyrant passed the innocent days of his pilgrimage.So\nthe godless herd of mankind acquiesced in the divine rights of royalty.[7] See Appendix at the end of this volume.[8] The middle Western Region consists of Algiers and part of Tunis.[9] Pliny, the Elder, confirms this tradition mentioned by Pliny.Marcus\nYarron reports, "that in all Spain there are spread Iberians, Persians,\nPhoenicians, Celts, and Carthaginians."[10] In Latin, Mauri, Maurice, Maurici, Maurusci, and it is supposed, so\ncalled by the Greeks from their dark complexions.[11] The more probable derivation of this word is from _bar_, signifying\nland, or earth, in contradistinction from the sea, or desert, beyond the\ncultivable lands to the South.To give the term more force it is\ndoubled, after the style of the Semitic reduplication.De Haedo de la\nCaptividad gives a characteristic derivation, like a genuine hidalgo,\nwho proclaimed eternal war against Los Moros.He says--"Moors, Alartes,\nCabayles, and some Turks, form all of them a dirty, lazy, inhuman,\nindomitable nation of beasts, and it is for this reason that, for the\nlast few years, I have accustomed myself to call that land the land of\nBarbary."[12] Procopius, de Bello Vandilico, lib.[13] Some derive it from _Sarak_, an Arabic word which signifies to\nsteal, and hence, call the conquerors thieves.Others, and with more\nprobability, derive it from _Sharak_, the east, and make them Orientals,\nand others say there is an Arabic word _Saracini_, which means a\npastoral people, and assert that Saracine is a corruption from it, the\nnew Arabian immigrants being supposed to have been pastoral tribes.[14] Some suppose that _Amayeegh_ means "great," and the tribes thus\ndistinguished themselves, as our neighbours are wont to do by the phrase\n"la grande nation."The Shoulah are vulgarly considered to be descended\nfrom the Philistines, and to have fled before Joshua on the conquest of\nPalestine.In his translation of the Description of Spain, by the Shereef El-Edris\n(Madrid, 1799), Don Josef Antonio Conde speaks of the Berbers in a\nnote--\n\n"Masmuda, one of the five principal tribes of Barbaria; the others are\nZeneta, called Zenetes in our novels and histories, Sanhagha which we\nname Zenagas; Gomesa is spelt in our histories Gomares and Gomeles.Huroara, some of these were originally from Arabia; there were others,\nbut not so distinguished.La de Ketama was, according to tradition,\nAfrican, one of the most ancient, for having come with Afrikio."Ben Kis Ben Taifi Ben Teba, the younger, who came from the king of the\nAssyrians, to the land of the west."None of these primitive tribes appear to have been known to the Romans,\ntheir historians, however, have transmitted to us many names of other\naboriginal tribes, some of which resemble fractions now existing, as the\nGetules are probably the present Geudala or Geuzoula.But the present\nBerbers do not correspond with the names of the five original people\njust mentioned.In Morocco, there are Amayeegh and Shelouh, in Algeria\nthe Kabyles, in Tunis the Aoures, sometimes the Shouwiah, and in Sahara\nthe Touarichs.There are, besides, numerous subdivisions and admixtures\nof these tribes."[15] Monsieur Balbi is decidedly the most recent, as well as the best\nauthority to apply to for a short and definite description of this most\ncelebrated mountain system, called by him "Systeme Atlantique," and I\nshall therefore annex what he says on this interesting subject,\n"Orographie."He says--"Of the \'Systeme Atlantique,\' which derives its\nname from the Mount Atlas, renowned for so many centuries, and still so\nlittle known; we include in this vast system, all the heights of the\nregion of Maghreb--we mean the mountain of the Barbary States--as well\nas the elevations scattered in the immense Sahara or Desert.It appears\nthat the most important ridge extends from the neighbourhood of Cape\nNoun, or the Atlantic, as far as the east of the Great Syrte in the\nState of Tripoli.In this vast space it crosses the new State of\nSidi-Hesdham, the Empire of Morocco, the former State of Algiers, as\nwell as the State of Tripoli and the Regency of Tunis.It is in the\nEmpire of Morocco, and especially in the east of the town of Morocco,\nand in the south-east of Fez, that that ridge presents the greatest\nheights of the whole system.It goes on diminishing afterwards in height\nas it extends towards the east, so that it appears the summits of the\nterritory of Algiers are higher than those on the territory of Tunis,\nand the latter are less high than those to be found in the State of\nTripoli.Several secondary ridges diverge in different directions from\nthe principal chain; we shall name among them the one which ends at the\nStrait of Gibraltar in the Empire of Morocco.Several intermediary\nmountains seem to connect with one another the secondary chains which\nintersect the territories of Algiers and Tunis.Geographers call Little\nAtlas the secondary mountains of the land of Sous, in opposition to the\nname of Great Atlas, they give to the high mountains of the Empire of\nMorocco.In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in\nthe south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the\nnames of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount\nTiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the\nDesert of Lybia and Sahara Proper.From observations made on the spot by\nMr.Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which\nseveral geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of\nGreat Atlas does not exist.The inhabitants of Mediah who were\nquestioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that\nthe way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less\nelevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of\nmountains to cross.The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to\nMediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of\nthe Regency.[16] Xenophon, in his Anabasis, speaks of ostriches in Mesopotamia being\nrun down by fleet horses.[17] Mount Atlas was called Dyris by the ancient aborigines, or Derem,\nits name amongst the modern aborigines.This word has been compared to\nthe Hebrew, signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, as if\nMount Atlas was the back of the world, or the cultivated parts of the\nglobe, and over which the sun was seen at full noon, in all his fierce\nand glorious splendour.Bochart connects the term with the Hebrew\nmeaning \'great\' or\'mighty,\' which epithet would be naturally applied to\nthe Atlas, and all mountains, by either a savage or civilized people.We\nhave, also, on the northern coast, Russadirum, the name given by the\nMoors to Cape Bon, which is evidently a compound of _Ras_, head, and\n_dirum_, mountain, or the head of the mountain.We have again the root of this word in Doa-el-Hamman, Tibet Deera, &c.,\nthe names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas.Any way, the modern\nDer-en is seen to be the same with the ancient Dir-is.[18] The only way of obtaining any information at all, is through the\nregisters of taxation; and, to the despotism and exactions of these and\nmost governments, we owe a knowledge of the proximate amount of the\nnumbers of mankind.[19] Tangier, Mogador, Wadnoun, and Sous have already been described,\nwholly, or in part.[20] In 936, Arzila was sacked by the English, and remained for twenty\nyears uninhabited.Hay, a portion of the Salee Rovers seem to have\nfinally taken refuge here.Up the river El-Kous, the Imperial squadron\nlay in ordinary, consisting of a corvette, two brigs, (once\nmerchant-vessels, and which had been bought of Christians), and a\nschooner, with some few gun-boats, and even these two or three vessels\nwere said to be all unfit for sea.But, when Great Britain captured the\nrock of Gibraltar, we, supplanting the Moors became the formidable\ntoll-keepers of the Herculean Straits, and the Salee rivers have ever\nsince been in our power.If the Shereefs have levied war or tribute on\nEuropean navies since that periods it has been under our tacit sanction.The opinion of Nelson is not the less true, that, should England engage\nin war with any maritime State of Europe, Morocco must be our warm and\nactive friend or enemy, and, if our enemy, we must again possess\nourselves of our old garrison of Tangier.[22] So called, it is supposed, from the quantity of aniseed grown in\nthe neighbourhood.[23] Near Cape Blanco is the ruined town of Tit or Tet, supposed to be\nof Carthaginian origin, and once also possessed by the Portuguese, when\ncommerce therein flourished.[24] El-Kesar is a very common name of a fortified town, and is usually\nwritten by the Spaniards Alcazar, being the name of the celebrated royal\npalace at Seville.[25] Marmol makes this city to have succeeded the ancient Roman town of\nSilda or Gilda.Mequinez has been called Ez-Zetounah, from the immense\nquantities of olives in its immediate vicinity.[26] Don J. A. Conde says--"Fes or sea Fez, the capital of the realm of\nthat name; the fables of its origin, and the grandeur of the Moors, who\nalways speak of their cities as foundations of heroes, or lords of the\nwhole world, &c., a foible of which our historians are guilty.Nasir-Eddin and the same Ullug Beig say, for certain, that Fez is the\ncourt of the king in the west.I must observe here, that nothing is less\nauthentic than the opinions given by Casiri in his Library of the\nEscurial, that by the word Algarb, they always mean the west of Spain,\nand by the word Almagreb, the west of Africa; one of these appellations\nis generally used for the other.The same Casiri says, with regard to\nFez, that it was founded by Edno Ben Abdallah, under the reign of\nAlmansor Abu Giafar; he is quite satisfied with that assertion, but does\nnot perceive that it contains a glaring anachronism.Fez was already a\nvery ancient city before the Mohammed Anuabi of the Mussulmen, and\nJoseph, in his A. J., mentions a city of Mauritania; the prophet Nahum\nspeaks of it also, when he addresses Ninive, he presents it as an\nexample for No Ammon.He enumerates its districts and cities, and says,\nFut and Lubim, Fez and Lybia, &c.[27] I imagine we shall never know the truth of this until the French\nmarch an army into Fez, and sack the library.[28] It is true enough what the governor says about _quietness_, but the\nnovelty of the mission turned the heads of the people, and made a great\nnoise among them.The slave-dealers of Sous vowed vengeance against me,\nand threatened to "rip open my bowels" if I went down there.[29] The Sultan\'s Minister, Ben Oris, addressing our government on the\nquestion says, "Whosoever sets any person free God will set his soul\nfree from the fire," (hell), quoting the Koran.[30] A person going to the Emperor without a present, is like a menace\nat court, for a present corresponds to our "good morning."[31] _Bash_, means chief, as Bash-Mameluke, chief of the Mamelukes.[32] This office answers vulgarly to our _Boots_ at English inns.[33] Bismilla, Arabic for "In the name of God!"the Mohammedan grace\nbefore meat, and also drink.[34] Shaw says.--"The hobara is of the bigness of a capon, it feeds upon\nthe little grubs or insects, and frequents the confines of the Desert.The body is of a light dun or yellowish colour, and marked over with\nlittle brown touches, whilst the larger feathers of the wing are black,\nwith each of them a white spot near the middle; those of the neck are\nwhitish with black streaks, and are long and erected when the bird is\nattacked.The bill is flat like the starling\'s, nearly an inch and a\nhalf long, and the legs agree in shape and in the want of the hinder toe\nwith the bustard\'s, but it is not, as Golins says, the bustard, that\nbird being twice as big as the hobara.Nothing can be more entertaining\nthan to see this bird pursued by the hawk, and what a variety of flights\nand stratagems it makes use of to escape."The French call the hobara, a\nlittle bustard, _poule de Carthage_, or Carthage-fowl.They are\nfrequently sold in the market of Tunis, as ordinary fowls, but eat\nsomething like pheasant, and their flesh is red.[35] The most grandly beautiful view in Tunis is that from the\nBelvidere, about a mile north-west from the capital, looking immediately\nover the Marsa road.Here, on a hill of very moderate elevation, you\nhave the most beautiful as well as the most magnificent panoramic view\nof sea and lake, mountain and plain, town and village, in the whole\nRegency, or perhaps in any other part of North Africa.There are besides\nmany lovely walks around the capital, particularly among and around the\ncraggy heights of the south-east.But these are little frequented by the\nEuropean residents, the women especially, who are so stay-at-homeative\nthat the greater part of them never walked round the suburbs once in\ntheir lives.Europeans generally prefer the Marina, lined on each side,\nnot with pleasant trees, but dead animals, sending forth a most\noffensive smell.[36] Shaw says: "The rhaad, or safsaf, is a granivorous and gregarious\nbird, which wanteth the hinder toe.There are two species, and both\nabout and a little larger than the ordinary pullet.The belly of both is\nwhite, back and wings of a buff colour spotted with brown, tail lighter\nand marked all along with black transverse streaks, beak and legs\nstronger than the partridge.The name rhaad, "thunder," is given to it\nfrom the noise it makes on the ground when it rises, safsaf, from its\nbeating the air, a sound imitating the motion."[37] Ghafsa, whose name Bochart derives from the Hebrew "comprimere,"\nis an ancient city, claiming as its august founder, the Libyan\nHercules.It was one of the principal towns in the dominions of\nJugurtha, and well-fortified, rendered secure by being placed in the\nmidst of immense deserts, fabled to have been inhabited solely by\nsnakes and serpents.Marius took it by a _coup-de-main_, and put all\nthe inhabitants to the sword.The modern city is built on a gentle\neminence, between two arid mountains, and, in a great part, with the\nmaterials of the ancient one.Ghafsa has no wall of _euceinte_, or\nrather a ruined wall surrounds it, and is defended by a kasbah,\ncontaining a small garrison.This place may be called the gate of the\nTunisian Sahara; it is the limit of Blad-el-Jereed; the sands begin now\nto disappear, and the land becomes better, and more suited to the\ncultivation of corn.Three villages are situated in the environs, Sala,\nEl-Kesir, and El-Ghetar.A fraction of the tribe of Hammand deposit\ntheir grain in Ghafsa.This town is famous for its manufactories of\nbaraeans and blankets ornamented with pretty  flowers.There is\nalso a nitre and powder-manufactory, the former obtained from the earth\nby a very rude process.The environs are beautifully laid out in plantations of the fig, the\npomegranate, and the orange, and especially the datepalm, and the\nolive-tree.Daniel moved to the hallway.The oil made here is of peculiarly good quality, and is\nexported to Tugurt, and other oases of the Desert.[38] Kaemtz\'s Meteorology, p.[39] This is the national dish of Barbary, and is a preparation of\nwheat-flour granulated, boiled by the steam of meat.It is most\nnutritive, and is

turned back toward the hill,\n"Hernandez is now with the angels.You gave him the sacrament, did you\nnot?""_Bien_, then you remitted his sins, and he is doubtless in paradise.But," he mused, "it may be that he had first to pass through\npurgatory._Caramba!_ I like not the thought of those hot fires!"Daniel went to the bathroom."Your mental wanderings at\ntimes are puerile!Do not be\ndeceived, Hernandez is still the same man, even though he has left his\nearthly body behind.Do not think he has been lifted at once into\neternal bliss.The Church has taught such rubbish for ages, and has\nbased its pernicious teachings upon the grossly misunderstood words of\nJesus.The Church is a failure--a dead, dead failure, in every sense\nof the word!And that man lying there in his grave is a ghastly proof\nof it!"Rosendo looked wonderingly at the excited priest, whose bitter words\nrang out so harshly on the still night air."The Church has failed utterly to preserve the simple gospel of the\nChrist!It has basely, wantonly betrayed its traditional trust!It has\nfought and slain and burned for centuries over trivial, vulnerable\nnon-essentials, and thrown its greatest pearls to the swine!It no\nlonger prophesies; it carps and reviles!It no longer heals the sick;\nbut it conducts a purgatorial lottery at so much a head!It has become\na jumble of idle words, a mumbling of silly formulae, a category of\nstupid, insensate ceremonies!Its children are taught to derive their\nfaith from such legends as that of the holy Saint Francis, who, to\nconvince a heretic, showed the _hostia_ to an ass, which on beholding\nthe sacred dough immediately kneeled!"_Ca-ram-ba!_ But you speak hard words, Padre!"muttered Rosendo,\nvague speculations flitting through his brain as to the priest\'s\nmental state.continued Jose heatedly, "the Church has fought truth\ndesperately ever since the Master\'s day!It has fawned at the feet of\nemperor and plutocrat, and licked the bloody hand of the usurer who\ntossed her a pittance of his foul gains!In the great world-battles\nfor reform, for the rights of man, for freedom from the slavery of man\nto man or to drink and drugs, she has come up only as the smoke has\ncleared away, but always in time to demand the spoils!She has filched\nfrom the systems of philosophy of every land and age, and after\nbedaubing them with her own gaudy colors, has foisted them upon\nunthinking mankind as divine decrees and mandates!She has foully\ninsulted God and man!--"\n\n"_Caramba_, Padre!_Hombre_, we must get back to the\nhill!You voice the Church\'s stock complaint of every\nman who exposes her shams: \'He hath a devil!\'"Jose went on more excitedly:\n\n"You ask if Hernandez is in paradise or purgatory.He is in a state no\nbetter nor worse than our own, for both are wholly mental.We are now\nin the fires of as great a purgatory as any man can ever experience!Yes, there is a purgatory--right here on earth--and it follows us\nafter death, and after every death that we shall die, until we learn\nto know God and see Him as infinite good, without taint or trace of\nevil!The flames of hell are eternal to us as long as we eat of \'the\ntree of the knowledge of good and evil\'--as long as we believe in\nother powers than God--as long as we believe sin and disease and evil\nto be as real and as potent as good!When we know these things as\nawful human illusions, and when we recognize God as the infinite mind\nthat did not create evil, and does not know or behold it, then, and\nthen only, will the flames of purgatory and hell in this state of\nconsciousness which we mistakenly call life, and in the states of\nconsciousness still to come, begin to diminish in intensity, and\nfinally die out!"Then he turned to Rosendo\nand put his hand affectionately upon the old man\'s shoulder."My good\nfriend," he said more calmly, "I speak with intense feeling, for I\nhave suffered much through the intolerance, the unspirituality, and\nthe worldly ambition of the agents of Holy Church.I suffer, because I\nsee what she is, and how widely she has missed the mark.But, worse, I\nsee how blindly, how cruelly, she leads and betrays her trusting\nchildren--and it is the thought of that which at times almost drives\nme mad!Do you but look to Carmen for your faith.She knows God, and she will lead you straight to Him.And\nas you follow her, your foolish ideas of purgatory, hell, and\nparadise, of wafers and virgins--all the tawdry beliefs which the\nChurch has laid upon you, will drop off, one by one, and melt away as\ndo the mists on the lake when the sun mounts high."Carmen and Dona Maria sat against the wall of the old church, waiting\nfor them.The child ran through the darkness and grasped Jose\'s hand."I wouldn\'t go to sleep until you came, Padre!""I\nwanted to be sure you wouldn\'t sleep anywhere else than right next to\nme.""Padre," admonished Rosendo anxiously, "do you think you ought to let\nher come close to you now?The plague--"\n\nJose turned to him and spoke low."There is no power or influence that\nwe can exert upon her, Rosendo, either for good or evil.She is\nobeying a spiritual law of which we know but little.""Just this, Rosendo: _\'Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind\nis stayed on thee.\'_"\n\nThe late moon peeped timidly above the drowsing treetops.Its yellow\nbeams stole silently across the still lake and up the hillside to the\ncrumbling church.When they reached the four quiet figures, huddled\nclose against the ghostly wall, they filtered like streams of liquid\ngold through the brown curls of the little head lying on the priest\'s\nshoulder.And there they dwelt as symbols of Love\'s protecting care\nover the trusting children of this world, until the full dawn of the\nglorious sun of Truth.CHAPTER 21\n\n\nJose rose from his hard bed stiff and weary.Depression sat heavily\nupon his soul, and he felt miserably unable to meet the day.Dona\nMaria was preparing the coffee over a little fire back of the church.The odor of the steaming liquid drifted to him on the warm morning air\nand gave him a feeling of nausea.Was the plague\'s cold hand settling upon him?Giddiness seized him, and he sat down again upon the rocks.In the road below a cloud of dust was rising, and across the distance\na murmur of voices floated up to his ears.He\nwondered dully what additional trouble it portended.Rosendo came to\nhim at that moment."_Muy buenos dias, Padre._ I saw a boat come across the lake some\nminutes ago.Jose struggled to his feet and\nwent forth to meet

ASSOCIATED SUBGRAPH: []
EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In the next place, Jefferson is\nadmonished that if he would save his friend\'s head he must not bring\nthe matter into notice.The government at Philadelphia must, in mercy\nto Paine, remain silent.As to the "pamphlet against Jesus Christ," my\nreader has already perused what Paine wrote on that theme in the "Age\nof Reason."But as that may not be so likely to affect freethinking\nJefferson, Morris adds the falsehood that Paine had been naturalized in\nFrance.The reader need hardly be reminded that if an application by\nthe American Minister for the release would be "ineffectual," it must be\nbecause the said Minister would have it so.Morris had already found,\nas he tells Washington, that the Ministry, supposing him immovable,\nwere making overtures of conciliation; and none can read the obsequious\nletter of the Foreign Minister, Deforgues (October 19, 1793), without\nknowing that a word from Morris would release Paine.The American\npetitioners had indeed been referred to their own government--that is,\nto Morris.The American Minister\'s version of what had occurred is given in a\nletter to Secretary Jefferson, dated March 6th:\n\n"I have mentioned Mr.Major Jackson--who, by\nthe by, has not given me a letter from you which he says was merely\nintroductory, but left it with the Comite de Surete Generale, as a kind\nof letter of credence--Major Jackson, relying on his great influence\nwith the leaders here, stepped forward to get Mr.Paine out of jail, and\nwith several other Americans, has presented a petition to that effect,\nwhich was referred to that Committee and the Comite de Salut Public.This last, I understand, slighted the application as totally irregular;\nand some time afterwards Mr.Paine wrote me a note desiring I would\nclaim him as an American, which I accordingly did, though contrary to my\njudgment, for reasons mentioned in my last The Minister\'s letter to me\nof the 1st Ventose, of which I enclose a copy, contains the answer to my\nreclamation.Paine, who prepared a long answer, and\nsent it to me by an Englishman, whom I did not know.Paine\'s friend, that my present opinion was similar to that of the\nMinister, but I might, perhaps, see occasion to change it, and in that\ncase, if Mr.Paine wished it, I would go on with the claim, but that it\nwould be well for him to consider the result; that, if the Government\nmeant to release him, they had already a sufficient ground; but if not,\nI could only push them to bring on his trial for the crimes imputed\nto him; seeing that whether he be considered as a Frenchman, or as an\nAmerican, he must be amenable to the tribunals of France for his conduct\nwhile he was a Frenchman, and he may see in the fate of the Brissotins,\nthat to which he is exposed.I have heard no more of the affair since;\nbut it is not impossible that he may force on a decision, which, as far\nas I can judge, would be fatal to him: for in the best of times he had\na larger share of every other sense than common sense, and lately the\nintemperate use of ardent spirits has, I am told, considerably impaired\nthe small stock he originally possessed."In this letter the following incidental points suggest comment:\n\n1.The petitioners for Paine\'s release were\neighteen in number, and seem to have comprised all the Americans then\nleft in Paris, some of them eminent.Paine was imprisoned\nunder a law against "foreigners."Those charged with his arrest reported\nthat his papers were entirely innocent.The archives of France, now open\nto exploration, prove that no offence was ever imputed to him, showing\nhis arrest due only to Morris\' insinuation of his being objectionable to\nthe United States.By this insinuation ("crimes imputed to him") Paine\nwas asserted to be amenable to French laws for matters with which the\nUnited States would of course have nothing to do, and of which nothing\ncould be known in Philadelphia.Had Paine ever been a Frenchman, he was\none when Morris pretended that he had claimed him as an American.But\nPaine had been excluded from the Convention and imprisoned expressly\nbecause he was not a Frenchman.No word of the Convention\'s published\naction was transmitted by Morris."The fate of the Brissotins," etc.This of course would frighten\nPaine\'s friends by its hint of a French hostility to him which did\nnot exist, and might restrain them from applying to America for\ninterference.Paine was already restrained by the new order preventing\nhim from communicating with any one except the American Minister."Intemperate," etc This is mere calumny.Since the brief lapse in\nJune, 1793, when overwhelmed by the arrest of his friends, Paine\'s daily\nlife is known from those who dwelt with him.During the months preceding\nhis arrest he wrote the "Age of Reason"; its power, if alcoholic, might\nhave recommended his cellar to Morris, or to any man living.So much for the insinuations and _suggestions falsi_ in Morris\' letter.There is nothing of what had\nreally happened; nothing of the eulogy of Paine by the President of the\nConvention, which would have been a commentary on what Morris had said\nof the contempt in which he was held; not a word of the fact that the\npetitioners were reminded by the Committee that their application was\nunofficial,--in other words, that the determination on Paine\'s fate\nrested with Morris himself.This Morris hides under the phrase:\n"slighted the application as totally irregular."But the fatal far-reaching falsehood of Morris\' letter to Jefferson was\nhis assertion that he had claimed Paine as an American.This falsehood,\ntold to Washington, Jefferson, Edmund Randolph, paralyzed all action in\nAmerica in Paine\'s behalf; told to the Americans in Paris, it paralyzed\nfurther effort of their own.The actual correspondence between Morris and Deforgues is now for the\nfirst time brought to light.MORRIS TO DEFORGUES,\n\n"Paris, 14th February (26 Pluviose) 1794."Sir,--Thomas Paine has just applied to me to claim him as a Citizen of\nthe United States.These (I believe) are the facts which relate to him.Having become a citizen of the United States, he\nacquired great celebrity there through his revolutionary writings.In\nconsequence he was adopted as French Citizen, and then elected Member of\nthe Convention.His behaviour since that epoch is out of my\njurisdiction.I am ignorant of the reason for his present detention in\nthe Luxembourg prison, but I beg you, Sir, if there be reasons which\nprevent his liberation, and which are unknown to me, be so good as to\ninform me of them, so that I may communicate them to the Government of\nthe United States.--I have the honour to be, Sir, Your very humble\nservant,\n\n"Gouv."Paris, 1st Ventose, 2nd year of the Republic [February 19, 1794.]"The Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Minister of the United States."In your letter of the 26th of last month you reclaim the liberty of\nThomas Payne, as an American Citizen.Born in England, this ex-deputy\nhas become successively an American and a French citizen.In accepting\nthis last title, and in occupying a place in the Legislative Corps,\nhe submitted himself to the laws of the Republic, and has _de fait_\nrenounced the protection which the right of the people and treaties\nconcluded with the United States could have assured him."I am ignorant of the motives of his detention, but I must presume\nthey are well founded.I shall nevertheless submit the demand you have\naddressed me to the Committee of Public Safety, and I shall lose no time\nin letting you know its decision.* "Etats Unis," vol.Endorsed: "Received the\n     18th of same [Pluviose, i. e., Feb.To declare\n     reception and to tell him that the Minister will take the\n     necessary steps."01 of\n     the same volume.The opening assertion of the French Minister\'s note reveals the\ncollusion.Careful examination of the American Minister\'s letter, to\nfind where he "reclaims the liberty of Thomas Payne as an American\ncitizen," forces me to the conclusion that the Frenchman only discovered\nsuch reclamation there by the assistance of Morris.The American Minister distinctly declares Paine to be a French citizen,\nand disclaims official recognition of his conduct as "_pas de mon\nressort_."It will be borne in mind that this French Minister is the same Deforgues\nwho had confided to Morris his longing to succeed Genet in America, and\nto whom Morris had whispered his design against Paine.Morris resided\nat Sainport, twenty-seven miles away, but his note is written in Paris.Consultation is further proved by\nthe French Minister\'s speaking of Paine as "occupying a place in the\nLegislative Corps."No uninspired Frenchman could have so described\nthe Convention, any more than an American would have described the\nConvention of 1787 as "Congress."Deforgues\' phrase is calculated for\nPhiladelphia, where it might be supposed that the recently adopted\nConstitution had been followed by the organization of a legislature,\nwhose members must of course take an oath of allegiance, which the\nConvention had not required.* Deforgues also makes bold to declare--as\nfar away as Philadelphia--that Paine is a French citizen, though he\nwas excluded from the Convention and imprisoned; because he was a\n"foreigner."* Deforgues\' phrase "laws of the Republic" is also a\n     deception.The Constitution had been totally suspended by\n     the Convention; no government or law had been or ever was\n     established under or by it.There was as yet no Republic,\n     and only revolutionary or martial laws.The extreme ingenuity of the letter was certainly not original with\nthis Frenchman.The American Minister, in response to his note declaring\nPaine a French citizen, and disclaiming jurisdiction over him, returns\nto Sainport with his official opiate for Paine\'s friends in America and\nParis--a certificate that he has "reclaimed the liberty of Thomas\nPaine as an American citizen."The alleged reclamation suppressed,\nthe certificate sent to Secretary Jefferson and to Paine, the American\nMinister is credited with having done his duty.In Washington\'s\nCabinet, where the technicalities of citizenship had become of paramount\nimportance, especially as regarded France, Deforgues\' claim that Paine\nwas not an American must be accepted--Morris consenting--as final.It may be wondered that Morris should venture on so dangerous a game.But he had secured himself in anything he might choose to do.So soon as\nhe discovered, in the previous summer, that he was not to be removed,\nand had fresh thunderbolts to wield, he veiled himself from the\ninspection of Jefferson.This he did in a letter of September 22, 1793.In the quasi-casual way characteristic of him when he is particularly\ndeep, Morris then wrote: "_By the bye, I shall cease to send you copies\nof my various applications in particular cases, for they will cost you\nmore in postage than they are worth_."I put in italics this sentence,\nas one which merits memorable record in the annals of diplomacy.The French Foreign Office being secret as the grave, Jefferson facile,\nand Washington confiding, there was no danger that Morris\' letter to\nDe-forgues would ever appear.Although the letter of Deforgues,--his\ncertificate that Morris had reclaimed Paine as an American,--was a\nlittle longer than the pretended reclamation, postal economy did not\nprevent the American Minister from sending _that_, but his own was never\nsent to his government, and to this day is unknown to its archives.It cannot be denied that Morris\' letter to De-forgues is masterly in its\nway.He asks the Minister to give him such reasons for Paine\'s detention\nas may not be known to him (Morris), there being no such reasons.He\nsets at rest any timidity the Frenchman might have, lest Morris should\nbe ensnaring him also, by begging--not demanding--such knowledge as he\nmay communicate to his government.Philadelphia is at a safe distance in\ntime and space.Deforgues is complacent enough, Morris being at hand,\nto describe it as a "demand," and to promise speedy action on the\nmatter--which was then straightway buried, for a century\'s slumber.Paine was no doubt right in his subsequent belief that Morris was\nalarmed at his intention of returning to America.Should Paine ever\nreach Jefferson and his adherents, Gouverneur Morris must instantly lose\na position which, sustained by Washington, made him a power\nthroughout Europe.Moreover, there was a Nemesis lurking near him.The\nrevolutionists, aware of his relations with their enemies, were only\nwithheld from laying hands on him by awe of Washington and anxiety about\nthe alliance.The moment of his repudiation by his government would have\nbeen a perilous one.It so proved, indeed, when Monroe supplanted him.For the present, however, he is powerful.As the French Executive\ncould have no interest merely to keep Paine, for six months, without\nsuggestion of trial, it is difficult to imagine any reason, save the\nwish of Morris, why he was not allowed to depart with the Americans, in\naccordance with their petition.Thus Thomas Paine, recognized by every American statesman and by\nCongress as a founder of their Republic, found himself a prisoner, and a\nman without a country.Outlawed by the rulers of his native land--though\nthe people bore his defender, Erskine, from the court on their shoulders\n--imprisoned by France as a foreigner, disowned by America as a\nforeigner, and prevented by its Minister from returning to the country\nwhose President had declared his services to it pre-eminent!Never dreaming that his situation was the work of Morris, Paine\n(February 24th) appealed to him for help."I received your letter enclosing a copy of a letter from the Minister\nof foreign affairs.You must not leave me in the situation in which\nthis letter places me.You know I do not deserve it, and you see the\nunpleasant situation in which I am thrown.I have made an essay in\nanswer to the Minister\'s letter, which I wish you to make ground of\na reply to him.They have nothing against me--except that they do not\nchoose I should be in a state of freedom to write my mind freely upon\nthings I have seen.Though you and I are not on terms of the best\nharmony, I apply to you as the Minister of America, and you may add to\nthat service whatever you think my integrity deserves.At any rate I\nexpect you to make Congress acquainted with my situation, and to send to\nthem copies of the letters that have passed on the subject.A reply to\nthe Minister\'s letter is absolutely necessary, were it only to continue\nthe reclamation.Otherwise your silence will be a sort of consent to his\nobservations."Supposing, from the French Minister\'s opening assertion, that a\nreclamation had really been made, Paine\'s simplicity led him into a\ntrap.He sent his argument to be used by the Minister in an answer of\nhis own, so that Minister was able to do as he pleased with it, the\nresult being that it was buried among his private papers, to be partly\nbrought to light by Jared Sparks, who is candid enough to remark on the\nMinister\'s indifference and the force of Paine\'s argument.Not a word to\nCongress was ever said on the subject.Jefferson, without the knowledge or expectation of Morris, had resigned\nthe State Secretaryship at the close of 1793.Morris\' letter of March\n6th reached the hands of Edmund Randolph, Jefferson\'s successor, late in\nJune.On June 25th Randolph writes Washington, at Mount Vernon, that\nhe has received a letter from Morris, of March 6th, saying "that he has\ndemanded Paine as an American citizen, but that the Minister holds him\nto be amenable to the French laws."Randolph was a just man and an exact\nlawyer; it is certain that if he had received a copy of the fictitious\n"reclamation" the imprisonment would have been curtailed.Under the\nfalse information before him, nothing could be done but await the\nstatement of the causes of Paine\'s detention, which Deforgues would\n"lose no time" in transmitting.It was impossible to deny, without\nfurther knowledge, the rights over Paine apparently claimed by the\nFrench government.And what could be done by the Americans in Paris, whom Paine alone had\nbefriended?Joel Barlow, who had best opportunities of knowing the\nfacts, says: "He [Paine] was always charitable to the poor beyond his\nmeans, a sure friend and protector to all Americans in distress that he\nfound in foreign countries; and he had frequent occasions to exert his\ninfluence in protecting them during the Revolution in France."They were\ngrateful and deeply moved, these Americans, but thoroughly deceived\nabout the situation.Told that they must await the action of a distant\ngovernment, which itself was waiting for action in Paris, alarmed by the\nAmerican Minister\'s hints of danger that might ensue on any misstep or\nagitation, assured that he was proceeding with the case, forbidden to\ncommunicate with Paine, they were reduced to helplessness.Meanwhile,\nbetween silent America and these Americans, all so cunningly disabled,\nstood the remorseless French Committee, ready to strike or to release in\nobedience to any sign from the alienated ally, to soothe whom no\nsacrifice would be too great.Genet had been demanded for the altar of\nsacred Alliance, but (to Morris\' regret) refused by the American\ngovernment.The Revolution would have preferred Morris as a victim, but\nwas quite ready to offer Paine.Six or seven months elapsed without bringing from President or Cabinet a\nword of sympathy for Paine.But they brought increasing indications that\nAmerica was in treaty with England, and Washington disaffected towards\nFrance.Under these circumstances Robespierre resolved on the accusation\nand trial of Paine.It does not necessarily follow that Paine would\nhave been condemned; but there were some who did not mean that he should\nescape, among whom Robespierre may or may not have been included.The\nprobabilities, to my mind, are against that theory.Robespierre having\nceased to attend the Committee of Public Safety when the order issued\nfor Paine\'s death.SICK AND IN PRISON\n\nIt was a strange world into which misfortune had introduced Paine.There\nwas in prison a select and rather philosophical society, mainly persons\nof refinement, more or less released from conventional habit by the\nstrange conditions under which they found themselves.There were\ngentlemen and ladies, no attempt being made to separate them until some\nscandal was reported.The Luxembourg was a special prison for the French\nnobility and the English, who had a good opportunity for cultivating\ndemocratic ideas.The gaoler, Benoit, was good-natured, and cherished\nhis unwilling guests as his children, according to a witness.Paine might even have been happy there but for the ever recurring\ntragedies--the cries of those led forth to death.He was now and then in\nstrange juxtapositions.One day Deforgues came to join him, he who had\nconspired with Morris.Instead of receiving for his crime diplomatic\nsecurity in America he found himself beside his victim.Perhaps if\nDeforgues and Paine had known each other\'s language a confession might\nhave passed There were horrors on horrors.Paine\'s old friend, Herault\nde Sechelles, was imprisoned for having humanely concealed in his house\na poor officer who was hunted by the police; he parted from Paine for\nthe scaffold.So also he parted from the brilliant Camille Desmoulins,\nand the fine dreamer, Anacharsis Clootz.One day came Danton, who,\ntaking Paine\'s hand, said: "That which you did for the happiness and\nliberty of your country, I tried in vain to do for mine.I have been\nless fortunate, but not less innocent.They will send me to the\nscaffold; very well, my friends, I shall go gaily."Even so did Danton\nmeet his doom.*\n\nAll of the English prisoners became Paine\'s friends.Among these was\nGeneral O\'Hara,--that same general who had fired the American heart at\nYorktown by offering the surrendered sword of Cornwallis to\nRochambeau instead of Washington.O\'Hara\'s captured suite included two\nphysicians--Bond and Graham--who attended Paine during an illness, as he\ngratefully records.What money Paine had when arrested does not appear\nto have been taken from him, and he was able to assist General O\'Hara\nwith L200 to return to his country; though by this and similar charities\nhe was left without means when his own unexpected deliverance came.**\n\nThe first part of "The Age of Reason" was sent out with final revision\nat the close of January.* "Memoires sur les prisons," t.** Among the anecdotes told of O\'Hara in prison, one is related of an\nargument he held with a Frenchman, on the relative degrees of liberty\nin England and France."In England," he said, "we are perfectly free to\nwrite and print, George is a good King; but you--why you are not even\nPermitted to write, Robespierre is a tiger!"In the second edition appeared the following inscription:\n\n"TO MY FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.--I put the\nfollowing work under your protection.You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always\nstrenuously supported the Right of every man to his opinion, however\ndifferent that opinion might be to mine.He who denies to another this\nright, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he\nprecludes himself the right of changing it.The most formidable weapon\nagainst errors of every kind is Reason.I have never used any other, and\nI trust I never shall.--Your affectionate friend and fellow citizen,\n\n"Thomas Paine."This dedication is dated, "Luxembourg (Paris), 8th Pluviose, Second year\nof the French Republic, one and indivisible.Paine now addressed himself to the second part of "The Age of Reason,"\nconcerning which the following anecdote is told in the manuscript\nmemoranda of Thomas Rickman:\n\n"Paine, while in the Luxembourg prison and expecting to die hourly, read\nto Mr.Bond (surgeon of Brighton, from whom this anecdote came) parts\nof his _Age of Reason_; and every night, when Mr.Bond left him, to\nbe separately locked up, and expecting not to see Paine alive in the\nmorning, he [Paine] always expressed his firm belief in the principles\nof that book, and begged Mr.Bond should tell the world such were his\ndying sentiments.Paine further said, if he lived he should further\nprosecute the work and print it.Bond added, Paine was the most\nconscientious man he ever knew."In after years, when Paine was undergoing persecution for "infidelity,"\nhe reminded the zealots that they would have to "accuse Providence of\ninfidelity," for having "protected him in all his dangers."Incidentally\nhe gives reminiscences of his imprisonment."I was one of the nine members that composed the first Committee of\nConstitution.Sieyes and myself have\nsurvived--he by bending with the times, and I by not bending.The other\nsurvivor [Barrere] joined Robespierre; he was seized and imprisoned in\nhis turn, and sentenced to transportation.He has since apologized to me\nfor having signed the warrant, by saying he felt himself in danger\nand was obliged to do it.Herault Sechelles, an acquaintance of Mr.Jefferson, and a good patriot, was my _suppleant_ as member of the\nCommittee of Constitution.... He was imprisoned in the Luxembourg with\nme, was taken to the tribunal and guillotined, and I, his principal,\nleft.There were two foreigners in the Convention, Anacharsis Clootz\nand myself.We were both put out of the Convention by the same vote,\narrested by the same order, and carried to prison together the same\nnight.He was taken to the guillotine, and I was again left.... Joseph\nLebon, one of the vilest characters that ever existed, and who made the\nstreets of Arras run with blood, was my _suppleant_ as member of the\nConvention for the Pas de Calais.When I was put out of the Convention\nhe came and took my place.When I was liberated from prison and voted\nagain into the Convention, he was sent to the same prison and took\nmy place there, and he was sent to the guillotine instead of me.He\nsupplied my place all the way through."One hundred and sixty-eight persons were taken out of the Luxembourg\nin one night, and a hundred and sixty of them guillotined next day,\nof which I knew I was to be one; and the manner I escaped that fate is\ncurious, and has all the appearance of accident.The room in which I\nlodged was on the ground floor, and one of a long range of rooms under a\ngallery, and the door of it opened outward and flat against the wall; so\nthat when it was open the inside of the door appeared outward, and the\ncontrary when it was shut.I had three comrades, fellow prisoners with\nme, Joseph Vanhuile of Bruges, since president of the municipality of\nthat town, Michael and Robbins Bastini of Louvain.When persons by\nscores and by hundreds were to be taken out of the prison for the\nguillotine it was always done in the night, and those who performed that\noffice had a private mark or signal by which they knew what rooms to go\nto, and what number to take.We, as I have-said, were four, and the door\nof our room was marked, unobserved by us, with that number in chalk; but\nit happened, if happening is the proper word, that the mark was put on\nwhen the door was open and flat against the wall, and thereby came on\nthe inside when we shut it at night; and the destroying angel passed by\nit."Paine did not hear of this chalk mark until afterwards.In his letter to\nWashington he says:\n\n"I had been imprisoned seven months, and the silence of the executive\npart of the government of America (Mr.Washington) upon the case, and\nupon every thing respecting me, was explanation enough to Robespierre\nthat he might proceed to extremities.A violent fever which had nearly\nterminated my existence was, I believe, the circumstance that preserved\nit.I was not in a condition to be removed, or to know of what was\npassing, or of what had passed, for more than a month.It makes a blank\nin my remembrance of life.The first thing I was informed of was the\nfall of Robespierre."The probabilities are that the prison physician Marhaski, whom Paine\nmentions with gratitude, was with him when the chalk mark was made,\nand that there was some connivance in the matter.In the same letter he\nsays:\n\n"From about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Robespierre,\nJuly 29, (9th of Thermidor,) the state of things in the prisons was a\ncontinued scene of horror.No man could count upon life for twenty-four\nhours.To such a pitch of rage and suspicion were Robespierre and his\ncommittee arrived, that it seemed as if they feared to leave a man to\nlive.Scarcely a night passed in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty\nor more were not taken out of the prison, carried before a pretended\ntribunal in the morning, and guillotined before night.One hundred and\nsixty-nine were taken out of the Luxembourg one night in the month\nof July, and one hundred and sixty of them guillotined.A list of two\nhundred more, according to the report in the prison, was preparing a few\ndays before Robespierre fell.In this last list I have good reason to\nbelieve I was included."To this Paine adds the memorandum for his accusation found in\nRobespierre\'s note-book.Of course it was natural, especially with the\nmemorandum, to accept the Robespierre mythology of the time without\ncriticism.The massacres of July were not due to Robespierre, who during\nthat time was battling with the Committee of Public Safety, at whose\nhands he fell on the 29th.At the close of June there was an alarm at\npreparations for an insurrection in Luxembourg prison, which caused a\nunion of the Committee of Public Safety and the police, resulting in\nindiscriminate slaughter of prisoners.Barrere, long after, apologized to him for\nhaving signed "the warrant," by saying he felt himself in danger and\nwas obliged to do it Paine accepted the apology, and when Barrere\nhad returned to France, after banishment, Paine introduced him to the\nEnglish author, Lewis Goldsmith.* As Barrere did not sign the warrant\nfor Paine\'s imprisonment, it must have been a warrant for his death, or\nfor accusation at a moment when it was equivalent to a death sentence.Whatever danger Barrere had to fear, so great as to cause him to\nsacrifice Paine, it was not from Robespierre; else it would not have\ncontinued to keep Paine in prison three months after Robespierre\'s\ndeath.* "Memoires de B. Barrere," t. i., p.Lewis Goldsmith was\n     the author of "Crimes of the Cabinets."As Robespierre\'s memorandum was for a "decree of accusation" against\nPaine, separately, which might not have gone against him, but possibly\nhave dragged to light the conspiracy against him, there would seem to be\nno ground for connecting that "demand" with the warrant signed by a\nCommittee he did not attend.Paine had good cause for writing as he did in praise of "Forgetfulness."During the period in which he was unconscious with fever the horrors of\nthe prison reached their apogee.On June 19th the kindly gaoler, Benoit,\nwas removed and tried; he was acquitted but not restored.His place was\ngiven to a cruel fellow named Gayard, who instituted a reign of terror\nin the prison.There are many evidences that the good Benoit, so warmly remembered\nby Paine, evaded the rigid police regulations as to communications of\nprisoners with their friends outside, no doubt with precaution against\nthose of a political character.It is pleasant to record an instance\nof this which was the means of bringing beautiful rays of light into\nPaine\'s cell.Shortly before his arrest an English lady had called on\nhim, at his house in the Faubourg St.Denis, to ask his intervention in\nbehalf of an Englishman of rank who had been arrested.Paine had now,\nhowever, fallen from power, and could not render the requested service.This lady was the last visitor who preceded the officers who\narrested him.But while he was in prison there was brought to him a\ncommunication, in a lady\'s handwriting, signed "A little corner of the\nWorld."So far as can be gathered, this letter was of a poetical\ncharacter, perhaps tinged with romance.It was followed by others, all\nevidently meant to beguile the weary and fearful hours of a prisoner\nwhom she had little expectation of ever meeting again.Paine, by the aid\nof Benoit, managed to answer his "contemplative correspondent," as he\ncalled her, signing, "The Castle in the Air."These letters have never\nseen the light, but the sweetness of this sympathy did, for many an\nhour, bring into Paine\'s _oubliette_ the oblivion of grief described in\nthe letter on "Forgetfulness," sent to the lady after his liberation."Memory, like a beauty that is always present to hear herself\nflattered, is flattered by every one.But the absent and silent goddess,\nForgetfulness, has no votaries, and is never thought of: yet we owe her\nmuch.She is the goddess of ease, though not of pleasure.When the mind\nis like a room hung with black, and every corner of it crowded with the\nmost horrid images imagination can create, this kind, speechless maid,\nForgetfulness, is following us night and day with her opium wand, and\ngently touching first one and then another, benumbs them into rest, and\nthen glides away with the silence of a departing shadow."Paine was not forgotten by his old friends in France.So soon as the\nexcitement attending Robespierre\'s execution had calmed a little,\nLan-thenas (August 7th) sent Merlin de Thionville a copy of the "Age of\nReason," which he had translated, and made his appeal."I think it would be in the well-considered interest of the Republic,\nsince the fall of the tyrants we have overthrown, to re-examine the\nmotives of Thomas Paine\'s imprisonment.That re-examination is suggested\nby too many and sensible grounds to be related in detail.Every friend\nof liberty familiar with the history of our Revolution, and feeling the\nnecessity of repelling the slanders with which despots are loading it in\nthe eyes of nations, misleading them against us, will understand these\ngrounds.Should the Committee of Public Safety, having before it no\nfounded charge or suspicion against Thomas Paine, retain any scruples,\nand think that from my occasional conversation with that foreigner, whom\nthe people\'s suffrage called to the national representation, and some\nacquaintance with his language, I might perhaps throw light upon their\ndoubt, I would readily communicate to them all that I know about him.I\nrequest Merlin de Thionville to submit these considerations to the\nCommittee."Merlin was now a leading member of the Committee.On the following day\nPaine sent (in French) the following letters:\n\n"Citizens, Representatives, and Members of the Committee of Public\nSafety: I address you a copy of a letter which I have to-day written to\nthe Convention.The singular situation in which I find myself determines\nme to address myself to the whole Convention, of which you are a part\n\n"Thomas Paine.Maison d\'Arret du Luxembourg, Le 19 Thermidor, l\'an 2 de\nla Republique, une et indivisible.""Citizen Representatives: If I should not express myself with the energy\nI used formerly to do, you will attribute it to the very dangerous\nillness I have suffered in the prison of the Luxembourg.For several\ndays I was insensible of my own existence; and though I am much\nrecovered, it is with exceeding great difficulty that I find power to\nwrite you this letter."But before I proceed further, I request the Convention to observe: that\nthis is the first line that has come from me, either to the Convention,\nor to any of the Committees, since my imprisonment,--which is\napproaching to Eight months.--Ah, my friends, eight months\' loss of\nLiberty seems almost a life-time to a man who has been, as I have been,\nthe unceasing defender of Liberty for twenty years."I have now to inform the Convention of the reason of my not having\nwritten before.It is a year ago that I had strong reason to believe\nthat Robespierre was my inveterate enemy, as he was the enemy of every\nman of virtue and humanity.The address that was sent to the Convention\nsome time about last August from Arras, the native town of Robespierre,\nI have always been informed was the work of that hypocrite and the\npartizans he had in the place.The intention of that address was to\nprepare the way for destroying me, by making the People declare (though\nwithout assigning any reason) that I had lost their confidence; the\nAddress, however, failed of success, as it was immediately opposed by\na counter-address from St.But\nthe strange power that Robespierre, by the most consummate hypocrisy\nand the most hardened cruelties, had obtained rendered any attempt on\nmy part to obtain justice not only useless but even dangerous; for it\nis the nature of Tyranny always to strike a deeper blow when any attempt\nhas been made to repel a former one.This being my situation I submitted\nwith patience to the hardness of my fate and waited the event of\nbrighter days.I hope they are now arrived to the nation and to me."Citizens, when I left the United States in the year 1787, I promised to\nall my friends that I would return to them the next year; but the hope\nof seeing a Revolution happily established in France, that might serve\nas a model to the rest of Europe, and the earnest and disinterested\ndesire of rendering every service in my power to promote it, induced me\nto defer my return to that country, and to the society of my friends,\nfor more than seven years.This long sacrifice of private tranquillity,\nespecially after having gone through the fatigues and dangers of the\nAmerican Revolution which continued almost eight years, deserved a\nbetter fate than the long imprisonment I have silently suffered.But it\nis not the nation but a faction that has done me this injustice, and it\nis to the national representation that I appeal against that injustice.Parties and Factions, various and numerous as they have been, I have\nalways avoided.My heart was devoted to all France, and the object to\nwhich I applied myself was the Constitution.The Plan which I proposed\nto the Committee, of which I was a member, is now in the hands of\nBarrere, and it will speak for itself."It is perhaps proper that I inform you of the cause assigned in the\norder for my imprisonment It is that I am \'a Foreigner\'; whereas, the\n_Foreigner_ thus imprisoned was invited into France by a decree of the\nlate national Assembly, and that in the hour of her greatest danger,\nwhen invaded by Austrians and Prussians.He was, moreover, a citizen of\nthe United States of America, an ally of France, and not a subject of\nany country in Europe, and consequently not within the intentions of\nany of the decrees concerning Foreigners.But any excuse can be made to\nserve the purpose of malignity when it is in power."I will not intrude on your time by offering any apology for the broken\nand imperfect manner in which I have expressed myself.I request you to\naccept it with the sincerity with which it comes from my heart; and I\nconclude with wishing Fraternity and prosperity to France, and union and\nhappiness to her representatives."Citizens, I have now stated to you my situation, and I can have no\ndoubt but your justice will restore me to the Liberty of which I have\nbeen deprived."Luxembourg, Thermidor 19th, 2d year of the French Republic, one and\nindivisible."No doubt this touching letter would have been effectual had it reached\nthe Convention.But the Committee of Public Safety took care that no\nwhisper even of its existence should be heard.Paine\'s participation in\ntheir fostered dogma, that _Robespierre le veut_ explained all crimes,\nprobably cost him three more months in prison.The lamb had confided its\nappeal to the wolf.Barrere, Bil-laud-Varennes, and Collot d\'Herbois,\nby skilful use of the dead scapegoat, maintained their places on the\nCommittee until September 1st, and after that influenced its counsels.At the same time Morris, as we shall see, was keeping Monroe out of his\nplace.There might have been a serious reckoning for these men had Paine\nbeen set free, or his case inquired into by the Convention.And Thuriot\nwas now on the Committee of Public Safety; he was eager to lay his own\ncrimes on Robespierre, and to conceal those of the Committee.Paine\'s\nold friend, Achille Audibert, unsuspicious as himself of the real\nfacts, sent an appeal (August 20th) to "Citizen Thuriot, member of the\nCommittee of Public Safety.""Representative:--A friend of mankind is groaning in chains,--Thomas\nPaine, who was not so politic as to remain silent in regard to a man\nunlike himself, but dared to say that Robespierre was a monster to be\nerased from the list of men.From that moment he became a criminal;\nthe despot marked him as his victim, put him into prison, and doubtless\nprepared the way to the scaffold for him, as for others who knew him and\nwere courageous enough to speak out.*\n\n     * It most be remembered that at this time it seemed the\n     strongest recommendation of any one to public favor to\n     describe him as a victim of Robespierre; and Paine\'s friends\n     could conceive no other cause for the detention of a man\n     they knew to be innocent."Thomas Paine is an acknowledged citizen of the United States.He was\nthe secretary of the Congress for the department of foreign affairs\nduring the Revolution.He has made himself known in Europe by his\nwritings, and especially by his \'Rights of Man.\'The electoral\nassembly of the department of Pas-de-Calais elected him one of its\nrepresentatives to the Convention, and commissioned me to go to London,\ninform him of his election, and bring him to France.I hardly escaped\nbeing a victim to the English Government with which he was at open war;\nI performed my mission; and ever since friendship has attached me to\nPaine.This is my apology for soliciting you for his liberation."I can assure you, Representative, that America was by no means\nsatisfied with the imprisonment of a strong column of its Revolution.But for Robespierre\'s\nvillainy this friend of man would now be free.Do not permit liberty\nlonger to see in prison a victim of the wretch who lives no more but by\nhis crimes; and you will add to the esteem and veneration I feel for\na man who did so much to save the country amidst the most tremendous\ncrisis of our Revolution."Greeting, respect, and brotherhood,\n\n"Achille Audibert, of Calais.216 Rue de Bellechase, Fauborg St Germaine."Audibert\'s letter, of course, sank under the burden of its Robespierre\nmyth to a century\'s sleep beside Paine\'s, in the Committee\'s closet.Meanwhile, the regulation against any communication of prisoners with\nthe outside world remaining in force, it was some time before Paine\ncould know that his letter had been suppressed on its way to the\nConvention.He was thus late in discovering his actual enemies.An interesting page in the annals of diplomacy remains to be written\non the closing weeks of Morris in France.On August 14th he writes to\nRobert Morris: "I am preparing for my departure, but as yet can take no\nstep, as there is a kind of interregnum in the government and Mr.Monroe\nis not yet received, at which he grows somewhat impatient."There was\nno such interregnum, and no such explanation was given to Monroe, who\nwrites:\n\n"I presented my credentials to the commissary of foreign affairs soon\nafter my arrival [August 2d]; but more than a week had elapsed, and I\nhad obtained no answer, when or whether I should be received.A delay\nbeyond a few days surprised me, because I could discern no adequate or\nrational motive for it."*\n\n     * "View of the Conduct of the Executive in the Foreign\n     Affairs of the United States," by James Monroe, p.It is plain that the statement of Paine, who was certainly in\ncommunication with the Committees a year later, is true, that Morris was\nin danger on account of the interception of compromising letters written\nby him.He needed time to dispose of his house and horses, and ship his\nwines, and felt it important to retain his protecting credentials.At\nany moment his friends might be expelled from the Committee, and their\npapers be examined.While the arrangements for Monroe\'s reception rested\nwith Morris and this unaltered Committee, there was little prospect\nof Monroe\'s being installed at all.The new Minister was therefore\ncompelled, as other Americans had been, to appeal directly to the\nConvention.That assembly responded at once, and he was received\n(August 28th) with highest honors.Morris had nothing to do with\nthe arrangement.The historian Frederic Masson, alluding to the\n"unprecedented" irregularity of Morris in not delivering or receiving\nletters of recall, adds that Monroe found it important to state that he\nhad acted without consultation with his predecessor.* This was necessary\nfor a cordial reception by the Convention, but it invoked the cordial\nhatred of Morris, who marked him for his peculiar guillotine set up in\nPhiladelphia.* "Le Departement des Affaires Etrangeres," etc., p.So completely had America and Congress been left in the dark about Paine\nthat Monroe was surprised to find him a prisoner.When at length the new\nMinister was in a position to consult the French Minister about Paine,\nhe found the knots so tightly tied around this particular victim--almost\nthe only one left in the Luxembourg of those imprisoned during the\nTerror--that it was difficult to untie them.The Minister of Foreign\nAffairs was now M. Bouchot, a weak creature who, as Morris said, would\nnot wipe his nose without permission of the Committee of Public Safety.When Monroe opened Paine\'s case he was asked whether he had brought\ninstructions.Of course he had none, for the administration had no\nsuspicion that Morris had not, as he said, attended to the case.When Paine recovered from his fever he heard that Monroe had superseded\nMorris."As soon as I was able to write a note legible enough to be read,\nI found a way to convey one to him [Monroe] by means of the man who\nlighted the lamps in the prison, and whose unabated friendship to me,\nfrom whom he never received any service, and with difficulty accepted\nany recompense, puts the character of Mr.In a few\ndays I received a message from Mr.Monroe, conveyed in a note from an\nintermediate person, with assurance of his friendship, and expressing\na desire that I should rest the case in his hands.After a fortnight\nor more had passed, and hearing nothing farther, I wrote to a friend\n[Whiteside], a citizen of Philadelphia, requesting him to inform me what\nwas the true situation of things with respect to me.I was sure\nthat something was the matter; I began to have hard thoughts of Mr.Washington, but I was unwilling to encourage them.In about ten days I\nreceived an answer to my letter, in which the writer says: \'Mr.Monroe\ntold me he had no order (meaning from the president, Mr.Washington)\nrespecting you, but that he (Mr.Monroe) will do everything in his\npower to liberate you, but, from what I learn from the Americans\nlately arrived in Paris, you are not considered, either by the American\ngovernment or by individuals, as an American citizen.\'"As the American government did regard Paine as an American citizen,\nand approved Monroe\'s demanding him as such, there is no difficulty in\nrecognizing the source from which these statements were diffused among\nPaine\'s newly arriving countrymen.On the receipt of Whiteside\'s note, Paine wrote a Memorial to Monroe,\nof which important parts--amounting to eight printed pages--are omitted\nfrom American and English editions of his works.In quoting this\nMemorial, I select mainly the omitted portions.*\n\n     * The whole is published in French: "Memoire de Thomas\n     Payne, autographe et signe de sa main: addresse a M. Monroe,\n     ministre des Etats-unis en France, pour reclamer sa mise en\n     liberte comme Citoyen Americain, zo Septembre, 1794.Paine says that before leaving London for the Convention, he consulted\nMinister Pinckney, who agreed with him that "it was for the interest of\nAmerica that the system of European governments should be changed and\nplaced on the same principle with her own"; and adds: "I have wished to\nsee America the mother church of government, and I have done my utmost\nto exalt her character and her condition."He points out that he had not\naccepted any title or office under a foreign government, within the\nmeaning of the United States Constitution, because there was no\ngovernment in France, the Convention being assembled to frame one; that\nhe was a citizen of France only in the honorary sense in which others in\nEurope and America were declared such; that no oath of allegiance was\nrequired or given.The following paragraphs are from various parts of\nthe Memorial."They who propagate the report of my not being considered as a citizen\nof America by government, do it to the prolongation of my imprisonment,\nand without authority; for Congress, as a government, has neither\ndecided upon it, nor yet taken the matter into consideration; and I\nrequest you to caution such persons against spreading such reports....\n\n"I know not what opinions have been circulated in America.It may have\nbeen supposed there, that I had voluntarily and intentionally abandoned\nAmerica, and that my citizenship had ceased by my own choice.I can\neasily conceive that there are those in that Country who would take such\na proceeding on my part somewhat in disgust.The idea of forsaking\nold friendships for new acquaintances is not agreeable.I am a little\nwarranted in making this supposition by a letter I received some time\nago from the wife of one of the Georgia delegates, in which she says,\n\'your friends on this side the water cannot be reconciled to the idea\nof your abandoning America.\'I have never abandoned America in thought,\nword, or deed, and I feel it incumbent upon me to give this assurance\nto the friends I have in that country, and with whom I have always\nintended, and am determined, if the possibility exists, to close the\nscene of my life.It is there that I have made myself a home.It is\nthere that I have given the services of my best days.America never\nsaw me flinch from her cause in the most gloomy and perilous of her\nsituations: and I know there are those in that Country who will not\nflinch from me.If I have Enemies (and every man has some) I leave them\nto the enjoyment of their ingratitude....\n\n"It is somewhat extraordinary, that the Idea of my not being a Citizen\nof America should have arisen only at the time that I am imprisoned\nin France because, or on the pretence that, I am a foreigner.The case\ninvolves a strange contradiction of Ideas.None of the Americans who\ncame to France whilst I was in liberty, had conceived any such idea or\ncirculated any such opinion; and why it should arise now is a matter\nyet to be explained.However discordant the late American Minister,\nGouverneur Morris, and the late French Committee of Public Safety were,\nit suited the purpose of both that I should be continued in arrestation.The former wished to prevent my return to America, that I should not\nexpose his misconduct; and the latter, lest I should publish to the\nworld the history of its wickedness.Whilst that Minister and that\nCommittee continued, I had no expectation of liberty.I speak here of\nthe Committee of which Robespierre was a member....\n\n"I here close my Memorial and proceed to offer to you a proposal, that\nappears to me suited to all the circumstances of the case; which is,\nthat you reclaim me conditionally, until the opinion of Congress can\nbe obtained upon the subject of my Citizenship of America, and that I\nremain in liberty under your protection during that time.I found this\nproposal upon the following grounds:\n\n"First, you say you have no orders respecting me; consequently you\nhave no orders _not_ to reclaim me; and in this case you are left\ndiscretionary judge whether to reclaim or not.My proposal therefore\nunites a consideration of your situation with my own."Secondly, I am put in arrestation because I am a foreigner.It is\ntherefore necessary to determine to what Country I belong.The right of\ndetermining this question cannot appertain exclusively to the committee\nof public safety or general surety; because I appear to the Minister of\nthe United States, and shew that my citizenship of that Country is good\nand valid, referring at the same time, through the agency of the\nMinister, my claim of Right to the opinion of Congress,--it being a\nmatter between two governments."Thirdly, France does not claim me for a citizen; neither do I set up\nany claim of citizenship in France.The question is simply, whether I am\nor am not a citizen of America.I am imprisoned here on the decree for\nimprisoning Foreigners, because, say they, I was born in England.I\nsay in answer, that, though born in England, I am not a subject of the\nEnglish Government any more than any other American is who was born, as\nthey all were, under the same government, or that the citizens of France\nare subjects of the French monarchy, under which they were born.I have\ntwice taken the oath of abjuration to the British king and government,\nand of Allegiance to America.Once as a citizen of the State of\nPennsylvania in 1776; and again before Congress, administered to me by\nthe President, Mr.Hancock, when I was appointed Secretary in the office\nof foreign affairs in 1777....\n\n"Painful as the want of liberty may be, it is a consolation to me to\nbelieve that my imprisonment proves to the world that I had no share in\nthe murderous system that then reigned.That I was an enemy to it, both\nmorally and politically, is known to all who had any knowledge of\nme; and could I have written French as well as I can English, I would\npublicly have exposed its wickedness, and shown the ruin with which it\nwas pregnant.They who have esteemed me on former occasions, whether\nin America or England, will, I know, feel no cause to abate that esteem\nwhen they reflect, that imprisonment with preservation of character, is\npreferable to liberty with disgrace."In a postscript Paine adds that "as Gouverneur Morris could not inform\nCongress of the cause of my arrestation, as he knew it not himself, it\nis to be supposed that Congress was not enough acquainted with the case\nto give any directions respecting me when you left."Which to the reader\nof the preceding pages will appear sufficiently naive.To this Monroe responded (September 18th) with a letter of warm\nsympathy, worthy of the high-minded gentleman that he was.After\nascribing the notion that Paine was not an American to mental confusion,\nand affirming his determination to maintain his rights as a citizen of\nthe United States, Monroe says:\n\n"It is unnecessary for me to tell you how much all your countrymen, I\nspeak of the great mass of the people, are interested in your welfare.They have not forgotten the history of their own revolution, and the\ndifficult scenes through which they passed; nor do they review its\nseveral stages without reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the\nmerits of those who served them in that great and arduous conflict.The\ncrime of ingratitude has not yet stained, and I trust never will stain,\nour national character.You are considered by them, as not only having\nrendered important services in our own revolution, but as being on a\nmore extensive scale, the friend of human rights, and a distinguished\nand able advocate in favor of public liberty.To the welfare of Thomas\nPaine the Americans are not and cannot be indifferent.Of the sense\nwhich the President has always entertained of your merits, and of his\nfriendly disposition towards you, you are too well assured to require\nany declaration of it from me.That I forward his wishes in seeking your\nsafety is what I well know; and this will form an additional obligation\non me to perform what I should otherwise consider as a duty."You are, in my opinion, menaced by no kind of danger.To liberate you,\nwill be an object of my endeavors, and as soon as possible.But you\nmust, until that event shall be accomplished, face your situation with\npatience and fortitude; you will likewise have the justice to recollect,\nthat I am placed here upon a difficult theatre, many important objects\nto attend to, and with few to consult.It becomes me in pursuit of\nthose, to regulate my conduct in respect to each, as to the manner and\nthe time, as will, in my judgment, be best calculated to accomplish the\nwhole."With great esteem and respect consider me personally your friend,\n\n"James Monroe."Monroe was indeed "placed upon a difficult theatre."Morris was showing\na fresh letter from the President expressing unabated confidence in him,\napologizing for his recall; he still had friends in the Committee of\nPublic Safety, to which Monroe had appealed in vain.The continued dread\nthe conspirators had of Paine\'s liberation appears in the fact that\nMonroe\'s letter, written September 18th, did not reach Paine until\nOctober 18th, when Morris had reached the boundary line of Switzerland,\nwhich he entered on the 19th.He had left Paris (Sainport) October 14th,\nwhen Barrere, Billaud-Varennes, and Collot d\'Herbois, no longer on\nthe Committee, were under accusation, and their papers under\ninvestigation,--a search that resulted in their exile.Morris got across\nthe line on an irregular passport.While Monroe\'s reassuring letter to Paine was taking a month to\npenetrate his prison walls, he vainly grappled with the subtle\nobstacles.All manner of delays impeded the correspondence, the\nprincipal one being that he could present no instructions from the\nPresident concerning Paine.Of course he was fighting in the dark,\nhaving no suspicion that the imprisonment was due to his predecessor.At length, however, he received from Secretary Randolph a letter (dated\nJuly 30th), from which, though Paine was not among its specifications,\nhe could select a sentence as basis of action: "We have heard with\nregret that several of our citizens have been thrown into prison in\nFrance, from a suspicion of criminal attempts against the government.If\nthey are guilty we are extremely sorry for it; if innocent we must\nprotect them."What Paine had said in his Memorial of collusion between\nMorris and the Committee of Public Safety probably determined Monroe to\napply no more in that quarter; so he wrote (November 2d) to the\nCommittee of General Surety.After stating the general principles and\nlimitations of ministerial protection to an imprisoned countryman, he\nadds:\n\n"The citizens of the United States cannot look back upon the time of\ntheir own revolution without recollecting among the names of their most\ndistinguished patriots that of Thomas Paine; the services he rendered to\nhis country in its struggle for freedom have implanted in the hearts of\nhis countrymen a sense of gratitude never to be effaced as long as they\nshall deserve the title of a just and generous people."The above-named citizen is at this moment languishing in prison,\naffected with a disease growing more intense from his confinement.I\nbeg, therefore, to call your attention to his condition and to request\nyou to hasten the moment when the law shall decide his fate, in case of\nany accusation against him, and if none, to restore him to liberty."Greeting and fraternity,\n\n"Monroe."At this the first positive assertion of Paine\'s American citizenship the\nprison door flew open.He had been kept there solely "pour les interets\nde l\'Amerique," as embodied in Morris, and two days after Monroe\nundertook, without instructions, to affirm the real interests of America\nin Paine he was liberated.Third year of the French Republic.--The Committee of\nGeneral Surety orders that the Citizen Thomas Paine be set at liberty,\nand the seals taken from his papers, on sight of these presents."Members of the Committee (signed): Clauzel, Lesage, Senault, Bentabole,\nReverchon, Goupilleau de Fontenai, Rewbell."Delivered to Clauzel, as Commissioner."*\n\nThere are several interesting points about this little decree.It\nis signed by Bentabole, who had moved Paine\'s expulsion from the\nConvention.It orders that the seals be removed from Paine\'s papers,\nwhereas none had been placed on them, the officers reporting them\ninnocent.This same authority, which had ordered Paine\'s arrest, now,\nin ordering his liberation, shows that the imprisonment had never been\na subject of French inquiry.It had ordered the seals but did not know\nwhether they were on the papers or not.It was no concern of France,\nbut only of the American Minister.It is thus further evident that when\nMonroe invited a trial of Paine there was not the least trace of any\ncharge against him.And there was precisely the same absence of any\naccusation against Paine in the new Committee of Public Safety, to which\nMonroe\'s letter was communicated the same day.Writing to Secretary Randolph (November 7th) Monroe says:\n\n"He was actually a citizen of the United States, and of the United\nStates only; for the Revolution which parted us from Great Britain broke\nthe allegiance which was before due to the Crown, of all who took our\nside.He was, of course, not a British subject; nor was he strictly a\ncitizen of France, for he came by invitation for the temporary purpose\nof assisting in the formation of their government only, and meant to\nwithdraw to America when that should be completed.And what confirms\nthis is the act of the Convention itself arresting him, by which he is\ndeclared a foreigner."I told him I had hoped getting him enlarged without it; but, if I did\ninterfere, it could only be by requesting that he be tried, in case\nthere was any charge against him, and liberated in case there was\nnot.His correspondence with me is lengthy and\ninteresting, and I may probably be able hereafter to send you a copy\nof it.After some time had elapsed, without producing any change in his\nfavor, I finally resolved to address the Committee of General Surety in\nhis behalf, resting my application on the above principle.My letter was\ndelivered by my Secretary in the Committee to the president, who assured\nhim he would communicate its contents immediately to the Committee of\nPublic Safety, and give me an answer as soon as possible.The conference\ntook place accordingly between the two Committees, and, as I presume,\non that night, or on the succeeding day; for on the morning of the day\nafter, which was yesterday, I was presented by the Secretary of the\nCommittee of General Surety with an order for his enlargement.I\nforwarded it immediately to the Luxembourg, and had it carried into\neffect; and have the pleasure now to add that he is not only released to\nthe enjoyment of liberty, but is in good spirits."In reply, the Secretary of State (Randolph) in a letter to Monroe of\nMarch 8, 1795, says: "Your observations on our commercial relations\nto France, and your conduct as to Mr.Gardoqui\'s letter, prove your\njudgment and assiduity.Paine, and the\nlady of our friend [Lafayette] less approved."Thus, after an imprisonment of ten months and nine days, Thomas Paine\nwas liberated from the prison into which he had been cast by a Minister\nof the United States.A RESTORATION\n\nAs in 1792 Paine had left England with the authorities at his heels,\nso in 1794 escaped Morris from France.The ex-Minister went off to\nplay courtier to George III.the despotic\nproclamation with which monarchy was to be restored in France*; Paine\nsat in the house of a real American Minister, writing proclamations of\nrepublicanism to invade the empires.While the American Minister in Paris and his wife were nursing their\npredecessor\'s victim back into life, a thrill of joy was passing\nthrough European courts, on a rumor that the dreaded author had\nbeen guillotined.Paine had the satisfaction of reading, at Monroe\'s\nfireside, his own last words on the scaffold,** and along with it an\ninvitation of the 27th of December 1792.* Morris\' royal proclamations are printed in full in his\n     biography by Jared Sparks.** "The last dying words of Thomas Paine.Executed at the\n     Guillotine in France on the 1st of September, 1794."The\n     dying speech begins: "Ye numerous spectators gathered\n     around, pray give ear to my last words; I am determined to\n     speak the Truth in these my last moments, altho\' I have\n     written and spoke nothing but lies all my life."There is\n     nothing in the witless leaflet worth quoting.When Paine was\n     burnt in effigy, in 1792, it appears to have been with\n     accompaniments of the same kind.Before me is a small\n     placard, which reads thus: "The Dying Speech and Confession\n     of the Arch-Traitor Thomas Paine.Who was executed at Oakham\n     on Thursday.""This morning the Officers usually attending on such\n     occasions went in procession on Horseback to the County\n     Gaol, and demanded the Body of the Arch-Traitor, and from\n     thence proceeded with the Criminal drawn in a Cart by an Ass\n     to the usual place of execution with his Pamphlet called the\n     \'Rights of Man\' in his right hand."On December 7, 1794, Thibaudeau had spoken to that assembly in the\nfollowing terms:\n\n"It yet remains for the Convention to perform an act of justice.I\nreclaim one of the most zealous defenders of liberty\'--Thomas Paine.My reclamation is for a man who has honored his\nage by his energy in defence of the rights of humanity, and who is\nso gloriously distinguished by his part in the American revolution.A\nnaturalized Frenchman* by a decree of the legislative assembly, he was\nnominated by the people.It was only by an intrigue that he was driven\nfrom the Convention, the pretext being a decree excluding foreigners\nfrom representing the French people.There were only two foreigners in\nthe Convention; one [Anacharsis Clootz] is dead, and I speak not of him,\nbut of Thomas Paine, who powerfully contributed to establish liberty in\na country allied with the French Republic.I demand that he be recalled\nto the bosom of the Convention."(_Applause._)\n\n"The _Moniteur_, from which I translate, reports the unanimous adoption\nof Thibaudeau\'s motion.The Committee of Public\nInstruction, empowered to award pensions for literary services, reported\n(January 3, 1795) as the first name on their list, Thomas Paine.Chenier, in reading the report, claimed the honor of having originally\nsuggested Paines name as an honorary citizen of France, and denounced,\namid applause, the decree against foreigners under which the great\nauthor had suffered.In the next sentence but one\n     he rightly describes Paine as a foreigner.The allusion to\n     "an intrigue" is significant.You have revoked that inhospitable decree, and we again see Thomas\nPaine, the man of genius without fortune, our colleague, dear to all\nfriends of humanity,--a cosmopolitan, persecuted equally by Pitt and by\nRobespierre.Notable epoch in the life of this philosopher, who opposed\nthe arms of Common Sense to the sword of Tyranny, the Rights of Man to\nthe machiavelism of English politicians; and who, by two immortal works,\nhas deserved well of the human race, and consecrated liberty in the two\nworlds."Poor as he was, Paine declined this literary pension.He accepted\nthe honors paid him by the Convention, no doubt with a sorrow at the\ncontrasted silence of those who ruled in America.Monroe, however,\nencouraged him to believe that he was still beloved there, and, as he\ngot stronger, a great homesickness came upon him.The kindly host\nmade an effort to satisfy him.On January 4th he (Monroe) wrote to the\nCommittee of Public Safety:\n\n"Citizens: The Decree just passed, bearing on the execution of Articles\n23 and 24 of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between the two\nRepublics, is of such great importance to my country, that I think it\nexpedient to send it there officially, by some particularly confidential\nhand; and no one seems to be better fitted for this errand than Thomas\nPaine, Having resided a long time in France, and having a perfect\nknowledge of the many vicissitudes which the Republic has passed, he\nwill be able to explain and compare the happy lot she now enjoys.As he\nhas passed the same himself, remaining faithful to his principles, his\nreports will be the more trustworthy, and consequently produce a better\neffect.But as Citizen Paine is a member of the Convention, I thought it\nbetter to submit this subject to your consideration.If this affair\ncan be arranged, the Citizen will leave for America immediately, via\nBordeaux, on an American vessel which will be prepared for him.As he\nhas reason to fear the persecution of the English government, should he\nbe taken prisoner, he desires that his departure may be kept a secret.The Convention alone could give a passport to one of its members, and\nas an application to it would make Paine\'s mission known, the Committee\nreturned next day a negative answer."Citizen: We see with satisfaction and without surprise, that you attach\nsome interest to sending officially to the United States the Decree\nwhich the National Convention has just made, in which are recalled and\nconfirmed the reports of Friendship and Commerce existing between the\ntwo Republics."As to the design you express of confiding this errand to Citizen Thomas\nPaine, we must observe to you that the position he holds will not permit\nhim to accept it."*\n\nLiberty\'s great defender gets least of it!The large seal of the\nCommittee--mottoed "Activity, Purity, Attention"--looks like a wheel of\nfortune; but one year before it had borne from the Convention to prison\nthe man it now cannot do without.France now especially needs the\ncounsel of shrewd and friendly American heads.There are indications\nthat Jay in London is carrying the United States into Pitt\'s combination\nagainst the Republic, just as it is breaking up on the Continent.Monroe\'s magnanimity towards Paine found its reward.He brought to his\nhouse, and back into life, just the one man in France competent to\ngive him the assistance he needed.Comprehending the history of the\nRevolution, knowing the record of every actor in it, Paine was able to\nrevise Monroe\'s impressions, and enable him to check calumnies\ncirculated in America.The despatches of Monroe are of high historic\nvalue, largely through knowledge derived from Paine.Monroe\n     dates his letter, "19th year of the American Republic."In Monroe\'s instructions emphasis was laid on\nthe importance to the United States of the free navigation of the\nMississippi and its ultimate control.* Paine\'s former enthusiasm in this\nmatter had possibly been utilized by Gouverneur Morris to connect him,\nas we have seen, with Genet\'s proceedings.The Kentuckians consulted\nPaine at a time when expulsion of the Spaniard was a patriotic American\nscheme.This is shown in a letter written by the Secretary of State\n(Randolph) to the President, February 27, 1794.Brown [Senator of Kentucky] has shown me a letter from the famous\nDr.O\'Fallon to Captain Herron, dated Oct 18, 1793.It was intercepted,\nand he has permitted me to take the following extract:--\'This plan\n(an attack on Louisiana) was digested between Gen.I framed the whole of the correspondence in the General\'s\nname, and corroborated it by a private letter of my own to Mr.Thomas\nPaine, of the National Assembly, with whom during the late war I was\nvery intimate.His reply reached me but a few days since, enclosed in\nthe General\'s despatches from the Ambassador."**\n\n     * "The conduct of Spain towards us is unaccountable and\n     injurious.Pinckney is by this time gone over to Madrid\n     as our envoy extraordinary to bring matters to a conclusion\n     some way or other.But you will seize any favorable moment\n     to execute what has been entrusted to you respecting the\n     Mississippi."--Randolph to Monroe, February 15, 1795.** Two important historical works have recently appeared\n     relating to the famous Senator Brown.The first is a\n     publication of the Filson Club: "The Political Beginnings of\n     Kentucky," by John Mason Brown.The second is: "The Spanish\n     Conspiracy," by Thomas Marshall Green (Cincinnati, Robert\n     Clarke & Co., 1891).The intercepted letter quoted above has\n     some bearing on the controversy between these authors.Apparently, Senator Brown, like many other good patriots,\n     favored independent action in Kentucky when that seemed for\n     the welfare of the United States, but, when the situation\n     had changed, Brown is found co-operating with Washington and\n     Randolph.That such letters (freely written as they were at the beginning of 1793)\nwere now intercepted indicates the seriousness of the situation time had\nbrought on.The administration had soothed the Kentuckians by pledges\nof pressing the matter by negotiations.Hence Monroe\'s instructions, in\ncarrying out which Paine was able to lend a hand.{1795}\n\nIn the State Archives at Paris (Etats Unis, vol.there are two\npapers marked "Thomas Payne."The first urges the French Ministry to\nseize the occasion of a treaty with Spain to do a service to the United\nStates: let the free navigation of the Mississippi be made by France a\ncondition of peace.The second paper (endorsed "3 Ventose, February 21,\n1795") proposes that, in addition to the condition made to Spain, an\neffort should be made to include American interests in the negotiation\nwith England, if not too late.The negotiation with England was\nthen finished, but the terms unpublished.Paine recommended that the\nConvention should pass a resolution that freedom of the Mississippi\nshould be a condition of peace with Spain, which would necessarily\naccept it; and that, in case the arrangement with England should\nprove unsatisfactory, any renewed negotiations should support the just\nreclamations of their American ally for the surrender of the frontier\nposts and for depredations on their trade.Paine points out that such a\ndeclaration could not prolong the war a day, nor cost France an obole;\nwhereas it might have a decisive effect in the United States, especially\nif Jay\'s treaty with England should be reprehensible, and should be\napproved in America.That generosity "would certainly raise the reputation of the French\nRepublic to the most eminent degree of splendour, and lower in\nproportion that of her enemies."It would undo the bad effects of the\ndepredations of French privateers on American vessels, which rejoiced\nthe British party in the United States and discouraged the friends of\nliberty and humanity there.It would acquire for France the merit\nwhich is her due, supply her American friends with strength against the\nintrigues of England, and cement the alliance of the Republics.This able paper might have been acted on, but for the anger in France at\nthe Jay treaty.While writing in Monroe\'s house, the invalid, with an abscess in his\nside and a more painful sore in his heart--for he could not forget that\nWashington had forgotten him,--receives tidings of new events through\ncries in the street.In the month of his release they had been resonant\nwith yells as the Jacobins were driven away and their rooms turned to\na Normal School.Then came shouts, when, after trial, the murderous\ncommitteemen were led to execution or exile.In the early weeks of 1795\nthe dread sounds of retribution subside, and there is a cry from the\nstreet that comes nearer to Paine\'s heart--"Bread and the Constitution\nof Ninety-three!"He knows that it is his Constitution for which\nthey are really calling, for they cannot understand the Robespierrian\nadulteration of it given out, as one said, as an opiate to keep the\ncountry asleep.These are the\npeople in whom Paine has ever believed,--the honest hearts that summoned\nhim, as author of "The Rights of Man," to help form their Constitution.They, he knows, had to be deceived when cruel deeds were done, and\nheard of such deeds with as much horror as distant peoples.Over that\nConstitution for which they were clamoring he and his lost friend\nCondorcet had spent many a day of honest toil.Of the original Committee\nof Nine appointed for the work, six had perished by the revolution,\none was banished, and two remained--Sieyes and Paine.That original\nCommittee had gradually left the task to Paine and Condorcet,--Sieyes,\nbecause he had no real sympathy with republicanism, though he honored\nPaine.* When afterwards asked how he had survived the Terror, Sieyes\nanswered, "I lived."He lived by bending, and now leads a Committee of\nEleven on the Constitution, while Paine, who did not bend, is\ndisabled.The people will vainly try for the\n"Constitution of Ninety-three."They shall have no Constitution but\nof Sieyes\' making, and in it will be some element of monarchy.Sieyes\npresently seemed to retire from the Committee, but old republicans did\nnot doubt that he was all the more swaying it.Thomas Paine is one of those men who have contributed\n     the most to establish the liberty of America.His ardent\n     love of humanity, and his hatred of every sort of tyranny,\n     have induced him to take up in England the defence of the\n     French revolution, against the amphigorical declamation of\n     Mr.His work has been translated into our language,\n     and is universally known.What French patriot is there who\n     has not already, from the bottom of his heart, thanked this\n     foreigner for having strengthened our cause by all the\n     powers of his reason and reputation?It is with pleasure\n     that I observe an opportunity of offering him the tribute of\n     my gratitude and my esteem for the truly philosophical\n     application of talents so distinguished as his own."--Sieyes\n     in the Moniteur, July 6, 1791.So once more Paine seizes his pen; his hand is feeble, but His intellect\nhas lost no fibre of force, nor his heart its old faith.His trust in\nman has passed through the ordeal of seeing his friends--friends of\nman--murdered by the people\'s Convention, himself saved by accident; it\nhas survived the apparent relapse of Washington into the arms of\nGeorge the Third.The ingratitude of his faithfully-served America\nis represented by an abscess in his side, which may strike into his\nheart--in a sense has done so--but will never reach his faith in\nliberty, equality, and humanity.Early in July the Convention is reading Paine\'s "Dissertation on First\nPrinciples of Government" His old arguments against hereditary right,\nor investing even an elective individual with extraordinary power, are\nrepeated with illustrations from the passing Revolution."Had a Constitution been established two years ago, as ought to have\nbeen done, the violences that have since desolated France and injured\nthe character of the revolution, would, in my opinion, have been\nprevented.The nation would have had a bond of union, and every\nindividual would have known the line of conduct he was to follow.But,\ninstead of this, a revolutionary government, a thing without either\nprinciple or authority, was substituted in its place; virtue or crime\ndepended upon accident; and that which was patriotism one day, became\ntreason the next.All these things have followed from the want of a\nConstitution; for it is the nature and intention or a Constitution to\nprevent governing by party, by establishing a common principle that\nshall limit and control the power and impulse of party, and that says\nto all parties, _Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther_.But in the\nabsence of a Constitution men look entirely to party; and instead of\nprinciple governing party, party governs principle."An avidity to punish is always dangerous to liberty.It leads men to\nstretch, to misinterpret and to misapply even the best of laws.He\nthat would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from\noppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent\nthat will reach himself."Few of Paine\'s pamphlets better deserve study than this.In writing it,\nhe tells us, he utilized the fragment of a work begun at some time\nnot stated, which he meant to dedicate to the people of Holland,\nthen contemplating a revolution.It is a condensed statement of the\nprinciples underlying the Constitution written by himself and Condorcet,\nnow included among Condorcet\'s works.They who imagine that Paine\'s\npolitical system was that of the democratic demagogues may undeceive\nthemselves by pondering this pamphlet.It has been pointed out, on a\nprevious page of this work, that Paine held the representative to be\nnot the voter\'s mouthpiece, but his delegated sovereignty.The\nrepresentatives of a people are therefore its supreme power.The\nexecutive, the ministers, are merely as chiefs of the national police\nengaged in enforcing the laws.They are mere employes, without any\nauthority at all, except of superintendence."The executive department\nis official, and is subordinate to the legislative as the body is to\nthe mind."The chief of these official departments is the judicial.In\nappointing officials the most important rule is, "never to invest any\nindividual with extraordinary power; for besides being tempted to\nmisuse it, it will excite contention and commotion in the nation for\nthe office."All of this is in logical conformity with the same author\'s\n"Rights of Man," which James Madison declared to be an exposition of the\nprinciples on which the United States government is based.It would be\nentertaining to observe the countenance of a President should our House\nof Representatives address him as a chief of national police.Soon after the publication of Paine\'s "Dissertation" a new French\nConstitution was textually submitted for popular consideration.Although\nin many respects it accorded fairly well with Paine\'s principles, it\ncontained one provision which he believed would prove fatal to the\nRepublic.This was the limitation of citizenship to payers of direct\ntaxes, except soldiers who had fought in one or more campaigns for the\nRepublic, this being a sufficient qualification.This revolutionary\ndisfranchisement of near half the nation brought Paine to the Convention\n(July 7th) for the first time since the fall of the Brissotins, two\nyears before.A special motion\nwas made by Lan-thenas and unanimously adopted, "that permission be\ngranted Thomas Paine to deliver his sentiments on the declaration of\nrights and the Constitution."With feeble step he ascended the tribune,\nand stood while a secretary read his speech.Of all present this man had\nsuffered most by the confusion of the mob with the people, which caused\nthe reaction on which was floated the device he now challenged.It is\nan instance of idealism rare in political history.The speech opens with\nwords that caused emotion."Citizens, The effects of a malignant fever, with which I was afflicted\nduring a rigorous confinement in the Luxembourg, have thus long\nprevented me from attending at my post in the bosom of the Convention;\nand the magnitude of the subject under discussion, and no other\nconsideration on earth, could induce me now to repair to my station.A recurrence to the vicissitudes I have experienced, and the critical\nsituations in which I have been placed in consequence of the French\nRevolution, will throw upon what I now propose to submit to the\nConvention the most unequivocal proofs of my integrity, and the\nrectitude of those principles which have uniformly influenced my\nconduct.In England I was proscribed for having vindicated the French\nRevolution, and I have suffered a rigorous imprisonment in France for\nhaving pursued a similar line of conduct.During the reign of terrorism\nI was a prisoner for eight long months, and remained so above three\nmonths after the era of the 10th Thermidor.I ought, however, to state,\nthat I was not persecuted by the _people_, either of England or France.The proceedings in both countries were the effects of the despotism\nexisting in their respective governments.But, even if my persecution\nhad originated in the people at large, my principles and conduct would\nstill have remained the same.Principles which are influenced and\nsubject to the control of tyranny have not their foundation in the\nheart."Though they slay him Paine will trust in the people.There seems a\nslight slip of memory; his imprisonment, by revolutionary calendar,\nlasted ten and a half months, or 315 days; but there is no failure\nof conviction or of thought.He points out the inconsistency of the\ndisfranchisement of indirect tax-payers with the Declaration of Rights,\nand the opportunity afforded partisan majorities to influence\nsuffrage by legislation on the mode of collecting taxes.The soldier,\nenfranchised without other qualification, would find his children\nslaves."If you subvert the basis of the Revolution, if you dispense with\nprinciples and substitute expedients, you will extinguish that\nenthusiasm which has hitherto been the life and soul of the revolution;\nand you will substitute in its place nothing but a cold indifference and\nself-interest, which will again degenerate into intrigue, cunning, and\neffeminacy."There was an educational test of suffrage to which he did not object."Where knowledge is a duty, ignorance is a crime."But in his appeal to\npure principle simple-hearted Paine knew nothing of the real test of the\nConvention\'s votes.This white-haired man was the only eminent member\nof the Convention with nothing in his record to cause shame or fear.He\nalmost alone among them had the honor of having risked his head rather\nthan execute Louis, on whom he had looked as one man upon another.He\nalone had refused to enter the Convention when it abandoned the work for\nwhich it was elected and became a usurping tribunal.During two fearful\nyears the true Republic had been in Paine\'s house and garden, where he\nconversed with his disciples; or in Luxembourg prison, where he won all\nhearts, as did imprisoned George Fox, who reappeared in him, and where,\nbeneath the knife whose fall seemed certain, he criticised consecrated\ndogmas.With this record Paine spoke that day to men who feared to face\nthe honest sentiment of the harried peasantry.Some of the members had\nindeed been terrorized, but a majority shared the disgrace of the old\nConvention.The heart of France was\nthrobbing again, and what would become of these "Conventionnels," when\ntheir assembly should die in giving birth to a government?They must\nfrom potentates become pariahs.Their aim now was to prolong their\npolitical existence.The constitutional narrowing of the suffrage was\nin anticipation of the decree presently appended, that two thirds of the\nnew legislature should be chosen from the Convention.Paine\'s speech was\ndelivered against a foregone conclusion.This was his last appearance\nin the Convention.Out of it he naturally dropped when it ended (October\n26, 1795), with the organization of the Directory.Being an American he\nwould not accept candidature in a foreign government.CHAPTER X. THE SILENCE OF WASHINGTON\n\nMonroe, in a letter of September 15th to his relative, Judge Joseph\nJones, of Fredericksburg, Virginia, after speaking of the Judge\'s son\nand his tutor at St.Germain, adds:\n\n"As well on his account as that of our child, who is likewise at St.Germain, we had taken rooms there, with the intention of occupying for a\nmonth or two in the course of the autumn, but fear it will not be in our\npower to do so, on account of the ill-health of Mr.Paine, who has lived\nin my house for about ten months past.He was upon my arrival confined\nin the Luxembourg, and released on my application; after which, being\nill, he has remained with me.For some time the prospect of his recovery\nwas good; his malady being an abscess in his side, the consequence of a\nsevere fever in the Luxembourg.Latterly his symptoms have become worse,\nand the prospect now is that he will not be able to hold out more than a\nmonth or two at the furthest.I shall certainly pay the utmost attention\nto this gentleman, as he is one of those whose merits in our Revolution\nwere most distinguished."*\n\n     * I am indebted to Mrs.Gouverneur, of Washington, for this\n     letter, which is among the invaluable papers of her\n     ancestor, President Monroe, which surely should be secured\n     for our national archives.Paine\'s speech in the Convention told sadly on his health.As when, in 1793, the guillotine rising over him, he had\nset about writing his last bequest, the "Age of Reason," he now devoted\nhimself to its completion.The manuscript of the second part, begun in\nprison, had been in the printer\'s hands some time before Monroe wrote\nof his approaching end.When the book appeared, he was so low that his\ndeath was again reported.So far as France was concerned, there was light about his eventide."Almost as suddenly," so he wrote, "as the morning light dissipates\ndarkness, did the establishment of the Constitution change the face of\naffairs in France.Security succeeded to terror, prosperity to distress,\nplenty to famine, and confidence increased as the days multiplied."This\nmay now seem morbid optimism, but it was shared by the merry youth, and\nthe pretty dames, whose craped arms did not prevent their sandalled feet\nand Greek-draped forms from dancing in their transient Golden Age.Of\nall this, we may be sure, the invalid hears many a beguiling story from\nMadame Monroe.But there is a grief in his heart more cruel than death.The months have\ncome and gone,--more than eighteen,--since Paine was cast into prison,\nbut as yet no word of kindness or inquiry had come from Washington.Early in the year, on the President\'s sixty-third birthday, Paine had\nwritten him a letter of sorrowful and bitter reproach, which Monroe\npersuaded him not to send, probably because of its censures on the\nministerial failures of Morris, and "the pusillanimous conduct of Jay\nin England."It now seems a pity that Monroe did not encourage Paine to\nsend Washington, in substance, the personal part of his letter, which\nwas in the following terms:\n\n"As it is always painful to reproach those one would wish to respect, it\nis not without some difficulty that I have taken the resolution to write\nto you.The danger to which I have been exposed cannot have been\nunknown to you, and the guarded silence you have observed upon that\ncircumstance, is what I ought not to have expected from you, either as a\nfriend or as a President of the United States."You knew enough of my character to be assured that I could not have\ndeserved imprisonment in France, and, without knowing anything more\nthan this, you had sufficient ground to have taken some interest for my\nsafety.Every motive arising from recollection ought to have suggested\nto you the consistency of such a measure.But I cannot find that you\nhave so much as directed any enquiry to be made whether I was in prison\nor at liberty, dead or alive; what the cause of that imprisonment was,\nor whether there was any service or assistance you could render.Is this\nwhat I ought to have expected from America after the part I had acted\ntowards her?Or, will it redound to her honor or to your\'s that I tell\nthe story?"I do not hesitate to say that you have not served America with more\nfidelity, or greater zeal, or greater disinterestedness, than myself,\nand perhaps with not better effect After the revolution of America had\nbeen established, you rested at home to partake its advantages, and I\nventured into new scenes of difficulty to extend the principles which\nthat revolution had produced.In the progress of events you beheld\nyourself a president in America and me a prisoner in France: you folded\nyour arms, forgot your friend, and became silent."As everything I have been doing in Europe was connected with my wishes\nfor the prosperity of America, I ought to be the more surprised at this\nconduct on the part of her government.It leaves me but one mode of\nexplanation, which is, that everything is not as it ought to be amongst\nyou, and that the presence of a man who might disapprove, and who had\ncredit enough with the country to be heard and believed, was not\nwished for.This was the operating motive of the despotic faction\nthat imprisoned me in France (though the pretence was that I was a\nforeigner); and those that have been silent towards me in America,\nappear to me to have acted from the same motive.It is impossible for me\nto discover any other."Unwilling as all are to admit anything disparaging to Washington,\njustice requires the fair consideration of Paine\'s complaint There were\nin his hands many letters proving Washington\'s friendship, and his great\nappreciation of Paine\'s services.Paine had certainly done nothing to\nforfeit his esteem.The "Age of Reason" had not appeared in America\nearly enough to affect the matter, even should we suppose it offensive\nto a deist like Washington.The dry approval, forwarded by the Secretary\nof State, of Monroe\'s reclamation of Paine, enhanced the grievance.It\nadmitted Paine\'s American citizenship.It was not then an old friend\nunhappily beyond his help, but a fellow-citizen whom he could legally\nprotect, whom the President had left to languish in prison, and in\nhourly danger of death.During six months he saw no visitor, he heard no\nword, from the country for which he had fought.To Paine it could appear\nonly as a sort of murder.And, although he kept back the letter, at his\nfriend\'s desire, he felt that it might yet turn out to be murder.Even\nso it seemed, six months later, when the effects of his imprisonment,\ncombined with his grief at Washington\'s continued silence (surely Monroe\nmust have written on the subject), brought him to death\'s door.One must\nbear in mind also the disgrace, the humiliation of it, for a man who had\nbeen reverenced as a founder of the American Republic, and its apostle\nin France.This, indeed, had made his last three months in prison, after\nthere had been ample time to hear from Washington, heavier than all the\nothers.After the fall of Robespierre the prisons were rapidly\nemptied--from twenty to forty liberations daily,--the one man apparently\nforgotten being he who wrote, "in the times that tried men\'s souls," the\nwords that Washington ordered to be read to his dispirited soldiers.If there can be any explanation of this long\nneglect and silence, knowledge of it would soothe the author\'s dying\npillow; and though there be little probability that he can hold out so\nlong, a letter (September 20th) is sent to Washington, under cover to\nFranklin Bache."Sir,--I had written you a letter by Mr.Letombe, French consul, but, at\nthe request of Mr.Monroe, I withdrew it, and the letter is still by\nme.I was the more easily prevailed upon to do this, as it was then my\nintention to have returned to America the latter end of the present year\n(1795;) but the illness I now suffer prevents me.In case I had come, I\nshould have applied to you for such parts of your official letters (and\nyour private ones, if you had chosen to give them) as contained any\ninstructions or directions either to Mr.Morris, or\nto any other person, respecting me; for after you were informed of my\nimprisonment in France it was incumbent on you to make some enquiry\ninto the cause, as you might very well conclude that I had not the\nopportunity of informing you of it.I cannot understand your silence\nupon this subject upon any other ground, than as connivance at my\nimprisonment; and this is the manner in which it is understood here,\nand will be understood in America, unless you will give me authority for\ncontradicting it.I therefore write you this letter, to propose to you\nto send me copies of any letters you have written, that I may remove\nthis suspicion.In the Second Part of the "Age of Reason," I have given\na memorandum from the handwriting of Robespierre, in which he proposed a\ndecree of accusation against me \'for the interest of America as well as\nof France.\'He could have no cause for putting America in the case, but\nby interpreting the silence of the American government into connivance\nand consent.I was imprisoned on the ground of being born in England;\nand your silence in not inquiring the cause of that imprisonment, and\nreclaiming me against it, was tacitly giving me up.I ought not to have\nsuspected you of treachery; but whether I recover from the illness I now\nsuffer, or not, I shall continue to think you treacherous, till you give\nme cause to think otherwise.I am sure you would have found yourself\nmore at your ease had you acted by me as you ought; for whether your\ndesertion of me was intended to gratify the English government, or to\nlet me fall into destruction in France that you might exclaim the louder\nagainst the French Revolution; or whether you hoped by my extinction to\nmeet with less opposition in mounting up the American government; either\nof these will involve you in reproach you will not easily shake off.This is a bitter letter, but it is still more a sorrowful one.In view\nof what Washington had written of Paine\'s services, and for the sake\nof twelve years of _camaraderie_, Washington should have overlooked the\nsharpness of a deeply wronged and dying friend, and written to him what\nhis Minister in France had reported.My reader already knows, what the\nsufferer knew not, that a part of Paine\'s grievance against Washington\nwas unfounded.Washington could not know that the only charge against\nPaine was one trumped up by his own Minister in France.Had he\nconsidered the letter just quoted, he must have perceived that Paine was\nlaboring under an error in supposing that no inquiry had been made into\nhis case.There are facts antecedent to the letter showing that his\ncomplaint had a real basis.For instance, in a letter to Monroe\n(July 30th), President\'s interest was expressed in two other American\nprisoners in France--Archibald Hunter and Shubael Allen,--but no word\nwas said of Paine.There was certainly a change in Washington towards\nPaine, and the following may have been its causes.Paine had introduced Genet to Morris, and probably to public men in\nAmerica.Genet had put an affront on Morris, and taken over a demand for\nhis recall, with which Morris connected Paine.In a letter to Washington\n(private) Morris falsely insinuated that Paine had incited the actions\nof Genet which had vexed the President.Morris, perhaps in fear that Jefferson, influenced by Americans in\nParis, might appoint Paine to his place, had written to Robert Morris in\nPhiladelphia slanders of Paine, describing him as a sot and an object of\ncontempt.This he knew would reach Washington without passing under the\neye of Paine\'s friend, Jefferson.In a private letter Morris related that Paine had visited him with\nColonel Oswald, and treated him insolently.Washington particularly\ndisliked Oswald, an American journalist actively opposing his\nadministration.Morris had described Paine as intriguing against him, both in Europe\nand America, thus impeding his mission, to which the President attached\ngreat importance.The President had set his heart on bribing England with a favorable\ntreaty of commerce to give up its six military posts in America.The\nmost obnoxious man in the world to England was Paine.Any interference\nin Paine s behalf would not only have offended England, but appeared as\na sort of repudiation of Morris\' intimacy with the English court.The (alleged) reclamation of Paine by Morris had been kept secret by\nWashington even from friends so intimate (at the time) as Madison, who\nwrites of it as having never been done.So carefully was avoided the\npublication of anything that might vex England.Morris had admonished the Secretary of State that if Paine\'s\nimprisonment were much noticed it might endanger his life.So conscience\nwas free to jump with policy.What else Morris may have conveyed to Washington against Paine can be\nonly matter for conjecture; but what he was capable of saying about\nthose he wished to injure may be gathered from various letters of his.In one (December 19, 1795) he tells Washington that he had heard from a\ntrusted informant that his Minister, Monroe, had told various Frenchmen\nthat "he had no doubt but that, if they would do what was proper here,\nhe and his friends would turn out Washington."Liability to imposition is the weakness of strong natures.Many an Iago\nof canine cleverness has made that discovery.But, however Washington\'s\nmind may have been poisoned towards Paine, it seems unaccountable that,\nafter receiving the letter of September 20th, he did not mention to\nMonroe, or to somebody, his understanding that the prisoner had been\npromptly reclaimed.In my first edition it was suggested that the letter\nmight have been intercepted by Secretary Pickering, Paine\'s enemy, who\nhad withheld from Washington important documents in Randolph\'s case.Unfortunately my copyist in the State Department sent me only Bache\'s\nendorsement: "Jan.Franklin Bache, and by him\nforwarded immediately upon receipt."But there is also an endorsement by\nWashington: "From Mr.(Addressed outside:\n"George Washington, President of the United States.")The President was\nno longer visited by his old friends, Madison and others, and they could\nnot discuss with him the intelligence they were receiving about Paine.Madison, in a letter to Jefferson (dated at Philadelphia, January 10,\n1796), says:\n\n"I have a letter from Thomas Paine which breathes the same sentiments,\nand contains some keen observations on the administration of the\ngovernment here.It appears that the neglect to claim him as an American\ncitizen when confined by Robespierre, or even to interfere in any way\nwhatever in his favor, has filled him with an indelible rancor against\nthe President, to whom it appears he has written on the subject\n[September 20, 1795].His letter to me is in the style of a dying one,\nand we hear that he is since dead of the abscess in his side, brought on\nby his imprisonment.His letter desires that he may be remembered to\nyou."Whatever the explanation may be, no answer came from Washington.After\nwaiting a year Paine employed his returning strength in embodying the\nletters of February 22d and September 20th, with large additions, in a\nprinted _Letter to George Washington_.The story of his imprisonment\nand death sentence here for the first time really reached the\nAmerican people.His personal case is made preliminary to an attack on\nWashington\'s whole career.The most formidable part of the pamphlet was\nthe publication of Washington\'s letter to the Committee of Public\nSafety, which, departing from its rule of secrecy (in anger at the\nBritish Treaty), thus delivered a blow not easily answerable.The\nPresident\'s letter was effusive, about the "alliance," "closer bonds of\nfriendship," and so forth,--phrases which, just after the virtual\ntransfer of our alliance to the enemy of France, smacked of perfidy.Paine attacks the treaty, which is declared to have put American\ncommerce under foreign dominion.Her right\nto navigate is reduced to the right of escaping; that is, until some\nship of England or France stops her vessels and carries them into port."The ministerial misconduct of Gouverneur Morris, and his neglect of\nAmerican interests, are exposed in a sharp paragraph.Washington\'s\nmilitary mistakes are relentlessly raked up, with some that he did not\ncommit, and the credit given him for victories won by others heavily\ndiscounted.{1796}\n\nThat Washington smarted under this pamphlet appears by a reference to it\nin a letter to David Stuart, January 8, 1797.Speaking of himself in the\nthird person, he says: "Although he is soon to become a private citizen,\nhis opinions are to be knocked down, and his character reduced as low\nas they are capable of sinking it, even by resorting to absolute\nfalsehoods.As an evidence whereof, and of the plan they are pursuing,\nI send you a letter of Mr.Paine to me, printed in this city\n[Philadelphia], and disseminated with great industry."In the same\nletter he says: "Enclosed you will receive also a production of Peter\nPorcupine, alias William Cobbett.Making allowances for the asperity of\nan Englishman, for some of his strong and coarse expressions, and a\nwant of official information as to many facts, it is not a bad thing."*\nCobbett\'s answer to Paine\'s personal grievance was really an arraignment\nof the President.He undertakes to prove that the French Convention was\na real government, and that by membership in it Paine had forfeited\nhis American citizenship.But Monroe had formally claimed Paine as an\nAmerican citizen, and the President had officially endorsed that claim.That this approval was unknown to Cobbett is a remarkable fact, showing\nthat even such small and tardy action in Paine\'s favor was kept secret\nfrom the President\'s new British and Federalist allies.* "Porcupine\'s Political Censor, for December, 1796.A\n     Letter to the Infamous Tom.Paine, in answer to his letter\n     to General Washington."For the rest it is a pity that Washington did not specify the "absolute\nfalsehoods" in Paine\'s pamphlet, if he meant the phrase to apply to\nthat.It might assist us in discovering just how the case stood in his\nmind.He may have been indignant at the suggestion of his connivance\nwith Paine\'s imprisonment; but, as a matter of fact, the President had\nbeen brought by his Minister into the conspiracy which so nearly cost\nPaine his life.On a review of the facts, my own belief is that the heaviest part of\nPaine\'s wrong came indirectly from Great Britain.It was probably one\nmore instance of Washington\'s inability to weigh any injustice against\nan interest of this country.He ignored compacts of capitulation in the\ncases of Burgoyne and Asgill, in the Revolution; and when convinced\nthat this nation must engage either in war or commercial alliance with\nEngland he virtually broke faith with France.*\n\n     * In a marginal note on Monroe\'s "View, etc.," found among\n     his papers, Washington writes: "Did then the situation of\n     our affairs admit of any other alternative than negotiation\n     or war?"(Sparks\' "Washington," xi., P- 505).Since writing\n     my "Life of Randolph," in which the history of the British\n     treaty is followed, I found in the French Archives ( Etats-\n     Unis, vol.12) Minister Fauchet\'s report of a\n     conversation with Secretary Randolph in which he (Randolph)\n     said: "What would you have us do?We could not end our\n     difficulties with the English but by a war or a friendly\n     treaty.We were not prepared for war; it was necessary to\n     negotiate."It is now tolerably certain that there was\n     "bluff" on the part of the British players, in London and\n     Philadelphia, but it won.To the new alliance he sacrificed his most faithful friends Edmund\nRandolph and James Monroe; and to it, mainly, was probably due his\nfailure to express any interest in England\'s outlaw, Paine.For this\nmight gain publicity and offend the government with which Jay was\nnegotiating.Let justice add that he\nincluded himself in the list of patriotic martyrdoms.he lost his old friends, lost the\nconfidence of his own State, incurred denunciations that, in his own\nwords, "could scarcely be applied to a Nero, a notorious defaulter,\nor even to a common pickpocket."So he wrote before Paine\'s pamphlet\nappeared, which, save in the personal matter, added nothing to\nthe general accusations.It is now forgotten that with one\nexception--Johnson--no President ever went out of office so loaded with\nodium as Washington.It was the penalty of Paine\'s power that, of the\nthousand reproaches, his alone survived to recoil on his memory when\nthe issues and the circumstances that explain if they cannot justify\nhis pamphlet, are forgotten.It is easy for the Washington worshipper\nof to-day to condemn Paine\'s pamphlet, especially as he is under no\nnecessity of answering it.But could he imagine himself abandoned to\nlong imprisonment and imminent death by an old friend and comrade, whose\nletters of friendship he cherished, that friend avowedly able to protect\nhim, with no apparent explanation of the neglect but deference to an\nenemy against whom they fought as comrades, an unprejudiced reader\nwould hardly consider Paine\'s letter unpardonable even where unjust.Its\ntremendous indignation is its apology so far as it needs apology.A man\nwho is stabbed cannot be blamed for crying out.It is only in poetry\nthat dying Desdemonas exonerate even their deluded slayers.Paine, who\nwhen he wrote these personal charges felt himself dying of an abscess\ntraceable to Washington\'s neglect, saw not Iago behind the President.His private demand for explanation, sent through Bache, was answered\nonly with cold silence."I have long since resolved," wrote Washington\nto Governor Stone (December 6, 1795), "for the present time at least,\nto let my calumniators proceed without any notice being taken of\ntheir invectives by myself, or by any others with my participation or\nknowledge."But now, nearly a year later, comes Paine\'s pamphlet, which\nis not made up of invectives, but of statements of fact.If, in this\ncase, Washington sent, to one friend at least, Cobbett\'s answer to\nPaine, despite its errors which he vaguely mentions, there appears no\ngood reason why he should not have specified those errors, and Paine\'s\nalso.By his silence, even in the confidence of friendship, the truth\nwhich might have come to light was suppressed beyond his grave.For such\nsilence the best excuse to me imaginable is that, in ignorance of\nthe part Morris had acted, the President\'s mind may have been in\nbewilderment about the exact facts.As for Paine\'s public letter, it was an answer to Washington\'s\nunjustifiable refusal to answer his private one.It was the natural\noutcry of an ill and betrayed man to one whom we now know to have been\nalso betrayed.Its bitterness and wrath measure the greatness of the\nlove that was wounded.The mutual personal services of Washington and\nPaine had continued from the beginning of the American revolution to the\ntime of Paine\'s departure for Europe in 1787.Although he recognized, as\nWashington himself did, the commander\'s mistakes Paine had magnified\nhis successes; his all-powerful pen defended him against loud charges\non account of the retreat to the Delaware, and the failures near\nPhiladelphia.In those days what "Common Sense" wrote was accepted\nas the People\'s verdict.It is even doubtful whether the proposal to\nsupersede Washington might not have succeeded but for Paine\'s fifth\n_Crisis_.*\n\n     * "When a party was forming, in the latter end of seventy-\n     seven and beginning of seventy-eight, of which John Adams\n     was one, to remove Mr.Washington from the command of the\n     army, on the complaint that he did nothing, I wrote the\n     fifth number of the Crisis, and published it at Lancaster\n     (Congress then being at Yorktown, in Pennsylvania), to ward\n     off that meditated blow; for though I well knew that the\n     black times of seventy-six were the natural consequence of\n     his want of military judgment in the choice of positions\n     into which the army was put about New York and New Jersey, I\n     could see no possible advantage, and nothing but mischief,\n     that could arise by distracting the army into parties, which\n     would have been the case had the intended motion gone on."--\n     Paine\'s Letter iii to the People of the United States\n     (1802).The personal relations between the two had been even affectionate.We\nfind Paine consulting him about his projected publications at little\noyster suppers in his own room; and Washington giving him one of his\ntwo overcoats, when Paine\'s had been stolen.Such incidents imply many\nothers never made known; but they are represented in a terrible epigram\nfound among Paine\'s papers,--"Advice to the statuary who is to execute\nthe statue of Washington."Take from the mine the coldest, hardest stone,\n     It needs no fashion: it is Washington.But if you chisel, let the stroke be rude,\n     And on his heart engrave--Ingratitude."Washington being dead, old memories may\nhave risen to restrain him; and he had learned more of the treacherous\ninfluences around the great man which had poisoned his mind towards\nother friends besides himself.For his pamphlet he had no apology to\nmake.It was a thing inevitable, volcanic, and belongs to the history of\na period prolific in intrigues, of which both Washington and Paine were\nvictims."THE AGE OF REASON"\n\nThe reception which the "Age of Reason" met is its sufficient\njustification.The chief priests and preachers answered it with personal\nabuse and slander, revealing by such fruits the nature of their tree,\nand confessing the feebleness of its root, either in reason or human\naffection.Lucian, in his "[--Greek--]" represents the gods as invisibly present\nat a debate, in Athens, on their existence.Damis, who argues from the\nevils of the world that there are no gods, is answered by Timocles, a\ntheological professor with large salary.The gods feel doleful, as the\nargument goes against them, until their champion breaks out against\nDamis,--"You blasphemous villain, you!The\nchief of the gods takes courage, and exclaims: "Well done, Timocles!Begin, to reason and you\nwill be dumb as a fish."So was it in the age when the Twilight of the Gods was brought on by\nfaith in the Son of Man.Not very different was it when this Son of\nMan, dehumanized by despotism, made to wield the thunderbolts of Jove,\nreached in turn his inevitable Twilight.The man who pointed out the\nnow admitted survivals of Paganism in the despotic system then called\nChristianity, who said, "the church has set up a religion of pomp and\nrevenue in the pretended imitation of a person whose life was\nhumility and poverty," was denounced as a sot and an adulterer.These\naccusations, proved in this work unquestionably false, have accumulated\nfor generations, so that a mountain of prejudice must be tunnelled\nbefore any reader can approach the "Age of Reason" as the work of an\nhonest and devout mind.It is only to irrelevant personalities that allusion is here made.Paine\nwas vehement in his arraignment of Church and Priesthood, and it was\nfair enough for them to strike back with animadversions on Deism and\nInfidelity.But it was no answer to an argument against the antiquity of\nGenesis to call Paine a drunkard, had it been true.This kind of reply\nwas heard chiefly in America.In England it was easy for Paine\'s chief\nantagonist, the Bishop of Llandaff, to rebuke Paine\'s strong language,\nwhen his lordship could sit serenely in the House of Peers with\nknowledge that his opponent was answered with handcuffs for every\nEnglishman who sold his book.But in America, slander had to take the\nplace of handcuffs.Paine is at times too harsh and militant.But in no case does he attack\nany person\'s character.Nor is there anything in his language, wherever\nobjectionable, which I have heard censured when uttered on the side of\northodoxy.It is easily forgotten that Luther desired the execution of\na rationalist, and that Calvin did burn a Socinian.The furious language\nof Protestants against Rome, and of Presbyterians against the English\nChurch, is considered even heroic, like the invective ascribed to\nChrist, "Generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of\nhell!"Although vehement language grates on the ear of an age that\nunderstands the real forces of evolution, the historic sense remembers\nthat moral revolutions have been made with words hard as cannon-balls.It was only when soft phrases about the evil of slavery, which\n"would pass away in God\'s good time," made way for the abolitionist\ndenunciation of the Constitution as "an agreement with hell," that the\nfortress began to fall.In other words, reforms are wrought by those who\nare in earnest.* It is difficult in our time to place one\'s self in\nthe situation of a heretic of Paine\'s time.Darwin, who is buried\nin Westminster, remembered the imprisonment of some educated men for\nopinions far less heretical than his own.egoistic insanity\nappears (1892) to have been inherited by an imperial descendant, and\nshould Germans be presently punished for their religion, as Paine\'s\nearly followers were in England, we shall again hear those words that\nare the "half-battles" preceding victories.* "In writing upon this, as upon every other subject, I\n     speak a language plain and intelligible.I deal not in hints\n     and intimations.I have several reasons for this: first,\n     that I may be clearly understood; secondly, that it may be\n     seen I am in earnest; and thirdly, because it is an affront\n     to truth to treat falsehood with complaisance."--Paine\'s\n     reply to Bishop Watson.There is even greater difficulty in the appreciation by one generation\nof the inner sense of the language of a past one.The common notion\nthat Paines "Age of Reason" abounds in "vulgarity" is due to the lack\nof literary culture in those--probably few--who have derived that\nimpression from its perusal.It is the fate of all genius potent enough\nto survive a century that its language will here and there seem coarse.The thoughts of Boccaccio, Rabelais, Shakespeare,--whose works are\ncommonly expurgated,--are so modern that they are not generally granted\nthe allowances conceded to writers whose ideas are as antiquated as\ntheir words.Only the instructed minds can set their classic nudities in\nthe historic perspective that reveals their innocency and value.Paine\'s\nbook has done as much to modify human belief as any ever written.It is\none of the very few religious works of the last century which survives\nin unsectarian circulation.It requires a scholarly perception to\nrecognize in its occasional expressions, by some called "coarse," the\nsimple Saxon of Nor-folkshire.Similar expressions abound in pious\nbooks of the time; they are not censured, because they are not read.Priestley--found no\nfault with Paine\'s words, though the former twice accuses his assertions\nas "indecent."In both cases, however, Paine is pointing out some\nbiblical triviality or indecency--or what he conceived such.I have\nbefore me original editions of both Parts of the "Age of Reason" printed\nfrom Paine\'s manuscripts.Part First may be read by the most prudish\nparent to a daughter, without an omission.In Part Second six or seven\nsentences might be omitted by the parent, where the writer deals,\nwithout the least prurience, with biblical narratives that can hardly be\ndaintily touched.Paine would have been astounded at the suggestion of\nany impropriety in his expressions.He passes over four-fifths of the\npassages in the Bible whose grossness he might have cited in support of\nhis objection to its immorality."Obscenity," he says, "in matters of\nfaith, however wrapped up, is always a token of fable and imposture; for\nit is necessary to our serious belief in God that we do not connect it\nwith stories that run, as this does, into ludicrous interpretations.The\nstory [of the miraculous conception] is, upon the face of it, the same\nkind of story as that of Jupiter and Leda."By R. Llandaff" [Dr.Another fostered prejudice supposes "The Age of Reason" largely made up\nof scoffs.The Bishop of Llandaff, in his reply to Paine, was impressed\nby the elevated Theism of the work, to portions of which he ascribed\n"a philosophical sublimity."Watson apparently tried to constrain\nhis ecclesiastical position into English fair play, so that his actual\nfailures to do so were especially misleading, as many knew Paine only as\nrepresented by this eminent antagonist.For instance, the Bishop says,\n"Moses you term a coxcomb, etc."But Paine, commenting on Numbers xii.,\n3, "Moses was very meek, above all men," had argued that Moses could\nnot have written the book, for "If Moses said this of himself he was a\ncoxcomb."Again the Bishop says Paine terms Paul "a fool."But Paine had\nquoted from Paul, "\'Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened\nexcept it die.\'To which [he says] one might reply in his own language,\nand say, \'Thou fool, Paul, that which thou sowest is not quickened\nexcept it die not.\'"No intellect that knows the law of literature, that deep answers only\nunto deep, can suppose that the effect of Paine\'s "Age of Reason," on\nwhich book the thirty years\' war for religious freedom in England was\nwon, after many martyrdoms, came from a scoffing or scurrilous work.It\nis never Paine\'s object to raise a laugh; if he does so it is because\nof the miserable baldness of the dogmas, and the ignorant literalism,\nconsecrated in the popular mind of his time.Through page after page he\nperuses the Heavens, to him silently declaring the glory of God, and it\nis not laughter but awe when he asks, "From whence then could arise the\nsolitary and strange conceit, that the Almighty, who had millions of\nworlds equally dependent on his protection, should quit the care of all\nthe rest, and come to die in our world, because, they say, one man and\none woman had eaten an apple!"In another work Paine finds allegorical truth in the legend of Eden.The\ncomparative mythlogists of to-day, with many sacred books of the East,\ncan find mystical meaning and beauty in many legends of the Bible\nwherein Paine could see none, but it is because of their liberation by\nthe rebels of last century from bondage to the pettiness of literalism.Paine sometimes exposes an absurdity with a taste easily questionable by\na generation not required like his own to take such things under foot\nof the letter.But his spirit is never flippant, and the sentences that\nmight so seem to a casual reader are such as Browning defended in his\n"Christmas Eve.""If any blames me,\n     Thinking that merely to touch in brevity\n     The topics I dwell on, were unlawful--\n     Or, worse, that I trench, with undue levity,\n     On the bounds of the Holy and the awful,\n     I praise the heart, and pity the head of him,\n     And refer myself to Thee, instead of him;\n     Who head and heart alike discernest,\n     Looking below light speech we utter,\n     When the frothy spume and frequent sputter\n     Prove that the soul\'s depths boil in earnest!"James Martineau, whose reverential spirit no one can question,\nonce raised a smile in his audience, of which the present writer was\none, by saying that the account of the temptation of Jesus, if true,\nmust have been reported by himself, or "by the only other party\npresent."Any allusion to the devil in our day excites a smile.But it\nwas not so in Paine\'s day, when many crossed themselves while speaking\nof this dark prince.Paine has "too much respect for the moral character\nof Christ" to suppose that he told the story of the devil showing him\nall the kingdoms of the world."How happened it that he did not discover\nAmerica; or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any\ninterest?"This is not flippancy; it was by following the inkstand\nLuther threw at the devil with equally vigorous humor that the grotesque\nfigure was eliminated, leaving the reader of to-day free to appreciate\nthe profound significance of the Temptation.How free Paine is from any disposition to play to pit or gallery, any\nmore than to dress circle, is shown in his treatment of the Book of\nJonah.It is not easy to tell the story without exciting laughter;\nindeed the proverbial phrases for exaggeration,--"a whale," a "fish\nstory,"--probably came from Jonah.He says,\n"it would have approached nearer to the idea of a miracle if Jonah had\nswallowed the whale"; but this is merely in passing to an argument that\nmiracles, in the early world, would hardly have represented Divinity.Had the fish cast up Jonah in the streets of Nineveh the people would\nprobably have been affrighted, and fancied them both devils.But in the\nsecond Part of the work there is a very impressive treatment of the Book\nof Jonah.This too is introduced with a passing smile--"if credulity\ncould swallow Jonah and the whale it could swallow anything."But it\nis precisely to this supposed "scoffer" that we owe the first\ninterpretation of the profound and pathetic significance of the book,\nlost sight of in controversies about its miracle.Paine anticipates Baur\nin pronouncing it a poetical work of Gentile origin.He finds in it the\nsame lesson against intolerance contained in the story of the reproof of\nAbraham for piously driving the suffering fire-worshipper from his tent.(This story is told by the Persian Saadi, who also refers to Jonah: "And\nnow the whale swallowed Jonah: the sun set.")In the prophet mourning\nfor his withered gourd, while desiring the destruction of a city, Paine\nfinds a satire; in the divine rebuke he hears the voice of a true\nGod, and one very different from the deity to whom the Jews ascribed\nmassacres.The same critical acumen is shown in his treatment of the\nBook of Job, which he believes to be also of Gentile origin, and much\nadmires.The large Paine Mythology cleared aside, he who would learn the\ntruth about this religious teacher will find in his way a misleading\nliterature of uncritical eulogies.Indeed the pious prejudices against\nPaine have largely disappeared, as one may see by comparing the earlier\nwith the later notices of him in religious encyclopaedias.But though he\nis no longer placed in an infernal triad as in the old hymn--"The world,\nthe devil, and Tom Paine"--and his political services are now candidly\nrecognized, he is still regarded as the propagandist of a bald\nilliterate deism.This, which is absurdly unhistorical, Paine having\nbeen dealt with by eminent critics of his time as an influence among the\neducated, is a sequel to his long persecution.For he was relegated to\nthe guardianship of an unlearned and undiscriminating radicalism, little\nable to appreciate the niceties of his definitions, and was gilded by\nits defensive commonplaces into a figurehead.Paine therefore has now\nto be saved from his friends more perhaps than from his enemies.It has\nbeen shown on a former page that his governmental theories were of a\ntype peculiar in his time.Though such writers as Spencer, Frederic\nHarrison, Bagehot, and Dicey have familiarized us with his ideas, few of\nthem have the historic perception which enables Sir George Trevelyan\nto recognize Paine\'s connection with them.It must now be added that\nPaine\'s religion was of a still more peculiar type.He cannot be classed\nwith deists of the past or theists of the present.Instead of being\nthe mere iconoclast, the militant assailant of Christian beliefs, the\n"infidel" of pious slang, which even men who should know better suppose,\nhe was an exact thinker, a slow and careful writer, and his religious\nideas, developed through long years, require and repay study.The dedication of "The Age of Reason" places the work under the\n"protection" of its authors fellow-citizens of the United States.To-day\nthe trust comes to many who really are such as Paine supposed all of his\ncountrymen to be,--just and independent lovers of truth and right.We shall see that his trust was not left altogether unfulfilled by\na multitude of his contemporaries, though they did not venture to do\njustice to the man.Paine had idealized his countrymen, looking from\nhis prison across three thousand miles.But, to that vista of space, a\ncentury of time had to be added before the book which fanatical Couthon\nsuppressed, and the man whom murderous Barrere sentenced to death, could\nboth be fairly judged by educated America."The Age of Reason" is in two Parts, published in successive years.These divisions are interesting as memorials of the circumstances\nunder which they were written and published,--in both cases with death\nevidently at hand.But taking the two Parts as one work, there appears\nto my own mind a more real division: a part written by Paine\'s century,\nand another originating from himself.Each of these has an important and\ntraceable evolution.I. The first of these divisions may be considered, fundementally, as\na continuation of the old revolution against arbitrary authority.Carlyle\'s humor covers a profound insight when he remarks that Paine,\nhaving freed America with his "Common Sense," was resolved to free this\nwhole world, and perhaps the other!All the authorities were and are\ninterdependent."If thou release this man thou art not Caesar\'s friend,"\ncried the Priest to Pilate.The proconsul must face the fact that in\nJudea Caesarism rests on the same foundation with Jahvism.Authority\nleans on authority; none can stand alone.It is still a question whether\npolitical revolutions cause or are caused by religious revolutions.Buckle maintained that the French Revolution was chiefly due to the\nprevious overthrow of spiritual authority; Rocquain, that the political\n_regime_ was shaken before the philosophers arose.* In England religious\nchanges seem to have usually followed those of a political character,\nnot only in order of time, but in character.In beginning the "Age of\nReason," Paine says:\n\n     * Felix Rocquain\'s fine work,  L\'Esprit revolutionnaire\n     avant la Revolution," though not speculative, illustrates\n     the practical nature of revolution,--an uncivilized and\n     often retrograde form of evolution."Soon after I had published the pamphlet \'Common Sense\' in America I saw\nthe exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government\nwould be followed by a revolution in the system of religion.The\nadulterous connection of church and state, wherever it had taken place,\nwhether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, had so effectually prohibited by\npains and penalties every discussion upon established creeds, and upon\nfirst principles of religion, that until the system of government should\nbe changed those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before\nthe world; but that whenever this should be done a revolution in the\nsystem of religion would follow.Human inventions and priestcraft\nwould be detected; and man would return to the pure, unmixed, and\nunadulterated belief of one God and no more."The historical continuity of the critical negations of Paine with the\npast is represented in his title.The Revolution of 1688,--the secular\narm transferring the throne from one family to another,--brought the\nmonarchical superstition into doubt; straightway the Christian authority\nwas shaken.One hundred years before Paine\'s book, appeared Charles Blount\'s\n"Oracles of Reason."Macaulay describes Blount as the head of a small\nschool of "infidels," troubled with a desire to make converts; his\ndelight was to worry the priests by asking them how light existed before\nthe sun was made, and where Eve found thread to stitch her fig-leaves.But to this same Blount, Macaulay is constrained to attribute\nemancipation of the press in England.Blount\'s title was taken up in America by Ethan Allen, leader of the\n"Green Mountain Boys."Allen\'s "Oracles of Reason" is forgotten; he is\nremembered by his demand (1775) for the surrender of Fort Ticonderoga,\n"in the name of Jehovah and the Continental Congress."The last five\nwords of this famous demand would have been a better title for the\nbook.It introduces the nation to a Jehovah qualified by the\nContinental Congress.Ethan Allen\'s deity is no longer a King of kings:\narbitrariness has disappeared; men are summoned to belief in a governor\nadministering laws inherent in the constitution of a universe co-eternal\nwith himself, and with which he is interdependent.His administration\nis not for any divine glory, but, in anticipation of our constitutional\npreamble, to "promote the general welfare."The old Puritan alteration\nin the Lord\'s Prayer, "Thy Commonwealth come!"would in Allen\'s church\nhave been "Thy Republic come!"That is, had he admitted prayer, which\nto an Executive is of course out of place.It must not, however, be\nsupposed that Ethan Allen is conscious that his system is inspired\nby the Revolution.His book is a calm, philosophical analysis of New\nEngland theology and metaphysics; an attempt to clear away the ancient\nbiblical science and set Newtonian science in its place; to found what\nhe conceives "Natural Religion."In editing his "Account of Arnold\'s Campaign in Quebec," John Joseph\nHenry says in a footnote that Paine borrowed from Allen.But the aged\nman was, in his horror of Paine\'s religion, betrayed by his memory.The\nonly connection between the books runs above the consciousness of either\nwriter.There was necessarily some resemblance between negations dealing\nwith the same narratives, but a careful comparison of the books leaves\nme doubtful whether Paine ever read Allen.His title may have been\nsuggested by Blount, whose "Oracles of Reason" was in the library of\nhis assistant at Bor-dentown, John Hall.The works are distinct in aim,\nproducts of different religious climes.Allen is occupied mainly with\nthe metaphysical, Paine with quite other, aspects of their common\nsubject.There is indeed a conscientious originality in the freethinkers\nwho successively availed themselves of the era of liberty secured by\nBlount.Collins, Bolingbroke, Hume, Toland, Chubb, Woolston, Tindal,\nMiddleton, Annet, Gibbon,--each made an examination for himself, and\nrepresents a distinct chapter in the religious history of England.Annet\'s "Free Inquirer," aimed at enlightenment of the lower classes,\nproved that free thought was tolerated only as an aristocratic\nprivilege; the author was pilloried, just thirty years before the\ncheapening of the "Rights of Man" led to Paine\'s prosecution.Probably\nMorgan did more than any of the deists to prepare English ground for\nPaine\'s sowing, by severely criticising the Bible by a standard\nof civilized ethics, so far as ethics were civilized in the early\neighteenth century.But none of these writers touched the deep chord of\nreligious feeling in, the people.The English-speaking people were timid\nabout venturing too much on questions which divided the learned, and\nwere content to express their protest against the worldliness of the\nChurch and faithlessness to the lowly Saviour, by following pietists and\nenthusiasts.The learned clergy, generally of the wealthy classes, were\nlargely deistical, but conservative.They gradually perceived that the\npolitical and the theological authority rested on the same foundation.So between the deists and the Christians there was, as Leslie Stephen\nsays, a "comfortable compromise, which held together till Wesley from\none side, and Thomas Paine from another, forced more serious thoughts on\nthe age."*\n\n     * "History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century."While "The Age of Reason" is thus, in one aspect, the product of its\ntime, the renewal of an old siege--begun far back indeed as Celsus,--its\nintellectual originality is none the less remarkable.Paine is\nmore complete master of the comparative method than Tindal in his\n"Christianity as old as the Creation."In his studies of "Christian\nMythology" (his phrase), one is surprised by anticipations of Baur\nand Strauss.These are all the more striking by reason of his\nhomely illustrations.Thus, in discussing the liabilities of ancient\nmanuscripts to manipulation, he mentions in his second Part that in the\nfirst, printed less than two years before, there was already a sentence\nhe never wrote; and contrasts this with the book of nature wherein\nno blade of grass can be imitated or altered.* He distinguishes the\nhistorical Jesus from the mythical Christ with nicety, though none had\npreviously done this.He is more discriminating than the early deists\nin his explanations of the scriptural marvels which he discredits.There\nwas not the invariable alternative of imposture with which the orthodoxy\nof his time had been accustomed to deal.He does indeed suspect Moses\nwith his rod of conjuring, and thinks no better of those who pretended\nknowledge of future events; but the incredible narratives are\ntraditions, fables, and occasionally "downright lies."* The sentence imported into Paine\'s Part First is: "The\n     book of Luke was carried by one voice only."I find the\n     words added as a footnote in the Philadelphia edition, 1794,\n     p.While Paine in Paris was utilizing the ascent of the\n     footnote to his text, Dr.Priestley in Pennsylvania was\n     using it to show Paine\'s untrustworthiness.("Letters to a\n     Philosophical Unbeliever," p.But it would appear,\n     though neither discovered it, that Paine\'s critic was the\n     real offender.In quoting the page, before answering it,\n     Priestley incorporated in the text the footnote of an\n     American editor.Priestley could not of course imagine such\n     editorial folly, but all the same the reader may here see\n     the myth-insect already building the Paine Mythology."It is not difficult to discover the progress by which even simple\nsupposition, with the aid of credulity, will in time grow into a lie,\nand at last be told as a fact; and wherever we can find a charitable\nreason for a thing of this kind we ought not to indulge a severe one."Paine\'s use of the word "lies" in this connection is an archaism.Carlyle told me that his father always spoke of such tales as "The\nArabian Nights" as "downright lies"; by which he no doubt meant fables\nwithout any indication of being such, and without any moral.Elsewhere\nPaine uses "lie" as synonymous with "fabulous"; when he means by the\nword what it would now imply, "wilful" is prefixed.In the Gospels he\nfinds "inventions" of Christian Mythologists--tales founded on\nvague rumors, relics of primitive works of imagination mistaken for\nhistory,--fathered upon disciples who did not write them.His treatment of the narrative of Christ\'s resurrection may be selected\nas an example of his method.He rejects Paul\'s testimony, and his five\nhundred witnesses to Christ\'s reappearance, because the evidence did not\nconvince Paul himself, until he was struck by lightning, or otherwise\nconverted.He finds disagreements in the narratives of the gospels,\nconcerning the resurrection, which, while proving there was no concerted\nimposture, show that the accounts were not written by witnesses of the\nevents; for in this case they would agree more nearly.He finds in the\nnarratives of Christ\'s reappearances,--"suddenly coming in and going out\nwhen doors are shut, vanishing out of sight and appearing again,"--and\nthe lack of details, as to his dress, etc., the familiar signs of a\nghost-story, which is apt to be told in different ways."Stories of this\nkind had been told of the assassination of Julius Caesar, not many years\nbefore, and they generally have their origin in violent deaths, or in\nthe execution of innocent persons.In cases of this kind compassion\nlends its aid, and benevolently stretches the story.It goes on a little\nand a little further, till it becomes a most certain truth.Once start\na ghost, and credulity fills up its life and assigns the cause of its\nappearance."The moral and religious importance of the resurrection\nwould thus be an afterthought.The secrecy and privacy of the alleged\nappearances of Christ after death are, he remarks, repugnant to the\nsupposed end of convincing the world.*\n\n     * In 1778 Lessing set forth his "New Hypothesis of the\n     Evangelists," that they had independently built on a basis\n     derived from some earlier Gospel of the Hebrews,--a theory\n     now confirmed by the recovered fragments of that lost\n     Memoir, collected by Dr.It is tolerably certain that Paine was unacquainted with\n     Lessing\'s work, when he became convinced, by variations in\n     the accounts of the resurrection, that some earlier\n     narrative "became afterwards the foundation of the four\n     books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,"--these\n     being, traditionally eye-witnesses.Paine admits the power of the deity to make a revelation.He therefore\ndeals with each of the more notable miracles on its own evidence,\nadhering to his plan of bringing the Bible to judge the Bible.Such an\ninvestigation, written with lucid style and quaint illustration, without\none timid or uncandid sentence, coming from a man whose services and\nsacrifices for humanity were great, could not have failed to give the\n"Age of Reason" long life, even had these been its only qualities.Four\nyears before the book appeared, Burke said in Parliament: "Who, born\nwithin the last forty years, has read one word of Collins, and\nToland, and Tindal, and Chubb, and Morgan, and the whole race who call\nthemselves freethinkers?"Paine was, in one sense, of this intellectual\npedigree; and had his book been only a digest and expansion of previous\nnegative criticisms, and a more thorough restatement of theism, these\ncould have given it but a somewhat longer life; the "Age of Reason" must\nhave swelled Burke\'s list of forgotten freethinking books.But there was\nan immortal soul in Paine\'s book.It is to the consideration of this its\nunique life, which has defied the darts of criticism for a century, and\nsurvived its own faults and limitations, that we now turn.Paine\'s book is the uprising of the human heart against the\nReligion of Inhumanity.This assertion may be met with a chorus of denials that there was, or\nis, in Christendom any Religion of Inhumanity.And, if Thomas Paine is\nenjoying the existence for which he hoped, no heavenly anthem would\nbe such music in his ears as a chorus of stormiest denials from earth\nreporting that the Religion of Inhumanity is so extinct as to be\nincredible.Nevertheless, the Religion of Inhumanity did exist, and\nit defended against Paine a god of battles, of pomp, of wrath; an\ninstigator of race hatreds and exterminations; an establisher of\nslavery; a commander of massacres in punishment of theological beliefs;\na sender of lying spirits to deceive men, and of destroying angels to\nafflict them with plagues; a creator of millions of human beings under\na certainty of their eternal torture by devils and fires of his own\ncreation.This apotheosis of Inhumanity is here called a religion,\nbecause it managed to survive from the ages of savagery by violence of\nsuperstition, to gain a throne in the Bible by killing off all who did\nnot accept its authority to the letter, and because it was represented\nby actual inhumanities.The great obstruction of Science and\nCivilization was that the Bible was quoted in sanction of war, crusades\nagainst alien religions, murders for witchcraft, divine right of\ndespots, degradation of reason, exaltation of credulity, punishment of\nopinion and unbiblical discovery, contempt of human virtues and human\nnature, and costly ceremonies before an invisible majesty, which,\nexacted from the means of the people, were virtually the offering of\nhuman sacrifices.There had been murmurs against this consecrated Inhumanity through the\nages, dissentients here and there; but the Revolution began with Paine.He was just the one man in the world who had\nundergone the training necessary for this particular work.The higher clergy, occupied with the old textual controversy, proudly\ninstructing Paine in Hebrew or Greek idioms, little realized their\nignorance in the matter now at issue.Their ignorance had been too\ncarefully educated to even imagine the University in which words are\nthings, and things the word, and the many graduations passed between\nThetford Quaker meeting and the French Convention.What to scholastics,\nfor whom humanities meant ancient classics, were the murders and\nmassacres of primitive tribes, declared to be the word and work of God?But Paine had seen that\nwar-god at his work.In childhood he had seen the hosts of the Defender\nof the Faith as, dripping with the blood of Culloden and Inverness, they\nmarched through Thetford; in manhood he had seen the desolations wrought\n"by the grace of" that deity to the royal invader of America; he\nhad seen the massacres ascribed to Jahve repeated in France, while\nRobespierre and Couthon were establishing worship of an infra-human\ndeity.By sorrow, poverty, wrong, through long years, amid revolutions\nand death-agonies, the stay-maker\'s needle had been forged into a pen of\nlightning.No Oxonian conductor could avert that stroke, which was\nnot at mere irrationalities, but at a huge idol worshipped with human\nsacrifices.The creation of the heart of Paine, historically traceable,\nis so wonderful, its outcome seems so supernatural, that in earlier ages\nhe might have been invested with fable, like some Avatar.Of some such\nman, no doubt, the Hindu poets dreamed in their picture of young Arguna\n(in the _Bhagavatgita_).The warrior, borne to the battlefield in his\nchariot, finds arrayed against him his kinsmen, friends, preceptors.He bids his charioteer pause; he cannot fight those he loves.His\ncharioteer turns: \'t is the radiant face of divine Chrishna, his\nSaviour!Even He has led him to this grievous contention with kinsmen,\nand those to whose welfare he was devoted.Chrishna instructs his\ndisciple that the war is an illusion; it is the conflict by which,\nfrom age to age, the divine life in the world is preserved."This\nimperishable devotion I declared to the sun, the sun delivered it to\nManu, Manu to Ikshaku; handed down from one to another it was studied by\nthe royal sages.In the lapse of time that devotion was lost.It is even\nthe same discipline which I this day communicate to thee, for thou\nart my servant and my friend.Both thou and I have passed through many\nbirths.Mine are known to me; thou knowest not of thine.I am made\nevident by my own power: as often as there is a decline of virtue, and\nan insurrection of wrong and injustice in the world, I appear."Paine could not indeed know his former births; and, indeed, each former\nself of his--Wycliffe, Fox, Roger Williams--was sectarianized beyond\nrecognition.He could hardly see kinsmen in the Unitarians, who were\nespecially eager to disown the heretic affiliated on them by opponents;\nnor in the Wesleyans, though in him was the blood of their apostle, who\ndeclared salvation a present life, free to all.In a profounder sense,\nPaine was George Fox.Here was George Fox disowned, freed from his\naccidents, naturalized in the earth and humanized in the world of men.Paine is explicable only by the intensity of his Quakerism, consuming\nits own traditions as once the church\'s ceremonies and sacraments.On\nhim, in Thetford meeting-house, rolled the burden of that Light that\nenlighteneth every man, effacing distinctions of rank, race, sex, making\nall equal, clearing away privilege, whether of priest or mediator,\nsubjecting all scriptures to its immediate illumination.This faith was a fearful heritage to carry, even in childhood, away from\nthe Quaker environment which, by mixture with modifying "survivals," in\nhabit and doctrine, cooled the fiery gospel for the average tongue.The intermarriage of Paine\'s father with a family in the English Church\nbrought the precocious boy\'s Light into early conflict with his kindred,\nhis little lamp being still fed in the meeting-house.A child brought up\nwithout respect for the conventional symbols of religion, or even with\npious antipathy to them, is as if born with only one spiritual skin; he\nwill bleed at a touch."I well remember, when about seven or eight years of age, hearing\na sermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great devotee of the\nChurch, upon the subject of what is called _redemption by the death of\nthe Son of God_.After the sermon was ended I went into the garden,\nand as I was going down the garden steps, (for I perfectly remember the\nspot), I revolted at the recollection of what I had heard, and thought\nto myself that it was making God Almighty act like a passionate man,\nthat killed his son when he could not revenge himself in any other way;\nand, as I was sure a man would be hanged that did such a thing, I could\nnot see for what purpose they preached such sermons.This was not one of\nthat kind of thoughts that had anything in it of childish levity; it was\nto me a serious reflection, arising from the idea I had, that God was\ntoo good to do such an action, and also too almighty to be under any\nnecessity of doing it.I believe in the same manner at this moment; and\nI moreover believe that any system of religion that has anything in it\nwhich shocks the mind of a child, cannot be a true system."The child took his misgivings out into the garden; he would not by a\ndenial shock his aunt Cocke\'s faith as his own had been shocked.For\nmany years he remained silent in his inner garden, nor ever was drawn\nout of it until he found the abstract dogma of the death of God\'s Son an\naltar for sacrificing men, whom he reverenced as all God\'s sons.What he\nused to preach at Dover and Sandwich cannot now be known.His ignorance\nof Greek and Latin, the scholastic "humanities," had prevented his\nbecoming a clergyman, and introduced him to humanities of another kind.His mission was then among the poor and ignorant.*\n\n     * "Old John Berry, the late Col.Hay\'s servant, told me he\n     knew Paine very well when he was at Dover--had heard him\n     preach there--thought him a staymaker by trade."--W.Weedon,\n     of Glynde, quoted in Notes and Queries (London), December\n     29, 1866.Sixteen years later he is in Philadelphia, attending the English Church,\nin which he had been confirmed.There were many deists in that Church,\nwhose laws then as now were sufficiently liberal to include them.In his\n"Common Sense" (published January 10, 1776) Paine used the reproof of\nIsrael (I. Samuel) for desiring a King.John Adams, a Unitarian and\nmonarchist, asked him if he really believed in the inspiration of the\nOld Testament.Paine said he did not, and intended at a later period to\npublish his opinions on the subject.John went to the garden.There was nothing inconsistent in\nPaine\'s believing that a passage confirmed by his own Light was a\ndivine direction, though contained in a book whose alleged inspiration\nthroughout he did not accept.Before\nthat, soon after his arrival in the country, when he found African\nSlavery supported by the Old Testament, Paine had repudiated the\nauthority of that book; he declares it abolished by "Gospel light,"\nwhich includes man-stealing among the greatest crimes.When, a year\nlater, on the eve of the Revolution, he writes "Common Sense," he has\nanother word to say about religion, and it is strictly what the human\nneed of the hour demands.Whatever his disbeliefs, he could never\nsacrifice human welfare to them, any more than he would, suffer dogmas\nto sacrifice the same.It would have been a grievous sacrifice of the\ngreat cause of republican independence, consequently, of religious\nliberty, had he introduced a theological controversy at the moment\nwhen it was of vital importance that the sects should rise above their\npartition-walls and unite for a great common end.The Quakers, deistical\nas they were, preserved religiously the separatism once compulsory; and\nPaine proved himself the truest Friend among them when he was "moved"\nby the Spirit of Humanity, for him at length the Holy Spirit, to utter\n(1776) his brave cheer for Catholicity."As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of all\ngovernments to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know\nof no other business which government hath to do therewith.Let a man\nthrow aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle,\nwhich the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and\nhe will be at once delivered of his fears on that head.Suspicion is the\ncompanion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society.For myself,\nI fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty\nthat there should be a diversity of religious opinions amongst us: it\naffords a larger field for our Christian kindness.Were we all of\none way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter\nfor probation; and, on this liberal principle, I look on the various\ndenominations among us to be like children of the same family, differing\nonly in what is called their Christian names."There was no pedantry whatever about Paine, this obedient son of\nHumanity.He would defend Man against men, against sects and parties;\nhe would never quarrel about the botanical label of a tree bearing such\nfruits as the Declaration of Independence.But no man better knew the\npower of words, and that a botanical error may sometimes result in\ndestructive treatment of the tree.For this reason he censured the\nQuakers for opposing the Revolution on the ground that, in the words\nof their testimony (1776), "the setting up and putting down kings and\ngovernments is God\'s peculiar prerogative."Kings, he answers, are not\nremoved by miracles, but by just such means as the Americans were using.Charles, then, died not by the hands of\nman; and should the present proud imitator of him come to the same\nuntimely end, the writers and publishers of the Testimony are bound, by\nthe doctrine it contains, to applaud the fact."In his "Epistle to Quakers" he speaks of the\ndispersion of the Jews as "foretold by our Saviour."In his famous first\n_Crisis_ he exhorts the Americans not to throw "the burden of the day\nupon Providence, but\'show your faith by your works,\' that God may bless\nyou."For in those days there was visible to such eyes as his, as to\nanti-slavery eyes in our civil war,\n\n     "A fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel."The Republic, not American but Human, became Paine\'s religion."Divine\nProvidence intends this country to be the asylum of persecuted\nvirtue from every quarter of the globe."So he had written before the\nDeclaration of Independence.In 1778 he finds that there still survives\nsome obstructive superstition among English churchmen in America about\nthe connection of Protestant Christianity with the King.In his seventh\n_Crisis_(November 21, 1778) he wrote sentences inspired by his new\nconception of religion."In a Christian and philosophical sense, mankind seem to have stood\nstill at individual civilization, and to retain as nations all the\noriginal rudeness of nature.... As individuals we profess ourselves\nChristians, but as nations we are heathens, Romans, and what not.I\nremember the late Admiral Saunders declaring in the House of Commons,\nand that in the time of peace, \'That the city of Madrid laid in ashes\nwas not a sufficient atonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder\nof an English sloop of war.\'...The arm of Britain has been spoken of as\nthe arm of the Almighty, and she has lived of late as if she thought\nthe whole world created for her diversion.Her politics, instead\nof civilizing, has tended to brutalize mankind, and under the vain\nunmeaning title of \'Defender of the Faith,\' she has made war like an\nIndian on the Religion of Humanity."\'Thus, forty years before Auguste Comte sat, a youth of twenty, at the\nfeet of Saint Simon, learning the principles now known as "The Religion\nof Humanity,"* Thomas Paine had not only minted the name, but with it\nthe idea of international civilization, in which nations are to treat\neach other as gentlemen in private life.National honor was, he said,\nconfused with "bullying"; but "that which is the best character for an\nindividual is the best character for a nation."The great and pregnant\nidea was, as in the previous instances, occasional.It was a sentence\npassed upon the "Defender-of-the-Faith" superstition, which detached\nfaith from humanity, and had pressed the Indian\'s tomahawk into the\nhands of Jesus.Thaddeus B. Wakeman, an eminent representative of the\n     "Religion of Humanity," writes me that he has not found this\n     phrase in any work earlier than Paine\'s _Crisis_, vii.At the close of the American Revolution there appeared little need for\na religious reformation.The people were happy, prosperous, and, there\nbeing no favoritism toward any sect under the new state constitutions,\nbut perfect equality and freedom, the Religion of Humanity meant\nsheathing of controversial swords also.It summoned every man to lend a\nhand in repairing the damages of war, and building the new nationality.Paine therefore set about constructing his iron bridge of thirteen\nsymbolic ribs, to overleap the ice-floods and quicksands of rivers.His\nassistant in this work, at Bordentown, New Jersey, John Hall, gives us\nin his journal, glimpses of the religious ignorance and fanaticism of\nthat region.But Paine showed no aggressive spirit towards them."My\nemployer," writes Hall (1786), "has _Common Sense_ enough to disbelieve\nmost of the common systematic theories of Divinity, but does not seem\nto establish any for himself."In all of his intercourse with Hall (a\nUnitarian just from England), and his neighbors, there is no trace\nof any disposition to deprive any one of a belief, or to excite any\ncontroversy.Humanity did not demand it, and by that direction he left\nthe people to their weekly toils and Sunday sermons.But when (1787) he was in England, Humanity gave another command.It was\nobeyed in the eloquent pages on religious liberty and equality in "The\nRights of Man."Burke had alarmed the nation by pointing out that the\nRevolution in France had laid its hand on religion.The cry was raised\nthat religion was in danger.Paine then uttered his impressive paradox:\n\n"Toleration is not the opposite of intoleration, but the counterfeit\nof it.The one assumes the right of withholding\nliberty of conscience, and the other of granting it.The one is the pope\narmed with fire and <DW19>, the other is the pope selling or granting\nindulgences.... Toleration by the same assumed authority by which it\ntolerates a man to pay his worship, presumptuously and blasphemously\nsets itself up to tolerate the Almighty to receive it.... Who then art\nthou, vain dust and ashes, by whatever name thou art called, whether a\nking, a bishop, a church or a state, a parliament or anything else, that\nobtrudest thine insignificance between the soul of man and his maker?If he believes not as thou believest, it is a\nproof that thou believest not as he believeth, and there is no earthly\npower can determine between you.... Religion, without regard to names,\nas directing itself from the universal family of mankind to the divine\nobject of all adoration, is man bringing to his maker the fruits of his\nheart; and though these fruits may differ like the fruits of the earth,\nthe grateful tribute of every one is accepted."This, which I condense with reluctance, was the affirmation which the\nReligion of Humanity needed in England.But when he came to sit in the\nFrench Convention a new burden rolled upon him.There was Marat with the\nBible always before him, picking out texts that justified his murders;\nthere were Robespierre and Couthon invoking the God of Nature to\nsanction just such massacres as Marat found in his Bible; and there were\ncrude "atheists" consecrating the ferocities of nature more dangerously\nthan if they had named them Siva, Typhon, or Satan.Paine had published\nthe rights of man for men; but here human hearts and minds had been\nburied under the superstitions of ages.The great mischief had ensued,\nto use his own words, "by the possession of power before they understood\nprinciples: they earned liberty in words but not in fact" Exhumed\nsuddenly, as if from some Nineveh, resuscitated into semi-conscious\nstrength, they remembered only the methods of the allied inquisitors and\ntyrants they were overthrowing; they knew no justice but vengeance; and\nwhen on crumbled idols they raised forms called "Nature" and "Reason,"\nold idols gained life in the new forms.These were the gods which had\nbut too literally created, by the slow evolutionary force of human\nsacrifices, the new revolutionary priesthood.Their massacres could not\nbe questioned by those who acknowledged the divine hand in the slaughter\nof Canaanites.*\n\n     * On August 10, 1793, there was a sort of communion of the\n     Convention around the statue of Nature, whose breasts were\n     fountains of water.Herault de Sechelles, at that time\n     president, addressed the statue: "Sovereign of the savage\n     and of the enlightened nations, O Nature, this great people,\n     gathered at the first beam of day before thee, is free!It\n     is in thy bosom, it is in thy sacred sources, that it has\n     recovered its rights, that it has regenerated itself after\n     traversing so many ages of error and servitude: it must\n     return to the simplicity of thy ways to rediscover liberty\n     and equality.receive the expression of the\n     eternal attachment of the French people for thy laws; and\n     may the teeming waters gushing from thy breasts, may this\n     pure beverage which refreshed the first human beings,\n     consecrate in this Cup of Fraternity and Equality the vows\n     that France makes thee this day,--the most beautiful that\n     the sun has illumined since it was suspended in the\n     immensity of space."The cup passed around from lip to lip,\n     amid fervent ejaculations.Next year Nature\'s breasts\n     issued Herault\'s blood.The Religion of Humanity again issued its command to its minister.The\n"Age of Reason" was written, in its first form, and printed in French."Couthon," says Lanthenas, "to whom I sent it, seemed offended with me\nfor having translated it"* Couthon raged against the priesthood, but\ncould not tolerate a work which showed vengeance to be atheism, and\ncompassion--not merely for men, but for animals--true worship of God.*  The letter of Lanthenas to Merlin de Thionville, of which\n     the original French is before me, is quoted in an article in\n     Scribner, September, 1880, by Hon.E. B. Washbarne (former\n     Minister to France); it is reprinted in Remsburg\'s\n     compilation of testimonies: "Thomas Paine, the Apostle of\n     Religions and Political Liberty" (1880).135\n     of this volume.On the other hand, Paine\'s opposition to atheism would appear to have\nbrought him into danger from another quarter, in which religion could\nnot be distinguished from priestcraft.In a letter to Samuel Adams Paine\nsays that he endangered his life by opposing the king\'s execution, and\n"a second time by opposing atheism."Those who denounce the "Age of\nReason" may thus learn that red-handed Couthon, who hewed men to pieces\nbefore his Lord, and those who acknowledged no Lord, agreed with\nthem.Under these menaces the original work was as I have inferred,\nsuppressed.But the demand of Humanity was peremptory, and Paine\nre-wrote it all, and more.When it appeared he was a prisoner; his\nlife was in Couthon\'s hands.He had personally nothing to gain by its\npublication--neither wife, child, nor relative to reap benefit by its\nsale.It was published as purely for the good of mankind as any work\never written.Nothing could be more simply true than his declaration,\nnear the close of life:\n\n"As in my political works my motive and object have been to give man an\nelevated sense of his own character, and free him from the slavish and\nsuperstitious absurdity of monarchy and hereditary government, so, in my\npublications on religious subjects, my endeavors have been directed\nto bring man to a right use of the reason that God has given him; to\nimpress on him the great principles of divine morality, justice, and\nmercy, and a benevolent disposition to all men, and to all creatures;\nand to inspire in him a spirit of trust, confidence and consolation, in\nhis Creator, unshackled by the fables of books pretending to be the word\nof God."It is misleading at the present day to speak of Paine as an opponent\nof Christianity.This would be true were Christianity judged by the\nauthorized formulas of any church; but nothing now acknowledged as\nChristianity by enlightened Christians of any denomination was known\nto him.In our time, when the humanizing wave, passing through all\nchurches, drowns old controversies, floats the dogmas, till it seems\nungenerous to quote creeds and confessions in the presence of our\n"orthodox" lovers of man--even "totally depraved" and divinely doomed\nman--the theological eighteenth century is inconceivable.Could one\nwander from any of our churches, unless of the Christian Pagans or\nremote villagers (_pagani_), into those of the last century, he would\nfind himself moving in a wilderness of cinders, with only the plaintive\nsong of John and Charles Wesley to break the solitude.If he would hear\nrecognition of the human Jesus, on whose credit the crowned Christ is\nnow maintained, he would be sharply told that it were a sin to "know\nChrist after the flesh," and must seek such recognition among those\nstoned as infidels.Three noble and pathetic tributes to the Man of\nNazareth are audible from the last century--those of Rousseau, Voltaire,\nand Paine.From its theologians and its pulpits not one!Should the\ntribute of Paine be to-day submitted, without his name, to our most\neminent divines, even to leading American and English Bishops, beside\nany theological estimate of Christ from the same century, the Jesus of\nPaine would be surely preferred.Should our cultured Christian of to-day press beyond those sectarian,\nmiserable controversies of the eighteenth century, known to him now as\ncold ashes, into the seventeenth century, he would find himself in a\ncomparatively embowered land; that is, in England, and in a few oases\nin America--like that of Roger Williams in Rhode Island.In England he\nwould find brain and heart still in harmony, as in Tillotson and South;\nstill more in Bishop Jeremy Taylor, "Shakespeare of divines."He would\nhear this Jeremy reject the notions of original sin and transmitted\nguilt, maintain the "liberty of prophesying," and that none should\nsuffer for conclusions concerning a book so difficult of interpretation\nas the Bible.In those unsophisticated years Jesus and the disciples\nand the Marys still wore about them the reality gained in miracle-plays.What Paine need arise where poets wrote the creed, and men knew the\nJesus of whom Thomas Dekker wrote:\n\n                    "The best of men\n     That e\'er wore earth about him was a sufferer;\n     A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit,\n     The first true gentleman that ever breathed."Dean Swift, whose youth was nourished in that living age, passed into\nthe era of dismal disputes, where he found the churches "dormitories of\nthe living as well as of the dead."Some ten years before Paine\'s birth\nthe Dean wrote: "Since the union of Divinity and Humanity is the great\nArticle of our Religion, \'t is odd to see some clergymen, in their\nwritings of Divinity, wholly devoid of Humanity."Men have, he said,\nenough religion to hate, but not to love.Had the Dean lived to the\nmiddle of the eighteenth century he might have discovered exceptions\nto this holy heartlessness, chiefly among those he had traditionally\nfeared--the Socinians.These, like the Magdalene, were seeking the lost\nhumanity of Jesus.He would have sympathized with Wesley, who escaped\nfrom "dormitories of the living" far enough to publish the Life of a\nSocinian (Firmin), with the brave apology, "I am sick of opinions, give\nme the life."But Socianism, in eagerness to disown its bolder children,\npresently lost the heart of Jesus, and when Paine was recovering it the\nbest of them could not comprehend his separation of the man from the\nmyth.So came on the desiccated Christianity of which Emerson said,\neven among the Unitarians of fifty years ago, "The prayers and even the\ndogmas of our church are like the zodiac of Denderah, wholly insulated\nfrom anything now extant in the life and business of the people."Emerson may have been reading Paine\'s idea that Christ and the Twelve\nwere mythically connected with Sun and Zodiac, this speculation being\nan indication of their distance from the Jesus he tenderly revered.If\nPaine rent the temple-veils of his time, and revealed the stony images\nbehind them, albeit with rudeness, let it not be supposed that those\nforms were akin to the Jesus and the Marys whom skeptical criticism is\nre-incarnating, so that they dwell with us.Outside Paine\'s heart the\nChrist of his time was not more like the Jesus of our time than Jupiter\nwas like the Prometheus he bound on a rock.The English Christ was not\nthe Son of Man, but a Prince of Dogma, bearing handcuffs for all who\nreasoned about him; a potent phantasm that tore honest thinkers\nfrom their families and cast them into outer darkness, because they\ncirculated the works of Paine, which reminded the clergy that the Jesus\neven of their own Bible sentenced those only who ministered not to the\nhungry and naked, the sick and in prison.Mary went back to the bathroom.There the brain had retreated to deistic caves, the heart had\ngone off to "Salvationism" of the time; the churches were given over\nto the formalist and the politician, who carried divine sanction to the\nrepetition of biblical oppressions and massacres by Burke and Pitt.And\nin all the world there had not been one to cry _Sursum Corda_ against\nthe consecrated tyranny until that throb of Paine\'s heart which\nbrought on it the vulture.But to-day, were we not swayed by names and\nprejudices, it would bring on that prophet of the divine humanity, even\nthe Christian dove.Soon after the appearance of Part First of the "Age of Reason" it\nwas expurgated of its negative criticisms, probably by some English\nUnitarians, and published as a sermon, with text from Job xi., 7: "Canst\nthou by searching find out God?Canst thou find out the Almighty to\nperfection?"It was printed anonymously; and were its sixteen pages\nread in any orthodox church to-day it would be regarded as admirable.It might be criticised by left wings as somewhat old-fashioned in the\nwarmth of its theism.It is fortunate that Paine\'s name was not appended\nto this doubtful use of his work, for it would have been a serious\nmisrepresentation.*\n\n     * "A Lecture on the Existence and Attributes of the Deity,\n     as Deduced from a Contemplation of His Works.The copy in my possession is inscribed with pen: "This was\n     J. Joyce\'s copy, and noticed by him as Paine\'s work."It is probable that the\n     suppression of Paine\'s name was in deference to his\n     outlawry, and to the dread, by a sect whose legal position\n     was precarious, of any suspicion of connection with\n     "Painite" principles.That his Religion of Humanity took the deistical form was an\nevolutionary necessity.English deism was not a religion, but at first a\nphilosophy, and afterwards a scientific generalization.Its founder, as\na philosophy, Herbert of Cherbury, had created the matrix in which\nwas formed the Quaker religion of the "inner light," by which Paine\'s\nchildhood was nurtured; its founder as a scientific theory of creation,\nSir Isaac Newton, had determined the matrix in which all unorthodox\nsystems should originate.The real issue was between a sanctified\nancient science and a modern science.The utilitarian English race,\nalways the stronghold of science, had established the freedom of the\nnew deism, which thus became the mould into which all unorthodoxies ran.From the time of Newton, English and American thought and belief have\nsteadily become Unitarian.The dualism of Jesus, the thousand years\nof faith which gave every soul its post in a great war between God\nand Satan, without which there would have been no church, has steadily\nreceded before a monotheism which, under whatever verbal disguises,\nmakes the deity author of all evil.English Deism prevailed only to be\nreconquered into alliance with a tribal god of antiquity, developed\ninto the tutelar deity of Christendom.And this evolution involved the\ntransformation of Jesus into Jehovah, deity of a "chosen" or "elect"\npeople.It was impossible for an apostle of the international republic,\nof the human brotherhood, whose Father was degraded by any notion of\nfavoritism to a race, or to a "first-born son," to accept a name in\nwhich foreign religions had been harried, and Christendom established on\na throne of thinkers\' skulls.The philosophical and scientific deism of\nHerbert and Newton had grown cold in Paine\'s time, but it was detached\nfrom all the internecine figure-heads called gods; it appealed to the\nreason of all mankind; and in that manger, amid the beasts, royal and\nrevolutionary, was cradled anew the divine humanity.Paine wrote "Deism" on his banner in a militant rather than an\naffirmative way.He was aiming to rescue the divine Idea from\ntraditional degradations in order that he might with it confront a\nrevolutionary Atheism defying the celestial monarchy.In a later work,\nspeaking of a theological book, "An Antidote to Deism," he remarks: "An\nantidote to Deism must be Atheism."So far as it is theological, the\n"Age of Reason" was meant to combat Infidelity.It raised before the\nFrench the pure deity of Herbert, of Newton, and other English deists\nwhose works were unknown in France.But when we scrutinize Paine\'s\npositive Theism we find a distinctive nucleus forming within the\nnebulous mass of deistical speculations.Paine recognizes a deity only\nin the astronomic laws and intelligible order of the universe, and in\nthe corresponding reason and moral nature of man.Like Kant, he was\nfilled with awe by the starry heavens and man\'s sense of right*.The\nfirst part of the "Age of Reason" is chiefly astronomical; with those\ncelestial wonders he contrasts such stories as that of Samson and the\nfoxes."When we contemplate the immensity of that Being who directs and\ngoverns the incomprehensible Whole, of which the utmost ken of human\nsight can discover but a part, we ought to feel shame at calling such\npaltry stories the word of God."Then turning to the Atheist he says:\n"We did not make ourselves; we did not make the principles of science,\nwhich we discover and apply but cannot alter."The only revelation of\nGod in which he believes is "the universal display of himself in the\nworks of creation, and that repugnance we feel in ourselves to bad\nactions, and disposition to do good ones.""The only idea we can have\nof serving God, is that of contributing to the happiness of the living\ncreation that God has made."* Astronomy, as we know, he had studied profoundly.In early\n     life he had studied astronomic globes, purchased at the cost\n     of many a dinner, and the orrery(sp), and attended lectures\n     at the Royal Society.In the "Age of Reason" he writes,\n     twenty-one years before Herschel\'s famous paper on the\n     Nebulae: "The probability is that each of those fixed stars\n     is also a sun, round which another system of worlds or\n     planets, though too remote for as to discover, performs its\n     revolutions."It thus appears that in Paine\'s Theism the deity is made manifest, not\nby omnipotence, a word I do not remember in his theories, but in this\ncorrespondence of universal order and bounty with rcason and conscience,\nand the humane heart In later works this speculative side of his Theism\npresented a remarkable Zoroastrian variation.When pressed with Bishop\nButler\'s terrible argument against previous Deism,--that the God of\nthe Bible is no more cruel than the God of Nature,--Paine declared his\npreference for the Persian religion, which exonerated the deity from\nresponsibility for natural evils, above the Hebrew which attributed\nsuch things to God.He was willing to sacrifice God\'s omnipotence to\nhis humanity.He repudiates every notion of a devil, but was evidently\nunwilling to ascribe the unconquered realms of chaos to the divine Being\nin whom he believed.Thus, while theology was lowering Jesus to a mere King, glorying in\nbaubles of crown and throne, pleased with adulation, and developing\nhim into an authorizor of all the ills and agonies of the world, so\ndepriving him of his humanity, Paine was recovering from the universe\nsomething like the religion of Jesus himself."Why even of yourselves\njudge ye not what is right" In affirming the Religion of Humanity, Paine\ndid not mean what Comte meant, a personification of the continuous life\nof our race*; nor did he merely mean benevolence towards all living\ncreatures.* Paine\'s friend and fellow-prisoner, Anacharsis Clootz, was\n     the first to describe Humanity as "L\'Etre Supreme."He affirmed a Religion based on the authentic divinity of that which\nis supreme in human nature and distinctive of it The sense of right,\njustice, love, mercy, is God himself in man; this spirit judges all\nthings,--all alleged revelations, all gods.In affirming a deity too\ngood, loving, just, to do what is ascribed to Jahve, Paine was animated\nby the same spirit that led the early believer to turn from heartless\nelemental gods to one born of woman, bearing in his breast a human\nheart.Pauline theology took away this human divinity, and effected a\nrestoration, by making the Son of Man Jehovah, and commanding the heart\nback from its seat of judgment, where Jesus had set it."Shall the clay\nsay to the potter, why hast thou formed me thus?""Yes," answered\nPaine, "if the thing felt itself hurt, and could speak."He knew as did\nEmerson, whom he often anticipates, that "no god dare wrong a worm."The force of the "Age of Reason" is not in its theology, though this\nethical variation of Deism in the direction of humanity is of exceeding\ninterest to students who would trace the evolution of avatars and\nincarnations.Paine\'s theology was but gradually developed, and in this\nwork is visible only as a tide beginning to rise under the fiery orb of\nhis religious passion."If the\nbelief of errors not morally bad did no mischief, it would make no part\nof the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them."He evinces regret\nthat the New Testament, containing so many elevated moral precepts,\nshould, by leaning on supposed prophecies in the Old Testament, have\nbeen burdened with its barbarities."It must follow the fate of its\nfoundation."This fatal connection, he knows, is not the work of Jesus;\nhe ascribes it to the church which evoked from the Old Testament a\ncrushing system of priestly and imperial power reversing the benign\nprinciples of Jesus.It is this oppression, the throne of all\noppressions, that he assails.His affirmations of the human deity are\nthus mainly expressed in his vehement denials.This long chapter must now draw to a close.It would need a volume to\nfollow thoroughly the argument of this epoch-making book, to which\nI have here written only an introduction, calling attention to its\nevolutionary factors, historical and spiritual.Such then was the new\nPilgrim\'s Progress.As in that earlier prison, at Bedford, there shone\nin Paine\'s cell in the Luxembourg a great and imperishable vision, which\nmultitudes are still following.The Christian teacher of to-day may well ponder this fact.The atheists\nand secularists of our time are printing, reading, revering a work that\nopposes their opinions.For above its arguments and criticisms they see\nthe faithful heart contending with a mighty Apollyon, girt with all the\nforces of revolutionary and Royal Terrorism.Just this one Englishman,\nborn again in America, confronting George III.and Robespierre on earth\nand tearing the like of them from the throne of the universe!Were it\nonly for the grandeur of this spectacle in the past Paine would maintain\nhis hold on thoughtful minds.But in America the hold is deeper than that.In this self-forgetting\ninsurrection of the human heart against deified Inhumanity there is an\nexpression of the inarticulate wrath of humanity against continuance of\nthe same wrong.In the circulation throughout the earth of the Bible as\nthe Word of God, even after its thousand serious errors of translation\nare turned, by exposure, into falsehoods; in the deliverance to savages\nof a scriptural sanction of their tomahawks and poisoned arrows; in the\ndiffusion among cruel tribes of a religion based on human sacrifice,\nafter intelligence has abandoned it; in the preservation of costly\nservices to a deity who "needs nothing at men\'s hands," beside hovels\nof the poor who need much; in an exemption of sectarian property from\ntaxation which taxes every man to support the sects, and continues the\nalliance of church and state; in these things, and others--the list is\nlong--there is still visible, however refined, the sting and claw of the\nApollyon against whom Paine hurled his far-reaching dart.The "Age of\nReason" was at first published in America by a religious house, and as\na religious book.It was circulated in Virginia by Washington\'s old\nfriend, Parson Weems.It is still circulated, though by supposed\nunbelievers, as a religious book, and such it is.Its religion is expressed largely in those same denunciations which\ntheologians resent.I have explained them; polite agnostics apologize\nfor them, or cast Paine over as a Jonah of the rationalistic ship.But\nto make one expression more gentle would mar the work.As it stands,\nwith all its violences and faults, it represents, as no elaborate or\npolite treatise could, the agony and bloody sweat of a heart breaking in\nthe presence of crucified Humanity.What dear heads, what noble hearts\nhad that man seen laid low; what shrieks had he heard in the desolate\nhomes of the Condorcets, the Brissots; what Canaanite and Midianite\nmassacres had he seen before the altar of Brotherhood, erected by\nhimself!And all because every human being had been taught from his\ncradle that there is something more sacred than humanity, and to which\nman should be sacrificed.Of all those mas-sacred thinkers not one voice\nremains: they have gone silent: over their reeking guillotine sits\nthe gloating Apollyon of Inhumanity.But here is one man, a prisoner,\npreparing for his long silence.He alone can speak for those slain\nbetween the throne and the altar.In these outbursts of laughter and\ntears, these outcries that think not of literary style, these appeals\nfrom surrounding chaos to the starry realm of order, from the tribune of\nvengeance to the sun shining for all, this passionate horror of cruelty\nin the powerful which will brave a heartless heaven or hell with its\nimmortal indignation,--in all these the unfettered mind may hear the\nwail of enthralled Europe, sinking back choked with its blood, under the\nchain it tried to break.So long as a link remains of the same chain,\nbinding reason or heart, Paine\'s "Age of Reason" will live.It is not a\nmere book--it is a man\'s heart.FRIENDSHIPS\n\nBaron Pichon, who had been a sinuous Secretary of Legation in America\nunder Genet and Fauchet, and attached to the Foreign Office in France\nunder the Directory, told George Ticknor, in 1837, that "Tom Paine, who\nlived in Monroe\'s house at Paris, had a great deal too much influence\nover Monroe."*\n\n     *  "Life of George Ticknor," ii., p.223\n\nThe Baron, apart from his prejudice against republicanism (Talleyrand\nwas his master), knew more about American than French politics at the\ntime of Monroe\'s mission in France.The agitation caused in France\nby Jay\'s negotiations in England, and rumors set afloat by their\nsecrecy,--such secrecy being itself felt as a violation of good\nfaith--rendered Monroe\'s position unhappy and difficult.After Paine\'s\nrelease from prison, his generous devotion to France, undiminished\nby his wrongs, added to the painful illness that reproached the\nConvention\'s negligence, excited a chivalrous enthusiasm for him.Monroe for him, the fact that this faithful\nfriend of France was in their house, were circumstances of international\nimportance.Of Paine\'s fidelity to republican principles, and his\nindignation at their probable betrayal in England, there could be no\ndoubt in any mind.He was consulted by the French Executive, and was\nvirtually the most important _attache_ of the United States Legation.The "intrigue" of which Thibaudeau had spoken, in Convention, as having\ndriven Paine from that body, was not given to the public, but it was\nwell understood to involve the American President.If Paine\'s suffering\nrepresented in London Washington\'s deference to England, all the more\ndid he stand to France as a representative of those who in America\nwere battling for the Alliance.He was therefore a tower of strength\nto Monroe.It will be seen by the subjoined letter that while he was\nMonroe\'s guest it was to him rather than the Minister that the Foreign\nOffice applied for an introduction of a new Consul to Samuel Adams,\nGovernor of Massachusetts--a Consul with whom Paine was not personally\nacquainted.The general feeling and situation in France at the date of\nthis letter (March 6th), and the anger at Jay\'s secret negotiations in\nEngland, are reflected in it:\n\n"My Dear Friend,--Mr.Mozard, who is appointed Consul, will present you\nthis letter.He is spoken of here as a good sort of man, and I can have\nno doubt that you will find him the same at Boston.When I came from\nAmerica it was my intention to return the next year, and I have intended\nthe same every year since.The case I believe is, that as I am embarked\nin the revolution, I do not like to leave it till it is finished,\nnotwithstanding the dangers I have run.I am now almost the only\nsurvivor of those who began this revolution, and I know not how it is\nthat I have escaped.I know however that I owe nothing to the government\nof America.The executive department has never directed either the\nformer or the present Minister to enquire whether I was dead or alive,\nin prison or in liberty, what the cause of the imprisonment was, and\nwhether there was any service or assistance it could render.Monroe\nacted voluntarily in the case, and reclaimed me as an American citizen;\nfor the pretence for my imprisonment was that I was a foreigner, born in\nEngland."The internal scene here from the 31 of May 1793 to the fall of\nRobespierre has been terrible.I was shut up in the prison of the\nLuxembourg eleven months, and I find by the papers of Robespierre\nthat have been published by the Convention since his death, that I\nwas designed for a worse fate.The following memorandum is in his own\nhandwriting; \'Demander que Thomas Paine soit decrete d\'accusation pour\nles interets de l\'Amerique autant que de la France.\'"You will see by the public papers that the successes of the French arms\nhave been and continue to be astonishing, more especially since the fall\nof Robespierre, and the suppression of the system of Terror.They\nhave fairly beaten all the armies of Austria, Prussia, England, Spain,\nSardignia, and Holland.Holland is entirely conquered, and there is now\na revolution in that country."I know not how matters are going on your side the water, but I think\neverything is not as it ought to be.The appointment of G. Morris to\nbe Minister here was the most unfortunate and the most injudicious\nappointment that could be made.Jefferson at\nthe time, and I said the same to Morris.Had he not been removed at\nthe time he was I think the two countries would have been involved in a\nquarrel, for it is a fact, that he would either have been ordered away\nor put in arrestation; for he gave every reason to suspect that he was\nsecretly a British Emissary.Jay is about in England I know not; but is it possible that\nany man who has contributed to the Independence of America, and to free\nher from the tyranny of the British Government, can read without shame\nand indignation the note of Jay to Grenville?That the _United States\nhas no other resource than in the justice and magnanimity of his\nMajesty_, is a satire upon the Declaration of Independence, and exhibits\n[such] a spirit of meanness on the part of America, that, were it true,\nI should be ashamed of her.Such a declaration may suit the spaniel\ncharacter of Aristocracy, but it cannot agree with manly character of a\nRepublican.Mozard is this moment come for this letter, and he sets off\ndirectly.--God bless you, remember me among the circle of our friends,\nand tell them how much I wish to be once more among them."*\n\n     * Mr.Spofford, Librarian of Congress, has kindly copied\n     this letter for me from the original, among the papers of\n     George Bancroft.There are indications of physical feebleness as well as haste in this\nletter.The spring and summer brought some vigor, but, as we have seen\nby Monroe\'s letter to Judge Jones, he sank again and in the autumn\nseemed nearing his end.Once more the announcement of his death appeared\nin England, this time bringing joy to the orthodox.From the same\nquarter, probably, whence issued, in 1793, "Intercepted Correspondence\nfrom Satan to Citizen Paine," came now ( 1795 ) a folio sheet: "Glorious\nNews for Old England.The British Lyon rous\'d; or John Bull for ever."The Fox has lost his Tail\n     The Ass has done his Braying,\n     The Devil has got Tom Paine."Good-hearted as Paine was, it must be admitted that he was cruelly\npersistent in disappointing these British obituaries.Despite anguish,\nfever, and abscess--this for more than a year eating into his side,--he\ndid not gratify those prayerful expectations by becoming a monument of\ndivine retribution.Nay, amid all these sufferings he had managed to\nfinish Part Second of the "Age of Reason," write the "Dissertation on\nGovernment," and give the Address before the Convention, Nevertheless\nwhen, in November, he was near death\'s door, there came from England\ntidings grievous enough to crush a less powerful constitution.It was\nreported that many of his staunchest old friends had turned against\nhim on account of his heretical book.This report seemed to find\nconfirmation in the successive volumes of Gilbert Wakefield in reply to\nthe two Parts of Paine\'s book.Wakefield held Unitarian opinions, and\ndid not defend the real fortress besieged by Paine.He was enraged that\nPaine should deal with the authority of the Bible, and the orthodox\ndogmas, as if they were Christianity, ignoring unorthodox versions\naltogether.This, however, hardly explains the extreme and coarse\nvituperation of these replies, which shocked Wakefield\'s friends.*\n\n     * "The office of \'castigation\' was unworthy of our friend\'s\n     talents, and detrimental to his purpose of persuading\n     others.Such a contemptuous treatment, even of an unfair\n     disputant, was also too well calculated to depredate in the\n     public estimation that benevolence of character by which Mr.--"Life of Gilbert\n     Wakefield," 1804, ii., p.Although in his thirty-eighth year at this time, Wakefield was not old\nenough to escape the _sequelae_ of his former clericalism.He had been a\nFellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, afterwards had a congregation, and\nhad continued his connection with the English Church after he was\nled, by textual criticism, to adopt Unitarian opinions.He had\ngreat reputation as a linguist, and wrote Scriptural expositions and\nretranslations.But few read his books, and he became a tutor in a\ndissenting college at Hackney, mainly under influence of the Unitarian\nleaders, Price and Priestley.Wakefield would not condescend to any\nconnection with a dissenting society, and his career at Hackney was\nmarked by arrogant airs towards Unitarians, on account of a university\ntraining, then not open to dissenters.He attacked Price and Priestley,\nhis superiors in every respect, apart from their venerable position\nand services, in a contemptuous way; and, in fact, might be brevetted a\nprig, with a fondness for coarse phrases, sometimes printed with blanks.He flew at Paine as if he had been waiting for him; his replies, not\naffecting any vital issue, were displays of linguistic and textual\nlearning, set forth on the background of Paine\'s page, which he\nblackened.He exhausts his large vocabulary of vilification on a book\nwhose substantial affirmations he concedes; and it is done in the mean\nway of appropriating the credit of Paine\'s arguments.Gilbert Wakefield was indebted to the excitement raised by Paine for\nthe first notice taken by the general public of anything he ever\nwrote.Paine, however, seems to have been acquainted with a sort of\nautobiography which he had published in 1792.In this book Wakefield\nadmitted with shame that he had subscribed the Church formulas when he\ndid not believe them, while indulging in flings at Price, Priestley, and\nothers, who had suffered for their principles.At the same time there\nwere some things in Wakefield\'s autobiography which could not fail to\nattract Paine: it severely attacked slavery, and also the whole course\nof Pitt towards France.It\nwas consequently a shock when Gilbert Wakefield\'s outrageous abuse\nof himself came to the invalid in his sick-room.It appeared to be an\nindication of the extent to which he was abandoned by the Englishmen\nwho had sympathized with his political principles, and to a large extent\nwith his religious views.This acrimonious repudiation added groans to\nPaine\'s sick and sinking heart, some of which were returned upon his\nSocinian assailant, and in kind.This private letter my reader must\nsee, though it was meant for no eye but that of Gilbert Wakefield.It is\ndated at Paris, November 19, 1795."Dear Sir,--When you prudently chose, like a starved apothecary,\nto offer your eighteenpenny antidote to those who had taken my\ntwo-and-sixpenny Bible-purge,* you forgot that although my dose\nwas rather of the roughest, it might not be the less wholesome for\npossessing that drastick quality; and if I am to judge of its salutary\neffects on your infuriate polemic stomach, by the nasty things it has\nmade you bring away, I think you should be the last man alive to take\nyour own panacea.As to the collection of words of which you boast the\npossession, nobody, I believe, will dispute their amount, but every one\nwho reads your answer to my \'Age of Reason\' will wish there were not so\nmany scurrilous ones among them; for though they may be very usefull\nin emptying your gallbladder they are too apt to move the bile of other\npeople.* These were the actual prices of the books."Those of Greek and Latin are rather foolishly thrown away, I think, on\na man like me, who, you are pleased to say, is \'the greatest ignoramus\nin nature\': yet I must take the liberty to tell you, that wisdom does\nnot consist in the mere knowledge of language, but of things."You recommend me to _know myself_--a thing very easy to advise, but\nvery difficult to practice, as I learn from your own book; for you take\nyourself to be a meek disciple of Christ, and yet give way to passion\nand pride in every page of its composition."You have raised an ant-hill about the roots of my sturdy oak, and it\nmay amuse idlers to see your work; but neither its body nor its branches\nare injured by you; and I hope the shade of my Civic Crown may be able\nto preserve your little contrivance, at least for the season."When you have done as much service to the world by your writings, and\nsuffered as much for them, as I have done, you will be better entitled\nto dictate: but although I know you to be a keener politician than Paul,\nI can assure you, from my experience of mankind, that you do not much\ncommend the Christian doctrines to them by announcing that it requires\nthe labour of a learned life to make them understood."May I be permitted, after all, to suggest that your truly vigorous\ntalents would be best employed in teaching men to preserve their\nliberties exclusively,--leaving to that God who made their immortal\nsouls the care of their eternal welfare."I am, dear Sir,\n\n"Your true well-wisher,\n\n"Tho.After a first perusal of this letter has made its unpleasant impression,\nthe reader will do well to read it again.Paine has repaired to his\nearliest Norfolk for language appropriate to the coarser tongue of his\nNottinghamshire assailant; but it should be said that the offensive\nparagraph, the first, is a travesty of one written by Wakefield.In his\nautobiography, after groaning over his books that found no buyers,\na veritable "starved apothecary," Wakefield describes the uneasiness\ncaused by his pamphlet on "Religious Worship" as proof that the disease\nwas yielding to his "potion."He says that "as a physician of spiritual\nmaladies" he had seconded "the favourable operation of the first\nprescription,"--and so forth.Paine, in using the simile, certainly\nallows the drugs and phials of his sick-room to enter it to a\ndisagreeable extent, but we must bear in mind that we are looking over\nhis shoulder.We must also, by the same consideration of its privacy,\nmitigate the letter\'s egotism.Wakefield\'s ant-hill protected by\nthe foliage, the "civic crown," of Paine\'s oak which it has\nattacked,--gaining notice by the importance of the work it\nbelittles,--were admirable if written by another; and the egotism is\nnot without some warrant.It is the rebuke of a scarred veteran of the\nliberal army to the insults of a subaltern near twenty years his junior.It was no doubt taken to heart For when the agitation which Gilbert\nWakefield had contributed to swell, and to lower, presently culminated\nin handcuffs for the circulators of Paine\'s works, he was filled with\nanguish.He vainly tried to resist the oppression, and to call back the\nUnitarians, who for twenty-five years continued to draw attention from\ntheir own heresies by hounding on the prosecution of Paine\'s adherents.*\n\n     * "But I would not forcibly suppress this book ["Age of\n     Reason"]; much less would I punish (O my God, be such\n     wickedness far from me, or leave me destitute of thy favour\n     in the midst of this perjured and sanguinary generation!)much less would I punish, by fine or imprisonment, from any\n     possible consideration, the publisher or author of these\n     pages."--Letter of Gilbert Wakefield to Sir John Scott,\n     Attorney General, 1798.For evidence of Unitarian\n     intolerance see the discourse of W, J. Fox on "The Duties of\n     Christians towards Deists" (Collected Works, vol.In\n     this discourse, October 24, 1819, on the prosecution of\n     Carlile for publishing the "Age of Reason," Mr.Fox\n     expresses his regret that the first prosecution should have\n     been conducted by a Unitarian."Goaded," he says, "by the\n     calumny which would identify them with those who yet reject\n     the Saviour, they have, in repelling so unjust an\n     accusation, caught too much of the tone of their opponents,\n     and given the most undesirable proof of their affinity to\n     other Christians by that unfairness towards the disbeliever\n     which does not become any Christian."Fox\n     became the champion of all the principles of "The Age of\n     Reason" and "The Rights of Man."The prig perished; in his place stood a martyr of the freedom bound up\nwith the work he had assailed.Paine\'s other assailant, the Bishop of\nLlandaff, having bent before Pitt, and episcopally censured the humane\nside he once espoused, Gilbert Wakefield answered him with a boldness\nthat brought on him two years\' imprisonment When he came out of prison\n(1801) he was received with enthusiasm by all of Paine\'s friends, who\nhad forgotten the wrong so bravely atoned for.Had he not died in the\nsame year, at the age of forty-five, Gilbert Wakefield might have become\na standard-bearer of the freethinkers.Paine\'s recovery after such prolonged and perilous suffering was a\nsort of resurrection.In April (1796) he leaves Monroe\'s house for the\ncountry, and with the returning life of nature his strength is steadily\nrecovered.What to the man whose years of anguish, imprisonment,\ndisease, at last pass away, must have been the paths and hedgerows of\nVersailles, where he now meets the springtide, and the more healing\nsunshine of affection!Risen from his thorny bed of pain--\n\n     "The meanest floweret of the vale,\n     The simplest note that swells the gale,\n     The common sun, the air, the skies,\n     To him are opening paradise."So had it been even if nature alone had surrounded him.But Paine had\nbeen restored by the tenderness and devotion of friends.Had it not been\nfor friendship he could hardly have been saved.We are little able, in\nthe present day, to appreciate the reverence and affection with which\nThomas Paine was regarded by those who saw in him the greatest apostle\nof liberty in the world.Elihu Palmer spoke a very general belief when\nhe declared Paine "probably the most useful man that ever existed upon\nthe face of the earth."This may sound wild enough on the ears of those\nto whom Liberty has become a familiar drudge.There was a time when she\nwas an ideal Rachel, to win whom many years of terrible service were\nnot too much; but now in the garish day she is our prosaic Leah,--a\nserviceable creature in her way, but quite unromantic.In Paris there\nwere ladies and gentlemen who had known something of the cost of\nLiberty,--Colonel and Mrs.Monroe, Sir Robert and Lady Smith, Madame\nLafayette, Mr.Barlow, M. and Madame De Bonneville.They\nhad known what it was to watch through anxious nights with terrors\nsurrounding them.He who had suffered most was to them a sacred person.He had come out of the succession of ordeals, so weak in body, so\nwounded by American ingratitude, so sore at heart, that no delicate\nchild needed more tender care.Set those ladies and their charge a\nthousand years back in the poetic past, and they become Morgan le Fay,\nand the Lady Nimue, who bear the wounded warrior away to their Avalon,\nthere to be healed of his grievous hurts.Men say their Arthur is dead,\nbut their love is stronger than death.And though the service of\nthese friends might at first have been reverential, it had ended with\nattachment, so great was Paine\'s power, so wonderful and pathetic his\nmemories, so charming the play of his wit, so full his response to\nkindness.One especially great happiness awaited him when he became convalescent.Sir Robert Smith, a wealthy banker in Paris, made his acquaintance, and\nhe discovered that Lady Smith was no other than "The Little Corner of\nthe World," whose letters had carried sunbeams into his prison.* An\nintimate friendship was at once established with Sir Robert and his\nlady, in whose house, probably at Versailles, Paine was a guest after\nleaving the Monroes.To Lady Smith, on discovering her, Paine addressed\na poem,--"The Castle in the Air to the Little Corner of the World":\n\n     * Sir Robert Smith (Smythe in the Peerage List) was born in\n     1744, and married, first, Miss Blake of London (1776).The\n     name of the second Lady Smith, Paine\'s friend, before her\n     marriage I have not ascertained."In the region of clouds, where the whirlwinds arise,\n     My Castle of Fancy was built;\n     The turrets reflected the blue from the skies,\n     And the windows with sunbeams were gilt."The rainbow sometimes, in its beautiful state,\n     Enamelled the mansion around;\n     And the figures that fancy in clouds can create\n     Supplied me with gardens and ground."I had grottos, and fountains, and orange-tree groves,\n     I had all that enchantment has told;\n     I had sweet shady walks for the gods and their loves,\n     I had mountains of coral and gold."But a storm that I felt not had risen and rolled,\n     While wrapped in a slumber I lay;\n     And when I looked out in the morning, behold,\n     My Castle was carried away."It passed over rivers and valleys and groves,\n     The world it was all in my view;\n     I thought of my friends, of their fates, of their loves,\n     And often, full often, of you."At length it came over a beautiful scene,\n     That nature in silence had made;\n     The place was but small, but\'t was sweetly serene,\n     And chequered with sunshine and shade."I gazed and I envied with painful good will,\n     And grew tired of my seat in the air;\n     When all of a sudden my Castle stood still,\n     As if some attraction were there."Like a lark from the sky it came fluttering down,\n     And placed me exactly in view,\n     When whom should I meet in this charming retreat\n     This corner of calmness, but--you."Delighted to find you in honour and ease,\n     I felt no more sorrow nor pain;\n     But the wind coming fair, I ascended the breeze,\n     And went back with my Castle again."The kindness that rescued him from death was\nfollowed by the friendship that beguiled him from horrors of the past.From gentle ladies he learned that beyond the Age of Reason lay the\nforces that defeat Giant Despair."To reason [so he writes to Lady Smith] against feelings is as vain as\nto reason against fire: it serves only to torture the torture, by adding\nreproach to horror.All reasoning with ourselves in such cases acts upon\nus like the reasoning of another person, which, however kindly done,\nserves but to insult the misery we suffer.If Reason could remove the\npain, Reason would have prevented it.If she could not do the one, how\nis she to perform the other?In all such cases we must look upon Reason\nas dispossessed of her empire, by a revolt of the mind.She retires to a\ndistance to weep, and the ebony sceptre of Despair rules alone.All that\nReason can do is to suggest, to hint a thought, to signify a wish, to\ncast now and then a kind of bewailing look, to hold up, when she\ncan catch the eye, the miniature shaded portrait of Hope; and though\ndethroned, and can dictate no more, to wait upon us in the humble\nstation of a handmaid."The mouth of the rescued and restored captive was filled with song.Several little poems were circulated among his friends, but not printed;\namong them the following:\n\n"Contentment; or, if you please, Confession.Barlow, on\nher pleasantly telling the author that, after writing against the\nsuperstition of the Scripture religion, he was setting up a religion\ncapable of more bigotry and enthusiasm, and more dangerous to its\nvotaries--that of making a religion of Love._\n\n     "O could we always live and love,\n     And always be sincere,\n     I would not wish for heaven above,\n     My heaven would be here."Though many countries I have seen,\n     And more may chance to see,\n     My Little Corner of the World\n     Is half the world to me."The other half, as you may guess,\n     America contains;\n     And thus, between them, I possess\n     The whole world for my pains."I\'m then contented with my lot,\n     I can no happier be;\n     For neither world I\'m sure has got\n     So rich a man as me."Then send no fiery chariot down\n     To take me off from hence,\n     But leave me on my heavenly ground--\n     This prayer is _common sense_."Let others choose another plan,\n     I mean no fault to find;\n     The true theology of man\n     Is happiness of mind."Paine gained great favor with the French government and fame throughout\nEurope by his pamphlet, "The Decline and Fall of the English System of\nFinance," in which he predicted the suspension of the Bank of England,\nwhich followed the next year.He dated the pamphlet April 8th, and the\nMinister of Foreign Affairs is shown, in the Archives of that office, to\nhave ordered, on April 27th, a thousand copies.It was translated in all\nthe languages of Europe, and was a terrible retribution for the forged\nassignats whose distribution in France the English government had\nconsidered a fair mode of warfare.This translation "into all the\nlanguages of the continent" is mentioned by Ralph Broome, to whom the\nBritish government entrusted the task of answering the pamphlet.* As\nBroome\'s answer is dated June 4th, this circulation in six or seven\nweeks is remarkable, The proceeds were devoted by Paine to the relief of\nprisoners for debt in Newgate, London.**\n\n     * "Observations on Mr.Broome\n     escapes the charge of prejudice by speaking of "Mr.Paine,\n     whose abilities I admire and deprecate in a breath."Paine\'s\n     pamphlet was also replied to by George Chalmers ("Oldys")\n     who had written the slanderous biography.** Richard Carlile\'s sketch of Paine, p.This large\n     generosity to English sufferers appears the more\n     characteristic beside the closing paragraph of Paine\'s\n     pamphlet, "As an individual citizen of America, and as far\n     as an individual can go, I have revenged (if I may use the\n     expression without any immoral meaning) the piratical\n     depredations committed on American commerce by the English\n     government.I have retaliated for France on the subject of\n     finance: and I conclude with retorting on Mr.Pitt the\n     expression he used against France, and say, that the English\n     system of finance \'is en the verge, nay even in the gulf of\n     bankruptcy.\'"Concerning the false French assignats forged in  England,\n     see  Louis Blanc\'s "History of the Revolution," vol.xii.,\n     p.The concentration of this pamphlet on its immediate subject, which made\nit so effective, renders it of too little intrinsic interest in the\npresent day to delay us long, especially as it is included in all\neditions of Paine\'s works.It possesses, however, much biographical\ninterest as proving the intellectual power of Paine while still but a\nconvalescent.He never wrote any work involving more study and mastery\nof difficult details.It was this pamphlet, written in Paris, while\n"Peter Porcupine," in America, was rewriting the slanders of "Oldys,"\nwhich revolutionized Cobbett\'s opinion of Paine, and led him to try and\nundo the injustice he had wrought.It now so turned out that Paine was able to repay all the kindnesses he\nhad received.The relations between the French government and Monroe,\nalready strained, as we have seen, became in the spring of 1796 almost\nintolerable.The Jay treaty seemed to the French so incredible that,\neven after it was ratified, they believed that the Representatives would\nrefuse the appropriation needed for its execution.But when tidings came\nthat this effort of the House of Representatives had been crushed by a\nmenaced _coup d\'etat_, the ideal America fell in France, and was broken\nin fragments.Monroe could now hardly have remained save on the credit\nof Paine with the French.There was, of course, a fresh accession of\nwrath towards England for this appropriation of the French alliance.Paine had been only the first sacrifice on the altar of the new\nalliance; now all English families and all Americans in Paris except\nhimself were likely to become its victims.The English-speaking\nresidents there made one little colony, and Paine was sponsor for them\nall.His fatal blow at English credit proved the formidable power of the\nman whom Washington had delivered up to Robespierre in the interest of\nPitt.So Paine\'s popularity reached its climax; the American Legation\nfound through him a _modus vivendi_ with the French government; the\nfamilies which had received and nursed him in his weakness found in his\nintimacy their best credential.Joel Barlow especially, while her\nhusband was in Algeria, on the service of the American government, might\nhave found her stay in Paris unpleasant but for Paine s friendship.The\nimportance of his guarantee to the banker, Sir Robert Smith, appears by\nthe following note, written at Versailles, August 13th:\n\n"Citizen Minister: The citizen Robert Smith, a very particular friend\nof mine, wishes to obtain a passport to go to Hamburg, and I will be\nobliged to you to do him that favor.Himself and family have lived\nseveral years in France, for he likes neither the government nor the\nclimate of England.He has large property in England, but his Banker\nin that country has refused sending him remittances.This makes it\nnecessary for him to go to Hamburg, because from there he can draw his\nmoney out of his Banker\'s hands, which he cannot do whilst in France.His family remains in France.--_Salut et fraternite._\n\n"Thomas Paine."Amid his circle of cultured and kindly friends Paine had dreamed of a\nlifting of the last cloud from his life, so long overcast.His eyes were\nstrained to greet that shining sail that should bring him a response to\nhis letter of September to Washington, in his heart being a great hope\nthat his apparent wrong would be explained as a miserable mistake,\nand that old friendship restored.As the reader knows, the hope was\ngrievously disappointed.The famous public letter to Washington (August\n3d), which was not published in France, has already been considered, in\nadvance of its chronological place.It will be found, however, of more\nsignificance if read in connection with the unhappy situation, in which\nall of Paine\'s friends, and all Americans in Paris, had been brought\nby the Jay treaty.From their point of view the deliverance of Paine to\nprison and the guillotine was only one incident in a long-planned and\nsystematic treason, aimed at the life of the French republic.Jefferson\nin America, and Paine in France, represented the faith and hope of\nrepublicans that the treason would be overtaken by retribution and\nreversal.* Soon after Jefferson became President Paine wrote to him,\n     suggesting that Sir Robert\'s firm might be safely depended\n     on as the medium of American financial transactions in\n     Europe.THEOPHILANTHROPY\n\nIn the ever-recurring controversies concerning Paine and his "Age\nof Reason" we have heard many triumphal claims.Christianity and\nthe Church, it is said, have advanced and expanded, unharmed by such\ncriticisms.But there are several fallacies implied in\nthis mode of dealing with the religious movement caused by Paine\'s work.It assumes that Paine was an enemy of all that now passes under the name\nof Christianity--a title claimed by nearly a hundred and fifty different\norganizations, with some of which (as the Unitarians, Universalists,\nBroad Church, and Hick-site Friends) he would largely sympathize.It\nfurther assumes that he was hostile to all churches, and desired or\nanticipated their destruction.Paine desired and\nanticipated their reformation, which has steadily progressed.At the\nclose of the "Age of Reason" he exhorts the clergy to "preach something\nthat is edifying, and from texts that are known to be true.""The Bible of the creation is inexhaustible in texts.Every part of\nscience, whether connected with the geometry of the universe, with\nthe systems of animal and vegetable life, or with the properties of\ninanimate matter, is a text for devotion as well as for philosophy--for\ngratitude as for human improvement.It will perhaps be said, that, if\nsuch a revolution in the system of religion takes place, every preacher\nought to be a philosopher.And every house of devotion\na school of science.It has been by wandering, from the immutable laws\nof science, and the right use of reason, and setting up an invented\nthing called revealed religion, that so many wild and blasphemous\nconceits nave been formed of the Almighty.The Jews have made him the\nassassin of the human species, to make room for the religion of the\nJews.The Christians have made him the murderer of himself, and the\nfounder of a new religion, to supersede and expel the Jewish religion.And to find pretence and admission for these things they must have\nsupposed his power and his wisdom imperfect, or his will changeable; and\nthe changeableness of the will is the imperfection of the judgment.The\nphilosopher knows that the laws of the Creator have never changed\nwith respect either to the principles of science, or the properties of\nmatter.Why then is it to be supposed they have changed with respect to\nman?"To the statement that Christianity has not been impeded by the "Age of\nReason," it should be added that its advance has been largely due to\nmodifications rendered necessary by that work.The unmodified dogmas\nare represented in small and eccentric communities.The advance has\nbeen under the Christian name, with which Paine had no concern; but\nto confuse the word "Christianity" with the substance it labels is\ninadmissible.George and the Dragon; but\nEnglish culture has reduced the saint and dragon to a fable.The special wrath with which Paine is still visited, above all other\ndeists put together, or even atheists is a tradition from a so-called\nChristianity which his work compelled to capitulate.That system is\nnow nearly extinct, and the vendetta it bequeathed should now end.The\ncapitulation began immediately with the publication of the Bishop of\nLlandaff\'s "Apology for the Bible," a title that did not fail to attract\nnotice when it appeared (1796).There were more than thirty replies to\nPaine, but they are mainly taken out of the Bishop\'s "Apology," to which\nthey add nothing.It is said in religious encyclopedias that Paine was\n"answered" by one and another writer, but in a strict sense Paine was\nnever answered, unless by the successive surrenders referred to.As Bishop Watson\'s "Apology" is adopted by most authorities as the\nsufficient "answer," it may be here accepted as a representative of the\nrest.Whether Paine\'s points dealt with by the Bishop are answerable\nor not, the following facts will prove how uncritical is the prevalent\nopinion that they were really answered.Watson concedes generally to Paine the discovery of some "real\ndifficulties" in the Old Testament, and the exposure, in the Christian\ngrove, of "a few unsightly shrubs, which good men had wisely concealed\nfrom public view" (p.* It is not Paine that here calls some\n"sacred" things unsightly, and charges the clergy with concealing\nthem--it is the Bishop.Among the particular and direct concessions made\nby the Bishop are the following:\n\n     * Corey\'s edition.That Moses may not have written every part of the Pentateuch.Some\npassages were probably written by later hands, transcribers or editors\n(pp.[If human reason and scholarship are admitted to detach\nany portions, by what authority can they be denied the right to bring\nall parts of the Pentateuch, or even the whole Bible, under their human\njudgment?]The law in Deuteronomy giving parents the right, under certain\ncircumstances, to have their children stoned to death, is excused only\nas a "humane restriction of a power improper to be lodged with any\nparent" (p.[Granting the Bishop\'s untrue assertion, that the same\n"improper" power was arbitrary among the Romans, Gauls, and Persians,\nwhy should it not have been abolished in Israel?Watson\npossessed the right to call any law established in the Bible "improper,"\nhow can Paine be denounced for subjecting other things in the book\nto moral condemnation?The moral sentiment is not an episcopal\nprerogative.]The Bishop agrees that it is "the opinion of many learned men and\ngood Christians" that the Bible, though authoritative in religion, is\nfallible in other respects, "relating the ordinary history of the times"\n(p.[What but human reason, in the absence of papal authority, is\nto draw the line between the historical and religious elements in the\nBible?]It is conceded that "Samuel did not write any part of the second book\nbearing his name, and only a part of the first" (p.[One of many\nblows dealt by this prelate at confidence in the Bible.]It is admitted that Ezra contains a contradiction in the estimate\nof the numbers who returned from Babylon; it is attributed to a\ntranscriber\'s mistake of one Hebrew figure for another (p.[Paine\'s\nquestion here had been: "What certainty then can there be in the Bible\nfor anything"?It is no answer to tell him how an error involving a\ndifference of 12,542 people may perhaps have occurred.]It is admitted that David did not write some of the Psalms ascribed\nto him (p."It is acknowledged that the order of time is not everywhere\nobserved" [in Jeremiah]; also that this prophet, fearing for his life,\nsuppressed the truth [as directed by King Zedekiah]."He was under\nno obligation to tell the whole [truth] to men who were certainly his\nenemies and no good subjects of the king" (pp.[But how can it\nbe determined how much in Jeremiah is the "word of God," and how much\nuttered for the casual advantage of himself or his king?]It is admitted that there was no actual fulfilment of Ezekie\'s\nprophecy, "No foot of man shall pass through it [Egypt], nor foot of\nbeast shall pass through it, for forty years" (p.The discrepancies between the genealogies of Christ, in Matthew and\nLuke, are admitted: they are explained by saying that Matthew gives the\ngenealogy of Joseph, and Luke that of Mary; and that Matthew commits "an\nerror" in omitting three generations between Joram and Ozias (p.[Paine had asked, why might not writers mistaken in the natural\ngenealogy of Christ be mistaken also in his celestial genealogy?Such are some of the Bishop\'s direct admissions.There are other admissions in his silences and evasions.For instance,\nhaving elaborated a theory as to how the error in Ezra might occur, by\nthe close resemblance of Hebrew letters representing widely different\nnumbers, he does not notice Nehemiah\'s error in the same matter, pointed\nout by Paine,--a self-contradiction, and also a discrepancy with Ezra,\nwhich could not be explained by his theory.He says nothing about\nseveral other contradictions alluded to by Paine.The Bishop\'s evasions\nare sometimes painful, as when he tries to escape the force of Paine\'s\nargument, that Paul himself was not convinced by the evidences of the\nresurrection which he adduces for others.The Bishop says: "That Paul\nhad so far resisted the evidence which the apostles had given of the\nresurrection and ascension of Jesus, as to be a persecutor of the\ndisciples of Christ, is certain; but I do not remember the place where\nhe declares that he had not believed them."But when Paul says, "I\nverily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to\nthe name of Jesus of Nazareth," surely this is inconsistent with his\nbelief in the resurrection and ascension.Paul declares that when it\nwas the good pleasure of God "to reveal his Son in me," immediately he\nentered on his mission.He "was not disobedient to the heavenly vision."Clearly then Paul had not been convinced of the resurrection and\nascension until he saw Christ in a vision.In dealing with Paine\'s moral charges against the Bible the Bishop has\nleft a confirmation of all that I have said concerning the Christianity\nof his time.An "infidel" of to-day could need no better moral arguments\nagainst the Bible than those framed by the Bishop in its defence.He\njustifies the massacre of the Canaanites on the ground that they were\nsacrificers of their own children to idols, cannibals, addicted to\nunnatural lust Were this true it would be no justification; but as no\nparticle of evidence is adduced in support of these utterly unwarranted\nand entirely fictitious accusations, the argument now leaves the\nmassacre without any excuse at all.The extermination is not in the\nBible based on any such considerations, but simply on a divine command\nto seize the land and slay its inhabitants.No legal right to the land\nis suggested in the record; and, as for morality, the only persons\nspared in Joshua\'s expedition were a harlot and her household, she\nhaving betrayed her country to the invaders, to be afterwards exalted\ninto an ancestress of Christ.Of the cities destroyed by Joshua it is\nsaid: "It was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel\nin battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have\nno favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses"\n(Joshua xi., 20).As their hearts were thus in Jehovah\'s power for\nhardening, it may be inferred that they were equally in his power for\nreformation, had they been guilty of the things alleged by the Bishop.With these things before him, and the selection of Rahab for mercy\nabove all the women in Jericho--every woman slain save the harlot who\ndelivered them up to slaughter--the Bishop says: "The destruction of the\nCanaanites exhibits to all nations, in all ages, a signal proof of God\'s\ndispleasure against sin."The Bishop rages against Paine for supposing that the commanded\npreservation of the Midianite maidens, when all males and married women\nwere slain, was for their "debauchery.""Prove this, and I will allow that Moses was the horrid monster you make\nhim--prove this, and I will allow that the Bible is what you call it--\'a\nbook of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy\'--prove this, or excuse my\nwarmth if I say to you, as Paul said to Elymas the sorcerer, who sought\nto turn away Sergius Paulus from the faith, \'O full of all subtilty,\nand of all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all\nrighteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the\nLord?\'--I did not, when I began these letters, think that I should\nhave been moved to this severity of rebuke, by anything you could\nhave written; but when so gross a misrepresentation is made of God\'s\nproceedings, coolness would be a crime."And what does my reader suppose is the alternative claimed by the\nprelate\'s foaming mouth?The maidens, he declares, were not reserved for\ndebauchery, but for slavery!Little did the Bishop foresee a time when, of the two suppositions,\nPaine\'s might be deemed the more lenient.The subject of slavery was\nthen under discussion in England, and the Bishop is constrained to add,\nconcerning this enslavement of thirty-two thousand maidens, from\nthe massacred families, that slavery is "a custom abhorrent from our\nmanners, but everywhere practised in former times, and still practised\nin countries where the benignity of the Christian religion has not\nsoftened the ferocity of human nature."Thus, Jehovah is represented\nas not only ordering the wholesale murder of the worshippers of another\ndeity, but an adoption of their "abhorrent" and inhuman customs.This connection of the deity of the Bible with "the ferocity of human\nnature" in one place, and its softening in another, justified Paine\'s\nsolemn rebuke to the clergy of his time."Had the cruel and murderous orders with which the Bible is filled,\nand the numberless torturing executions of men, women, and children, in\nconsequence of those orders, been ascribed to some friend whose memory\nyou revered, you would have glowed with satisfaction at detecting the\nfalsehood of the charge, and gloried in defending his injured fame.It is because ye are sunk in the cruelty of superstition, or feel no\ninterest in the honor of your Creator, that ye listen to the horrid\ntales of the Bible, or hear them with callous indifference."This is fundamentally what the Bishop has to answer, and of course he\nmust resort to the terrible _Tu quoque_ of Bishop Butler, Dr.Watson\nsays he is astonished that "so acute a reasoner" should reproduce the\nargument."You profess yourself to be a deist, and to believe that there is a God,\nwho created the universe, and established the laws of nature, by which\nit is sustained in existence.You profess that from a contemplation\nof the works of God you derive a knowledge of his attributes; and you\nreject the Bible because it ascribes to God things inconsistent (as you\nsuppose) with the attributes which you have discovered to belong to\nhim; in particular, you think it repugnant to his moral justice that\nhe should doom to destruction the crying and smiling infants of the\nCanaanites.Why do you not maintain it to be repugnant to his moral\njustice that he should suffer crying or smiling infants to be swallowed\nup by an earthquake, drowned by an inundation, consumed by fire, starved\nby a famine, or destroyed by a pestilence?"Watson did not, of course, know that he was following Bishop Butler\nin laying the foundations of atheism, though such was the case.As was\nsaid in my chapter on the "Age of Reason," this dilemma did not really\napply to Paine, His deity was inferred, despite all the disorders in\nnature, exclusively from its apprehensible order without, and from the\nreason and moral nature of man.He had not dealt with the problem of\nevil, except implicitly, in his defence of the divine goodness, which is\ninconsistent with the responsibility of his deity for natural evils, or\nfor anything that would be condemned by reason and conscience if done by\nman.It was thus the Christian prelate who had abandoned the primitive\nfaith in the divine humanity for a natural deism, while the man he calls\na "child of the devil" was defending the divine humanity.This then was the way in which Paine was "answered," for I am not aware\nof any important addition to the Bishop\'s "Apology" by other opponents.I cannot see how any Christian of the present time can regard it\notherwise than as a capitulation of the system it was supposed to\ndefend, however secure he may regard the Christianity of to-day.It\nsubjects the Bible to the judgment of human reason for the determination\nof its authorship, the integrity of its text, and the correction of\nadmitted errors in authorship, chronology, and genealogy; it admits the\nfallibility of the writers in matters of fact; it admits that some of\nthe moral laws of the Old Testament are "improper" and others, like\nslavery, belonging to "the ferocity of human nature"; it admits the\nnon-fulfilment of one prophet\'s prediction, and the self-interested\nsuppression of truth by another; and it admits that "good men" were\nengaged in concealing these "unsightly" things.Here are gates thrown\nopen for the whole "Age of Reason."The unorthodoxy of the Bishop\'s "Apology" does not rest on the judgment\nof the present writer alone.If Gilbert Wakefield presently had to\nreflect on his denunciations of Paine from the inside of a prison, the\nBishop of Llandaff had occasion to appreciate Paine\'s ideas on "mental\nlying" as the Christian infidelity.The Bishop, born in the same year\n(1737) with the two heretics he attacked--Gibbon and Paine--began his\ncareer as a professor of chemistry at Cambridge (1764), but seven years\nlater became Regius professor of divinity there.His posthumous papers\npresent a remarkable picture of the church in his time.In replying to\nGibbon he studied first principles, and assumed a brave stand against\nall intellectual and religious coercion.On the episcopal bench he\nadvocated a liberal policy toward France.In undertaking to answer Paine\nhe became himself unsettled; and at the very moment when unsophisticated\northodoxy was hailing him as its champion, the sagacious magnates of\nChurch and State proscribed him.He learned that the king had described\nhim as "impracticable"; with bitterness of soul he saw prelates of\ninferior rank and ability promoted over his head.He tried the effect\nof a political recantation, in one of his charges; and when Williams was\nimprisoned for publishing the "Age of Reason," and Gilbert Wakefield\nfor rebuking his "Charge," this former champion of free speech dared not\nutter a protest.He seems to\nhave at length made up his mind that if he was to be punished for his\nliberalism he would enjoy it.While preaching on "Revealed Religion" he\nsaw the Bishop of London shaking his head.In 18111, five years before\nhis death, he writes this significant note: "I have treated my divinity\nas I, twenty-five years ago, treated my chemical papers: I have lighted\nmy fire with the labour of a great portion of my life."*\n\n     * Patrick Henry\'s Answer to the "Age of Reason" shared the\n     like fate."When, during the first two years of his\n     retirement, Thomas Paine\'s \'Age of Reason\' made its\n     appearance, the old statesman was moved to write out a\n     somewhat elaborate treatise in defence of the truth of\n     Christianity.This treatise it was his purpose to have\n     published.\'He read the manuscript to his family as he\n     progressed with it, and completed it a short time before his\n     death\' (1799).When it was finished, however, \'being\n     diffident about his own work,\' and impressed also by the\n     great ability of the replies to Paine which were then\n     appearing in England, \'he directed his wife to destroy\' what\n     he had written.She \'complied literally with his\n     directions,\' and thus put beyond the chance of publication a\n     work which seemed, to some who heard it, \'the most eloquent\n     and unanswerable argument in defence of the Bible which was\n     ever written.\'"quoted in Tyler\'s "Patrick\n     Henry."Next to the "Age of Reason," the book that did most to advance Paine\'s\nprinciples in England was, as I believe, Dr.Watson\'s "Apology for the\nBible."Dean Swift had warned the clergy that if they began to reason\nwith objectors to the creeds they would awaken skepticism.He pointed out, as Gilbert Wakefield did,\nsome exegetical and verbal errors in Paine\'s book, but they no more\naffected its main purpose and argument than the grammatical mistakes in\n"Common Sense" diminished its force in the American Revolution.David\nDale, the great manufacturer at Paisley, distributed three thousand\ncopies of the "Apology" among his workmen.The books carried among them\nextracts from Paine, and the Bishop\'s admissions.Robert Owen married\nDale\'s daughter, and presently found the Paisley workmen a ripe harvest\nfor his rationalism and radicalism.Thus, in the person of its first clerical assailant, began the march\nof the "Age of Reason" in England.In the Bishop\'s humiliations for\nhis concessions to truth, were illustrated what Paine had said of his\nsystem\'s falsity and fraudulence.After the Bishop had observed the\nBishop of London manifesting disapproval of his sermon on "Revealed\nReligion" he went home and wrote: "What is this thing called Orthodoxy,\nwhich mars the fortunes of honest men?It is a sacred thing to which\nevery denomination of Christians lays exclusive claim, but to which no\nman, no assembly of men, since the apostolic age, can prove a title."There is now a Bishop of London who might not acknowledge the claim\neven for the apostolic age.The principles, apart from the particular\ncriticisms, of Paine\'s book have established themselves in the\nEnglish Church.They were affirmed by Bishop Wilson in clear language:\n"Christian duties are founded on reason, not on the sovereignty of God\ncommanding what he pleases: God cannot command us what is not fit to be\nbelieved or done, all his commands being founded in the necessities of\nour nature."It was on this principle that Paine declared that things\nin the Bible, "not fit to be believed or done," could not be divine\ncommands.His book, like its author, was outlawed, but men more heretical are\nnow buried in Westminster Abbey, and the lost bones of Thomas Paine are\nreally reposing in those tombs.It was he who compelled the hard and\nheartless Bibliolatry of his time to repair to illiterate conventicles,\nand the lovers of humanity, true followers of the man of Nazareth, to\nabandon the crumbling castle of dogma, preserving its creeds as archaic\nbric-a-brac.As his "Rights of Man" is now the political constitution\nof England, his "Age of Reason" is in the growing constitution of its\nChurch,--the most powerful organization in Christendom because the\nfreest and most inclusive.The excitement caused in England by the "Age of Reason," and the large\nnumber of attempted replies to it, were duly remarked by the _Moniteur_\nand other French journals.The book awakened much attention in France,\nand its principles were reproduced in a little French book entitled:\n"Manuel des Theoantropophiles."In\nJanuary, 1797, Paine, with five families, founded in Paris the church\nof Theo-philanthropy,--a word, as he stated in a letter to Erskine\n"compounded of three Greek words, signifying God, Love, and Man.The\nexplanation given to this word is _Lovers of God and Man, or Adorers of\nGod and Friends of Man._" The society opened "in the street Denis, No."The Theophilanthropists believe in\nthe existence of God, and the immortality of the soul."The inaugural\ndiscourse was given by Paine.It opens with these words: "Religion\nhas two principal enemies, Fanaticism and Infidelity, or that which\nis called atheism.The first requires to be combated by reason and\nmorality, the other by natural philosophy."The discourse is chiefly an\nargument for a divine existence based on motion, which, he maintains,\nis not a property of matter.It proves a Being "at the summit of all\nthings."At the close he says:\n\n"The society is at present in its infancy, and its means are small; but\nI wish to hold in view the subject I allude to, and instead of teaching\nthe philosophical branches of learning as ornamental branches only, as\nthey have hitherto been taught, to teach them in a manner that shall\ncombine theological knowledge with scientific instruction.To do this to\nthe best advantage, some instruments will be necessary for the purpose\nof explanation, of which the society is not yet possessed.But as the\nviews of the Society extend to public good, as well as to that of the\nindividual, and as its principles can have no enemies, means may be\ndevised to procure them.If we unite to the present instruction a series\nof lectures on the ground I have mentioned, we shall, in the first\nplace, render theology the most entertaining of all studies.In the\nnext place, we shall give scientific instruction to those who could\nnot otherwise obtain it.The mechanic of every profession will there be\ntaught the mathematical principles necessary to render him proficient\nin his art.The cultivator will there see developed the principles of\nvegetation; while, at the same time, they will be led to see the hand of\nGod in all these things."A volume of 214 pages put forth at the close of the year shows that the\nTheophilanthropists sang theistic and humanitarian hymns, and read Odes;\nalso that ethical readings were introduced from the Bible, and from\nthe Chinese, Hindu, and Greek authors.A library was established\n(rue Neuve-Etienne-l\'Estrapade, No.25) at which was issued (1797),\n"Instruction Elementaire sur la Morale religieuse,"--this being declared\nto be morality based on religion.{1797}\n\nThus Paine, pioneer in many things, helped to found the first theistic\nand ethical society.It may now be recognized as a foundation of the Religion of Humanity.It\nwas a great point with Paine that belief in the divine existence was the\none doctrine common to all religions.On this rock the Church of Man was\nto be built Having vainly endeavored to found the international Republic\nhe must repair to an ideal moral and human world.Robespierre and Pitt\nbeing unfraternal he will bring into harmony the sages of all races.It is a notable instance of Paine\'s unwillingness to bring a personal\ngrievance into the sacred presence of Humanity that one of the four\nfestivals of Theophilanthropy was in honor of Washington, while its\ncatholicity was represented in a like honor to St.The\nothers so honored were Socrates and Rousseau.These selections were no\ndoubt mainly due to the French members, but they could hardly have been\nmade without Paine\'s agreement.It is creditable to them all that, at a\ntime when France believed itself wronged by Washington, his services to\nliberty should alone have been remembered.The flowers of all races, as\nrepresented in literature or in history, found emblematic association\nwith the divine life in nature through the flowers that were heaped on\na simple altar, as they now are in many churches and chapels.The walls\nwere decorated with ethical mottoes, enjoining domestic kindness and\npublic benevolence.Paine\'s pamphlet of this year (1797) on "Agrarian Justice" should be\nconsidered part of the theophil-anthropic movement.It was written as a\nproposal to the French government, at a time when readjustment of landed\nproperty had been rendered necessary by the Revolution.*\n\n     * "Thomas Payne a la Legislature et au Directoire: ou la\n     Justice Agraire Opposee a la Loi et aux Privileges\n     Agraires."It was suggested by a sermon printed by the Bishop of Llandaff, on "The\nwisdom and goodness of God in having made both rich and poor."Paine\ndenies that God made rich and poor: "he made only male and female, and\ngave them the earth for their inheritance."The earth, though naturally\nthe equal possession of all, has been necessarily appropriated by\nindividuals, because their improvements, which alone render its\nproductiveness adequate to human needs, cannot be detached from the\nsoil.Paine maintains that these private owners do nevertheless owe\nmankind ground-rent.He therefore proposes a tithe,--not for God,\nbut for man.He advises that at the time when the owner will feel\nit least,--when property is passing by inheritance from one to\nanother,--the tithe shall be taken from it.Personal property also owes\na debt to society, without which wealth could not exist,--as in the case\nof one alone on an island.By a careful estimate he estimates that a\ntithe on inheritances would give every person, on reaching majority,\nfifteen pounds, and after the age of fifty an annuity of ten pounds,\nleaving a substantial surplus for charity.The practical scheme\nsubmitted is enforced by practical rather than theoretical\nconsiderations.Property is always imperilled by poverty, especially\nwhere wealth and splendor have lost their old fascinations, and awaken\nemotions of disgust."To remove the danger it is necessary to remove the antipathies, and\nthis can only be done by making property productive of a national\nblessing, extending to every individual When the riches of one man above\nanother shall increase the national fund in the same proportion; when it\nshall be seen that the prosperity of that fund depends on the prosperity\nof individuals; when the more riches a man acquires, the better it shall\nbe for the general mass; it is then that antipathies will cease, and\nproperty be placed on the permanent basis of national interest and\nprotection."I have no property in France to become subject to the plan I propose.What I have, which is not much, is in the United States of America.But\nI will pay one hundred pounds sterling towards this fund in France, the\ninstant it shall be established; and I will pay the same sum in England,\nwhenever a similar establishment shall take place in that country."The tithe was to be given to rich and poor alike, including owners of\nthe property tithed, in order that there should be no association of\nalms with this "agrarian justice."About this time the priesthood began to raise their heads again.A\nreport favorable to a restoration to them of the churches, the raising\nof bells, and some national recognition of public worship, was made by\nCamille Jordan for a committee on the subject The Jesuitical report was\nespecially poetical about church bells, which Paine knew would ring the\nknell of the Republic.He wrote a theophilanthropic letter to Camille\nJordan, from which I quote some paragraphs."You claim a privilege incompatible with the Constitution, and with\nRights.The Constitution protects equally, as it ought to do, every\nprofession of religion; it gives no exclusive privilege to any.The\nchurches are the common property of all the people; they are national\ngoods, and cannot be given exclusively to any one profession, because\nthe right does not exist of giving to any one that which appertains to\nall.It would be consistent with right that the churches should be sold,\nand the money arising therefrom be invested as a fund for the education\nof children of poor parents of every profession, and, if more than\nsufficient for this purpose, that the surplus be appropriated to the\nsupport of the aged poor.After this every profession can erect its own\nplace of worship, if it choose--support its own priests, if it choose to\nhave any--or perform its worship without priests, as the Quakers do.""It is a want of feeling to talk of priests and bells whilst so many\ninfants are perishing in the hospitals, and aged and infirm poor in the\nstreets.The abundance that France possesses is sufficient for every\nwant, if rightly applied; but priests and bells, like articles of\nluxury, ought to be the least articles of consideration.""No man ought to make a living by religion.Religion is not an act that can be performed by proxy.Every person must perform it for himself; and\nall that a priest can do is to take from him; he wants nothing but his\nmoney, and then to riot in the spoil and laugh at his credulity.The\nonly people who, as a professional sect of Christians, provide for the\npoor of their society, are people known by the name of Quakers.They assemble quietly in their places of worship,\nand do not disturb their neighbors with shows and noise of bells.Religion does not unite itself to show and noise."One good schoolmaster is of more use than a hundred priests.If we look\nback at what was the condition of France under the _ancien regime_ we\ncannot acquit the priests of corrupting the morals of the nation.""Why has the Revolution of France been stained with crimes, while the\nRevolution of the United States of America was not?Men are physically\nthe same in all countries; it is education that makes them different.Accustom a people to believe that priests, or any other class of men,\ncan forgive sins, and you will have sins in abundance."While Thomas Paine was thus founding; in Paris a religion of love to God\nexpressed in love to man, his enemies in England were illustrating\nby characteristic fruits the dogmas based on a human sacrifice.The\nascendency of the priesthood of one church over others, which he\nwas resisting in France, was exemplified across the channel in the\nprosecution of his publisher, and the confiscation of a thousand pounds\nwhich had somehow fallen due to Paine.* The "Age of Reason," amply\nadvertised by its opponents, had reached a vast circulation, and a\nprosecution of its publisher, Thomas Williams, for blasphemy, was\ninstituted in the King\'s Bench.Williams being a poor man, the defence\nwas sustained by a subscription.**\n\n     * This loss, mentioned by Paine in a private note, occurred\n     about the time when he had devoted the proceeds of his\n     pamphlet on English Finance, a very large sum, to prisoners\n     held for debt in Newgate.I suppose the thousand pounds were\n     the proceeds of the "Age of Reason."** Subscriptions (says his circular) will be received by J.\n     Ashley, Shoemaker, No.6 High Holborn; C. Cooper, Grocer,\n     New Compton St., Soho; G. Wilkinson, Printer, No.115\n     Shoreditch; J. Rhynd, Printer, Ray St., Clerkenwell; R.\n     Hodgson, Hatter, No.It will be\n     observed that the defence of free printing had fallen to\n     humble people.The extent to which the English reign\nof terror had gone was shown in the fact that Erskine was now the\nprosecutor; he who five years before had defended the "Rights of Man,"\nwho had left the court in a carriage drawn by the people, now stood\nin the same room to assail the most sacred of rights.He began with a\nmenace to the defendant\'s counsel (S. Kyd) on account of a notice served\non the prosecution, foreshadowing a search into the Scriptures.*\n\n     * "The King v. Thomas Williams for Blasphemy.--Take notice\n     that the Prosecutors of the Indictment against the above\n     named Defendant will upon the Trial of this cause be\n     required to produce a certain Book described in the said\n     Indictment to be the Holy Bible.--John Martin.Solicitor for\n     the Defendant.Dated the 17th day of June 1797.""No man," he cried, "deserves to be upon the Rolls of the Court who\ndares, as an Attorney, to put his name to such a notice.It is an insult\nto the authority and dignity of the Court of which he is an officer;\nsince it seems to call in question the very foundations of its\njurisdiction."So soon did Erskine point the satire of the fable he\nquoted from Lucian, in Paine\'s defence, of Jupiter answering arguments\nwith thunderbolts.Erskine\'s argument was that the King had taken a\nsolemn oath "to maintain the Christian Religion as it is promulgated by\nGod in the Holy Scriptures.""Every man has a right to investigate, with\nmodesty and decency, controversial points of the Christian religion; but\nno man, consistently with a law which only exists under its sanction,\nhas a right not only broadly to deny its very existence, but to pour\nforth a shocking and insulting invective, etc."The law, he said,\npermits, by a like principle, the intercourse between the sexes to\nbe set forth in plays and novels, but punishes such as "address the\nimagination in a manner to lead the passions into dangerous excesses."Erskine read several passages from the "Age of Reason," which, their\nmain point being omitted, seemed mere aimless abuse.In his speech, he\nquoted as Paine\'s words of his own collocation, representing the author\nas saying, "The Bible teaches nothing but \'lies, obscenity, cruelty,\nand injustice.\'"This is his entire and inaccurate rendering of\nwhat Paine,--who always distinguishes the "Bible" from the "New\nTestament,"--says at the close of his comment on the massacre of the\nMidianites and appropriation of their maidens:\n\n"People in general know not what wickedness there is in this pretended\nword of God.Brought up in habits of superstition, they take it for\ngranted that the Bible [Old Testament] is true, and that it is good;\nthey permit themselves not to doubt it; and they carry the ideas they\nform of the benevolence of the Almighty to the book they have been\ntaught to believe was written by his authority.it is a book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy;\nfor what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man\nto the orders of the Almighty?"Erskine argued that the sanction of Law was the oath by which judges,\njuries, witnesses administered law and justice under a belief in\n"the revelation of the unutterable blessings which shall attend their\nobservances, and the awful punishments which shall await upon their\ntransgressions."The rest of his opening argument was, mainly, that\ngreat men had believed in Christianity.Kyd, in replying, quoted from the Bishop of Llandaff\'s "Answer to\nGibbon": "I look upon the right of private judgment, in every respect\nconcerning God and ourselves, as superior to the control of human\nauthority"; and his claim that the Church of England is distinguished\nfrom Mahometanism and Romanism by its permission of every man to utter\nhis opinion freely.Waddington,\nthe Bishop of Chichester, who declared that Woolston "ought not to be\npunished for being an infidel, nor for writing against the Christian\nreligion."He quoted Paine\'s profession of faith on the first page of\nthe incriminated book: "I believe in one God and no more; I hope for\nhappiness, beyond this life; I believe in the equality of men, and I\nbelieve that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy,\nand endeavouring to make our fellow creatures happy."He also quoted\nPaine\'s homage to the character of Jesus.He defied the prosecution to\nfind in the "Age of Reason" a single passage "inconsistent with the\nmost chaste, the most correct system of morals," and declared the very\npassages selected for indictment pleas against obscenity and cruelty.Kyd pointed out fourteen narratives in the Bible (such as Sarah\ngiving Hagar to Abraham, Lot and his daughters, etc.)which, if found in\nany other book, would be pronounced obscene.He was about to enumerate\ninstances of cruelty when the judge, Lord Kenyon, indignantly\ninterrupted him, and with consent of the jury said he could only allow\nhim to cite such passages without reading them.Kyd gratefully\nacknowledged this release from the "painful task" of reading such\nhorrors from the "Word of God"!)One of the interesting things about\nthis trial was the disclosure of the general reliance on Butler\'s\n"Analogy," used by Bishop Watson in his reply to Paine,--namely, that\nthe cruelties objected to in the God of the Bible are equally found\nin nature, through which deists look up to their God.When Kyd, after\nquoting from Bishop Watson, said, "Gentlemen, observe the weakness of\nthis answer," Lord Kenyon exclaimed: "I cannot sit in this place and\nhear this kind of discussion."Kyd said: "My Lord, I stand here on the\nprivilege of an advocate in an English Court of Justice: this man has\napplied to me to defend him; I have undertaken his defence; and I have\noften heard your Lordship declare, that every man had a right to be\ndefended.I know no other mode by which I can seriously defend him\nagainst this charge, than that which I am now pursuing; if your Lordship\nwish to prevent me from pursuing it, you may as well tell me to abandon\nmy duty to my client at once."Lord Kenyon said: "Go on, Sir."Returning\nto the analogy of the divinely ordered massacres in the Bible with the\nlike in nature, Kyd said:\n\n"Gentlemen, this is reasoning by comparison; and reasoning by comparison\nis often fallacious.On the present occasion the fallacy is this: that,\nin the first case, the persons perish by the operation of the general\nlaws of nature, not suffering punishment for a crime; whereas, in the\nlatter, the general laws of nature are suspended or transgressed, and\nGod commands the slaughter to avenge his offended will.Is this then\na satisfactory answer to the objection?I think it is not; another may\nthink so too; which it may be fairly supposed the Author did; and then\nthe objection, as to him, remains in full force, and he cannot, from\ninsisting upon it, be fairly accused of malevolent intention."In his answer Erskine said: "The history of man is the history of man\'s\nvices and passions, which could not be censured without adverting to\ntheir existence; many of the instances that have been referred to were\nrecorded as memorable warnings and examples for the instruction of\nmankind."But for this argument Erskine was indebted to his old client,\nPaine, who did not argue against the things being recorded, but against\nthe belief "that the inhuman and horrid butcheries of men, women, and\nchildren, told of in those books, were done, as those books say they\nwere done, at the command of God."Paine says: "Those accounts are\nnothing to us, nor to any other persons, unless it be to the Jews, as\na part of the history of their nation; and there is just as much of\nthe word of God in those books as there is in any of the histories of\nFrance, or Rapin\'s \'History of England,\' or the history of any other\ncountry."As in Paines own trial in 1792, the infallible scheme of a special jury\nwas used against Williams.Lord Kenyon closed his charge with the words:\n"Unless it was for the most malignant purposes, I cannot conceive how it\nwas published.It is, however, for you to judge of it, and to do justice\nbetween the Public and the Defendant.""The jury instantly found the Defendant--Guilty."Paine at once wrote a letter to Erskine, which was first printed in\nParis.He calls attention to the injustice of the special jury system,\nin which all the jurymen are nominated by the crown.In London a special\njury generally consists of merchants."Talk to some London merchants\nabout scripture, and they will understand you mean scrip, and tell you\nhow much it is worth at the Stock Exchange.Ask them about Theology,\nand they will say they know no such gentleman upon \'Change."He also\ndeclares that Lord Kenyon\'s course in preventing Mr.Kyd from reading\npassages from the Bible was irregular, and contrary to words, which he\ncites, used by the same judge in another case.This Letter to Erskine contains some effective passages.In one of these\nhe points out the sophistical character of the indictment in declaring\nthe "Age of Reason" a blasphemous work, tending to bring in contempt\nthe holy scriptures."The charge should have stated that the work was\nintended to prove certain books not the holy scriptures.It is one\nthing if I ridicule a work as being written by a certain person; but it\nis quite a different thing if I write to prove that such a work was not\nwritten by such person.In the first case I attack the person through\nthe work; in the other case I defend the honour of the person against\nthe work."After alluding to the two accounts in Genesis of the creation\nof man, according to one of which there was no Garden of Eden and no\nforbidden tree, Paine says:\n\n"Perhaps I shall be told in the cant language of the day, as I have\noften been told by the Bishop of Llandaff and others, of the great and\nlaudable pains that many pious and learned men have taken to explain the\nobscure, and reconcile the contradictory, or, as they say, the seemingly\ncontradictory passages of the Bible.It is because the Bible needs such\nan undertaking, that is one of the first causes to suspect it is _not_\nthe word of God: this single reflection, when carried home to the mind,\nis in itself a volume.does not the Creator of the Universe, the\nFountain of all Wisdom, the Origin of all Science, the Author of all\nKnowledge, the God of Order and of Harmony, know how to write?When\nwe contemplate the vast economy of the creation, when we behold the\nunerring regularity of the visible solar system, the perfection with\nwhich all its several parts revolve, and by corresponding assemblage\nform a whole;--when we launch our eye into the boundless ocean of space,\nand see ourselves surrounded by innumerable worlds, not one of which\nvaries from its appointed place--when we trace the power of a Creator,\nfrom a mite to an elephant, from an atom to an universe, can we suppose\nthat the mind [which] could conceive such a design, and the power\nthat executed it with incomparable perfection, cannot write without\ninconsistence; or that a book so written can be the work of such a\npower?The writings of Thomas Paine, even of Thomas Paine, need no\ncommentator to explain, compound, arrange, and re-arrange their several\nparts, to render them intelligible--he can relate a fact, or write an\nessay, without forgetting in one page what he has written in another;\ncertainly then, did the God of all perfection condescend to write or\ndictate a book, that book would be as perfect as himself is perfect: The\nBible is not so, and it is confessedly not so, by the attempts to mend\nit."Paine admonishes Erskine that a prosecution to preserve God\'s word, were\nit really God\'s word, would be like a prosecution to prevent the sun\nfrom falling out of heaven; also that he should be able to comprehend\nthat the motives of those who declare the Bible not God\'s word\nare religious.He then gives him an account of the new church of\nTheophilanthropists in Paris, and appends his discourse before that\nsociety.In the following year, Paine\'s discourse to the Theophilanthropists was\nseparately printed by Clio Rickman, with a sentence from Shakespeare\nin the title-page: "I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the\nmorality of imprisonment" There was also the following dedication:\n\n"The following little Discourse is dedicated to the enemies of Thomas\nPaine, by one who has known him long and intimately, and who is\nconvinced that he is the enemy of no man.It is printed to do good, by\na well wisher to the world.By one who thinks that discussion should\nbe unlimited, that all coercion is error; and that human beings should\nadopt no other conduct towards each other but an appeal to truth and\nreason."Paine wrote privately, in the same sense as to Erskine, to his\nremonstrating friends.In one such letter (May 12th) he goes again\npartly over the ground."You," he says, "believe in the Bible from the\naccident of birth, and the Turks believe in the Koran from the same\naccident, and each calls the other _infidel_.This answer to your letter\nis not written for the purpose of changing your opinion.It is written\nto satisfy you, and some other friends whom I esteem, that my disbelief\nof the Bible is founded on a pure and religious belief in God.""All\nare infidels who believe falsely of God.""Belief in a cruel God makes a\ncruel man."Paine had for some time been attaining unique fame in England.Some\npublisher had found it worth while to issue a book, entitled "Tom\nPaine\'s Jests: Being an entirely new and select Collection of Patriotic\nBon Mots, Repartees, Anecdotes, Epigrams, &c, on Political Subjects.There are hardly a half dozen items by Paine in the book\n(72 pages), which shows that his name was considered marketable.The\ngovernment had made the author a cause.Erskine, who had lost his office\nas Attorney-General for the Prince of Wales by becoming Paine\'s counsel\nin 1792, was at once taken back into favor after prosecuting the "Age of\nReason," and put on his way to become Lord Erskine.The imprisonment of\nWilliams caused a reaction in the minds of those who had turned\nagainst Paine.The terror\nmanifested at the name of Paine--some were arrested even for showing his\nportrait--was felt to be political.None of the aristocratic deists, who\nwrote for the upper classes, were dealt with in the same way.Paine had\nproclaimed from the housetops what, as Dr.Watson confessed, scholars\nwere whispering in the ear.There were lampoons of Paine, such as\nthose of Peter Pindar (Rev.John Wolcott), but they only served to\nwhet popular curiosity concerning him.* The "Age of Reason" had passed\nthrough several editions before it was outlawed, and every copy of it\npassed through many hands.From the prosecution and imprisonment of\nWilliams may be dated the consolidation of the movement for the\n"Rights of Man," with antagonism to the kind of Christianity which\nthat injustice illustrated.Political liberalism and heresy thenceforth\nprogressed in England, hand in hand.* "I have preserved," says Royall Tyler, "an epigram of\n     Peter Pindar\'s, written originally in a blank leaf of a copy\n     of Paine\'s \'Age of Reason,\' and not inserted in any of his\n     works."\'Tommy Paine wrote this book to prove that the bible Was an old woman\'s\ndream of fancies most idle; That Solomon\'s proverbs were made by low\nlivers, That prophets were fellows who sang semiquavers; That religion\nand miracles all were a jest, And the devil in torment a tale of the\npriest.Though Beelzebub\'s absence from hell I \'ll maintain!Yet we all\nmust allow that the Devil\'s in Paine.\'"THE REPUBLICAN ABDIEL\n\nThe sight of James Monroe and Thomas Paine in France, representing\nRepublican America, was more than Gouverneur Morris could stand.He sent\nto Washington the abominable slander of Monroe already quoted (ii., p.173), and the Minister\'s recall came at the close of 1796.* Monroe\ncould not sail in midwinter with his family, so they remained until\nthe following spring.Paine made preparations to return to America\nwith them, and accompanied them to Havre; but he found so many "british\nfrigates cruising in sight" (so he writes Jefferson) that he did not\n"trust [himself] to their discretion, and the more so as [he] had no\nconfidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet" Sure enough this Captain\nClay was friendly enough with the British cruiser which lay in wait\nto catch Paine, but only succeeded in finding his letter to Jefferson.Before returning from Havre to Paris he wrote another letter to\nVice-President Jefferson.* This sudden recall involved Monroe in heavy expenses,\n     which Congress afterwards repaid.Frederick McGuire, of Washington, for the manuscript of\n     Monroe\'s statement of his expenses and annoyances caused by\n     his recall, which he declares due to "the representations\n     which were made to him [Washington] by those in whom he\n     confided."He states that Paine remained in his house a year\n     and a half, and that be advanced him 250 louis d\'or.For\n     these services to Paine, he adds, "no claims were ever\n     presented on my part, nor is any indemnity now desired."This money was repaid ($1,188) to Monroe by an Act of\n     Congress, April 7, 1831.The advances are stated in the Act\n     to have been made "from time to time," and were no doubt\n     regarded by both Paine and Monroe as compensated by the many\n     services rendered by the author to the Legation."Havre, May 14th, 1797."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you by the Ship Dublin Packet, Captain Clay,\nmentioning my intention to have returned to America by that Vessel, and\nto have suggested to some Member of the House of Representatives the\npropriety of calling Mr.Monroe before them to have enquired into the\nstate of their affairs in France.This might have laid the foundation\nfor some resolves on their part that might have led to an accommodation\nwith France, for that House is the only part of the American Government\nthat have any reputation here.Monroe of my design, and\nhe wishes to be called up."You will have heard before this reaches you that the Emperor has been\nobliged to sue for peace, and to consent to the establishment of the new\nrepublic in Lombardy.How France will proceed with respect to England,\nI am not, at this distance from Paris, in the way of knowing, but am\ninclined to think she meditates a descent upon that Country, and a\nrevolution in its Government.If this should be the plan, it will keep\nme in Europe at least another year."As the british party has thrown the American commerce into wretched\nconfusion, it is necessary to pay more attention to the appointment of\nConsuls in the ports of france, than there was occasion to do in time\nof peace; especially as there is now no Minister, and Mr.Skipwith,\nwho stood well with the Government here, has resigned.Cutting, the\nConsul for Havre, does not reside at it, and the business is altogether\nin the hands of De la Motte, the Vice Consul, who is a frenchman, [and]\ncannot have the full authority proper for the office in the difficult\nstate matters are now in.I do not mention this to the disadvantage of\nMr.Cutting, for no man is more proper than himself if he thought it an\nobject to attend to."I know not if you are acquainted with Captain Johnson of\nMassachusetts--he is a staunch man and one of the oldest American\nCaptains in the American employ.He is now settled at Havre and is a\nmore proper man for a Vice Consul than La Motte.He has written to some of his friends to have\nthe appointment and if you can see an opportunity of throwing in a\nlittle service for him, you will do a good thing.He would be well received as an\nindividual, but as an Envoy of John Adams he could do nothing.The following, in Paine\'s handwriting, is copied from the original in\nthe Morrison papers, at the British Museum.It was written in the summer\nof 1797, when Lord Malmsbury was at Lille in negotiation for peace.The negotiations were broken off because the English commissioners were\nunauthorized to make the demanded restorations to Holland and Spain.Paine\'s essay was no doubt sent to the Directory in the interests of\npeace, suggesting as it does a compromise, as regards the Cape of Good\nHope."Cape of Good Hope.--It is very well known that Dun-das, the English\nMinister for Indian affairs, is tenacious of holding the Cape of Good\nHope, because it will give to the English East India Company a monopoly\nof the commerce of India; and this, on the other hand, is the very\nreason that such a claim is inadmissible by France, and by all the\nnations trading in India and to Canton, and would also be injurious to\nCanton itself.--We pretend not to know anything of the negociations at\nLille, but it is very easy to see, from the nature of the case, what\nought to be the condition of the Cape.It ought to be a free port open\nto the vessels of all nations trading to any part of the East Indias.It\nought also to be a neutral port at all times, under the guarantee of\nall nations; the expense of keeping the port in constant repair to\nbe defrayed by a tonnage tax to be paid by every vessel, whether\nof commerce or of war, and in proportion to the time of their\nstay.--Nothing then remains but with respect to the nation who shall be\nthe port-master; and this ought to be the Dutch, because they understand\nthe business best.As the Cape is a half-way stage between Europe and\nIndia, it ought to be considered as a tavern, where travellers on a long\njourney put up for rest and refreshment.--T.The suspension of peace negotiations,* and the bloodless defeat of\nPichigru\'s conspiracy of 18 Fructidor (September 4th) were followed by a\npamphlet addressed to "The People of France and the French Armies."This\nlittle work is of historical value, in connection with 18 Fructidor, but\nit was evidently written to carry two practical points.The first was,\nthat if the war with England must continue it should be directed to the\nend of breaking the Anglo-Germanic compact.England has the right to\nher internal arrangements, but this is an external matter.While "with\nrespect to England it has been the cause of her immense national debt,\nthe ruin of her finances, and the insolvency of her bank," English\nintrigues on the continent "are generated by, and act through, the\nmedium of this Anglo-Germanic compound.Let the elector retire to his electorate, and the world will have\npeace."Paine\'s other main point is, that the neutral nations should\nsecure, in time of war, an unarmed neutrality.* In a letter to Duane, many years later, Paine relates the\n     following story concerning the British Union: "When Lord\n     Malmsbury arrived in Paris, in the time of the Directory\n     Government, to open a negociation for a peace, his\n     credentials ran in the old style of \'George, by the grace of\n     God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, king.\'Malmsbury\n     was informed that although the assumed title of king of\n     France, in his credentials, would not prevent France opening\n     a negociation, yet that no treaty of peace could be\n     concluded until that assumed title was removed.Pitt then\n     hit on the Union.Bill, under which the assumed title of\n     king of France was discontinued.""Were the neutral nations to associate, under an honorable injunction of\nfidelity to each other, and publickly declare to the world, that if any\nbelligerent power shall seize or molest any ship or vessel belonging\nto the citizens or subjects of any of the powers composing that\nassociation, that the whole association will shut its ports against the\nflag of the offending nation, and will not permit any goods, wares,\nor merchandize, produced or manufactured in the offending nation, or\nappertaining thereto, to be imported into any of the ports']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Within a fortnight of that day Gabriel Carew\'s passions were roused to\nan almost uncontrollable pitch.It was evening, and he saw Eric and Emilius in the woods.They were\nconversing with more than ordinary animation, and appeared to be\ndiscussing some question upon which they did not agree.Carew saw\nsigns which he could not interpret--appeals, implorings, evidences of\nstrong feeling on one side and of humbleness on the other, despair\nfrom one, sorrow from the other; and then suddenly a phase which\nstartled the watcher and filled him with a savage joy.Eric, in a\nparoxysm, laid hands furiously upon his brother, and it seemed for a\nmoment as if a violent struggle were about to take place.It was to the restraint and moderation of Emilius that this\nunbrotherly conflict was avoided.He did not meet violence with\nviolence; after a pause he gently lifted Eric\'s hands from his\nshoulders, and with a sad look turned away, Eric gazing at his\nretreating figure in a kind of bewilderment.Presently Emilius was\ngone, and only Eric remained.From an opposite direction to that taken by\nEmilius the watcher saw approaching the form of the woman he loved,\nand to whom he was shortly to be wed.That her coming was not\naccidental, but in fulfilment of a promise was clear to Gabriel Carew.Eric expected her, and welcomed her without surprise.Then the two\nbegan to converse.Carew\'s heart beat tumultuously; he would have given worlds to hear\nwhat was being said, but he was at too great a distance for a word to\nreach his ears.For a time Eric was the principal speaker, Lauretta,\nfor the most part, listening, and uttering now and then merely a word\nor two.In her quiet way she appeared to be as deeply agitated as the\nyoung man who was addressing her in an attitude of despairing appeal.Again and again it seemed as if he had finished what he had to say,\nand again and again he resumed, without abatement of the excitement\nunder which he was labouring.At length he ceased, and then Lauretta\nbecame the principal actor in the scene.She spoke long and forcibly,\nbut always with that gentleness of manner which was one of her\nsweetest characteristics.In her turn she seemed to be appealing to\nthe young man, and to be endeavouring to impress upon him a sad and\nbitter truth which he was unwilling, and not in the mood, to\nrecognise.For a long time she was unsuccessful; the young man walked\nimpatiently a few steps from her, then returned, contrite and humble,\nbut still with all the signs of great suffering upon him.At length\nher words had upon him the effect she desired; he wavered, he held out\nhis hands helplessly, and presently covered his face with them and\nsank to the ground.Then, after a silence, during which Lauretta gazed\ncompassionately upon his convulsed form, she stooped and placed her\nhand upon his shoulder.He lifted his eyes, from which the tears were\nflowing, and raised himself from the earth.He stood before her with\nbowed head, and she continued to speak.The pitiful sweetness of her\nface almost drove Carew mad; it could not be mistaken that her heart\nwas beating with sympathy for Eric\'s sufferings.A few minutes more\npassed, and then it seemed as if she had prevailed.Eric accepted the\nhand she held out to him, and pressed his lips upon it.Had he at that\nmoment been within Gabriel Carew\'s reach, it would have fared ill with\nboth these men, but Heaven alone knows whether it would have averted\nwhat was to follow before the setting of another sun, to the\nconsternation and grief of the entire village.After pressing his lips\nto Lauretta\'s hand, the pair separated, each going a different way,\nand Gabriel Carew ground his teeth as he observed that there were\ntears in Lauretta\'s eyes as well as in Eric\'s.A darkness fell upon\nhim as he walked homewards.V.\n\n\nThe following morning Nerac and the neighbourhood around were agitated\nby news of a tragedy more thrilling and terrible than that in which\nthe hunchback and his companion in crime were concerned.In attendance\nupon this tragedy, and preceding its discovery, was a circumstance\nstirring enough in its way in the usually quiet life of the simple\nvillagers, but which, in the light of the mysterious tragedy, would\nhave paled into insignificance had it not been that it appeared to\nhave a direct bearing upon it.Martin Hartog\'s daughter, Patricia, had\nfled from her home, and was nowhere to be discovered.This flight was made known to the villagers early in the morning by\nthe appearance among them of Martin Hartog, demanding in which house\nhis daughter had taken refuge.The man was distracted; his wild words\nand actions excited great alarm, and when he found that he could\nobtain no satisfaction from them, and that every man and woman in\nNerac professed ignorance of his daughter\'s movements, he called down\nheaven\'s vengeance upon the man who had betrayed her, and left them to\nsearch the woods for Patricia.The words he had uttered in his imprecations when he called upon a\nhigher power for vengeance on a villain opened the villagers\' eyes.Who was the monster who had\nworked this evil?While they were talking excitedly together they saw Gabriel Carew\nhurrying to the house of Father Daniel.He was admitted, and in the\ncourse of a few minutes emerged from it in the company of the good\npriest, whose troubled face denoted that he had heard the sad news of\nPatricia\'s flight from her father\'s home.The villagers held aloof\nfrom Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew, seeing that they were in earnest\nconverse.Carew was imparting to the priest his suspicions of Eric and\nEmilius in connection with this event; he did not mention Lauretta\'s\nname, but related how on several occasions he had been an accidental\nwitness of meetings between Patricia and one or other of the brothers."It was not for me to place a construction upon these meetings," said\nCarew, "nor did it appear to me that I was called upon to mention it\nto any one.It would have been natural for me to suppose that Martin\nHartog was fully acquainted with his daughter\'s movements, and that,\nbeing of an independent nature, he would have resented any\ninterference from me.He is Patricia\'s father, and it was believed by\nall that he guarded her well.Had he been my equal I might have\nincidentally asked whether there was anything serious between his\ndaughter and these brothers, but I am his master, and therefore was\nprecluded from inviting a confidence which can only exist between men\noccupying the same social condition.There is, besides, another reason\nfor my silence which, if you care to hear, I will impart to you.""Nothing should be concealed from me," said Father Daniel."Although," said Gabriel Carew, "I have been a resident here now for\nsome time, I felt, and feel, that a larger knowledge of me is\nnecessary to give due and just weight to the unfavourable opinion I\nhave formed of two men with whom you have been acquainted from\nchildhood, and who hold a place in your heart of which they are\nutterly unworthy.Not alone in your heart, but in the hearts of my\ndearest friends, Doctor Louis and his family."You refer to Eric and Emilius," said the priest."What you have already said concerning them has deeply pained me.Their meetings with Hartog\'s daughter were,\nI am convinced, innocent.They are incapable of an act of baseness;\nthey are of noble natures, and it is impossible that they should ever\nhave harboured a thought of treachery to a young maiden.""I am more than justified," said Gabriel Carew, "by the expression of\nyour opinion, in the course I took.You would have listened with\nimpatience to me, and what I should have said would have recoiled on\nmyself.Yet now I regret that I did not interfere; this calamity might\nhave been avoided, and a woman\'s honour saved.Let us seek Martin\nHartog; he may be in possession of information to guide us."From the villagers they learnt that Hartog had gone to the woods, and\nthey were about to proceed in that direction when another, who had\njust arrived, informed them that he had seen Hartog going to Gabriel\nCarew\'s house.Thither they proceeded, and found Hartog in his\ncottage.He was on his knees, when they entered, before a box in which\nhis daughter kept her clothes.This he had forced open, and was\nsearching.He looked wildly at Father Daniel and Carew, and\nimmediately resumed his task, throwing the girl\'s clothes upon the\nfloor after examining the pockets.In his haste and agitation he did\nnot observe a portrait which he had cast aside, Carew picked it up and\nhanded it to Father Daniel."Who is the more\nlikely to be right in our estimate of these brothers, you or I?"Father Daniel, overwhelmed by the evidence, did not reply.By this\ntime Martin Hartog had found a letter which he was eagerly perusing."If there is justice in heaven he has\nmet with his deserts.If he still lives he shall die by my hands!""Vengeance is not yours to deal\nout.Pray for comfort--pray for mercy."If the monster be not already smitten, Lord, give him into\nmy hands!The\ncunning villain has not even signed his name!"Father Daniel took the letter from his unresisting hand, and as his\neyes fell upon the writing he started and trembled.It was indeed the writing of Emilius.Martin Hartog had heard Carew\'s\ninquiry and the priest\'s reply.And without another word he rushed\nfrom the cottage.Carew and the priest hastily followed him, but he\noutstripped them, and was soon out of sight."There will be a deed of violence done," said Father Daniel, "if the\nmen meet.I must go immediately to the house of these unhappy brothers\nand warn them."Carew accompanied him, but when they arrived at the house they were\ninformed that nothing had been seen of Eric and Emilius since the\nprevious night.Neither of them had been home nor slept in his bed.This seemed to complicate the mystery in Father Daniel\'s eyes,\nalthough it was no mystery to Carew, who was convinced that where\nPatricia was there would Emilius be found.Father Daniel\'s grief and\nhorror were clearly depicted.He looked upon the inhabitants of Nerac\nas one family, and he regarded the dishonour of Martin Hartog\'s\ndaughter as dishonour to all.Carew, being anxious to see Lauretta,\nleft him to his inquiries.Louis and his family were already\nacquainted with the agitating news."Dark clouds hang over this once happy village," said Doctor Louis to\nCarew.He was greatly shocked, but he had no hesitation in declaring that,\nalthough circumstances looked black against the twin brothers, his\nfaith in them was undisturbed.Lauretta shared his belief, and\nLauretta\'s mother also.Gabriel Carew did not combat with them; he\nheld quietly to his views, convinced that in a short time they would\nthink as he did.Lauretta was very pale, and out of consideration for\nher Gabriel Carew endeavoured to avoid the all-engrossing subject.Nothing else could be thought or spoken\nof.Once Carew remarked\nto Lauretta, "You said that Eric and Emilius had a secret, and you\ngave me to understand that you were not ignorant of it.Has it any\nconnection with what has occurred?""I must not answer you, Gabriel," she replied; "when we see Emilius\nagain all will be explained."Little did she suspect the awful import of those simple words.In\nCarew\'s mind the remembrance of the story of Kristel and Silvain was\nvery vivid."Were Eric and Emilius true friends?"Lauretta looked at him piteously; her lips quivered."They are\nbrothers," she said.She gazed at him in tender surprise; for weeks past he had not been so\nhappy.The trouble by which he had been haunted took flight."And yet," he could not help saying, "you have a secret, and you keep\nit from me!"His voice was almost gay; there was no touch of reproach in it."The secret is not mine, Gabriel," she said, and she allowed him to\npass his arm around her; her head sank upon his breast."When you know\nall, you will approve," she murmured."As I trust you, so must you\ntrust me."Their lips met; perfect confidence and faith were established between\nthem, although on Lauretta\'s side there had been no shadow on the love\nshe gave him.It was late in the afternoon when Carew was informed that Father\nDaniel wished to speak to him privately.He kissed Lauretta and went\nout to the priest, in whose face he saw a new horror."I should be the first to tell them," said Father Daniel in a husky\nvoice, "but I am not yet strong enough."No," replied the priest, "but Eric is.I would not have him removed\nuntil the magistrate, who is absent and has been sent for, arrives.In a state of wonder Carew accompanied Father Daniel out of Doctor\nLouis\'s house, and the priest led the way to the woods."We have passed the\nhouse in which the brothers live."The sun was setting, and the light was quivering on the tops of the\ndistant trees.Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew plunged into the woods.There were scouts on the outskirts, to whom the priest said, "Has the\nmagistrate arrived?""No, father," was the answer, "we expect him every moment."From that moment until they arrived at the spot to which Father Daniel\nled him, Carew was silent.What had passed between him and Lauretta\nhad so filled his soul with happiness that he bestowed but little\nthought upon a vulgar intrigue between a peasant girl and men whom he\nhad long since condemned.They no longer troubled him; they had passed\nfor ever out of his life, and his heart was at rest.Father Daniel and\nhe walked some distance into the shadows of the forest and the night.Before him he saw lights in the hands of two villagers who had\nevidently been stationed there to keep guard."Yes," he replied, "it is I."He conducted Gabriel Carew to a spot, and pointed downwards with his\nfinger; and there, prone and still upon the fallen leaves, lay the\nbody of Eric stone dead, stabbed to the heart!"Martin Hartog," said the priest, "is in custody on suspicion of this\nruthless murder.""What evidence is there to incriminate\nhim?""When the body was first discovered," said the priest, "your gardener\nwas standing by its side.Upon being questioned his answer was, \'If\njudgment has not fallen upon the monster, it has overtaken his\nbrother.The brood should be wiped off the face of the earth.\'Gabriel Carew was overwhelmed by the horror of this discovery.The\nmeeting between the brothers, of which he had been a secret witness on\nthe previous evening, and during which Eric had laid violent hands on\nEmilius, recurred to him.He had not spoken of it, nor did he mention\nit now.If Martin Hartog confessed his guilt\nthe matter was settled; if he did not, the criminal must be sought\nelsewhere, and it would be his duty to supply evidence which would\ntend to fix the crime upon Emilius.He did not believe Martin Hartog\nto be guilty; he had already decided within himself that Emilius had\nmurdered Eric, and that the tragedy of Kristel and Silvain had been\nrepeated in the lives of Silvain\'s sons.There was a kind of\nretribution in this which struck Gabriel Carew with singular force."Useless," he thought, "to fly from a fate which is preordained.When\nhe recovered from the horror which had fallen on him upon beholding\nthe body of Eric, he asked Father Daniel at what hour of the day the\nunhappy man had been killed."That," said Father Daniel, "has yet to be determined.No doctor has\nseen the body, but the presumption is that when Martin Hartog,\nanimated by his burning craving for vengeance, of which we were both a\nwitness, rushed from his cottage, he made his way to the woods, and\nthat he here unhappily met the brother of the man whom he believed to\nbe the betrayer of his daughter.The arrival of the magistrate put a stop to the conversation.He\nlistened to what Father Daniel had to relate, and some portions of the\npriest\'s explanations were corroborated by Gabriel Carew.The\nmagistrate then gave directions that the body of Eric should be\nconveyed to the courthouse; and he and the priest and Carew walked\nback to the village together."The village will become notorious," he remarked."Is there an\nepidemic of murder amongst us that this one should follow so closely\nupon the heels of the other?"Then, after a pause, he asked Father\nDaniel whether he believed Martin Hartog to be guilty."I believe no man to be guilty," said the priest, "until he is proved\nso incontrovertibly."I bear in remembrance," said the magistrate, "that you would not\nsubscribe to the general belief in the hunchback\'s guilt.""Nor do I now," said Father Daniel."And you," said the magistrate, turning to Gabriel Carew, "do you\nbelieve Hartog to be guilty?""This is not the time or place," said Carew, "for me to give\nexpression to any suspicion I may entertain.The first thing to be\nsettled is Hartog\'s complicity in this murder.""Father Daniel believes," continued Carew, "that Eric was murdered\nto-day, within the last hour or two."The doctors will decide that," said the magistrate."If the deed was\nnot, in your opinion, perpetrated within the last few hours, when do\nyou suppose it was done?""Have you any distinct grounds for the belief?"You have asked me a question which I have answered.There is no\nmatter of absolute knowledge involved in it; if there were I should be\nable to speak more definitely.Until the doctors pronounce there is\nnothing more to be said.But I may say this: if Hartog is proved to be\ninnocent, I may have something to reveal in the interests of justice."The magistrate nodded and said, "By the way, where is Emilius, and\nwhat has he to say about it?""Neither Eric nor Emilius," replied Father Daniel, "slept at home last\nnight, and since yesterday evening Emilius has not been seen.""Nothing is known of him," said Father Daniel."Inquiries have been\nmade, but nothing satisfactory has been elicited."The magistrate glanced at Carew, and for a little while was silent.Shortly after they reached the court-house the doctors presented their\nreport.In their opinion Eric had been dead at least fourteen or\nfifteen hours, certainly for longer than twelve.This disposed of the\ntheory that he had been killed in the afternoon.Their belief was that\nthe crime was committed shortly after midnight.In that case Martin\nHartog must be incontestably innocent.He was able to account for\nevery hour of the previous day and night.He was out until near\nmidnight; he was accompanied home, and a friend sat up with him till\nlate, both keeping very quiet for fear of disturbing Patricia, who was\nsupposed to be asleep in her room, but who before that time had most\nlikely fled from her home.Moreover, it was proved that Martin Hartog\nrose in the morning at a certain time, and that it was only then that\nhe became acquainted with the disappearance of his daughter.Father\nDaniel and Gabriel Carew were present when the magistrate questioned\nHartog.The man seemed indifferent as to his fate, but he answered\nquite clearly the questions put to him.He had not left his cottage\nafter going to bed on the previous night; he believed his daughter to\nbe in her room, and only this morning discovered his mistake.After\nhis interview with Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew he rushed from the\ncottage in the hope of meeting with Emilius, whom he intended to kill;\nhe came upon the dead body of Eric in the woods, and his only regret\nwas that it was Eric and not Emilius."If the villain who has dishonoured me were here at this moment," said\nMartin Hartog, "I would strangle him.No power should save him from my\njust revenge!"The magistrate ordered him to be set at liberty, and he wandered out\nof the court-house a hopeless and despairing man.Then the magistrate\nturned to Carew, and asked him, now that Hartog was proved to be\ninnocent, what he had to reveal that might throw light upon the crime.Carew, after some hesitation, related what he had seen the night\nbefore when Emilius and Eric were together in the forest."But," said the magistrate, "the brothers were known to be on the most\nloving terms.""So," said Carew, "were their father, Silvain, and his brother Kristel\nuntil a woman stepped between them.Upon this matter, however, it is\nnot for me to speak."I have heard something of the story of these hapless brothers," said\nthe magistrate, pondering, "but am not acquainted with all the\nparticulars.Carew then asked that he should be allowed to go for Doctor Louis, his\nobject being to explain to the doctor, on their way to the magistrate,\nhow it was that reference had been made to the story of Silvain and\nKristel which he had heard from the doctor\'s lips.He also desired to\nhint to Doctor Louis that Lauretta might be in possession of\ninformation respecting Eric and Emilius which might be useful in\nclearing up the mystery."You have acted right," said Doctor Louis sadly to Gabriel Carew; "at\nall risks justice must be done.And\nis this to be the end of that fated family?I cannot believe that\nEmilius can be guilty of a crime so horrible!"His distress was so keen that Carew himself, now that he was freed\nfrom the jealousy by which he had been tortured with respect to\nLauretta, hoped also that Emilius would be able to clear himself of\nthe charge hanging over him.But when they arrived at the magistrate\'s\ncourt they were confronted by additional evidence which seemed to tell\nheavily against the absent brother.A witness had come forward who\ndeposed that, being out on the previous night very late, and taking a\nshort cut through the woods to his cottage, he heard voices of two men\nwhich he recognised as the voices of Emilius and Eric.They were\nraised in anger, and one--the witness could not say which--cried out,\n\n"Well, kill me, for I do not wish to live!"Upon being asked why he did not interpose, his answer was that he did\nnot care to mix himself up with a desperate quarrel; and that as he\nhad a family he thought the best thing he could do was to hasten home\nas quickly as possible.Having told all he knew he was dismissed, and\nbade to hold himself in readiness to repeat his evidence on a future\noccasion.Then the magistrate heard what Doctor Louis had to say, and summed up\nthe whole matter thus:\n\n"The reasonable presumption is, that the brothers quarrelled over some\nlove affair with a person at present unknown; for although Martin\nHartog\'s daughter has disappeared, there is nothing as yet to connect\nher directly with the affair.Whether premeditatedly, or in a fit of\nungovernable passion, Emilius killed his brother and fled.If he does\nnot present himself to-morrow morning in the village he must be sought\nfor.It was a melancholy night for all, to Carew in a lesser degree than to\nthe others, for the crime which had thrown gloom over the whole\nvillage had brought ease to his heart.He saw now how unreasonable had\nbeen his jealousy of the brothers, and he was disposed to judge them\nmore leniently.On that night Doctor Louis held a private conference with Lauretta,\nand received from her an account of the unhappy difference between the\nbrothers.As Silvain and Kristel had both loved one woman, so had Eric\nand Emilius, but in the case of the sons there had been no supplanting\nof the affections.Emilius and Patricia had long loved each other, and\nhad kept their love a secret, Eric himself not knowing it.When\nEmilius discovered that his brother loved Patricia his distress of\nmind was very great, and it was increased by the knowledge that was\nforced upon him that there was in Eric\'s passion for the girl\nsomething of the fierce quality which had distinguished Kristel\'s\npassion for Avicia.In his distress he had sought advice from\nLauretta, and she had undertaken to act as an intermediary, and to\nendeavour to bring Eric to reason.On two or three occasions she\nthought she had succeeded, but her influence over Eric lasted only as\nlong as he was in her presence.He made promises which he found it\nimpossible to keep, and he continued to hope against hope.Lauretta\ndid not know what had passed between the brothers on the previous\nevening, in the interview of which I was a witness, but earlier in the\nday she had seen Emilius, who had confided a secret to her keeping\nwhich placed Eric\'s love for Patricia beyond the pale of hope.He was\nsecretly married to Patricia, and had been so for some time.When\nGabriel Carew heard this he recognised how unjust he had been towards\nEmilius and Patricia in the construction he had placed upon their\nsecret interviews.Lauretta advised Emilius to make known his marriage\nto Eric, and offered to reveal the fact to the despairing lover, but\nEmilius would not consent to this being immediately done.He\nstipulated that a week should pass before the revelation was made;\nthen, he said, it might be as well that all the world should know\nit--a fatal stipulation, against which Lauretta argued in vain.Thus\nit was that in the last interview between Eric and Lauretta, Eric was\nstill in ignorance of the insurmountable bar to his hopes.As it\nsubsequently transpired, Emilius had made preparations to remove\nPatricia from Nerac that very night.Up to that point, and at that\ntime nothing more was known; but when Emilius was tried for the murder\nLauretta\'s evidence did not help to clear him, because it established\nbeyond doubt the fact of the existence of an animosity between the\nbrothers.On the day following the discovery of the murder, Emilius did not make\nhis appearance in the village, and officers were sent in search of\nhim.There was no clue as to the direction which he and Patricia had\ntaken, and the officers, being slow-witted, were many days before they\nsucceeded in finding him.Their statement, upon their return to Nerac\nwith their prisoner, was, that upon informing him of the charge\nagainst him, he became violently agitated and endeavoured to escape.He denied that he made such an attempt, asserting that he was\nnaturally agitated by the awful news, and that for a few minutes he\nscarcely knew what he was doing, but, being innocent, there was no\nreason why he should make a fruitless endeavour to avoid an inevitable\ninquiry into the circumstances of a most dreadful crime.No brother, he declared, had\never been more fondly loved than Eric was by him, and he would have\nsuffered a voluntary death rather than be guilty of an act of violence\ntowards one for whom he entertained so profound an affection.In the\npreliminary investigations he gave the following explanation of all\nwithin his knowledge.What Lauretta had stated was true in every\nparticular; neither did he deny Carew\'s evidence nor the evidence of\nthe villager who had deposed that, late on the night of the murder,\nhigh words had passed between him and Eric."The words," said Emilius, "\'Well, kill me, for I do not wish to\nlive!\'were uttered by my poor brother when I told him that Patricia\nwas my wife.For although I had not intended that this should be known\nuntil a few days after my departure, my poor brother was so worked up\nby his love for my wife, that I felt I dared not, in justice to him\nand myself, leave him any longer in ignorance.For that reason, and\nthus impelled, pitying him most deeply, I revealed to him the truth.Had the witness whose evidence, true as it is, seems to bear fatally\nagainst me, waited and listened, he would have been able to testify in\nmy favour.My poor brother for a time was overwhelmed by the\nrevelation.His love for my wife perhaps did not die immediately away;\nbut, high-minded and honourable as he was, he recognised that to\npersevere in it would be a guilty act.The force of his passion became\nless; he was no longer violent--he was mournful.He even, in a\ndespairing way, begged my forgiveness, and I, reproachful that I had\nnot earlier confided in him, begged _his_ forgiveness for the\nunconscious wrong I had done him.Then, after a while, we fell\ninto our old ways of love; tender words were exchanged; we clasped\neach other\'s hand; we embraced.Truly you who hear me can scarcely\nrealise what Eric and I had always been to each other.More than\nbrothers--more like lovers.Heartbroken as he was at the conviction\nthat the woman he adored was lost to him, I was scarcely less\nheartbroken that I had won her.And so, after an hour\'s loving\nconverse, I left him; and when we parted, with a promise to meet again\nwhen his wound was healed, we kissed each other as we had done in the\ndays of our childhood."RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LONDON AND BUNGAY.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Secret Inheritance  (Volume 2 of 3), by\nB. L.Thrice happy he, who here partakes\n    That Sacred Stream, that Heavenly Food.This is the Prayer-Book aspect, which deals with the "_Administration_\nof the Lord\'s Supper"; which bids us "feed upon Him (not it) in our\nhearts by faith," and not by sight; which speaks of the elements as\nGod\'s "creatures of Bread and Wine"; which prays, in language of awful\nsolemnity, that we may worthily "eat His Flesh {90} and drink His\nBlood".This is the aspect which speaks of the "means whereby" Christ\ncommunicates Himself to us, implants within us His character, His\nvirtues, His will;--makes us one with Him, and Himself one with us.By\nSacramental Communion, we "dwell in Him, and He in us"; and this, not\nmerely as a lovely sentiment, or by means of some beautiful meditation,\nbut by the real communion of Christ--present without us, and\ncommunicated to us, through the ordained channels.Hence, in the Blessed Sacrament, Jesus is for ever counteracting within\nus the effects of the Fall.If the first Adam ruined us through food,\nthe second Adam will reinstate us through food--and that food nothing\nless than Himself.The Holy Ghost is the operative power, but\nthe operation is overshadowed as by the wings of the Dove.It is\nenough for us to know what is done, without questioning as to how it is\ndone.It is enough for us to worship Him in what He does, without {91}\nstraining to know how He does it--being fully persuaded that, what He\nhas promised, He is able also to perform.[9]  Here, again, we are in\nthe region of faith, not sight; and reason tells us that faith must be\nsupreme in its own province.For us, it is enough to say with Queen\nElizabeth:--\n\n  _He was the Word that spake it;_\n  _He took the bread and break it;_\n  _And what that Word did make it,_\n  _I do believe and take it._[10]\n\n\n\n[1] _Leitos_, public, _ergon_, work.[2] Either when the service is over, or when those not admissible to\nCommunion are dismissed.The "Masses" condemned in the thirty-first\nArticle involved the heresy that Christ was therein offered again by\nthe Mass Priest to buy souls out of Purgatory at so much per Mass."He took the cup, and eucharized," i.e.[4] _Accedit verium ad elementum, et fit Sacramentum_ (St.[5] This definition is really given up now by the best Roman Catholic\ntheologians.The theory on which Transubstantiation alone is based\n(viz.that "substance" is something which exists apart from the\ntotality of the accidents whereby it is known to us), has now been\ngenerally abandoned.Now, it is universally allowed that "substance is\nonly a collective name for the sum of all the qualities of matter,\nsize, colour, weight, taste, and so forth".But, as all these\nqualities of bread and wine admittedly remain after consecration, the\nsubstance of the bread and wine must remain too.The doctrine of Transubstantiation condemned in Article 22, was that of\na material Transubstantiation which taught (and was taught _ex\nCathedra_ by Pope Nicholas II) that Christ\'s Body was sensibly touched\nand broken by the teeth.[6] "The Altar has respect unto the oblation, the Table to the\nparticipation" (Bishop Cosin).[10] "These lines," says Malcolm MacColl in his book on "The\nReformation Settlement" (p.34), "have sometimes been attributed to\nDonne; but the balance of evidence is in favour of their Elizabethan\nauthorship when the Queen was in confinement as Princess Elizabeth.They are not in the first edition of Donne, and were published for the\nfirst time as his in 1634, thirteen years after his death."These are "those five" which the Article says are "commonly called\nSacraments":[1] Confirmation, Matrimony, Orders, Penance, Unction.They are called "Lesser" Sacraments to distinguish them from the two\npre-eminent or "Greater Sacraments," Baptism and the Supper of the\nLord.[2]  These, though they have not all a "like nature" with the\nGreater Sacraments, are selected by the Church as meeting the main\nneeds of her children between Baptism and Burial.They may, for our purpose, be classified in three groups:--\n\n(I) _The Sacrament of Completion_ (Confirmation, which completes the\nSacrament of Baptism).{93}\n\n(II) The Sacraments of Perpetuation (Holy Matrimony, which perpetuates\nthe human race; and Holy Order, which perpetuates the Christian\nMinistry).(III) The Sacraments of Recovery (Penance, which recovers the sick soul\ntogether with the body; and Unction, which recovers the sick body\ntogether with the soul).And, first, The Sacrament of Completion: Confirmation.[2] The Homily on the Sacraments calls them the "other\nSacraments"--i.e.in addition to Baptism and the Eucharist.The renewal of vows is the\nfinal part of the _preparation_ for Confirmation.It is that part of\nthe preparation which takes place in public, as the previous\npreparation has taken place in private.Before Confirmation, the\nBaptismal vows are renewed "openly before the Church".Their renewal\nis the last word of preparation.The Bishop, or Chief Shepherd,\nassures himself by question, and answer, that the Candidate openly\nresponds to the preparation he has received in {95} private from the\nParish Priest, or under-Shepherd.Before the last revision of the\nPrayer Book, the Bishop asked the Candidates in public many questions\nfrom the Catechism before confirming them; now he only asks one--and\nthe "I do," by which the Candidate renews his Baptismal vows, is the\nanswer to that preparatory question.It is still quite a common idea, even among Church people, that\nConfirmation is something which the Candidate does for himself, instead\nof something which God does to him.This is often due to the\nunfortunate use of the word "confirm"[1] in the Bishop\'s question.At\nthe time it was inserted, the word "confirm" meant "confess,"[2] and\nreferred, not to the Gift of Confirmation, but to the Candidate\'s\npublic Confession of faith, before receiving the Sacrament of\nConfirmation.It had nothing whatever to do with Confirmation itself.We must not, then, confuse the preparation for Confirmation with the\nGift of Confirmation.The Sacrament itself is God\'s gift to the child\nbestowed through the Bishop in accordance with the teaching given to\n{96} the God-parents at the child\'s Baptism: "Ye are to take care that\nthis child be brought to the Bishop _to be_ confirmed _by him_".[3]\n\nAnd this leads us to our second point: What Confirmation is.In the words of our Confirmation Service, it "increases and\nmultiplies"--i.e.strengthens or confirms Baptismal grace.It is the\nordained channel which conveys to the Baptized the "sevenfold" (i.e.complete) gift of the Holy Ghost, which was initially received in\nBaptism.And this will help us to answer a question frequently asked: "If I have\nbeen confirmed, but not Baptized, must I be Baptized?"Surely, Baptism\nmust _precede_ Confirmation.If {97} Confirmation increases the grace\ngiven in Baptism, that grace must have been received before it can be\nincreased."And must I be \'confirmed again,\' as it is said, after\nBaptism?"If I had not been Baptized _before_ I presented\nmyself for Confirmation, I have not confirmed at all.My Baptism will\nnow allow me to "be presented to the Bishop once again to be confirmed\nby him"--and this time in reality."Did I, then, receive no grace when\nI was presented to the Bishop to be confirmed by him before?"Much\ngrace, surely, but not the special grace attached to the special\nSacrament of Confirmation, and guaranteed to the Confirmed.God\'s love overflows its channels; what\nGod gives, or withholds, outside those channels, it would be an\nimpertinence for us to say.Again, Confirmation is, in a secondary sense, a Sacrament of\nAdmittance.It admits the Baptized to Holy Communion."It is expedient," says the rubric after an adult Baptism,\n"that every person thus Baptized should be confirmed by the Bishop so\nsoon after his Baptism as conveniently may be; that _so he may be\nadmitted to the Holy Communion_.""And {98} there shall none _be\nadmitted to Holy Communion_," adds the rubric after Confirmation,\n"until such time as he be confirmed, or be ready and desirous to be\nconfirmed."For "Confirmation, or the laying on of hands," fully\nadmits the Baptized to that "Royal Priesthood" of the Laity,[4] of\nwhich the specially ordained Priest is ordained to be the\nrepresentative.The Holy Sacrifice is the offering of the _whole_\nChurch, the universal Priesthood, not merely of the individual Priest\nwho is the offerer.Thus, the Confirmed can take their part in the\noffering, and can assist at it, in union with the ordained Priest who\nis actually celebrating.They can say their _Amen_ at the Eucharist,\nor "giving of thanks," and give their responding assent to what he is\ndoing in their name, and on their behalf."If I am a Communicant, but have\nnot been confirmed, ought I to present myself for Confirmation?"First, it\nlegislates for the normal case, then for the abnormal.First it says:\n"None shall be admitted to Holy Communion until such time as they have\nbeen Confirmed".Then it deals with {99} exceptional cases, and adds,\n"or be willing and desirous to be confirmed".Such exceptional cases\nmay, and do, occur; but even these may not be Communicated unless they\nare both "ready" and "desirous" to be confirmed, as soon as\nConfirmation can be received.So does the Church safeguard her\nSacraments, and her children."But would you," it is asked, "exclude a Dissenter from Communion,\nhowever good and holy he may be, merely because he has not been\nConfirmed?"He certainly would have very little respect for me if I\ndid not.If, for instance, he belonged to the Methodist Society, he\nwould assuredly not admit me to be a "Communicant" in that Society."No person," says his rule, "shall be suffered on any pretence to\npartake of the Lord\'s Supper _unless he be a member of the Society_, or\nreceive a note of admission from the Superintendent, which note must be\nrenewed quarterly."And, again: "That the Table of the Lord should be\nopen to all comers, is surely a great discredit, and a serious peril to\nany Church".[5]  And yet the Church, the Divine Society, established by\nJesus Christ Himself, is blamed, and called narrow and {100} bigoted,\nif she asserts her own rule, and refuses to admit "all comers" to the\nAltar.To give way on such a point would be to forfeit, and rightly to\nforfeit, the respect of any law-abiding people, and would be--in many\ncases, is--"a great discredit, and a serious peril" to the Church.We\nhave few enough rules as it is, and if those that we have are\nmeaningless, we may well be held up to derision.The Prayer Book makes\nno provision whatever for those who are not Confirmed, and who, if able\nto receive Confirmation, are neither "ready nor desirous to be\nConfirmed".Confirmation is for the Baptized, and none other.The Prayer-Book\nTitle to the service is plain.It calls Confirmation the "laying on of\nHands upon _those that are baptized_," and, it adds, "are come to years\nof discretion".First, then, Confirmation is for the Baptized, and never for the\nunbaptized.Secondly, it is (as now administered[6]) for {101} "those who have come\nto years of discretion," i.e.As we pray\nin the Ember Collect that the Bishop may select "fit persons for the\nSacred Ministry" of the special Priesthood, and may "lay hands suddenly\non no man," so it is with Confirmation or the "laying on of hands" for\nthe Royal Priesthood.The Bishop must be assured by the Priest who\npresents them (and who acts as his examining Chaplain), that they are\n"fit persons" to be confirmed.And this fitness must be of two kinds: moral and intellectual.The candidate must "have come to years of discretion,"\ni.e.he must "know to refuse the evil and choose the good".[7]  This\n"age of discretion," or _competent age_, as the Catechism Rubric calls\nit, is not a question of years, but of character.Our present Prayer\nBook makes no allusion to any definite span of years whatever, and to\nmake the magic age of fifteen the minimum universal age for Candidates\nis wholly illegal.At the Reformation, the English Church fixed seven\nas the age for Confirmation, but our 1662 Prayer Book is more\nprimitive, and, taking a common-sense view, {102} leaves each case of\nmoral fitness to be decided on its own merits.The moral standard must\nbe an individual standard, and must be left, first, to the parent, who\npresents the child to the Priest to be prepared; then, to the Priest\nwho prepares the child for Confirmation, and presents him to the\nBishop; and, lastly, to the Bishop, who must finally decide, upon the\ncombined testimony of the Priest and parent--and, if in doubt, upon his\nown personal examination.The _intellectual_ standard is laid down in the Service for the "Public\nBaptism of Infants": "So soon as he can say the Creed, the Lord\'s\nPrayer, and the Ten Commandments, in the vulgar (i.e.his native)\ntongue, and be further instructed, etc."Here, the words "can say"\nobviously mean can say _intelligently_.The mere saying of the words\nby rote is comparatively unimportant, though it has its use; but if\nthis were all, it would degrade the Candidate\'s intellectual status to\nthe capacities of a parrot.But, "as soon as" he can intelligently\ncomply with the Church\'s requirements, as soon as he has reached "a\ncompetent age," any child may "be presented to the Bishop to be\nconfirmed by him".{103}\n\nAnd, in the majority of cases, in these days, "the sooner, the better".It is, speaking generally, far safer to have the "child" prepared at\nhome--if it is a Christian home--and confirmed from home, than to risk\nthe preparation to the chance teaching of a Public School.With\nsplendid exceptions, School Confirmation is apt to get confused with\nthe school curriculum and school lessons.It is a sort of "extra\ntuition," which, not infrequently, interferes with games or work,\nwithout any compensating advantages in Church teaching.(IV) WHAT IS ESSENTIAL."The Laying on of Hands"--and nothing else.This act of ritual (so\nfamiliar to the Early Church, from Christ\'s act in blessing little\nchildren) was used by the Apostles,[8] and is still used by their\nsuccessors, the Bishops.It is the only act essential to a valid\nConfirmation.Other, and suggestive, ceremonies have been in use in different ages,\nand in different parts of the Church: but they are supplementary, not\nessential.Thus, in the sub-apostolic age, ritual {104} acts expressed\nvery beautifully the early names for Confirmation, just as "the laying\non of Hands" still expresses the name which in the English Church\nproclaims the essence of the Sacrament.For instance, Confirmation is called _The Anointing_,[9] and _The\nSealing_, and in some parts of the Church, the Priest dips his finger\nin oil blessed by the Bishop, and signs or seals the child upon the\nforehead with the sign of the Cross, thus symbolizing the meaning of\nsuch names.But neither the sealing, nor the anointing, is necessary\nfor a valid Sacrament.Confirmation, then, "rightly and duly" administered, completes the\ngrace given to a child at the outset of its Christian career.It\nadmits the child to full membership and to full privileges in the\nChristian Church.It is the ordained Channel by which the Bishop is\ncommissioned to convey and guarantee the special grace attached {105}\nto, and only to, the Lesser Sacrament of Confirmation.[10]\n\n\n\n[1] "Ratifying and _confirming_ the same in your own persons."[2] The word was "confess" in 1549.[3] The Greek Catechism of Plato, Metropolitan of Moscow, puts it very\nclearly: "Through this holy Ordinance _the Holy Ghost descendeth upon\nthe person Baptized_, and confirmeth him in the grace which he received\nin his Baptism according to the example of His descending upon the\ndisciples of Jesus Christ, and in imitation of the disciples\nthemselves, who after Baptism laid their hands upon the believers; by\nwhich laying on of hands the Holy Ghost was conferred".[5] Minutes of Wesleyan Conference, 1889, p.[6] In the first ages, and, indeed, until the fifteenth century,\nConfirmation followed immediately after Baptism, both in East and West,\nas it still does in the East.[9] In an old seventh century Service, used in the Church of England\ndown to the Reformation, the Priest is directed: "Here he is to put the\nChrism (oil) on the forehead of the man, and say, \'Receive the sign of\nthe Holy Cross, by the Chrism of Salvation in Jesus Christ unto Eternal\nLife.[10] The teaching of our Church of England, passing on the teaching of\nthe Church Universal, is very happily summed up in an ancient Homily of\nthe Church of England.It runs thus: "In Baptism the Christian was\nborn again spiritually, to live; in Confirmation he is made bold to\nfight.There he received remission of sin; here he receiveth increase\nof grace....  In Baptism he was chosen to be God\'s son; in Confirmation\nGod shall give him His Holy Spirit to... perfect him.In Baptism he\nwas called and chosen to be one of God\'s soldiers, and had his white\ncoat of innocency given him, and also his badge, which was the red\ncross set upon his forehead...; in Confirmation he is encouraged to\nfight, and to take the armour of God put upon him, which be able to\nbear off the fiery darts of the devil."We have called Holy Matrimony the "_Sacrament of Perpetuation_," for it\nis the ordained way in which the human race is to be perpetuated.Matrimony is the legal union between two persons,--a union which is\ncreated by mutual consent: Holy Matrimony is that union sanctioned and\nsanctified by the Church.There are three familiar names given to this union: Matrimony,\nMarriage, Wedlock.Matrimony, derived from _mater_, a mother, tells of the woman\'s (i.e.wife-man\'s) "joy that a man is born into the world".Marriage, derived\nfrom _maritus_, a husband (or house-dweller[1]), tells of the man\'s\nplace in the "hus" or house.Wedlock, derived from _weddian_, a\npledge, reminds both man and woman of the life-long pledge which each\nhas made "either to other".{107}\n\nIt is this Sacrament of Matrimony, Marriage, or Wedlock, that we are\nnow to consider.We will think of it under four headings:--\n\n  (I) What is it for?Marriage is, as we have seen, God\'s method of propagating the human\nrace.It does this in two ways--by expansion, and by limitation.This\nis seen in the New Testament ordinance, "one man for one woman".It\nexpands the race, but within due and disciplined limitations.Expansion, without limitation, would produce quantity without quality,\nand would wreck the human race; limitation without expansion might\nproduce quality without quantity, but would extinguish the human race.Sandra moved to the garden.Like every other gift of God, marriage is to be treated "soberly,\nwisely, discretely," and, like every other gift, it must be used with a\ndue combination of freedom and restraint.Hence, among other reasons, the marriage union between one man and one\nwoman is {108} indissoluble.For marriage is not a mere union of\nsentiment; it is not a mere terminable contract between two persons,\nwho have agreed to live together as long as they suit each other.It\nis an _organic_ not an emotional union; "They twain shall be one\nflesh," which nothing but death can divide.No law in Church or State\ncan unmarry the legally married.A State may _declare_ the\nnon-existence of the marriage union, just as it may _declare_ the\nnon-existence of God: but such a declaration does not affect the fact,\neither in one case or the other.In England the State does, in certain cases, declare that the life-long\nunion is a temporary contract, and does permit "this man" or "this\nwoman" to live with another man, or with another woman, and, if they\nchoose, even to exchange husbands or wives.This is allowed by the\nDivorce Act of 1857,[2] "when," writes Bishop Stubbs, "the calamitous\nlegislation of 1857 inflicted on English Society and English morals\n{109} the most cruel blow that any conjunction of unrighteous influence\ncould possibly have contrived".[3]\n\nThe Church has made no such declaration.It rigidly forbids a husband\nor wife to marry again during the lifetime of either party.The Law of\nthe Church remains the Law of the Church, overridden--but not repealed.This has led to a conflict between Church and State in a country where\nthey are, in theory though not in fact, united.But this is the fault\nof the State, not of the Church.It is a case in which a junior\npartner has acted without the consent of, or rather in direct\nopposition to, the senior partner.Historically and chronologically\nspeaking, the Church (the senior partner) took the State (the junior\npartner) into partnership, and the State, in spite of all the benefits\nit has received from the Church, has taken all it could get, and has\nthrown the Church over to legalize sin.It has ignored its senior\npartner, and loosened the old historical bond between the two.This\nthe Church cannot help, and this the State fully admits, legally\nabsolving the Church from taking any part in its mock re-marriages.{110}\n\n(II) WHAT IS ITS ESSENCE?The essence of matrimony is "mutual consent".The essential part of\nthe Sacrament consists in the words: "I, M., take thee, N.," etc.Nothing else is essential, though much else is desirable.Thus,\nmarriage in a church, however historical and desirable, is not\n_essential_ to the validity of a marriage.Marriage at a Registry\nOffice (i.e.mutual consent in the presence of the Registrar) is every\nbit as legally indissoluble as marriage in a church.The not uncommon\nargument: "I was only married in a Registry Office, and can therefore\ntake advantage of the Divorce Act," is fallacious _ab initio_.[4]\n\nWhy, then, be married in, and by the Church?Apart from the history\nand sentiment, for this reason.The Church is the ordained channel\nthrough which grace to keep the marriage vow is bestowed.A special\nand _guaranteed_ grace is {111} attached to a marriage sanctioned and\nblest by the Church.The Church, in the name of God, "consecrates\nmatrimony," and from the earliest times has given its sanction and\nblessing to the mutual consent.We are reminded of this in the\nquestion: "Who _giveth_ this woman to be married to this man?"In\nanswer to the question, the Parent, or Guardian, presents the Bride to\nthe Priest (the Church\'s representative), who, in turn, presents her to\nthe Bridegroom, and blesses their union.In the Primitive Church,\nnotice of marriage had to be given to the Bishop of the Diocese, or his\nrepresentative,[5] in order that due inquiries might be made as to the\nfitness of the persons, and the Church\'s sanction given or withheld.After this notice, a special service of _Betrothal_ (as well as the\nactual marriage service) was solemnized.These two separate services are still marked off from each other in\n(though both forming a part of) our present marriage service.The\nfirst part of the service is held outside the chancel gates, and\ncorresponds to the old service of _Betrothal_.Here, too, the actual\nceremony of "mutual consent" now takes place--that part of {112} the\nceremony which would be equally valid in a Registry Office.Then\nfollows the second part of the service, in which the Church gives her\nblessing upon the marriage.And because this part is, properly\nspeaking, part of the Eucharistic Office, the Bride and Bridegroom now\ngo to the Altar with the Priest, and there receive the Church\'s\nBenediction, and--ideally--their first Communion after marriage.So\ndoes the Church provide grace for her children that they may "perform\nthe vows they have made unto the King".The late hour for modern\nweddings, and the consequent postponement[6] of Communion, has obscured\nmuch of the meaning of the service; but a nine o\'clock wedding, in\nwhich the married couple receive the Holy Communion, followed by the\nwedding breakfast, is, happily, becoming more common, and is restoring\nto us one of the best of old English customs.It is easy enough to\nslight old religious forms and ceremonies; but is anyone one atom\nbetter, or happier for having neglected them?{113}\n\n(III) WHOM IS IT FOR?Marriage is for three classes:--\n\n(1) The unmarried--i.e.those who have never been married, or whose\nmarriage is (legally) dissolved by death.(2) The non-related--i.e.either by consanguinity (by blood), or\naffinity (by marriage).But, is not this very\nhard upon those whose marriage has been a mistake, and who have been\ndivorced by the State?And, above all, is it not very hard upon the\ninnocent party, who has been granted a divorce?It is very hard, so\nhard, so terribly hard, that only those who have to deal personally,\nand practically, with concrete cases, can guess how hard--hard enough\noften on the guilty party, and harder still on the innocent."God\nknows" it is hard, and will make it as easy as God Himself can make it,\nif only self-surrender is placed before self-indulgence.We sometimes forget that legislation for\nthe individual may bear even harder {114} on the masses, than\nlegislation for the masses may bear upon the individual.And, after\nall, this is not a question of "hard _versus_ easy," but of "right\n_versus_ wrong".Moreover, as we are finding out, that which seems\neasiest at the moment, often turns out hardest in the long run.It is\nno longer contended that re-marriage after a State-divorce is that\nuniversal Elysium which it has always been confidently assumed to be.There is, too, a positively absurd side to the present conflict between\nChurch and State.Some time ago, a young\ngirl married a man about whom she knew next to nothing, the man telling\nher that marriage was only a temporary affair, and that, if it did not\nanswer, the State would divorce them.Wrong-doing\nensued, and a divorce was obtained.Then the girl entered into a\nState-marriage with another man.A\ndivorce was again applied for, but this time was refused.Eventually,\nthe girl left her State-made husband, and ran away with her real\nhusband.In other words, she eloped with her own husband.But what is\nher position to-day?In the eyes of the State, she is now living with\na man who is not {115} her husband.Her State-husband is still alive,\nand can apply, at any moment, for an order for the restitution of\nconjugal rights--however unlikely he is to get it.Further, if in the\nfuture she has any children by her real husband (unless she has been\nmarried again to him, after divorce from her State-husband) these\nchildren will be illegitimate.This is the sort of muddle the Divorce\nAct has got us into.One course, and only one course, is open to the\nChurch--to disentangle itself from all question of extending the powers\nof the Act on grounds of inequality, or any other real (and sometimes\nvery real) or fancied hardship, and to consistently fight for the\nrepeal of the Act.This, it will be said, is _Utopian_.It\nis the business of the Church to aim at the Utopian.Her whole history\nshows that she is safest, as well as most successful, when aiming at\nwhat the world derides.One question remains: Is not the present Divorce Law "one law for the\nrich and another for the poor"?This is its sole\nmerit, if merit it can have.It does, at least, partially protect the\npoor from sin-made-easy--a condition which money has bought for the\nrich.If the State abrogated the Sixth {116} Commandment for the rich,\nand made it lawful for a rich man to commit murder, it would at least\nbe no demerit if it refused to extend the permit to the poor.But, secondly, marriage is for the non-related--non-related, that is,\nin two ways, by Consanguinity, and Affinity.(_a_) By _Consanguinity_.Consanguinity is of two kinds, lineal and\ncollateral._Lineal_ Consanguinity[7] is blood relationship "in a\n_direct_ line," i.e._Collateral_\nConsanguinity is blood relationship from a common ancestor, but not in\na direct line.The law of Consanguinity has not, at the present moment, been attacked,\nand is still the law of the land.Affinity[8] is near relationship by marriage.It\nis of three kinds: (1) _Direct_, i.e.between a husband and his wife\'s\nblood relations, and between a wife and her husband\'s blood relations;\n(2) _Secondary_, i.e.between a husband {117} and his wife\'s relations\nby marriage; (3) _Collateral_, i.e.between a husband and the relations\nof his wife\'s relations.In case of Affinity, the State has broken\nfaith with the Church without scruple, and the _Deceased Wife\'s Sister\nBill_[9] is the result.So has it\n\n  brought confusion to the Table round.The question is sometimes asked, whether the State can alter the\nChurch\'s law without her consent.An affirmative answer would reduce\nwhatever union still remains between them to its lowest possible term,\nand would place the Church in a position which no Nonconformist body\nwould tolerate for a day.The further question, as to whether the\nState can order the Church to Communicate persons who have openly and\ndeliberately broken her laws, needs no discussion.No thinking person\nseriously contends that it can.(3) _For the Full-Aged_.John went to the office.No boy under 14, and no girl under 12, can contract a legal marriage\neither with, or without the consent of Parents or Guardians.No man\n{118} or woman under 21 can do so against the consent of Parents or\nGuardians.(IV) WHAT ARE ITS SAFEGUARDS?These are, mainly, two: _Banns_ and _Licences_--both intended to secure\nthe best safeguard of all, _publicity_.This publicity is secured,\nfirst, by Banns.The word is the plural form of _Ban_, "a proclamation".The object of\nthis proclamation is to "ban" an improper marriage.In the case of marriage after Banns, in order to secure publicity:--\n\n(1) Each party must reside[10] for twenty-one days in the parish where\nthe Banns are being published.(2) The marriage must be celebrated in one of the two parishes in which\nthe Banns have been published.{119}\n\n(3) Seven days\' previous notice of publication must be given to the\nclergy by whom the Banns are to be published--though the clergy may\nremit this length of notice if they choose.(4) The Banns must be published on three separate (though not\nnecessarily successive) Sundays.(5) Before the marriage, a certificate of publication must be presented\nto the officiating clergyman, from the clergyman of the other parish in\nwhich the Banns were published.(6) Banns only hold good for three months.After this period, they\nmust be again published three times before the marriage can take place.(7) Banns may be forbidden on four grounds: If either party is married\nalready; or is related by consanguinity or affinity; or is under age;\nor is insane.(8) Banns published in false names invalidate a marriage, if both\nparties are cognisant of the fact before the marriage takes place, i.e.if they wilfully intend to defeat the law, but not otherwise.There are two kinds of Marriage Licence, an Ordinary, or Common\nLicence, and a Special Licence.{120}\n\nAn _Ordinary Licence_, costing about L2, is granted by the Bishop, or\nOrdinary, in lieu of Banns, either through his Chancellor, or a\n"Surrogate," i.e.In marriage by Licence, three points may\nbe noticed:--\n\n(1) One (though only one) of the parties must reside in the parish\nwhere the marriage is to be celebrated, for fifteen days previous to\nthe marriage.(2) One of the parties must apply for the Licence in person, not in\nwriting.(3) A licence only holds good for three months.A _Special Licence_, costing about L30, can only be obtained from the\nArchbishop of Canterbury,[11] and is only granted after special and\nminute inquiry.The points here to notice are:--\n\n(1) Neither party need reside in the parish where the marriage is to be\nsolemnized.(2) The marriage may be celebrated in any Church, whether licensed or\nunlicensed[12] for marriages.(3) It may be celebrated at any time of the day.It may be added that\nif any clergyman {121} celebrates a marriage without either Banns or\nLicence (or upon a Registrar\'s Certificate), he commits a felony, and\nis liable to fourteen years\' penal servitude.[13]\n\nOther safeguards there are, such as:--\n\n_The Time for Marriages_.--Marriages must not be celebrated before 8\nA.M., or after 3 P.M., so as to provide a reasonable chance of\npublicity._The Witnesses to a Marriage_.--Two witnesses, at least, must be\npresent, in addition to the officiating clergyman._The Marriage Registers_.--The officiating clergyman must enter the\nmarriage in two Registers provided by the State._The Signing of the Registers_.--The bride and bridegroom must sign\ntheir names in the said Registers immediately after the ceremony, as\nwell as the two witnesses and the officiating clergyman.If either\nparty wilfully makes any false statement with regard to age, condition,\netc., he or she is guilty of perjury.Such are some of the wise safeguards provided by both Church and State\nfor the Sacrament of Marriage.Their object is to prevent the {122}\nmarriage state being entered into "lightly, unadvisedly, or wantonly,"\nto secure such publicity as will prevent clandestine marriages,[14] and\nwill give parents, and others with legal status, an opportunity to\nlodge legal objections.Great is the solemnity of the Sacrament in which is "signified and\nrepresented the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and His Church".[1] Husband--from _hus_, a house, and _buan_, to dwell.[2] Until fifty-three years ago an Act of Parliament was necessary for\na divorce.In 1857 _The Matrimonial Causes Act_ established the\nDivorce Court.In 1873 the _Indicature Act_ transferred it to a\ndivision of the High Court--the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty\nDivision.[3] "Visitation Charges," p.[4] It is a common legal error that seven years effective separation\nbetween husband and wife entitles either to remarry, and hundreds of\nwomen who have lost sight of their husbands for seven years innocently\ncommit bigamy.Probably the mistake comes from the fact that\n_prosecution_ for bigamy does not hold good in such a case.But this\ndoes not legalize the bigamous marriage or legitimize the children.[5] The origin of Banns.[6] The Rubric says: "It is convenient that the new-married persons\nreceive the Holy Communion _at the time of their marriage_, or at the\nfirst opportunity after their marriage," thus retaining, though\nreleasing, the old rule.[7] Consanguinity--from _cum_, together, and _sanguineus_, relating to\nblood.[8] Affinity--from _ad_, near, and _finis_, a boundary.[9] See a most helpful paper read by Father Puller at the E.C.U.Anniversary Meeting, and reported in "The Church Times" of 17 June,\n1910.[10] There seems to be no legal definition of the word "reside".The\nlaw would probably require more than leaving a bag in a room, hired for\ntwenty-one days, as is often done.It must be remembered that the\nobject of the law is _publicity_--that is, the avoidance of a\nclandestine marriage, which marriage at a Registry Office now\nfrequently makes so fatally easy.[12] Such as, for example, Royal Chapels, St.Paul\'s Cathedral, Eton\nCollege Chapel, etc.[14] It will be remembered that runaway marriages were, in former days,\nfrequently celebrated at Gretna Green, a Scotch village in\nDumfriesshire, near the English border.{123}\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nHOLY ORDER.The Second Sacrament of Perpetuation is Holy Order.As the Sacrament\nof Marriage perpetuates the human race, so the Sacrament of Order\nperpetuates the Priesthood.Holy Order, indeed, perpetuates the\nSacraments themselves.It is the ordained channel through which the\nSacramental life of the Church is continued.Holy Order, then, was instituted for the perpetuation of those\nSacraments which depend upon Apostolic Succession.It makes it\npossible for the Christian laity to be Confirmed, Communicated,\nAbsolved.Thus, the Christian Ministry is a great deal more than a\nbody of men, chosen as officers might be chosen in the army or navy.It is the Church\'s media for the administration of the Sacraments of\nSalvation.To say this does not assert that God cannot, and does not,\nsave and sanctify souls in any other way; but it does assert, as\nScripture does, that the {124} Christian Ministry is the authorized and\nordained way.In this Ministry, there are three orders, or degrees: Bishops, Priests,\nand Deacons.In the words of the Prayer Book: "It is evident unto all\nmen, diligently reading Holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that, from\nthe Apostles\' time, there have been these Orders of Ministers in\nChrist\'s Church; Bishops, Priests, and Deacons".[1]\n\n\n\n(I) BISHOPS.Jesus Christ, "the Shepherd and Bishop of\nour souls".When, and where, was the first Ordination?In the Upper\nChamber, when He, the Universal Bishop, Himself ordained the first\nApostles.When was {125} the second Ordination?When these Apostles\nordained Matthias to succeed Judas.This was the first link in the\nchain of Apostolic Succession.In apostolic days,\nTimothy was ordained, with episcopal jurisdiction over Ephesus; Titus,\nover Crete; Polycarp (the friend of St.John), over Smyrna; and then,\nlater on, Linus, over Rome.And so the great College of Bishops\nexpands until, in the second century, we read in a well-known writer,\nSt.Irenaeus: "We can reckon up lists of Bishops ordained in the\nChurches from the Apostles to our time".Link after link, the chain of\nsuccession lengthens "throughout all the world," until it reaches the\nEarly British Church, and then, in 597, the English Church, through the\nconsecration of Augustine,[2] first Archbishop of Canterbury, and in\n1903 of Randall Davidson his ninety-fourth successor.And this is the history of every ordination in the Church to-day."It\nis through the Apostolic Succession," said the late Bishop Stubbs to\nhis ordination Candidates, "that I am empowered, through the long line\nof mission and Commission {126} from the Upper Chamber at Jerusalem, to\nlay my hands upon you and send you."[3]\n\nHow does a Priest become a Bishop?In the Church of England he goes\nthrough four stages:--\n\n  (1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop.(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.(1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.This is in accordance with the\nimmemorial custom of this realm.In these days, the Prime Minister\n(representing the people) proposes the name of a Priest to the King,\nwho accepts or rejects the recommendation.If he accepts it, the King\nnominates the selected Priest to the Church for election, and\nauthorizes the issue of legal documents for such election.This is\ncalled _Conge d\'elire_, "leave to elect".(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.The King\'s {127} nominee now comes\nbefore the Dean and Chapter (representing the Church), and the Church\neither elects or rejects him.If the\nnominee is elected, what is called his "Confirmation" follows--that\nis:--\n\n(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop of Canterbury,\naccording to a right reserved to him by _Magna Charta_.Before\nconfirming the election, the Archbishop, or his representative, sits in\npublic, generally at Bow Church, Cheapside, to hear legal objections\nfrom qualified laity against the election.Objections were of late, it\nwill be remembered, made, and overruled, in the cases of Dr.Then, if duly nominated, elected, and confirmed,--\n\n(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.To safeguard the\nSuccession, three Bishops, at least, are required for the Consecration\nof another Bishop, though one would secure a valid Consecration.No\nPriest can be Consecrated Bishop under the age of thirty.Very\ncarefully does the Church safeguard admission to the Episcopate.{128}\n\n_Homage._\n\nAfter Consecration, the Bishop "does homage,"[4] i.e.he says that he,\nlike any other subject (ecclesiastic or layman), is the King\'s\n"_homo_".He does homage, not for any\nspiritual gift, but for "all the possessions, and profette spirituall\nand temporall belongyng to the said...[5]  The\n_temporal_ possessions include such things as his house, revenue, etc.But what is meant by doing homage for _spiritual_ possessions?Does\nnot this admit the claim that the King can, as Queen Elizabeth is\nreported to have said, make or unmake a Bishop?Spiritual\n_possessions_ do not here mean spiritual _powers_,--powers which can be\nconferred by the Episcopate alone.{129} The "spiritual possessions"\nfor which a Bishop "does homage" refer to fees connected with spiritual\nthings, such as Episcopal Licences, Institutions to Benefices, Trials\nin the Ecclesiastical Court, Visitations--fees, by the way, which, with\nvery rare exceptions, do not go into the Bishop\'s own pocket!_Jurisdiction._\n\nWhat is meant by Episcopal Jurisdiction?Jurisdiction is of two kinds,\n_Habitual_ and _Actual_.Habitual Jurisdiction is the Jurisdiction given to a Bishop to exercise\nhis office in the Church at large.It is conveyed with Consecration,\nand is given to the Bishop as a Bishop of the Catholic Church.Thus an\nEpiscopal act, duly performed, would be valid, however irregular,\noutside the Bishop\'s own Diocese, and in any part of the Church._Actual Jurisdiction_ is this universal Jurisdiction limited to a\nparticular area, called a Diocese.To this area, a Bishop\'s right to\nexercise his Habitual Jurisdiction is, for purposes of order and\nbusiness, confined.The next order in the Ministry is the Priesthood.{130}\n\n(II) PRIESTS.No one can read the Prayer-Book Office for the _Ordering of Priests_\nwithout being struck by its contrast to the ordinary conception of\nPriesthood by the average Englishman.The Bishop\'s words in the\nOrdination Service: "Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of\na Priest in the Church of God," must surely mean more than that a\nPriest should try to be a good organizer, a good financier, a good\npreacher, or good at games--though the better he is at all these, the\nbetter it may be.But the gift of the Holy Ghost for "the Office and\nWork of a Priest" must mean more than this.We may consider it in connexion with four familiar English clerical\ntitles: _Priest, Minister, Parson, Clergyman_._Priest._\n\nAccording to the Prayer Book, a Priest, or Presbyter, is ordained to do\nthree things, which he, and he alone, can do: to Absolve, to\nConsecrate, to Bless.He, and he alone, can _Absolve_.It is the day of his\nOrdination to the Priesthood.He is saying Matins as a Deacon just\n_before_ his {131} Ordination, and he is forbidden to pronounce the\nAbsolution: he is saying Evensong just _after_ his Ordination, and he\nis ordered to pronounce the Absolution.He, and he alone, can _Consecrate_.If a Deacon pretends to Consecrate\nthe Elements at the Blessed Sacrament, not only is his act sacrilege\nand invalid, but even by the law of the land he is liable to a penalty\nof L100.[6]\n\nHe, and he alone, can give the _Blessing_--i.e.The right of Benediction belongs to him as part of his\nMinisterial Office.The Blessing pronounced by a Deacon might be the\npersonal blessing of a good and holy man, just as the blessing of a\nlayman--a father blessing his child--might be of value as such.In\neach case it would be a personal act.But a Priest does not bless in\nhis own name, but in the name of the Whole Church.It is an official,\nnot a personal act: he conveys, not his own, but the Church\'s blessing\nto the people.Hence, the valid Ordination of a Priest is of essential importance to\nthe laity.{132}\n\nBut there is another aspect of "the Office and Work of a Priest in the\nChurch of God".This we see in the word\n\n\n\n_Minister._\n\nThe Priest not only ministers before God on behalf of his people, but\nhe ministers to his people on behalf of God.In this aspect of the\nPriesthood, he ministers God\'s gifts to the laity.If, as a Priest, he\npleads the One Sacrifice on behalf of the people, as a Minister he\nfeeds the people upon the one Sacrifice.His chief ministerial duty is\nto minister to the people--to give them Baptism, Absolution, Holy\nCommunion; to minister to all their spiritual needs whenever, and\nwherever, he is needed.It is, surely, a sad necessity that this ministerial "office and work"\nshould be so often confused with finance, doles, charities, begging\nsermons, committees, etc.In all such things he is, indeed, truly\nserving and ministering; but he is often obliged to place them in the\nwrong order of importance, and so dim the sight of the laity to his\nreal position, and not infrequently make his spiritual ministrations\nunacceptable.A well-known and London-wide respected Priest said {133}\nshortly before he died, that he had almost scattered his congregation\nby the constant "begging sermons" which he hated, but which necessity\nmade imperative.The laity are claiming (and rightly claiming) the\nprivilege of being Church workers, and are preaching (and rightly\npreaching) that "the Clergy are not the Church".If only they would\npractise what they preach, and relieve the Clergy of all Church\nfinance, they need never listen to another "begging sermon" again.So\ndoing, they would rejoice the heart of the Clergy, and fulfil one of\ntheir true functions as laity.This is one of the most beautiful of all the clerical names, only it\nhas become smirched by common use.The word Parson is derived from _Persona_, a _person_.The Parson is\n_the_ Person--the Person who represents God in the Parish.It is not\nhis own person, or position, that he stands for, but the position and\nPerson of his Master.Paul, he can say, "I magnify mine\noffice," and probably the best way to magnify his office will be to\nminimize himself.The outward marks of {134} respect still shown to\n"the Parson" in some places, are not necessarily shown to the person\nhimself (though often, thank God, they may be), but are meant, however\nunconsciously, to honour the Person he represents--just as the lifting\nof the hat to a woman is not, of necessity, a mark of respect to the\nindividual woman, but a tribute to the Womanhood she represents.The Parson, then, is, or should be, the official person, the standing\nelement in the parish, who reminds men of God._Clergyman._\n\nThe word is derived from the Greek _kleros_,[7] "a lot," and conveys\nits own meaning.According to some, it takes us back in thought to the\nfirst Apostolic Ordination, when "they cast _lots_, and the _lot_ fell\nupon Matthias".It reminds us that, as Matthias "was numbered with the\neleven," so a "Clergyman" is, at his Ordination, numbered with that\nlong list of "Clergy" who trace their spiritual pedigree to Apostolic\ndays.{135}\n\n_Ordination Safeguards._\n\n"Seeing then," run the words of the Ordination Service, "into how high\na dignity, and how weighty an Office and Charge" a Priest is called,\ncertain safeguards surround his Ordination, both for his own sake, and\nfor the sake of his people._Age._\n\nNo Deacon can, save under very exceptional circumstances, be ordained\nPriest before he is 24, and has served at least a year in the Diaconate._Fitness._\n\nThis fitness, as in Confirmation, will be intellectual and moral.His\n_intellectual_ fitness is tested by the Bishop\'s Examining Chaplain\nsome time before the Ordination to the Priesthood, and, in doubtful\ncases, by the Bishop himself.His _moral_ fitness is tested by the Publication during Service, in the\nChurch where he is Deacon, of his intention to offer himself as a\nCandidate for the Priesthood.To certify that this has been done, this\nPublication must be signed by the Churchwarden, representing the {136}\nlaity, and by the Incumbent, representing the Clergy and responsible to\nthe Bishop.Further safeguard is secured by letters of Testimony from three\nBeneficed Clergy, who have known the Candidate well either for the past\nthree years, or during the term of his Diaconate.Finally, at the very last moment, in the Ordination Service itself, the\nBishop invites the laity, if they know "any impediment or notable\ncrime" disqualifying the Candidate from being ordained Priest, to "come\nforth in the Name of God, and show what the crime or impediment is".For many obvious reasons, but specially for\none._The Indelibility of Orders._\n\nOnce a Priest, always a Priest.When once the Bishop has ordained a\nDeacon to the Priesthood, there is no going back.The law,\necclesiastical or civil, may deprive him of the right to _exercise_ his\nOffice, but no power can deprive him of the Office itself.For instance, to safeguard the Church, and for {137} the sake of the\nlaity, a Priest may, for various offences, be what is commonly called\n"unfrocked".He may be degraded, temporarily suspended, or permanently\nforbidden to _officiate_ in any part of the Church; but he does not\ncease to be a Priest.Any Priestly act, rightly and duly performed,\nwould be valid, though irregular.It would be for the people\'s good,\nthough it would be to his own hurt.Again: by _The Clerical Disabilities Act_ of 1870, a Priest may, by the\nlaw of the land, execute a "Deed of Relinquishment," and, as far as the\nlaw is concerned, return to lay life.This would enable him legally to\nundertake lay work which the law forbids to the Clergy.[8]\n\nHe may, in consequence, regain his legal rights as a layman, and lose\nhis legal rights as a Priest; but he does not cease to be a Priest.The law can only touch his civil status, and cannot touch his priestly\n"character".Hence, no securities can be superfluous to safeguard the irrevocable.{138}\n\n_Jurisdiction._\n\nAs in the case of the Bishops, a Priest\'s jurisdiction is\ntwofold--_habitual_ and _actual_.Ordination confers on him _habitual_\njurisdiction, i.e.the power to exercise his office, to Absolve, to\nConsecrate, to Bless, in the "Holy Church throughout the world".And,\nas in the case of Bishops, for purposes of ecclesiastical order and\ndiscipline, this Habitual Jurisdiction is limited to the sphere in\nwhich the Bishop licenses him."Take thou authority," says the Bishop,\n"to preach the word of God, and to minister the Sacraments _in the\ncongregation where thou shalt be lawfully appointed thereunto_."This\nis called _Actual_ Jurisdiction._The Essence of the Sacrament._\n\nThe absolutely essential part of Ordination is the Laying on of Hands\n(1 Tim.Various other and beautiful\nceremonies have, at different times, and in different places,\naccompanied the essential Rite.Sometimes, and in some parts of the\nChurch, Unction, or anointing the Candidate with oil, has been used:\nsometimes Ordination has been accompanied with the delivery of a Ring,\nthe Paten {139} and Chalice, the Bible, or the Gospels, the Pastoral\nStaff (to a Bishop),--all edifying ceremonies, but not essentials.The word comes from the Greek _diakonos_, a\nservant, and exactly describes the Office.Originally, a permanent\nOrder in the Church, the Diaconate is now, in the Church of England,\ngenerally regarded as a step to the Priesthood.But\nit is as this step, or preparatory stage, that we have to consider it.Considering the importance of this first step in the Ministry, both to\nthe man himself, and to the people, it is well that the laity should\nknow what safeguards are taken by the Bishop to secure "fit persons to\nserve in the sacred ministry of the Church"[9]--and should realize\ntheir own great responsibility in the matter.(1) _The Age._\n\nNo layman can be made a Deacon under 23.{140}\n\n(2) The Preliminaries.The chief preliminary is the selection of the Candidate.The burden of\nselection is shared by the Bishop, Clergy and Laity.The Bishop must,\nof course, be the final judge of the Candidate\'s fitness, but _the\nevidence upon which he bases his judgment_ must very largely be\nsupplied by the Laity.We pray in the Ember Collect that he "may lay hands suddenly on no man,\nbut make choice of _fit persons_".It is well that the Laity should\nremember that they share with the Bishop and Clergy in the\nresponsibility of choice.For this fitness will, as in the case of the Priest, be moral and\nintellectual.It will be _moral_--and it is here that the responsibility of the laity\nbegins.For, in addition to private inquiries made by the Bishop, the\nlaity are publicly asked, in the church of the parish where the\nCandidate resides, to bear testimony to the integrity of his character.This publication is called the _Si quis_, from the Latin of the first\ntwo words of publication ("if any..."), and it is repeated by the\nBishop in open church in the Ordination Service.The {141} absence of\nany legal objection by the laity is the testimony of the people to the\nCandidate\'s fitness.This throws upon the laity a full share of\nresponsibility in the choice of the Candidate.Their responsibility in\ngiving evidence is only second to that of the Bishop, whose decision\nrests upon the evidence they give.Then, there is the testimony of the Clergy.No layman is accepted by\nthe Bishop for Ordination without _Letters Testimonial_--i.e.the\ntestimony of three beneficed Clergymen, to whom he is well known.These Clergy must certify that "we have had opportunity of observing\nhis conduct, and we do believe him, in our consciences, and as to his\nmoral conduct, a fit person to be admitted to the Sacred Ministry".Each signature must be countersigned by the signatory\'s own Bishop, who\nthus guarantees the Clergyman\'s moral fitness to certify.Lastly, comes the Bishop himself, who, from first to last, is in close\ntouch with the Candidate, and who almost invariably helps to prepare\nhim personally in his own house during the week before his Ordination.In addition to University testimony,\nevidence of the Candidate\'s {142} intellectual fitness is given to the\nBishop, as in the case of Priests, by his Examining Chaplains.Some\nmonths before the Ordination, the Candidate is examined, and the\nExaminer\'s Report sent in to the Bishop.The standard of intellectual\nfitness has differed at various ages, in different parts of the Church,\nand no one standard can be laid down.Assuming that the average\nproportion of people in a parish will be (on a generous calculation) as\ntwelve Jurymen to one Judge, the layman called to the Diaconate should,\nat least, be equal in intellectual attainment to "the layman" called to\nthe Bar.It does sometimes happen that evidence is given by Clergy, or laity,\nwhich leads the Bishop to reject the Candidate on moral grounds.It\ndoes sometimes happen that the Candidate is rejected or postponed on\nintellectual grounds.It does, it must, sometimes happen that mistakes\nare made: God alone is infallible.But, if due care is taken, publicly\nand privately, and if the laity, as well as the Clergy, do their duty,\nthe Bishop\'s risk of a wrong judgment is reduced to a very small\nminimum.A "fit" Clergy is so much the concern of the laity, that they may well\nbe reminded of their {143} parts and duties in the Ordination of a\nDeacon.Liddon says, "the strength of the Church does not\nconsist in the number of pages in its \'Clerical Directory,\' but in the\nsum total of the moral and spiritual force which she has at her\ncommand".[1] "The Threefold Ministry," writes Bishop Lightfoot, "can be traced\nto Apostolic direction; and, short of an express statement, we can\npossess no better assurance of a Divine appointment, or, at least, a\nDivine Sanction."And he adds, speaking of his hearty desire for union\nwith the Dissenters, "we cannot surrender for any immediate advantages\nthe threefold Ministry which we have inherited from Apostolic times,\nand which is the historic backbone of the Church" ("Ep.[2] The Welsh Bishops did not transmit Episcopacy to us, but rather\ncame into us.[3] In a book called _Registrum Sacrum Anglicanum_, Bishop Stubbs has\ntraced the name, date of Consecration, names of Consecrators, and in\nmost cases place of Consecration, of every Bishop in the Church of\nEngland from the Consecration of Augustine.[4] The Bishops are one of the three Estates of the Realm--Lords\nSpiritual, Lords Temporal, and Commons (not, as is so often said, King,\nLords, and Commons).The Archbishop of Canterbury is the first Peer of\nthe Realm, and has precedency immediately after the blood royal.The\nArchbishop of York has precedency over all Dukes, not being of royal\nblood, and over all the great officers of State, except the Lord\nChancellor.He has the privilege of crowning the Queen Consort."Encyclopedia of the Laws of England," vol.See Phillimore\'s "Ecclesiastical Law,"\nvol.[7] But see Skeat, whose references are to [Greek: kleros], "a lot," in\nlate Greek, and the Clergy whose portion is the Lord (Deut.The [Greek: kleros] is thus the portion\nrather than the circumstance by which it is obtained, i.e.[8] For example: farming more than a certain number of acres, or going\ninto Parliament.We deal now with the two last Sacraments under consideration--Penance\nand Unction.Penance is for the\nhealing of the soul, and indirectly of the body: Unction is for the\nhealing of the body, and indirectly of the soul.Thomas Aquinas, "has been instituted to\nproduce one special effect, although it may produce, as consequences,\nother effects besides."It is so with these two Sacraments.Body and\nSoul are so involved, that what directly affects the one must\nindirectly affect the other.Thus, the direct effect of Penance on the\nsoul must indirectly affect the body, and the direct effect of Unction\non the body must indirectly affect the soul.{145}\n\n_Penance._\n\nThe word is derived from the Latin _penitentia_, penitence, and its\nroot-meaning (_poena_, punishment) suggests a punitive element in all\nreal repentance.It is used as a comprehensive term for confession of\nsin, punishment for sin, and the Absolution, or Remission of Sins.As\nBaptism was designed to recover the soul from original or inherited\nsin, so Penance was designed to recover the soul from actual or wilful\nsin....[1]  It is not, as in the case of infant Baptism, administered\nwholly irrespective of free will: it must be freely sought ("if he\nhumbly and heartily desire it"[2]) before it can be freely bestowed.Thus, Confession must precede Absolution, and Penitence must precede\nand accompany Confession._Confession._\n\nHere we all start on common ground.the necessity of Confession (1) _to God_ ("If we confess our sins, He\nis faithful and just to forgive us our sins") {146} and (2) _to man_\n("Confess your faults one to another").Further, we all agree that\nconfession to man is in reality confession to God ("Against Thee, _Thee\nonly_, have I sinned").Our only ground of difference is, not\n_whether_ we ought to confess, but _how_ we ought to confess.It is a\ndifference of method rather than of principle.There are two ways of confessing sins (whether to God, or to man), the\ninformal, and the formal.Most of us use one way; some the other; many\nboth._Informal Confession_.--Thank God, I can use this way at any, and at\nevery, moment of my life.If I have sinned, I need wait for no formal\nact of Confession; but, as I am, and where I am, I can make my\nConfession.Then, and there, I can claim the Divine response to the\nsoul\'s three-fold _Kyrie_: "Lord, have mercy upon me; Christ, have\nmercy upon me; Lord, have mercy upon me".But do I never want--does\nGod never want--anything more than this?The soul is not always\nsatisfied with such an easy method of going to Confession.It needs at\ntimes something more impressive, something perhaps less superficial,\nless easy going.It demands more time for {147} deepening thought, and\ngreater knowledge of what it has done, before sin\'s deadly hurt cuts\ndeep enough to produce real repentance, and to prevent repetition.At\nsuch times, it cries for something more formal, more solemn, than\ninstantaneous confession.It needs, what the Prayer Book calls, "a\nspecial Confession of sins"._Formal Confession_.--Hence our Prayer Book provides two formal Acts of\nConfession, and suggests a third.Two of these are for public use, the\nthird for private.In Matins and Evensong, and in the Eucharistic Office, a form of\n"_general_ confession" is provided.Both forms are in the first person\nplural throughout.Clearly, their primary intention is, not to make us\nmerely think of, or confess, our own personal sins, but the sins of the\nChurch,--and our own sins, as members of the Church.It is "we" have\nsinned, rather than "I" have sinned.Such formal language might,\notherwise, at times be distressingly unreal,--when, e.g., not honestly\nfeeling that the "burden" of our own personal sin "is intolerable," or\nwhen making a public Confession in church directly after a personal\nConfession in private.In the Visitation of the Sick, the third mode of {148} formal\nConfession is suggested, though the actual words are naturally left to\nthe individual penitent.The Prayer Book no longer speaks in the\nplural, or of "a _general_ Confession," but it closes, as it were, with\nthe soul, and gets into private, personal touch with it: "Here shall\nthe sick man be moved to make a _special_ Confession of his sins, if he\nfeel his conscience troubled with any weighty matter; after which\nConfession, the Priest shall absolve him (if he humbly and heartily\ndesire it) after this sort".This Confession is to be both free and\nformal: formal, for it is to be made before the Priest in his\n"_ministerial_" capacity; free, for the penitent is to be "moved" (not\n"compelled") to confess.Notice, he _is_ to be moved; but then (though\nnot till then) he is free to accept, or reject, the preferred means of\ngrace.Sacraments are open to all;\nthey are forced on none.They are love-tokens of the Sacred Heart;\nfree-will offerings of His Royal Bounty.These, then, are the two methods of Confession at our disposal.God is\n"the Father of an infinite Majesty".In _informal_ Confession, the\nsinner goes to God as his _Father_,--as the Prodigal, after doing\npenance in the far country, went {149} to his father with "_Father_, I\nhave sinned".In _formal_ Confession, the sinner goes to God as to the\nFather of an _infinite Majesty_,--as David went to God through Nathan,\nGod\'s ambassador.It is a fearful responsibility to hinder any soul from using either\nmethod; it is a daring risk to say: "Because one method alone appeals\nto me, therefore no other method shall be used by you".God multiplies\nHis methods, as He expands His love: and if any "David" is drawn to say\n"I have sinned" before the appointed "Nathan," and, through prejudice\nor ignorance, such an one is hindered from so laying his sins on Jesus,\nGod will require that soul at the hinderer\'s hands._Absolution._\n\nIt is the same with Absolution as with Confession.Here, too, we start\non common ground.All agree that "_God only_ can forgive sins," and\nhalf our differences come because this is not recognized.Whatever\nform Confession takes, the penitent exclaims: "_To Thee only it\nappertaineth to forgive sins_".Pardon through the Precious Blood is\nthe one, and only, source of {150} forgiveness.Our only difference,\nthen, is as to God\'s _methods_ of forgiveness.Some seem to limit His love, to tie forgiveness down to one, and\nonly one, method of absolution--direct, personal, instantaneous,\nwithout any ordained Channel such as Christ left.Direct, God\'s pardon\ncertainly is; personal and instantaneous, it certainly can be; without\nany sacramental _media_, it certainly may be.But we dare not limit\nwhat God has not limited; we dare not deny the existence of ordained\nchannels, because God can, and does, act without such channels.He has\nopened an ordained fountain for sin and uncleanness as a superadded\ngift of love, and in the Ministry of reconciliation He conveys pardon\nthrough this channel.At the most solemn moment of his life, when a Deacon is ordained\nPriest, the formal terms of his Commission to the Priesthood run thus:\n"Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in the\nChurch of God, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of our hands.Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou\ndost retain, they are retained."No\nPriest dare hide his commission, play with {151} the plain meaning of\nthe words, or conceal from others a "means of grace" which they have a\nblessed right to know of, and to use.But what is the good of this Absolution, if God can forgive without it?There must, therefore, be some\nsuperadded grace attached to this particular ordinance.It is not left merely to comfort the penitent (though that it\ndoes), nor to let him hear from a fellow-sinner that his sins are\nforgiven him (though that he does); but it is left, like any other\nSacrament, as a special means of grace.It is the ordained Channel\nwhereby God\'s pardon is conveyed to (and only to) the penitent sinner."No penitence, no pardon," is the law of Sacramental Absolution.The Prayer Book, therefore, preaches the power of formal, as well as\ninformal, Absolution.There are in it three forms of Absolution,\nvarying in words but the same in power.The appropriating power of the\npenitent may, and does, vary, according to the sincerity of his\nconfession: Absolution is in each case the same.It is man\'s capacity\nto receive it, not God\'s power in giving it, that varies.Thus, all\nthree Absolutions in the {152} Prayer Book are of the same force,\nthough our appropriating capacity in receiving them may differ.This\ncapacity will probably be less marked at Matins and Evensong than at\nHoly Communion, and at Holy Communion than in private Confession,\nbecause it will be less personal, less thorough.The words of\nAbsolution seem to suggest this.The first two forms are in the plural\n("pardon and deliver _you_"), and are thrown, as it were, broadcast\nover the Church: the third is special ("forgive _thee_ thine offences")\nand is administered to the individual.But the formal act is the same\nin each case; and to stroll late into church, as if the Absolution in\nMatins and Evensong does not matter, may be to incur a very distinct\nloss.When, and how often, formal "special Confession" is to be used, and\nformal Absolution to be sought, is left to each soul to decide.The\ntwo special occasions which the Church of England emphasizes (without\nlimiting) are before receiving the Holy Communion, and when sick.Before Communion, the Prayer Book counsels its use for any disquieted\nconscience; and the {153} Rubric which directs intending Communicants\nto send in their names to the Parish Priest the day before making their\nCommunion, still bears witness to its framers\' intention--that known\nsinners might not be communicated without first being brought to a\nstate of repentance.The sick, also, after being directed to make their wills,[3] and\narrange their temporal affairs, are further urged to examine their\nspiritual state; to make a special confession; and to obtain the\nspecial grace, in the special way provided for them.And, adds the\nRubric, "men should often be put in remembrance to take order for the\nsettling of their temporal estates, while they are in health"--and if\nof the temporal, how much more of their spiritual estate._Direction._\n\nBut, say some, is not all this very weakening to the soul?They are,\nprobably, mixing up two things,--the Divine Sacrament of forgiveness\nwhich (rightly used) must be strengthening, and the human appeal for\ndirection which (wrongly used) may be weakening.{154}\n\nBut "direction" is not necessarily part of Penance.The Prayer Book\nlays great stress upon it, and calls it "ghostly counsel and advice,"\nbut it is neither Confession nor Absolution.It has its own place in\nthe Prayer Book;[4] but it has not, necessarily, anything whatever to\ndo with the administration of the Sacrament.Direction may, or may\nnot, be good for the soul.It largely depends upon the character of\nthe penitent, and the wisdom of the Director.It is quite possible for\nthe priest to over-direct, and it is fatally possible for the penitent\nto think more of direction than of Absolution.It is quite possible to\nobscure the Sacramental side of Penance with a human craving for\n"ghostly counsel and advice".Satan would not be Satan if it were not\nso.But this "ghostly," or spiritual, "counsel and advice" has saved\nmany a lad, and many a man, from many a fall; and when rightly sought,\nand wisely given is, as the Prayer Book teaches, a most helpful adjunct\nto Absolution.Only, it is not, necessarily, a part of "going to\nConfession".{155}\n\n_Indulgences._\n\nThe abuse of the Sacrament is another, and not unnatural objection to\nits use; and it often gets mixed up with Mediaeval teaching about\nIndulgences.An _Indulgence_ is exactly what the word suggests--the act of\nindulging, or granting a favour.In Roman theology, an Indulgence is\nthe remission of temporal punishment due to sin after Absolution.It\nis either "plenary," i.e.when the whole punishment is remitted, or\n"partial," when some of it is remitted.At corrupt periods of Church\nhistory, these Indulgences have been bought for money,[5] thus making\none law for the rich, and another for the poor.Very naturally, the\nscandals connected with such buying and selling raised suspicions\nagainst the Sacrament with which Indulgences were associated.[6]  But\nIndulgences have nothing in the world to do with the right use of the\nlesser Sacrament of Penance.{156}\n\n_Amendment._\n\nThe promise of Amendment is an essential part of Penance.It is a\nnecessary element in all true contrition.Thus, the penitent promises\n"true amendment" before he receives Absolution.If he allowed a priest\nto give him Absolution without firmly purposing to amend, he would not\nonly invalidate the Absolution, but would commit an additional sin.The promise to amend may, like any other promise, be made and broken;\nbut the deliberate purpose must be there.No better description of true repentance can be found than in\nTennyson\'s "Guinevere":--\n\n  _For what is true repentance but in thought--_\n  _Not ev\'n in inmost thought to think again_\n  _The sins that made the past so pleasant to us._\n\n\nSuch has been the teaching of the Catholic Church always, everywhere,\nand at all times: such is the teaching of the Church of England, as\npart of that Church, and as authoritatively laid down in the Book of\nCommon Prayer.Absolution is the conveyance of God\'s\npardon to the penitent sinner by God\'s ordained Minister, through the\nordained Ministry of Reconciliation.{157}\n\n  Lamb of God, the world\'s transgression\n    Thou alone canst take away;\n  Hear!hear our heart\'s confession,\n    And Thy pardoning grace convey.Thine availing intercession\n    We but echo when we pray.[2] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[3] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[4] See the First Exhortation in the Order of the Administration of the\nHoly Communion.Peter\'s at Rome was largely built out of funds gained by the\nsale of indulgences.[6] The Council of Trent orders that Indulgences must be granted by\nPope and Prelate _gratis_.The second Sacrament of Recovery is _Unction_, or, in more familiar\nlanguage, "the Anointing of the Sick".It is called by Origen "the\ncomplement of Penance".The meaning of the Sacrament is found in St.let him call for the elders of the Church; and let them\npray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the\nprayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;\nand if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."Here the Bible states that the "Prayer of Faith" with Unction is more\neffective than the "Prayer of Faith" without Unction.It can (1) recover the body, and (2) restore the\nsoul.Its primary {159} object seems to be to recover the body; but it\nalso, according to the teaching of St.First, he says, Anointing with the Prayer of Faith heals the body; and\nthen, because of the inseparable union between body and soul, it\ncleanses the soul.Thus, as the object of Penance is primarily to heal the soul, and\nindirectly to heal the body; so the object of Unction is primarily to\nheal the body, and indirectly to heal the soul.The story of Unction may be summarized very shortly.It was instituted\nin Apostolic days, when the Apostles "anointed with oil many that were\nsick and healed them" (St.It was continued in the Early\nChurch, and perpetuated during the Middle Ages, when its use (by a\n"_corrupt_[1] following of the Apostles") was practically limited to\nthe preparation of the dying instead of (by a _correct_ "following of\nthe Apostles") being used for the recovery of the living.In our 1549\nPrayer Book an authorized Office was appointed for its use, but this,\nlest it should be misused, was omitted in 1552.And although, as\nBishop Forbes says, "everything of that earlier Liturgy was praised by\nthose who {160} removed it," it has not yet been restored.It is "one\nof the lost Pleiads" of our present Prayer Book.But, as Bishop Forbes\nadds, "there is nothing to hinder the revival of the Apostolic and\nScriptural Custom of Anointing the Sick whenever any devout person\ndesires it".[2]\n\n\n\n_Extreme Unction._\n\nAn unhistoric use of the name partly explains the unhistoric use of the\nSacrament._Extreme_, or last (_extrema_) Unction has been taken to\nmean the anointing of the sick when _in extremis_.This, as we have\nseen, is a "corrupt," and not a correct, "following of the Apostles".The phrase _Extreme_ Unction means the extreme, or last, of a series of\nritual Unctions, or anointings, once used in the Church.The first\nUnction was in Holy Baptism, when the Baptized were anointed with Holy\nOil: then came the anointing in Confirmation: then in Ordination; and,\nlast of all, the anointing of the sick.Of this last anointing, it is\nwritten: "All Christian men should account, and repute the said manner\nof anointing among the other Sacraments, forasmuch as it is a visible\nsign of an invisible grace".[3]\n\n{161}\n\n_Its Administration._\n\nIt must be administered under the Scriptural conditions laid down in\nSt.John went to the hallway.The first condition refers to:--\n\n(1) _The Minister_.--The Minister is _the Church_, in her corporate\ncapacity.Scripture says to the sick: "Let him call for the Elders,"\nor Presbyters, "of the Church".The word is in the plural; it is to be\nthe united act of the whole Church.And, further, there must be\nnothing secret about it, as if it were either a charm, or something to\nbe ashamed of, or apologized for.It may have to be done in a private\nhouse, but it is to be done by no private person.[4]  "Let him call for\nthe elders."(2) _The Manner_.--The Elders are to administer Sacrament not in their\nown name (any more than the Priest gives Absolution in his own name),\nbut "in the Name of the Lord".(3) _The Method_.--The sick man is to be anointed (either on the\nafflicted part, or in other ways), _with prayer_: "Let them pray over\nhim".{162}\n\n(4) _The Matter_.--Oil--"anointing him with oil".As in Baptism,\nsanctified water is the ordained matter by which "Jesus Christ\ncleanseth us from all sin"; so in Unction, consecrated oil is the\nordained matter used by the Holy Ghost to cleanse us from all\nsickness--bodily, and (adds St."And if he have\ncommitted sins, they shall be forgiven him."For this latter purpose, there are two Scriptural requirements:\n_Confession_ and _Intercession_.For it follows: "Confess your faults\none to another, and pray for one another that ye may be healed".Thus\nit is with Unction as with other Sacraments; with the "last" as with\nthe first--special grace is attached to special means.The Bible says\nthat, under certain conditions, oil and prayer together will effect\nmore than either oil or prayer apart; that oil without prayer cannot,\nand prayer without oil will not, win the special grace of healing\nguaranteed to the use of oil and prayer together.In our days, the use of anointing with prayer is (in alliance with, and\nin addition to, Medical Science) being more fully recognized."The\nPrayer of Faith" is coming into its own, and is being placed once more\nin proper position in the {163} sphere of healing; _anointing_ is being\nmore and more used "according to the Scriptures".Both are being used\ntogether in a simple belief in revealed truth.It often happens that\n"the elders of the Church" are sent for by the sick; a simple service\nis used; the sick man is anointed; the united "Prayer of Faith" (it\n_must_ be "of Faith") is offered; and, if it be good for his spiritual\nhealth, the sick man is "made whole of whatsoever disease he had".God give us in this, as in every other Sacrament, a braver, quieter,\nmore loving faith in His promises.The need still exists: the grace is\nstill to be had._If our love were but more simple,_\n    _We should take Him at His word;_\n  _And our lives would be all sunshine_\n    _In the sweetness of our Lord._\n\n\n\n[1] Article XXV.[2] "Forbes on the Articles" (xxv.).[3] "Institution of a Christian Man."[4] In the Greek Church, seven, or at least three, Priests must be\npresent.Augustine, St., 3,

more people, and of indulging\nin her charities, or in her extravagances, for that matter, as she\nwishes.I have no fear of her bodily comfort; her life, as far as that\nis concerned, will be easier and broader, and with more power for good.Her future, as I say, as you say also, is assured; but I want to ask you\nthis," the bishop leaned forward and watched the young man anxiously,\n"you can protect her in the future, but can you assure me that you can\nprotect her from the past?"Young Latimer raised his eyes calmly and said, "I don\'t think I quite\nunderstand.""I have perfect confidence, I say," returned the bishop, "in you as far\nas your treatment of Ellen is concerned in the future.You love her and\nyou would do everything to make the life of the woman you love a happy\none; but this is it, Can you assure me that there is nothing in the past\nthat may reach forward later and touch my daughter through you--no ugly\nstory, no oats that have been sowed, and no boomerang that you have\nthrown wantonly and that has not returned--but which may return?""I think I understand you now, sir," said the young man, quietly."I\nhave lived," he began, "as other men of my sort have lived.You know\nwhat that is, for you must have seen it about you at college, and after\nthat before you entered the Church.I judge so from your friends, who\nwere your friends then, I understand.I never\nwent in for dissipation, if you mean that, because it never attracted\nme.I am afraid I kept out of it not so much out of respect for others\nas for respect for myself.I found my self-respect was a very good thing\nto keep, and I rather preferred keeping it and losing several pleasures\nthat other men managed to enjoy, apparently with free consciences.I\nconfess I used to rather envy them.It is no particular virtue on my\npart; the thing struck me as rather more vulgar than wicked, and so I\nhave had no wild oats to speak of; and no woman, if that is what you\nmean, can write an anonymous letter, and no man can tell you a story\nabout me that he could not tell in my presence."John went back to the kitchen.There was something in the way the young man spoke which would have\namply satisfied the outsider, had he been present; but the bishop\'s eyes\nwere still unrelaxed and anxious.He made an impatient motion with his\nhand."I know you too well, I hope," he said, "to think of doubting your\nattitude in that particular.I know you are a gentleman, that is enough\nfor that; but there is something beyond these more common evils.You\nsee, I am terribly in earnest over this--you may think unjustly so,\nconsidering how well I know you, but this child is my only child.If her\nmother had lived, my responsibility would have been less great; but, as\nit is, God has left her here alone to me in my hands.I do not think He\nintended my duty should end when I had fed and clothed her, and taught\nher to read and write.I do not think He meant that I should only act as\nher guardian until the first man she fancied fancied her.I must look to\nher happiness not only now when she is with me, but I must assure myself\nof it when she leaves my roof.These common sins of youth I acquit you\nof.Such things are beneath you, I believe, and I did not even consider\nthem.But there are other toils in which men become involved, other\nevils or misfortunes which exist, and which threaten all men who are\nyoung and free and attractive in many ways to women, as well as men.You have lived the life of the young man of this day.You have reached\na place in your profession when you can afford to rest and marry and\nassume the responsibilities of marriage.Mary moved to the bathroom.You look forward to a life of\ncontent and peace and honorable ambition--a life, with your wife at your\nside, which is to last forty or fifty years.You consider where you will\nbe twenty years from now, at what point of your career you may become a\njudge or give up practice; your perspective is unlimited; you even\nthink of the college to which you may send your son.It is a long, quiet\nfuture that you are looking forward to, and you choose my daughter as\nthe companion for that future, as the one woman with whom you could live\ncontent for that length of time.And it is in that spirit that you come\nto me to-night and that you ask me for my daughter.Now I am going to\nask you one question, and as you answer that I will tell you whether\nor not you can have Ellen for your wife.You look forward, as I say, to\nmany years of life, and you have chosen her as best suited to live that\nperiod with you; but I ask you this, and I demand that you answer me\ntruthfully, and that you remember that you are speaking to her father.Imagine that I had the power to tell you, or rather that some superhuman\nagent could convince you, that you had but a month to live, and that for\nwhat you did in that month you would not be held responsible either by\nany moral law or any law made by man, and that your life hereafter would\nnot be influenced by your conduct in that month, would you spend it, I\nask you--and on your answer depends mine--would you spend those thirty\ndays, with death at the end, with my daughter, or with some other woman\nof whom I know nothing?"Latimer sat for some time silent, until indeed, his silence assumed\nsuch a significance that he raised his head impatiently and said with a\nmotion of the hand, "I mean to answer you in a minute; I want to be sure\nthat I understand."The bishop bowed his head in assent, and for a still longer period the\nmen sat motionless.The clock in the corner seemed to tick more loudly,\nand the dead coals dropping in the grate had a sharp, aggressive sound.The notes of the piano that had risen from the room below had ceased."If I understand you," said Latimer, finally, and his voice and his\nface as he raised it were hard and aggressive, "you are stating a purely\nhypothetical case.You wish to try me by conditions which do not exist,\nwhich cannot exist.What justice is there, what right is there,\nin asking me to say how I would act under circumstances which are\nimpossible, which lie beyond the limit of human experience?You cannot\njudge a man by what he would do if he were suddenly robbed of all his\nmental and moral training and of the habit of years.I am not admitting,\nunderstand me, that if the conditions which you suggest did exist that I\nwould do one whit differently from what I will do if they remain as they\nare.I am merely denying your right to put such a question to me at all.You might just as well judge the shipwrecked sailors on a raft who eat\neach other\'s flesh as you would judge a sane, healthy man who did such\na thing in his own home.Are you going to condemn men who are ice-locked\nat the North Pole, or buried in the heart of Africa, and who have given\nup all thought of return and are half mad and wholly without hope, as\nyou would judge ourselves?Are they to be weighed and balanced as you\nand I are, sitting here within the sound of the cabs outside and with\na bake-shop around the corner?What you propose could not exist, could\nnever happen.I could never be placed where I should have to make such\na choice, and you have no right to ask me what I would do or how I\nwould act under conditions that are super-human--you used the word\nyourself--where all that I have held to be good and just and true would\nbe obliterated.I would be unworthy of myself, I would be unworthy of\nyour daughter, if I considered such a state of things for a moment, or\nif I placed my hopes of marrying her on the outcome of such a test, and\nso, sir," said the young man, throwing back his head, "I must refuse to\nanswer you."The bishop lowered his hand from before his eyes and sank back wearily\ninto his chair."You have no right to say that," cried the young man, springing to his\nfeet."You have no right to suppose anything or to draw any conclusions.He stood with his head and shoulders thrown\nback, and with his hands resting on his hips and with the fingers\nworking nervously at his waist."What you have said," replied the bishop, in a voice that had changed\nstrangely, and which was inexpressibly sad and gentle, "is merely a\ncurtain of words to cover up your true feeling.It would have been so\neasy to have said, \'For thirty days or for life Ellen is the only woman\nwho has the power to make me happy.\'You see that would have answered me\nand satisfied me.But you did not say that," he added, quickly, as the\nyoung man made a movement as if to speak."Well, and suppose this other woman did exist, what then?""The conditions you suggest are impossible; you must, you will\nsurely, sir, admit that.""I do not know," replied the bishop, sadly; "I do not know.It may\nhappen that whatever obstacle there has been which has kept you from her\nmay be removed.It may be that she has married, it may be that she has\nfallen so low that you cannot marry her.But if you have loved her once,\nyou may love her again; whatever it was that separated you in the past,\nthat separates you now, that makes you prefer my daughter to her, may\ncome to an end when you are married, when it will be too late, and when\nonly trouble can come of it, and Ellen would bear that trouble."But I tell you it is impossible," cried the young man."The woman is\nbeyond the love of any man, at least such a man as I am, or try to be.""Do you mean," asked the bishop, gently, and with an eager look of hope,\n"that she is dead?"Latimer faced the father for some seconds in silence."No," he said, "I do not mean she is dead.Again the bishop moved back wearily into his chair."You mean then," he\nsaid, "perhaps, that she is a married woman?"Latimer pressed his lips\ntogether at first as though he would not answer, and then raised his\neyes coldly.The older man had held up his hand as if to signify that what he was\nabout to say should be listened to without interruption, when a sharp\nturning of the lock of the door caused both father and the suitor to\nstart.Then they turned and looked at each other with anxious inquiry\nand with much concern, for they recognized for the first time that their\nvoices had been loud.The older man stepped quickly across the floor,\nbut before he reached the middle of the room the door opened from the\noutside, and his daughter stood in the door-way, with her head held down\nand her eyes looking at the floor.exclaimed the father, in a voice of pain and the deepest pity.The girl moved toward the place from where his voice came, without\nraising her eyes, and when she reached him put her arms about him and\nhid her face on his shoulder.She moved as though she were tired, as\nthough she were exhausted by some heavy work."My child," said the bishop, gently, "were you listening?"There was no\nreproach in his voice; it was simply full of pity and concern."I thought," whispered the girl, brokenly, "that he would be frightened;\nI wanted to hear what he would say.I thought I could laugh at him\nfor it afterward.I thought--" she stopped with a\nlittle gasping sob that she tried to hide, and for a moment held herself\nerect and then sank back again into her father\'s arms with her head upon\nhis breast.Latimer started forward, holding out his arms to her."Ellen," he said,\n"surely, Ellen, you are not against me.You see how preposterous it is,\nhow unjust it is to me.You cannot mean--"\n\nThe girl raised her head and shrugged her shoulders slightly as though\nshe were cold."Father," she said, wearily, "ask him to go away, Why\ndoes he stay?Latimer stopped and took a step back as though some one had struck him,\nand then stood silent with his face flushed and his eyes flashing.It\nwas not in answer to anything that they said that he spoke, but to their\nattitude and what it suggested."You stand there," he began, "you\ntwo stand there as though I were something unclean, as though I had\ncommitted some crime.You look at me as though I were on trial for\nmurder or worse.You loved me a half-hour ago, Ellen; you said\nyou did.I know you loved me; and you, sir," he added, more quietly,\n"treated me like a friend.Has anything come since then to change me or\nyou?It is a silly,\nneedless, horrible mistake.You know I love you, Ellen; love you better\nthan all the world.I don\'t have to tell you that; you know it, you can\nsee and feel it.It does not need to be said; words can\'t make it any\ntruer.You have confused yourselves and stultified yourselves with this\ntrick, this test by hypothetical conditions, by considering what is not\nreal or possible.It is simple enough; it is plain enough.You know I\nlove you, Ellen, and you only, and that is all there is to it, and all\nthat there is of any consequence in the world to me.The matter stops\nthere; that is all there is for you to consider.Answer me, Ellen, speak\nto me.He stopped and moved a step toward her, but as he did so, the girl,\nstill without looking up, drew herself nearer to her father and shrank\nmore closely into his arms; but the father\'s face was troubled and\ndoubtful, and he regarded the younger man with a look of the most\nanxious scrutiny.Their hands were raised\nagainst him as far as he could understand, and he broke forth again\nproudly, and with a defiant indignation:\n\n"What right have you to judge me?"he began; "what do you know of what\nI have suffered, and endured, and overcome?How can you know what I have\nhad to give up and put away from me?It\'s easy enough for you to draw\nyour skirts around you, but what can a woman bred as you have been bred\nknow of what I\'ve had to fight against and keep under and cut away?It\nwas an easy, beautiful idyl to you; your love came to you only when it\nshould have come, and for a man who was good and worthy, and distinctly\neligible--I don\'t mean that; forgive me, Ellen, but you drive me beside\nmyself.But he is good and he believes himself worthy, and I say that\nmyself before you both.But I am only worthy and only good because of\nthat other love that I put away when it became a crime, when it became\nimpossible.Do you know what it meant to\nme, and what I went through, and how I suffered?Do you know who this\nother woman is whom you are insulting with your doubts and guesses in\nthe dark?Perhaps it was easy\nfor her, too; perhaps her silence cost her nothing; perhaps she did not\nsuffer and has nothing but happiness and content to look forward to for\nthe rest of her life; and I tell you that it is because we did put\nit away, and kill it, and not give way to it that I am whatever I am\nto-day; whatever good there is in me is due to that temptation and\nto the fact that I beat it and overcame it and kept myself honest and\nclean.And when I met you and learned to know you I believed in my heart\nthat God had sent you to me that I might know what it was to love a\nwoman whom I could marry and who could be my wife; that you were the\nreward for my having overcome temptation and the sign that I had done\nwell.And now you throw me over and put me aside as though I were\nsomething low and unworthy, because of this temptation, because of this\nvery thing that has made me know myself and my own strength and that has\nkept me up for you."As the young man had been speaking, the bishop\'s eyes had never left\nhis face, and as he finished, the face of the priest grew clearer and\ndecided, and calmly exultant.And as Latimer ceased he bent his head\nabove his daughter\'s, and said in a voice that seemed to speak with more\nthan human inspiration."My child," he said, "if God had given me a son\nI should have been proud if he could have spoken as this young man has\ndone."But the woman only said, "Let him go to her."He drew back from the girl in his arms and looked anxiously and\nfeelingly at her lover."How could you, Ellen," he said, "how could\nyou?"He was watching the young man\'s face with eyes full of sympathy\nand concern."How little you know him," he said, "how little you\nunderstand.He will not do that," he added quickly, but looking\nquestioningly at Latimer and speaking in a tone almost of command."He\nwill not undo all that he has done; I know him better than that."But\nLatimer made no answer, and for a moment the two men stood watching each\nother and questioning each other with their eyes.Then Latimer turned,\nand without again so much as glancing at the girl walked steadily to the\ndoor and left the room.He passed on slowly down the stairs and out into\nthe night, and paused upon the top of the steps leading to the street.Below him lay the avenue with its double line of lights stretching off\nin two long perspectives.The lamps of hundreds of cabs and carriages\nflashed as they advanced toward him and shone for a moment at the\nturnings of the cross-streets, and from either side came the ceaseless\nrush and murmur, and over all hung the strange mystery that covers a\ngreat city at night.Latimer\'s rooms lay to the south, but he stood\nlooking toward a spot to the north with a reckless, harassed look in his\nface that had not been there for many months.He stood so for a minute,\nand then gave a short shrug of disgust at his momentary doubt and ran\nquickly down the steps."No," he said, "if it were for a month, yes; but\nit is to be for many years, many more long years."And turning his back\nresolutely to the north he went slowly home.8\n\n\nThe "trailer" for the green-goods men who rented room No.8 in Case\'s\ntenement had had no work to do for the last few days, and was cursing\nhis luck in consequence.He was entirely too young to curse, but he had never been told so, and,\nindeed, so imperfect had his training been that he had never been told\nnot to do anything as long as it pleased him to do it and made existence\nany more bearable.He had been told when he was very young, before the man and woman who\nhad brought him into the world had separated, not to crawl out on the\nfire-escape, because he might break his neck, and later, after his\nfather had walked off Hegelman\'s Slip into the East River while very\ndrunk, and his mother had been sent to the penitentiary for grand\nlarceny, he had been told not to let the police catch him sleeping under\nthe bridge.With these two exceptions he had been told to do as he pleased, which\nwas the very mockery of advice, as he was just about as well able to do\nas he pleased as is any one who has to beg or steal what he eats and has\nto sleep in hall-ways or over the iron gratings of warm cellars and has\nthe officers of the children\'s societies always after him to put him in\na "Home" and make him be "good.""Snipes," as the trailer was called, was determined no one should ever\nforce him to be good if he could possibly prevent it.And he certainly\ndid do a great deal to prevent it.Some of the boys who had escaped from the Home had told him all about\nthat.It meant wearing shoes and a blue and white checkered apron, and\nmaking cane-bottomed chairs all day, and having to wash yourself in a\nbig iron tub twice a week, not to speak of having to move about like\nmachines whenever the lady teacher hit a bell.So when the green-goods\nmen, of whom the genial Mr.Alf Wolfe was the chief, asked Snipes to\nact as "trailer" for them at a quarter of a dollar for every victim he\nshadowed, he jumped at the offer and was proud of the position.If you should happen to keep a grocery store in the country, or to\nrun the village post-office, it is not unlikely that you know what a\ngreen-goods man is; but in case you don\'t, and have only a vague idea\nas to how he lives, a paragraph of explanation must be inserted here\nfor your particular benefit.Green goods is the technical name for\ncounterfeit bills, and the green-goods men send out circulars to\ncountrymen all over the United States, offering to sell them $5,000\nworth of counterfeit money for $500, and ease their conscience by\nexplaining to them that by purchasing these green goods they are hurting\nno one but the Government, which is quite able, with its big surplus, to\nstand the loss.They enclose a letter which is to serve their victim as\na mark of identification or credential when he comes on to purchase.The address they give him is in one of the many drug-store and\ncigar-store post-offices which are scattered all over New York, and\nwhich contribute to make vice and crime so easy that the evil they do\ncannot be reckoned in souls lost or dollars stolen.If the letter from\nthe countryman strikes the dealers in green goods as sincere, they\nappoint an interview with him by mail in rooms they rent for the\npurpose, and if they, on meeting him there, think he is still in earnest\nand not a detective or officer in disguise, they appoint still another\ninterview, to be held later in the day in the back room of some saloon.Then the countryman is watched throughout the day from the moment\nhe leaves the first meeting-place until he arrives at the saloon.If\nanything in his conduct during that time leads the man whose duty it is\nto follow him, or the "trailer," as the profession call it, to believe\nhe is a detective, he finds when he arrives at the saloon that there\nis no one to receive him.But if the trailer regards his conduct as\nunsuspicious, he is taken to another saloon, not the one just appointed,\nwhich is, perhaps, a most respectable place, but to the thieves\' own\nprivate little rendezvous, where he is robbed in any of the several\ndifferent ways best suited to their purpose.He was so little that no one ever\nnoticed him, and he could keep a man in sight no matter how big the\ncrowd was, or how rapidly it changed and shifted.And he was as patient\nas he was quick, and would wait for hours if needful, with his eye on\na door, until his man reissued into the street again.And if the one he\nshadowed looked behind him to see if he was followed, or dodged up and\ndown different streets, as if he were trying to throw off pursuit, or\ndespatched a note or telegram, or stopped to speak to a policeman or any\nspecial officer, as a detective might, who thought he had his men safely\nin hand, off Snipes would go on a run, to where Alf Wolfe was waiting,\nand tell what he had seen.Then Wolfe would give him a quarter or more, and the trailer would go\nback to his post opposite Case\'s tenement, and wait for another victim\nto issue forth, and for the signal from No.It was not\nmuch fun, and "customers," as Mr.Wolfe always called them, had been\nscarce, and Mr.Wolfe, in consequence, had been cross and nasty in his\ntemper, and had batted Snipe out of the way on more than one occasion.So the trailer was feeling blue and disconsolate, and wondered how it\nwas that "Naseby" Raegen, "Rags" Raegen\'s younger brother, had had the\nluck to get a two weeks\' visit to the country with the Fresh Air Fund\nchildren, while he had not.He supposed it was because Naseby had sold papers, and wore shoes, and\nwent to night school, and did many other things equally objectionable.Still, what Naseby had said about the country, and riding horseback,\nand the fishing, and the shooting crows with no cops to stop you, and\nwatermelons for nothing, had sounded wonderfully attractive and quite\nimprobable, except that it was one of Naseby\'s peculiarly sneaking ways\nto tell the truth.Anyway, Naseby had left Cherry Street for good, and\nhad gone back to the country to work there.This all helped to make\nSnipes morose, and it was with a cynical smile of satisfaction that he\nwatched an old countryman coming slowly up the street, and asking his\nway timidly of the Italians to Case\'s tenement.The countryman looked up and about him in evident bewilderment and\nanxiety.He glanced hesitatingly across at the boy leaning against the\nwall of a saloon, but the boy was watching two sparrows fighting in the\ndirt of the street, and did not see him.At least, it did not look as if\nhe saw him.Then the old man knocked on the door of Case\'s tenement.No one came, for the people in the house had learned to leave inquiring\ncountrymen to the gentleman who rented room No.8, and as that gentleman\nwas occupied at that moment with a younger countryman, he allowed the\nold man, whom he had first cautiously observed from the top of the\nstairs, to remain where he was.The old man stood uncertainly on the stoop, and then removed his heavy\nblack felt hat and rubbed his bald head and the white shining locks of\nhair around it with a red bandanna handkerchief.Then he walked very\nslowly across the street toward Snipes, for the rest of the street was\nempty, and there was no one else at hand.The old man was dressed in\nheavy black broadcloth, quaintly cut, with boot legs showing up under\nthe trousers, and with faultlessly clean linen of home-made manufacture."I can\'t make the people in that house over there hear me," complained\nthe old man, with the simple confidence that old age has in very young\nboys."Do you happen to know if they\'re at home?""I\'m looking for a man named Perceval," said the stranger; "he lives in\nthat house, and I wanter see him on most particular business.It isn\'t\na very pleasing place he lives in, is it--at least," he hurriedly added,\nas if fearful of giving offence, "it isn\'t much on the outside?Do you\nhappen to know him?"Perceval was Alf Wolfe\'s business name."Well, I\'m not looking for him," explained the stranger, slowly, "as\nmuch as I\'m looking for a young man that I kind of suspect is been\nto see him to-day: a young man that looks like me, only younger.Has\nlightish hair and pretty tall and lanky, and carrying a shiny black bag\nwith him.Did you happen to hev noticed him going into that place across\nthe way?"The old man sighed and nodded his head thoughtfully at Snipes, and\npuckered up the corners of his mouth, as though he were thinking deeply.He had wonderfully honest blue eyes, and with the white hair hanging\naround his sun-burned face, he looked like an old saint.But the trailer\ndidn\'t know that: he did know, though, that this man was a different\nsort from the rest."What is\'t you want to see him about?"he asked sullenly, while he\nlooked up and down the street and everywhere but at the old man, and\nrubbed one bare foot slowly over the other.The old man looked pained, and much to Snipe\'s surprise, the question\nbrought the tears to his eyes, and his lips trembled.Then he swerved\nslightly, so that he might have fallen if Snipes had not caught him and\nhelped him across the pavement to a seat on a stoop."Thankey, son,"\nsaid the stranger; "I\'m not as strong as I was, an\' the sun\'s mighty\nhot, an\' these streets of yours smell mighty bad, and I\'ve had a\npowerful lot of trouble these last few days.But if I could see this\nman Perceval before my boy does, I know I could fix it, and it would all\ncome out right.""What do you want to see him about?"repeated the trailer, suspiciously,\nwhile he fanned the old man with his hat.Snipes could not have told you\nwhy he did this or why this particular old countryman was any different\nfrom the many others who came to buy counterfeit money and who were\nthieves at heart as well as in deed."I want to see him about my son," said the old man to the little boy."He\'s a bad man whoever he is.This \'ere Perceval is a bad man.He sends\ndown his wickedness to the country and tempts weak folks to sin.He\nteaches \'em ways of evil-doing they never heard of, and he\'s ruined my\nson with the others--ruined him.I\'ve had nothing to do with the city\nand its ways; we\'re strict living, simple folks, and perhaps we\'ve been\ntoo strict, or Abraham wouldn\'t have run away to the city.But I thought\nit was best, and I doubted nothing when the fresh-air children came to\nthe farm.I didn\'t like city children, but I let \'em come.I took\n\'em in, and did what I could to make it pleasant for \'em.Poor little\nfellers, all as thin as corn-stalks and pale as ghosts, and as dirty as\nyou."I took \'em in and let \'em ride the horses, and swim in the river, and\nshoot crows in the cornfield, and eat all the cherries they could\npull, and what did the city send me in return for that?It sent me this\nthieving, rascally scheme of this man Perceval\'s, and it turned my boy\'s\nhead, and lost him to me.I saw him poring over the note and reading it\nas if it were Gospel, and I suspected nothing.And when he asked me if\nhe could keep it, I said yes he could, for I thought he wanted it for a\ncuriosity, and then off he put with the black bag and the $200 he\'s been\nsaving up to start housekeeping with when the old Deacon says he can\nmarry his daughter Kate."The old man placed both hands on his knees and\nwent on excitedly."The old Deacon says he\'ll not let \'em marry till Abe has $2,000, and\nthat is what the boy\'s come after.He wants to buy $2,000 worth of bad\nmoney with his $200 worth of good money, to show the Deacon, just as\nthough it were likely a marriage after such a crime as that would ever\nbe a happy one."Snipes had stopped fanning the old man, as he ran on, and was listening\nintently, with an uncomfortable feeling of sympathy and sorrow,\nuncomfortable because he was not used to it.He could not see why the old man should think the city should have\ntreated his boy better because he had taken care of the city\'s children,\nand he was puzzled between his allegiance to the gang and his desire\nto help the gang\'s innocent victim, and then because he was an innocent\nvictim and not a "customer," he let his sympathy get the better of his\ndiscretion."Saay," he began, abruptly, "I\'m not sayin\' nothin\' to nobody, and\nnobody\'s sayin\' nothin\' to me--see?but I guess your son\'ll be around\nhere to-day, sure.He\'s got to come before one, for this office closes\nsharp at one, and we goes home.Now, I\'ve got the call whether he gets\nhis stuff taken off him or whether the boys leave him alone.If I say\nthe word, they\'d no more come near him than if he had the cholera--see?An\' I\'ll say it for this oncet, just for you.Hold on," he commanded, as\nthe old man raised his voice in surprised interrogation, "don\'t ask no\nquestions, \'cause you won\'t get no answers \'except lies.You find your\nway back to the Grand Central Depot and wait there, and I\'ll steer your\nson down to you, sure, as soon as I can find him--see?Now get along, or\nyou\'ll get me inter trouble.""You\'ve been lying to me, then," cried the old man, "and you\'re as bad\nas any of them, and my boy\'s over in that house now."Mary travelled to the hallway.He scrambled up from the stoop, and before the trailer could understand\nwhat he proposed to do, had dashed across the street and up the stoop,\nand up the stairs, and had burst into room No.come back out of that, you old fool!"Snipes was afraid to enter room\nNo.8, but he could hear from the outside the old man challenging Alf\nWolfe in a resonant angry voice that rang through the building.said Snipes, crouching on the stairs, "there\'s goin\' to be a\nmuss this time, sure!"He ran across the room and pulled open a door that led into another\nroom, but it was empty.He had fully expected to see his boy murdered\nand quartered, and with his pockets inside out.He turned on Wolfe,\nshaking his white hair like a mane."Give me up my son, you rascal you!"he cried, "or I\'ll get the police, and I\'ll tell them how you decoy\nhonest boys to your den and murder them.""Are you drunk or crazy, or just a little of both?""For a cent I\'d throw you out of that window.You\'re too old to get excited like that; it\'s not good for you."But this only exasperated the old man the more, and he made a lunge\nat the confidence man\'s throat.Wolfe stepped aside and caught him\naround the waist and twisted his leg around the old man\'s rheumatic one,\nand held him."Now," said Wolfe, as quietly as though he were giving a\nlesson in wrestling, "if I wanted to, I could break your back."The old man glared up at him, panting."Your son\'s not here," said\nWolfe, "and this is a private gentleman\'s private room.I could turn\nyou over to the police for assault if I wanted to; but," he added,\nmagnanimously, "I won\'t.Now get out of here and go home to your wife,\nand when you come to see the sights again don\'t drink so much raw\nwhiskey."He half carried the old farmer to the top of the stairs and\ndropped him, and went back and closed the door.Snipes came up and\nhelped him down and out, and the old man and the boy walked slowly and\nin silence out to the Bowery.Snipes helped his companion into a car and\nput him off at the Grand Central Depot.The heat and the excitement had\ntold heavily on the old man, and he seemed dazed and beaten.He was leaning on the trailer\'s shoulder and waiting for his turn in\nthe line in front of the ticket window, when a tall, gawky, good-looking\ncountry lad sprang out of it and at him with an expression of surprise\nand anxiety."Father," he said, "father, what\'s wrong?"Abraham," said the old man, simply, and dropped heavily on the younger\nman\'s shoulder.Then he raised his head sternly and said: "I thought you\nwere murdered, but better that than a thief, Abraham.What did you do with that rascal\'s letter?The trailer drew cautiously away; the conversation was becoming\nunpleasantly personal."I don\'t know what you\'re talking about," said Abraham, calmly."The\nDeacon gave his consent the other night without the $2,000, and I took\nthe $200 I\'d saved and came right on in the fust train to buy the ring.he said, flushing, as he pulled out a little\nvelvet box and opened it.The old man was so happy at this that he laughed and cried alternately,\nand then he made a grab for the trailer and pulled him down beside him\non one of the benches."You\'ve got to come with me," he said, with kind severity."You\'re a\ngood boy, but your folks have let you run wrong.You\'ve been good to\nme, and you said you would get me back my boy and save him from those\nthieves, and I believe now that you meant it.Now you\'re just coming\nback with us to the farm and the cows and the river, and you can eat\nall you want and live with us, and never, never see this unclean, wicked\ncity again."Snipes looked up keenly from under the rim of his hat and rubbed one of\nhis muddy feet over the other as was his habit.The young countryman,\ngreatly puzzled, and the older man smiling kindly, waited expectantly in\nsilence.From outside came the sound of the car-bells jangling, and the\nrattle of cabs, and the cries of drivers, and all the varying rush and\nturmoil of a great metropolis.Green fields, and running rivers, and\nfruit that did not grow in wooden boxes or brown paper cones, were myths\nand idle words to Snipes, but this "unclean, wicked city" he knew."I guess you\'re too good for me," he said, with an uneasy laugh."I\nguess little old New York\'s good enough for me."cried the old man, in the tones of greatest concern."You would\ngo back to that den of iniquity, surely not,--to that thief Perceval?""Well," said the trailer, slowly, "and he\'s not such a bad lot, neither.You see he could hev broke your neck that time when you was choking him,\nbut he didn\'t.There\'s your train," he added hurriedly and jumping away.I\'m much \'bliged to you jus\' for asking me."Two hours later the farmer and his son were making the family weep and\nlaugh over their adventures, as they all sat together on the porch with\nthe vines about it; and the trailer was leaning against the wall of a\nsaloon and apparently counting his ten toes, but in reality watching for\nMr.Wolfe to give the signal from the window of room No."THERE WERE NINETY AND NINE"\n\n\nYoung Harringford, or the "Goodwood Plunger," as he was perhaps better\nknown at that time, had come to Monte Carlo in a very different spirit\nand in a very different state of mind from any in which he had ever\nvisited the place before.He had come there for the same reason that\na wounded lion, or a poisoned rat, for that matter, crawls away into a\ncorner, that it may be alone when it dies.He stood leaning against one\nof the pillars of the Casino with his back to the moonlight, and with\nhis eyes blinking painfully at the flaming lamps above the green tables\ninside.He knew they would be put out very soon; and as he had something\nto do then, he regarded them fixedly with painful earnestness, as a man\nwho is condemned to die at sunrise watches through his barred windows\nfor the first gray light of the morning.That queer, numb feeling in his head and the sharp line of pain between\nhis eyebrows which had been growing worse for the last three weeks, was\ntroubling him more terribly than ever before, and his nerves had thrown\noff all control and rioted at the base of his head and at his wrists,\nand jerked and twitched as though, so it seemed to him, they were\nstriving to pull the tired body into pieces and to set themselves free.He was wondering whether if he should take his hand from his pocket and\ntouch his head he would find that it had grown longer, and had turned\ninto a soft, spongy mass which would give beneath his fingers.He\nconsidered this for some time, and even went so far as to half withdraw\none hand, but thought better of it and shoved it back again as he\nconsidered how much less terrible it was to remain in doubt than to find\nthat this phenomenon had actually taken place.The pity of the whole situation was, that the boy was only a boy with\nall his man\'s miserable knowledge of the world, and the reason of it all\nwas, that he had entirely too much heart and not enough money to make\nan unsuccessful gambler.If he had only been able to lose his conscience\ninstead of his money, or even if he had kept his conscience and won, it\nis not likely that he would have been waiting for the lights to go\nout at Monte Carlo.But he had not only lost all of his money and more\nbesides, which he could never make up, but he had lost other things\nwhich meant much more to him now than money, and which could not be\nmade up or paid back at even usurious interest.He had not only lost the\nright to sit at his father\'s table, but the right to think of the girl\nwhose place in Surrey ran next to that of his own people, and whose\nlighted window in the north wing he had watched on those many dreary\nnights when she had been ill, from his own terrace across the trees\nin the park.And all he had gained was the notoriety that made him a\nby-word with decent people, and the hero of the race-tracks and the\nmusic-halls.He was no longer "Young Harringford, the eldest son of the\nHarringfords of Surrey," but the "Goodwood Plunger," to whom Fortune had\nmade desperate love and had then jilted, and mocked, and overthrown.As he looked back at it now and remembered himself as he was then, it\nseemed as though he was considering an entirely distinct and separate\npersonage--a boy of whom he liked to think, who had had strong, healthy\nambitions and gentle tastes.He reviewed it passionlessly as he stood\nstaring at the lights inside the Casino, as clearly as he was capable\nof doing in his present state and with miserable interest.How he had\nlaughed when young Norton told him in boyish confidence that there was\na horse named Siren in his father\'s stables which would win the Goodwood\nCup; how, having gone down to see Norton\'s people when the long vacation\nbegan, he had seen Siren daily, and had talked of her until two every\nmorning in the smoking-room, and had then staid up two hours later to\nwatch her take her trial spin over the downs.He remembered how they\nused to stamp back over the long grass wet with dew, comparing watches\nand talking of the time in whispers, and said good night as the sun\nbroke over the trees in the park.And then just at this time of all\nothers, when the horse was the only interest of those around him, from\nLord Norton and his whole household down to the youngest stable-boy and\noldest gaffer in the village, he had come into his money.And then began the then and still inexplicable plunge into gambling,\nand the wagering of greater sums than the owner of Siren dared to risk\nhimself, the secret backing of the horse through commissioners all\nover England, until the boy by his single fortune had brought the odds\nagainst her from 60 to 0 down to 6 to 0.He recalled, with a thrill that\nseemed to settle his nerves for the moment, the little black specks at\nthe starting-post and the larger specks as the horses turned the first\ncorner.The rest of the people on the coach were making a great deal of\nnoise, he remembered, but he, who had more to lose than any one or all\nof them together, had stood quite still with his feet on the wheel and\nhis back against the box-seat, and with his hands sunk into his pockets\nand the nails cutting through his gloves.The specks grew into horses\nwith bits of color on them, and then the deep muttering roar of the\ncrowd merged into one great shout, and swelled and grew into sharper,\nquicker, impatient cries, as the horses turned into the stretch with\nonly their heads showing toward the goal.Some of the people were\nshouting "Firefly!"and others were calling on "Vixen!"and others, who\nhad their glasses up, cried "Trouble leads!"but he only waited until\nhe could distinguish the Norton colors, with his lips pressed tightly\ntogether.Then they came so close that their hoofs echoed as loudly as\nwhen horses gallop over a bridge, and from among the leaders Siren\'s\nbeautiful head and shoulders showed like sealskin in the sun, and the\nboy on her back leaned forward and touched her gently with his hand, as\nthey had so often seen him do on the downs, and Siren, as though he had\ntouched a spring, leaped forward with her head shooting back and out,\nlike a piston-rod that has broken loose from its fastening and beats the\nair, while the jockey sat motionless, with his right arm hanging at\nhis side as limply as though it were broken, and with his left moving\nforward and back in time with the desperate strokes of the horse\'s head.cried Lord Norton, with a grim smile, and "Siren!"the\nmob shouted back with wonder and angry disappointment, and "Siren!"the\nhills echoed from far across the course.Young Harringford felt as if\nhe had suddenly been lifted into heaven after three months of purgatory,\nand smiled uncertainly at the excited people on the coach about him.It\nmade him smile even now when he recalled young Norton\'s flushed face\nand the awe and reproach in his voice when he climbed up and whispered,\n"Why, Cecil, they say in the ring you\'ve won a fortune, and you never\ntold us."And how Griffith, the biggest of the book-makers, with\nthe rest of them at his back, came up to him and touched his hat\nresentfully, and said, "You\'ll have to give us time, sir; I\'m very hard\nhit"; and how the crowd stood about him and looked at him curiously,\nand the Certain Royal Personage turned and said, "Who--not that boy,\nsurely?"Then how, on the day following, the papers told of the young\ngentleman who of all others had won a fortune, thousands and thousands\nof pounds they said, getting back sixty for every one he had ventured;\nand pictured him in baby clothes with the cup in his arms, or in an Eton\njacket; and how all of them spoke of him slightingly, or admiringly, as\nthe "Goodwood Plunger."He did not care to go on after that; to recall the mortification of his\nfather, whose pride was hurt and whose hopes were dashed by this sudden,\nmad freak of fortune, nor how he railed at it and provoked him until the\nboy rebelled and went back to the courses, where he was a celebrity and\na king.Fortune and greater fortune at first;\ndays in which he could not lose, days in which he drove back to the\ncrowded inns choked with dust, sunburnt and fagged with excitement, to\na riotous supper and baccarat, and afterward went to sleep only to see\ncards and horses and moving crowds and clouds of dust; days spent in\na short covert coat, with a field-glass over his shoulder and with a\npasteboard ticket dangling from his buttonhole; and then came the change\nthat brought conscience up again, and the visits to the Jews, and the\nslights of the men who had never been his friends, but whom he had\nthought had at least liked him for himself, even if he did not like\nthem; and then debts, and more debts, and the borrowing of money to pay\nhere and there, and threats of executions; and, with it all, the longing\nfor the fields and trout springs of Surrey and the walk across the park\nto where she lived.This grew so strong that he wrote to his father, and was told briefly\nthat he who was to have kept up the family name had dragged it into the\ndust of the race-courses, and had changed it at his own wish to that of\nthe Boy Plunger--and that the breach was irreconcilable.Then this queer feeling came on, and he wondered why he could not eat,\nand why he shivered even when the room was warm or the sun shining, and\nthe fear came upon him that with all this trouble and disgrace his head\nmight give way, and then that it had given way.This came to him at all\ntimes, and lately more frequently and with a fresher, more cruel thrill\nof terror, and he began to watch himself and note how he spoke, and to\nrepeat over what he had said to see if it were sensible, and to question\nhimself as to why he laughed, and at what.It was not a question of\nwhether it would or would not be cowardly; It was simply a necessity.He had to have rest and sleep and peace\nagain.He had boasted in those reckless, prosperous days that if by any\npossible chance he should lose his money he would drive a hansom, or\nemigrate to the colonies, or take the shilling.He had no patience in\nthose days with men who could not live on in adversity, and who were\nfound in the gun-room with a hole in their heads, and whose family asked\ntheir polite friends to believe that a man used to firearms from his\nschool-days had tried to load a hair-trigger revolver with the muzzle\npointed at his forehead.He had expressed a fine contempt for those men\nthen, but now he had forgotten all that, and thought only of the\nrelief it would bring, and not how others might suffer by it.If he did\nconsider this, it was only to conclude that they would quite understand,\nand be glad that his pain and fear were over.Then he planned a grand _coup_ which was to pay off all his debts and\ngive him a second chance to present himself a supplicant at his father\'s\nhouse.If it failed, he would have to stop this queer feeling in his\nhead at once.The Grand Prix and the English horse was the final\n_coup_.On this depended everything--the return of his fortunes, the\nreconciliation with his father, and the possibility of meeting her\nagain.It was a very hot day he remembered, and very bright; but the\ntall poplars on the road to the races seemed to stop growing just at\na level with his eyes.Below that it was clear enough, but all above\nseemed black--as though a cloud had fallen and was hanging just over the\npeople\'s heads.He thought of speaking of this to his man Walters, who\nhad followed his fortunes from the first, but decided not to do so, for,\nas it was, he had noticed that Walters had observed him closely of late,\nand had seemed to spy upon him.The race began, and he looked through\nhis glass for the English horse in the front and could not find her,\nand the Frenchman beside him cried, "Frou Frou!"as Frou Frou passed the\ngoal.He lowered his glasses slowly and unscrewed them very carefully\nbefore dropping them back into the case; then he buckled the strap, and\nturned and looked about him.Two Frenchmen who had won a hundred\nfrancs between them were jumping and dancing at his side.He remembered\nwondering why they did not speak in English.Then the sunlight changed\nto a yellow, nasty glare, as though a calcium light had been turned\non the glass and colors, and he pushed his way back to his carriage,\nleaning heavily on the servant\'s arm, and drove slowly back to Paris,\nwith the driver flecking his horses fretfully with his whip, for he had\nwished to wait and see the end of the races.He had selected Monte Carlo as the place for it, because it was more\nunlike his home than any other spot, and because one summer night, when\nhe had crossed the lawn from the Casino to the hotel with a gay party of\nyoung men and women, they had come across something under a bush which\nthey took to be a dog or a man asleep, and one of the men had stepped\nforward and touched it with his foot, and had then turned sharply and\nsaid, "Take those girls away"; and while some hurried the women back,\nfrightened and curious, he and the others had picked up the body and\nfound it to be that of a young Russian whom they had just seen losing,\nwith a very bad grace, at the tables.There was no passion in his face\nnow, and his evening dress was quite unruffled, and only a black spot on\nthe shirt front showed where the powder had burnt the linen.It had\nmade a great impression on him then, for he was at the height of his\nfortunes, with crowds of sycophantic friends and a retinue of dependents\nat his heels.And now that he was quite alone and disinherited by even\nthese sorry companions there seemed no other escape from the pain in his\nbrain but to end it, and he sought this place of all others as the most\nfitting place in which to die.So, after Walters had given the proper papers and checks to the\ncommissioner who handled his debts for him, he left Paris and took the\nfirst train for Monte Carlo, sitting at the window of the carriage,\nand beating a nervous tattoo on the pane with his ring until the old\ngentleman at the other end of the compartment scowled at him.But\nHarringford did not see him, nor the trees and fields as they swept by,\nand it was not until Walters came and said, "You get out here, sir,"\nthat he recognized the yellow station and the great hotels on the hill\nabove.It was half-past eleven, and the lights in the Casino were still\nburning brightly.He wondered whether he would have time to go over to\nthe hotel and write a letter to his father and to her.He decided, after\nsome difficult consideration, that he would not.There was nothing\nto say that they did not know already, or that they would fail to\nunderstand.But this suggested to him that what they had written to him\nmust be destroyed at once, before any stranger could claim the right\nto read it.He took his letters from his pocket and looked them over\ncarefully.They all seemed to be\nabout money; some begged to remind him of this or that debt, of which he\nhad thought continuously for the last month, while others were abusive\nand insolent.One was the last letter\nhe had received from his father just before leaving Paris, and though he\nknew it by heart, he read it over again for the last time.That it came\ntoo late, that it asked what he knew now to be impossible, made it none\nthe less grateful to him, but that it offered peace and a welcome home\nmade it all the more terrible."I came to take this step through young Hargraves, the new curate,"\nhis father wrote, "though he was but the instrument in the hands of\nProvidence.He showed me the error of my conduct toward you, and proved\nto me that my duty and the inclination of my heart were toward the\nsame end.He read this morning for the second lesson the story of the\nProdigal Son, and I heard it without recognition and with no present\napplication until he came to the verse which tells how the father came\nto his son \'when he was yet a great way off.\'He saw him, it says, \'when\nhe was yet a great way off,\' and ran to meet him.He did not wait for\nthe boy to knock at his gate and beg to be let in, but went out to meet\nhim, and took him in his arms and led him back to his home.Now, my boy,\nmy son, it seems to me as if you had never been so far off from me\nas you are at this present time, as if you had never been so greatly\nseparated from me in every thought and interest; we are even worse than\nstrangers, for you think that my hand is against you, that I have closed\nthe door of your home to you and driven you away.But what I have done\nI beg of you to forgive: to forget what I may have said in the past, and\nonly to think of what I say now.Your brothers are good boys and have\nbeen good sons to me, and God knows I am thankful for such sons, and\nthankful to them for bearing themselves as they have done."But, my boy, my first-born, my little Cecil, they can never be to me\nwhat you have been.I can never feel for them as I feel for you; they\nare the ninety and nine who have never wandered away upon the mountains,\nand who have never been tempted, and have never left their home for\neither good or evil.But you, Cecil, though you have made my heart ache\nuntil I thought and even hoped it would stop beating, and though you\nhave given me many, many nights that I could not sleep, are still dearer\nto me than anything else in the world.You are the flesh of my flesh and\nthe bone of my bone, and I cannot bear living on without you.I cannot\nbe at rest here, or look forward contentedly to a rest hereafter, unless\nyou are by me and hear me, unless I can see your face and touch you and\nhear your laugh in the halls.Come back to me, Cecil; to Harringford and\nthe people that know you best, and know what is best in you and love you\nfor it.I can have only a few more years here now when you will take\nmy place and keep up my name.I will not be here to trouble you much\nlonger; but, my boy, while I am here, come to me and make me happy for\nthe rest of my life.I saw her only yesterday, and she asked me of you with such\nsplendid disregard for what the others standing by might think, and as\nthough she dared me or them to say or even imagine anything against you.You cannot keep away from us both much longer.Surely not; you will come\nback and make us happy for the rest of our lives."The Goodwood Plunger turned his back to the lights so that the people\npassing could not see his face, and tore the letter up slowly and\ndropped it piece by piece over the balcony."If I could," he whispered;\n"if I could."The pain was a little worse than usual just then, but it\nwas no longer a question of inclination.He felt only this desire to\nstop these thoughts and doubts and the physical tremor that shook him.To rest and sleep, that was what he must have, and peace.There was no\npeace at home or anywhere else while this thing lasted.He could not see\nwhy they worried him in this way.He felt much\nmore sorry for them than for himself, but only because they could not\nunderstand.He was quite sure that if they could feel what he suffered\nthey would help him, even to end it.He had been standing for some time with his back to the light, but now\nhe turned to face it and to take up his watch again.He felt quite\nsure the lights would not burn much longer.As he turned, a woman came\nforward from out the lighted hall, hovered uncertainly before him, and\nthen made a silent salutation, which was something between a courtesy\nand a bow.That she was a woman and rather short and plainly dressed,\nand that her bobbing up and down annoyed him, was all that he realized\nof her presence, and he quite failed to connect her movements with\nhimself in any way."Sir," she said in French, "I beg your pardon,\nbut might I speak with you?"The Goodwood Plunger possessed a somewhat\nvarious knowledge of Monte Carlo and its _habitues_.It was not the\nfirst time that women who had lost at the tables had begged a napoleon\nfrom him, or asked the distinguished child of fortune what color or\ncombination she should play.That, in his luckier days, had happened\noften and had amused him, but now he moved back irritably and wished\nthat the figure in front of him would disappear as it had come."I am in great trouble, sir," the woman said."I have no friends here,\nsir, to whom I may apply.I am very bold, but my anxiety is very great."The Goodwood Plunger raised his hat slightly and bowed.Then he\nconcentrated his eyes with what was a distinct effort on the queer\nlittle figure hovering in front of him, and stared very hard.She wore\nan odd piece of red coral for a brooch, and by looking steadily at\nthis he brought the rest of the figure into focus and saw, without\nsurprise,--for every commonplace seemed strange to him now, and\neverything peculiar quite a matter of course,--that she was distinctly\nnot an _habituee_ of the place, and looked more like a lady\'s maid than\nan adventuress.She was French and pretty,--such a girl as might wait in\na Duval restaurant or sit as a cashier behind a little counter near the\ndoor."We should not be here," she said, as if in answer to his look and in\napology for her presence."But Louis, my husband, he would come.I told\nhim that this was not for such as we are, but Louis is so bold.He said\nthat upon his marriage tour he would live with the best, and so here\nhe must come to play as the others do.We have been married, sir, only\nsince Tuesday, and we must go back to Paris to-morrow; they would give\nhim only the three days.He is not a gambler; he plays dominos at the\ncafes, it is true.He is young and with so much\nspirit, and I know that you, sir, who are so fortunate and who\nunderstand so well how to control these tables, I know that you will\npersuade him.He will not listen to me; he is so greatly excited and so\nlittle like himself.You will help me, sir, will you not?The Goodwood Plunger knit his eyebrows and closed the lids once or\ntwice, and forced the mistiness and pain out of his eyes.The woman seemed to be talking a great deal and to say\nvery much, but he could not make sense of it."I can\'t understand," he said wearily, turning away."It is my husband," the woman said anxiously: "Louis, he is playing at\nthe table inside, and he is only an apprentice to old Carbut the baker,\nbut he owns a third of the store.It was my _dot_ that paid for it," she\nadded proudly."Old Carbut says he may have it all for 20,000 francs,\nand then old Carbut will retire, and we will be proprietors.We have\nsaved a little, and we had counted to buy the rest in five or six years\nif we were very careful.""I see, I see," said the Plunger, with a little short laugh of relief;\n"I understand."He was greatly comforted to think that it was not so bad\nas it had threatened.He saw her distinctly now and followed what she\nsaid quite easily, and even such a small matter as talking with this\nwoman seemed to help him."He is gambling," he said, "and losing the money, and you come to me to\nadvise him what to play.Well, tell him he will lose what\nlittle he has left; tell him I advise him to go home; tell him--"\n\n"No, no!"the girl said excitedly; "you do not understand; he has not\nlost, he has won.He has won, oh, so many rolls of money, but he will\nnot stop.He has won as much as we could earn in many\nmonths--in many years, sir, by saving and working, oh, so very hard!And\nnow he risks it again, and I cannot force him away.But if you, sir,\nif you would tell him how great the chances are against him, if you who\nknow would tell him how foolish he is not to be content with what he\nhas, he would listen.you are a woman\'; and he is\nso red and fierce; he is imbecile with the sight of the money, but he\nwill listen to a grand gentleman like you.He thinks to win more and\nmore, and he thinks to buy another third from old Carbut."Oh, yes," said the Goodwood Plunger, nodding, "I see now.You want me\nto take him away so that he can keep what he has.I see; but I don\'t\nknow him.He will not listen to me, you know; I have no right to\ninterfere."He turned away, rubbing his hand across his forehead.He wished so much\nthat this woman would leave him by himself."Ah, but, sir," cried the girl, desperately, and touching his coat, "you\nwho are so fortunate, and so rich, and of the great world, you cannot\nfeel what this is to me.To have my own little shop and to be free, and\nnot to slave, and sew, and sew until my back and fingers burn with the\npain.Speak to him, sir; ah, speak to him!It is so easy a thing to do,\nand he will listen to you."Sandra journeyed to the hallway.The Goodwood Plunger turned again abruptly.The woman ran ahead, with a murmur of gratitude, to the open door and\npointed to where her husband was standing leaning over and placing\nsome money on one of the tables.He was a handsome young Frenchman,\nas _bourgeois_ as his wife, and now terribly alive and excited.In the\nself-contained air of the place and in contrast with the silence of the\ngreat hall he seemed even more conspicuously out of place.The\nPlunger touched him on the arm, and the Frenchman shoved the hand off\nimpatiently and without looking around.The Plunger touched him again\nand forced him to turn toward him."Madame, your wife," said Cecil, with the grave politeness of an old\nman, "has done me the honor to take me into her confidence.She tells me\nthat you have won a great deal of money; that you could put it to good\nuse at home, and so save yourselves much drudgery and debt, and all\nthat sort of trouble.You are quite right if you say it is no concern of\nmine.But really, you know there is a great deal of sense in\nwhat she wants, and you have apparently already won a large sum."He paused for\na second or two in some doubt, and even awe, for the disinherited\none carried the mark of a personage of consideration and of one whose\nposition is secure.Then he gave a short, unmirthful laugh."You are most kind, sir," he said with mock politeness and with an\nimpatient shrug."But madame, my wife, has not done well to interest a\nstranger in this affair, which, as you say, concerns you not."He turned to the table again with a defiant swagger of independence and\nplaced two rolls of money upon the cloth, casting at the same moment a\nchildish look of displeasure at his wife."You see," said the Plunger,\nwith a deprecatory turning out of his hands.But there was so much grief\non the girl\'s face that he turned again to the gambler and touched his\narm.He could not tell why he was so interested in these two.He had\nwitnessed many such scenes before, and they had not affected him in any\nway except to make him move out of hearing.But the same dumb numbness\nin his head, which made so many things seem possible that should have\nbeen terrible even to think upon, made him stubborn and unreasonable\nover this.He felt intuitively--it could not be said that he\nthought--that the woman was right and the man wrong, and so he grasped\nhim again by the arm, and said sharply this time:\n\n"Come away!But even as he spoke the red won, and the Frenchman with a boyish gurgle\nof pleasure raked in his winnings with his two hands, and then turned\nwith a happy, triumphant laugh to his wife.It is not easy to convince a\nman that he is making a fool of himself when he is winning some hundred\nfrancs every two minutes.His silent arguments to the contrary are\ndifficult to answer.But the Plunger did not regard this in the least.he said in the same stubborn tone and with much the\nsame manner with which he would have spoken to a groom.Again the Frenchman tossed off his hand, this time with an execration,\nand again he placed the rolls of gold coin on the red; and again the red\nwon.cried the girl, running her fingers over the rolls on the\ntable, "he has won half of the 20,000 francs.Oh, sir, stop him, stop\nhim!"cried the Plunger, excited to a degree of utter\nself-forgetfulness, and carried beyond himself; "you\'ve got to come with\nme.""Take away your hand," whispered the young Frenchman, fiercely."See,\nI shall win it all; in one grand _coup_ I shall win it all.I shall win\nfive years\' pay in one moment."He swept all of the money forward on the red and threw himself over the\ntable to see the wheel.whispered the Plunger, excitedly."If you will\nrisk it, risk it with some reason.You can\'t play all that money; they\nwon\'t take it.Six thousand francs is the limit, unless," he ran on\nquickly, "you divide the 12,000 francs among the three of us.You\nunderstand, 6,000 francs is all that any one person can play; but if you\ngive 4,000 to me, and 4,000 to your wife, and keep 4,000 yourself, we\ncan each chance it.You can back the red if you like, your wife shall\nput her money on the numbers coming up below eighteen, and I will back\nthe odd.In that way you stand to win 24,000 francs if our combination\nwins, and you lose less than if you simply back the color.cried the Frenchman, reaching for the piles of money which the\nPlunger had divided rapidly into three parts, "on the red; all on the\nred!""I may not know much,\nbut you should allow me to understand this dirty business."He caught\nthe Frenchman by the wrists, and the young man, more impressed with the\nstrange look in the boy\'s face than by his physical force, stood still,\nwhile the ball rolled and rolled, and clicked merrily, and stopped, and\nbalanced, and then settled into the "seven.""Red, odd, and below," the croupier droned mechanically.said the Plunger, with sudden\ncalmness."You have won more than your 20,000 francs; you are\nproprietors--I congratulate you!"cried the Frenchman, in a frenzy of delight, "I will\ndouble it."He reached toward the fresh piles of coin as if he meant to sweep them\nback again, but the Plunger put himself in his way and with a quick\nmovement caught up the rolls of money and dropped them into the skirt of\nthe woman, which she raised like an apron to receive her treasure."Now," said young Harringford, determinedly, "you come with me."The\nFrenchman tried to argue and resist, but the Plunger pushed him on with\nthe silent stubbornness of a drunken man.He handed the woman into a\ncarriage at the door, shoved her husband in beside her, and while the\nman drove to the address she gave him, he told the Frenchman, with an\nair of a chief of police, that he must leave Monte Carlo at once, that\nvery night."Do you fancy I speak without\nknowledge?I\'ve seen them come here rich and go away paupers.But you\nshall not; you shall keep what you have and spite them."He sent the\nwoman up to her room to pack while he expostulated with and browbeat\nthe excited bridegroom in the carriage.When she returned with the bag\npacked, and so heavy with the gold that the servants could hardly lift\nit up beside the driver, he ordered the coachman to go down the hill to\nthe station."The train for Paris leaves at midnight," he said, "and you will be\nthere by morning.Then you must close your bargain with this old Carbut,\nand never return here again."The Frenchman had turned during the ride from an angry, indignant\nprisoner to a joyful madman, and was now tearfully and effusively humble\nin his petitions for pardon and in his thanks.Their benefactor, as they\nwere pleased to call him, hurried them into the waiting train and ran to\npurchase their tickets for them."Now," he said, as the guard locked the door of the compartment, "you\nare alone, and no one can get in, and you cannot get out.Go back to\nyour home, to your new home, and never come to this wretched place\nagain.Promise me--you understand?--never again!"They embraced each other like\nchildren, and the man, pulling off his hat, called upon the good Lord to\nthank the gentleman."You will be in Paris, will you not?"said the woman, in an ecstasy of\npleasure, "and you will come to see us in our own shop, will you not?we should be so greatly honored, sir, if you would visit us; if you\nwould come to the home you have given us.You have helped us so greatly,\nsir," she said; "and may Heaven bless you!"She caught up his gloved hand as it rested on the door and kissed it\nuntil he snatched it away in great embarrassment and flushing like a\ngirl.Her husband drew her toward him, and the young bride sat at\nhis side with her face close to his and wept tears of pleasure and of\nexcitement.said the young man, joyfully; "look how happy you have\nmade us.You have made us happy for the rest of our lives."The train moved out with a quick, heavy rush, and the car-wheels took\nup the young stranger\'s last words and seemed to say, "You have made us\nhappy--made us happy for the rest of our lives."It had all come about so rapidly that the Plunger had had no time to\nconsider or to weigh his motives, and all that seemed real to him now,\nas he stood alone on the platform of the dark, deserted station, were\nthe words of the man echoing and re-echoing like the refrain of the\nsong.And then there came to him suddenly, and with all the force of\na gambler\'s superstition, the thought that the words were the same as\nthose which his father had used in his letter, "you can make us happy\nfor the rest of our lives.""Ah," he said, with a quick gasp of doubt, "if I could!If I made those\npoor fools happy, mayn\'t I live to be something to him, and to her?he cried, but so gently that one at his elbow could not have heard\nhim, "if I could, if I could!"He tossed up his hands, and drew them down again and clenched them in\nfront of him, and raised his tired, hot eyes to the calm purple sky with\nits millions of moving stars.And as he lowered his head the queer numb feeling seemed to go, and\na calm came over his nerves and left him in peace.He did not know what\nit might be, nor did he dare to question the change which had come to\nhim, but turned and slowly mounted the hill, with the awe and fear still\nupon him of one who had passed beyond himself for one brief moment into\nanother world.When he reached his room he found his servant bending\nwith an anxious face over a letter which he tore up guiltily as his\nmaster entered."You were writing to my father," said Cecil, gently,\n"were you not?Well, you need not finish your letter; we are going home."I am going away from this place, Walters," he said as he pulled off his\ncoat and threw himself heavily on the bed."I will take the first train\nthat leaves here, and I will sleep a little while you put up my things.The first train, you understand--within an hour, if it leaves that\nsoon."His head sank back on the pillows heavily, as though he had come\nin from a long, weary walk, and his eyes closed and his arms fell easily\nat his side.The servant stood frightened and yet happy, with the tears\nrunning down his cheeks, for he loved his master dearly."We are going home, Walters," the Plunger whispered drowsily."We are\ngoing home; home to England and Harringford and the governor--and we are\ngoing to be happy for all the rest of our lives."He paused a moment,\nand Walters bent forward over the bed and held his breath to listen."For he came to me," murmured the boy, as though he was speaking in his\nsleep, "when I was yet a great way off--while I was yet a great way off,\nand ran to meet me--"\n\nHis voice sank until it died away into silence, and a few hours later,\nwhen Walters came to wake him, he found his master sleeping like a child\nand smiling in his sleep.THE CYNICAL MISS CATHERWAIGHT\n\n\nMiss Catherwaight\'s collection of orders and decorations and medals was\nher chief offence in the eyes of those of her dear friends who thought\nher clever but cynical.All of them were willing to admit that she was clever, but some of them\nsaid she was clever only to be unkind.Young Van Bibber had said that if Miss Catherwaight did not like dances\nand days and teas, she had only to stop going to them instead of making\nunpleasant remarks about those who did.So many people repeated this\nthat young Van Bibber believed finally that he had said something good,\nand was somewhat pleased in consequence, as he was not much given to\nthat sort of thing.Catherwaight, while she was alive, lived solely for society, and,\nso some people said, not only lived but died for it.She certainly did\ngo about a great deal, and she used to carry her husband away from\nhis library every night of every season and left him standing in\nthe doorways of drawing-rooms, outwardly courteous and distinguished\nlooking, but inwardly somnolent and unhappy.She was a born and trained\nsocial leader, and her daughter\'s coming out was to have been the\ngreatest effort of her life.She regarded it as an event in the dear\nchild\'s lifetime second only in importance to her birth; equally\nimportant with her probable marriage and of much more poignant interest\nthan her possible death.But the great effort proved too much for\nthe mother, and she died, fondly remembered by her peers and tenderly\nreferred to by a great many people who could not even show a card for\nher Thursdays.Her husband and her daughter were not going out, of\nnecessity, for more than a year after her death, and then felt no\ninclination to begin over again, but lived very much together and showed\nthemselves only occasionally.They entertained, though, a great deal, in the way of dinners, and\nan invitation to one of these dinners soon became a diploma for\nintellectual as well as social qualifications of a very high order.One was always sure of meeting some one of consideration there, which\nwas pleasant in itself, and also rendered it easy to let one\'s friends\nknow where one had been dining.It sounded so flat to boast abruptly, "I\ndined at the Catherwaights\' last night"; while it seemed only natural to\nremark, "That reminds me of a story that novelist, what\'s his name, told\nat Mr.Catherwaight\'s," or "That English chap, who\'s been in Africa, was\nat the Catherwaights\' the other night, and told me--"\n\nAfter one of these dinners people always asked to be allowed to look\nover Miss Catherwaight\'s collection, of which almost everybody had\nheard.It consisted of over a hundred medals and decorations which Miss\nCatherwaight had purchased while on the long tours she made with her\nfather in all parts of the world.Each of them had been given as a\nreward for some public service, as a recognition of some virtue of the\nhighest order--for personal bravery, for statesmanship, for great genius\nin the arts; and each had been pawned by the recipient or sold outright.Miss Catherwaight referred to them as her collection of dishonored\nhonors, and called them variously her Orders of the Knights of the\nAlmighty Dollar, pledges to patriotism and the pawnshops, and honors at\nsecond-hand.It was her particular fad to get as many of these together as she could\nand to know the story of each.The less creditable the story, the more\nhighly she valued the medal.People might think it was not a pretty\nhobby for a young girl, but they could not help smiling at the stories\nand at the scorn with which she told them."These," she would say, "are crosses of the Legion of Honor; they are of\nthe lowest degree, that of chevalier.I keep them in this cigar box to\nshow how cheaply I got them and how cheaply I hold them.I think you\ncan get them here in New York for ten dollars; they cost more than\nthat--about a hundred francs--in Paris.The\nFrench government can imprison you, you know, for ten years, if you wear\none without the right to do so, but they have no punishment for those\nwho choose to part with them for a mess of pottage."All these," she would run on, "are English war medals.See, on this one\nis \'Alma,\' \'Balaclava,\' and \'Sebastopol.\'He was quite a veteran, was he\nnot?Well, he sold this to a dealer on Wardour Street, London, for five\nand six.You can get any number of them on the Bowery for their weight\nin silver.I tried very hard to get a Victoria Cross when I was in\nEngland, and I only succeeded in getting this one after a great deal of\ntrouble.They value the cross so highly, you know, that it is the only\nother decoration in the case which holds the Order of the Garter in the\nJewel Room at the Tower.It is made of copper, so that its intrinsic\nvalue won\'t have any weight with the man who gets it, but I bought this\nnevertheless for five pounds.The soldier to whom it belonged had loaded\nand fired a cannon all alone when the rest of the men about the battery\nhad run away.He was captured by the enemy, but retaken immediately\nafterward by re-enforcements from his own side, and the general in\ncommand recommended him to the Queen for decoration.He sold his cross\nto the proprietor of a curiosity shop and drank himself to death.I felt\nrather meanly about keeping it and hunted up his widow to return it to\nher, but she said I could have it for a consideration."This gold medal was given, as you see, to \'Hiram J. Stillman, of the\nsloop _Annie Barker_, for saving the crew of the steamship _Olivia_,\nJune 18, 1888,\' by the President of the United States and both houses of\nCongress.I found it on Baxter Street in a pawnshop.The gallant Hiram\nJ. had pawned it for sixteen dollars and never came back to claim it.""But, Miss Catherwaight," some optimist would object, "these men\nundoubtedly did do something brave and noble once.You can\'t get back\nof that; and they didn\'t do it for a medal, either, but because it was\ntheir duty.And so the medal meant nothing to them: their conscience\ntold them they had done the right thing; they didn\'t need a stamped coin\nto remind them of it, or of their wounds, either, perhaps.""Quite right; that\'s quite true," Miss Catherwaight would say.Look at this gold medal with the diamonds: \'Presented to\nColonel James F. Placer by the men of his regiment, in camp before\nRichmond.\'Every soldier in the regiment gave something toward that, and\nyet the brave gentleman put it up at a game of poker one night, and the\nofficer who won it sold it to the man who gave it to me.Miss Catherwaight was well known to the proprietors of the pawnshops and\nloan offices on the Bowery and Park Row.They learned to look for her\nonce a month, and saved what medals they received for her and tried to\nlearn their stories from the people who pawned them, or else invented\nsome story which they hoped would answer just as well.Though her brougham produced a sensation in the unfashionable streets\ninto which she directed it, she was never annoyed.Her maid went with\nher into the shops, and one of the grooms always stood at the door\nwithin call, to the intense delight of the neighborhood.And one day she\nfound what, from her point of view, was a perfect gem.It was a poor,\ncheap-looking, tarnished silver medal, a half-dollar once, undoubtedly,\nbeaten out roughly into the shape of a heart and engraved in script by\nthe jeweller of some country town.On one side were two clasped hands\nwith a wreath around them, and on the reverse was this inscription:\n"From Henry Burgoyne to his beloved friend Lewis L. Lockwood"; and\nbelow, "Through prosperity and adversity."And here it\nwas among razors and pistols and family Bibles in a pawnbroker\'s window.These two boy friends, and their boyish\nfriendship that was to withstand adversity and prosperity, and all that\nremained of it was this inscription to its memory like the wording on a\ntomb!"He couldn\'t have got so much on it any way," said the pawnbroker,\nentering into her humor."I didn\'t lend him more\'n a quarter of a dollar\nat the most."Miss Catherwaight stood wondering if the Lewis L. Lockwood could be\nLewis Lockwood, the lawyer one read so much about.Then she remembered\nhis middle name was Lyman, and said quickly, "I\'ll take it, please."She stepped into the carriage, and told the man to go find a directory\nand look for Lewis Lyman Lockwood.The groom returned in a few minutes\nand said there was such a name down in the book as a lawyer, and that\nhis office was such a number on Broadway; it must be near Liberty."Go\nthere," said Miss Catherwaight.Her determination was made so quickly that they had stopped in front of\na huge pile of offices, sandwiched in, one above the other, until they\ntowered mountains high, before she had quite settled in her mind what\nshe wanted to know, or had appreciated how strange her errand might\nappear.Lockwood was out, one of the young men in the outer office\nsaid, but the junior partner, Mr.Latimer, was in and would see her.She had only time to remember that the junior partner was a dancing\nacquaintance of hers, before young Mr.Latimer stood before her smiling,\nand with her card in his hand.Lockwood is out just at present, Miss Catherwaight," he said, "but\nhe will be back in a moment.Won\'t you come into the other room and\nwait?I\'m sure he won\'t be away over five minutes.She saw that he was surprised to see her, and a little ill at ease as\nto just how to take her visit.He tried to make it appear that he\nconsidered it the most natural thing in the world, but he overdid it,\nand she saw that her presence was something quite out of the common.This did not tend to set her any more at her ease.She already regretted\nthe step she had taken.What if it should prove to be the same Lockwood,\nshe thought, and what would they think of her?Lockwood," she said, as she\nfollowed him into the inner office."I fear I have come upon a very\nfoolish errand, and one that has nothing at all to do with the law.""Not a breach of promise suit, then?""Perhaps it is only an innocent subscription to a most worthy charity.I\nwas afraid at first," he went on lightly, "that it was legal redress you\nwanted, and I was hoping that the way I led the Courdert\'s cotillion\nhad made you think I could conduct you through the mazes of the law as\nwell.""No," returned Miss Catherwaight, with a nervous laugh; "it has to do\nwith my unfortunate collection.This is what brought me here," she said,\nholding out the silver medal."I came across it just now in the Bowery.The name was the same, and I thought it just possible Mr.Lockwood would\nlike to have it; or, to tell you the truth, that he might tell me what\nhad become of the Henry Burgoyne who gave it to him."Young Latimer had the medal in his hand before she had finished\nspeaking, and was examining it carefully.He looked up with just a touch\nof color in his cheeks and straightened himself visibly."Please don\'t be offended," said the fair collector.You\'ve heard of my stupid collection, and I know you think\nI meant to add this to it.But, indeed, now that I have had time to\nthink--you see I came here immediately from the pawnshop, and I was\nso interested, like all collectors, you know, that I didn\'t stop to\nconsider.That\'s the worst of a hobby; it carries one rough-shod over\nother people\'s feelings, and runs away with one.I beg of you, if you do\nknow anything about the coin, just to keep it and don\'t tell me, and I\nassure you what little I know I will keep quite to myself."Young Latimer bowed, and stood looking at her curiously, with the medal\nin his hand."I hardly know what to say," he began slowly.You say you found this on the Bowery, in a pawnshop.Well, of\ncourse, you know Mr.Miss Catherwaight shook her head vehemently and smiled in deprecation."This medal was in his safe when he lived on Thirty-fifth Street at\nthe time he was robbed, and the burglars took this with the rest of the\nsilver and pawned it, I suppose.Lockwood would have given more for\nit than any one else could have afforded to pay."He paused a moment,\nand then continued more rapidly: "Henry Burgoyne is Judge Burgoyne.Lockwood and he were friends when they\nwere boys.They were Damon\nand Pythias and that sort of thing.They roomed together at the State\ncollege and started to practise law in Tuckahoe as a firm, but they made\nnothing of it, and came on to New York and began reading law again with\nFuller & Mowbray.It was while they were at school that they had these\nmedals made.There was a mate to this, you know; Judge Burgoyne had it.Well, they continued to live and work together.They were both orphans\nand dependent on themselves.I suppose that was one of the strongest\nbonds between them; and they knew no one in New York, and always spent\ntheir spare time together.They were pretty poor, I fancy, from all\nMr.Lockwood has told me, but they were very ambitious.They were--I\'m\ntelling you this, you understand, because it concerns you somewhat:\nwell, more or less.They were great sportsmen, and whenever they could\nget away from the law office they would go off shooting.I think they\nwere fonder of each other than brothers even.Lockwood\ntell of the days they lay in the rushes along the Chesapeake Bay waiting\nfor duck.He has said often that they were the happiest hours of his\nlife.That was their greatest pleasure, going off together after duck or\nsnipe along the Maryland waters.Well, they grew rich and began to know\npeople; and then they met a girl.It seems they both thought a great\ndeal of her, as half the New York men did, I am told; and she was the\nreigning belle and toast, and had other admirers, and neither met with\nthat favor she showed--well, the man she married, for instance.But for\na while each thought, for some reason or other, that he was especially\nfavored.Lockwood never spoke of it\nto me.But they both fell very deeply in love with her, and each thought\nthe other disloyal, and so they quarrelled; and--and then, though the\nwoman married, the two men kept apart.It was the one great passion\nof their lives, and both were proud, and each thought the other in the\nwrong, and so they have kept apart ever since.And--well, I believe that\nis all."Miss Catherwaight had listened in silence and with one little gloved\nhand tightly clasping the other.Latimer, indeed," she began, tremulously, "I am terribly\nashamed of myself.I seemed to have rushed in where angels fear to\ntread.Of course I might\nhave known there was a woman in the case, it adds so much to the story.But I suppose I must give up my medal.I never could tell that story,\ncould I?""No," said young Latimer, dryly; "I wouldn\'t if I were you."Something in his tone, and something in the fact that he seemed to avoid\nher eyes, made her drop the lighter vein in which she had been speaking,\nand rise to go.There was much that he had not told her, she suspected,\nand when she bade him good-by it was with a reserve which she had not\nshown at any other time during their interview.she murmured, as young Latimer turned\nfrom the brougham door and said "Home," to the groom.She thought about\nit a great deal that afternoon; at times she repented that she had given\nup the medal, and at times she blushed that she should have been carried\nin her zeal into such an unwarranted intimacy with another\'s story.She determined finally to ask her father about it.He would be sure to\nknow, she thought, as he and Mr.Then\nshe decided finally not to say anything about it at all, for Mr.Catherwaight did not approve of the collection of dishonored honors\nas it was, and she had no desire to prejudice him still further by a\nrecital of her afternoon\'s adventure, of which she had no doubt but he\nwould also disapprove.So she was more than usually silent during\nthe dinner, which was a tete-a-tete family dinner that night, and she\nallowed her father to doze after it in the library in his great chair\nwithout disturbing him with either questions or confessions.{Illustration with caption: "What can Mr.Lockwood be calling upon me\nabout?"}They had been sitting there some time, he with his hands folded on the\nevening paper and with his eyes closed, when the servant brought in a\ncard and offered it to Mr.Catherwaight fumbled\nover his glasses, and read the name on the card aloud: "\'Mr.Miss Catherwaight sat upright, and reached out for the card with a\nnervous, gasping little laugh."Oh, I think it must be for me," she said; "I\'m quite sure it is\nintended for me.I was at his office to-day, you see, to return him some\nkeepsake of his that I found in an old curiosity shop.Something with\nhis name on it that had been stolen from him and pawned.You needn\'t go down, dear; I\'ll see him.It was I he asked for,\nI\'m sure; was it not, Morris?"Morris was not quite sure; being such an old gentleman, he thought it\nmust be for Mr.He did not like to disturb\nhis after-dinner nap, and he settled back in his chair again and\nrefolded his hands."I hardly thought he could have come to see me," he murmured, drowsily;\n"though I used to see enough and more than enough of Lewis Lockwood\nonce, my dear," he added with a smile, as he opened his eyes and nodded\nbefore he shut them again."That was before your mother and I were\nengaged, and people did say that young Lockwood\'s chances at that time\nwere as good as mine.He was very attentive,\nthough; _very_ attentive."Miss Catherwaight stood startled and motionless at the door from which\nshe had turned.she asked quickly, and in a very low voice.Catherwaight did not deign to open his eyes this time, but moved his\nhead uneasily as if he wished to be let alone."To your mother, of course, my child," he answered; "of whom else was I\nspeaking?"Miss Catherwaight went down the stairs to the drawing-room slowly, and\npaused half-way to allow this new suggestion to settle in her mind.There was something distasteful to her, something that seemed not\naltogether unblamable, in a woman\'s having two men quarrel about her,\nneither of whom was the woman\'s husband.And yet this girl of whom\nLatimer had spoken must be her mother, and she, of course, could do no\nwrong.It was very disquieting, and she went on down the rest of the way\nwith one hand resting heavily on the railing and with the other pressed\nagainst her cheeks.It now seemed to her very\nsad indeed that these two one-time friends should live in the same city\nand meet, as they must meet, and not recognize each other.She argued\nthat her mother must have been very young when it happened, or she would\nhave brought two such men together again.Her mother could not have\nknown, she told herself; she was not to blame.For she felt sure that\nhad she herself known of such an accident she would have done something,\nsaid something, to make it right.And she was not half the woman her\nmother had been, she was sure of that.There was something very likable in the old gentleman who came forward\nto greet her as she entered the drawing-room; something courtly and of\nthe old school, of which she was so tired of hearing, but of which she\nwished she could have seen more in the men she met.Latimer\nhad accompanied his guardian, exactly why she did not see, but she\nrecognized his presence slightly.He seemed quite content to remain in\nthe background.Lockwood, as she had expected, explained that he had\ncalled to thank her for the return of the medal.He had it in his hand\nas he spoke, and touched it gently with the tips of his fingers as\nthough caressing it."I knew your father very well," said the lawyer, "and I at one time had\nthe honor of being one of your mother\'s younger friends.That was before\nshe was married, many years ago."He stopped and regarded the girl\ngravely and with a touch of tenderness."You will pardon an old man, old\nenough to be your father, if he says," he went on, "that you are greatly\nlike your mother, my dear young lady--greatly like.Your mother was\nvery kind to me, and I fear I abused her kindness; abused it by\nmisunderstanding it.There was a great deal of misunderstanding; and\nI was proud, and my friend was proud, and so the misunderstanding\ncontinued, until now it has become irretrievable."He had forgotten her presence apparently, and was speaking more to\nhimself than to her as he stood looking down at the medal in his hand."You were very thoughtful to give me this," he continued; "it was very\ngood of you.I don\'t know why I should keep it though, now, although I\nwas distressed enough when I lost it.But now it is only a reminder of\na time that is past and put away, but which was very, very dear to me.Perhaps I should tell you that I had a misunderstanding with the friend\nwho gave it to me, and since then we have never met; have ceased to\nknow each other.But I have always followed his life as a judge and as a\nlawyer, and respected him for his own sake as a man.I cannot tell--I do\nnot know how he feels toward me."The old lawyer turned the medal over in his hand and stood looking down\nat it wistfully.The cynical Miss Catherwaight could not stand it any longer.Lockwood," she said, impulsively, "Mr.Latimer has told me why\nyou and your friend separated, and I cannot bear to think that it\nwas she--my mother--should have been the cause.She could not have\nunderstood; she must have been innocent of any knowledge of the trouble\nshe had brought to men who were such good friends of hers and to each\nother.It seems to me as though my finding that coin is more than a\ncoincidence.I somehow think that the daughter is to help undo the harm\nthat her mother has caused--unwittingly caused.Keep the medal and don\'t\ngive it back to me, for I am sure your friend has kept his, and I am\nsure he is still your friend at heart.Don\'t think I am speaking hastily\nor that I am thoughtless in what I am saying, but it seems to me as if\nfriends--good, true friends--were so few that one cannot let them go\nwithout a word to bring them back.But though I am only a girl, and a\nvery light and unfeeling girl, some people think, I feel this very\nmuch, and I do wish I could bring your old friend back to you again as I\nbrought back his pledge."John moved to the garden."It has been many years since Henry Burgoyne and I have met," said the\nold man, slowly, "and it would be quite absurd to think that he still\nholds any trace of that foolish, boyish feeling of loyalty that we once\nhad for each other.Yet I will keep this, if you will let me, and I\nthank you, my dear young lady, for what you have said.I thank you from\nthe bottom of my heart.You are as good and as kind as your mother was,\nand--I can say nothing, believe me, in higher praise."He rose slowly and made a movement as if to leave the room, and then,\nas if the excitement of this sudden return into the past could not\nbe shaken off so readily, he started forward with a move of sudden\ndetermination."I think," he said, "I will go to Henry Burgoyne\'s house at once,\nto-night.I will see if this has\nor has not been one long, unprofitable mistake.If my visit should\nbe fruitless, I will send you this coin to add to your collection of\ndishonored honors, but if it should result as I hope it may, it will be\nyour doing, Miss Catherwaight, and two old men will have much to thank\nyou for.Good-night," he said as he bowed above her hand, "and--God\nbless you!"Miss Catherwaight flushed slightly at what he had said, and sat looking\ndown at the floor for a moment after the door had closed behind him.Latimer moved uneasily in his chair.The routine of the office\nhad been strangely disturbed that day, and he now failed to recognize\nin the girl before him with reddened cheeks and trembling eyelashes the\ncold, self-possessed young woman of society whom he had formerly known."You have done very well, if you will let me say so," he began, gently."I hope you are right in what you said, and that Mr.Lockwood will not\nmeet with a rebuff or an ungracious answer.Why," he went on quickly, "I\nhave seen him take out his gun now every spring and every fall for the\nlast ten years and clean and polish it and tell what great shots he and\nHenry, as he calls him, used to be.And then he would say he would take\na holiday and get off for a little shooting.He would\nput the gun back into its case again and mope in his library for days\nafterward.You see, he never married, and though he adopted me, in a\nmanner, and is fond of me in a certain way, no one ever took the place\nin his heart his old friend had held.""You will let me know, will you not, at once,--to-night, even,--whether\nhe succeeds or not?""You can\nunderstand why I am so deeply interested.I see now why you said I\nwould not tell the story of that medal.But, after all, it may be the\nprettiest story, the only pretty story I have to tell."Lockwood had not returned, the man said, when young Latimer reached\nthe home the lawyer had made for them both.He did not know what to\nargue from this, but determined to sit up and wait, and so sat smoking\nbefore the fire and listening with his sense of hearing on a strain for\nthe first movement at the door.The front door shut with a clash, and he heard\nMr.Lockwood crossing the hall quickly to the library, in which he\nwaited.Then the inner door was swung back, and Mr.Lockwood came in\nwith his head high and his eyes smiling brightly.There was something in his step that had not been there before,\nsomething light and vigorous, and he looked ten years younger.He\ncrossed the room to his writing-table without speaking and began tossing\nthe papers about on his desk.Then he closed the rolling-top lid with a\nsnap and looked up smiling."I shall have to ask you to look after things at the office for a little\nwhile," he said."Judge Burgoyne and I are going to Maryland for a few\nweeks\' shooting."VAN BIBBER AND THE SWAN-BOATS\n\n\nIt was very hot in the Park, and young Van Bibber, who has a good heart\nand a great deal more money than good-hearted people generally get, was\ncross and somnolent.He had told his groom to bring a horse he wanted to\ntry to the Fifty-ninth Street entrance at ten o\'clock, and the groom had\nnot appeared.He waited as long as his dignity would allow, and then turned off into\na by-lane end dropped on a bench and looked gloomily at the Lohengrin\nswans with the paddle-wheel attachment that circle around the lake.They struck him as the most idiotic inventions he had ever seen, and he\npitied, with the pity of a man who contemplates crossing the ocean to\nbe measured for his fall clothes, the people who could find delight in\nhaving some one paddle them around an artificial lake.Two little girls from the East Side, with a lunch basket, and an older\ngirl with her hair down her back, sat down on a bench beside him and\ngazed at the swans.The place was becoming too popular, and Van Bibber decided to move on.But the bench on which he sat was in the shade, and the asphalt walk\nleading to the street was in the sun, and his cigarette was soothing,\nso he ignored the near presence of the three little girls, and remained\nwhere he was."I s\'pose," said one of the two little girls, in a high, public school\nvoice, "there\'s lots to see from those swan-boats that youse can\'t see\nfrom the banks.""Oh, lots," assented the girl with long hair."If you walked all round the lake, clear all the way round, you could\nsee all there is to see," said the third, "except what there\'s in the\nmiddle where the island is.""I guess it\'s mighty wild on that island," suggested the youngest."Eddie Case he took a trip around the lake on a swan-boat the other day.He said youse could see fishes and ducks, and\nthat it looked just as if there were snakes and things on the island."asked the other one, in a hushed voice."Well, wild things," explained the elder, vaguely; "bears and animals\nlike that, that grow in wild places."Van Bibber lit a fresh cigarette, and settled himself comfortably and\nunreservedly to listen."My, but I\'d like to take a trip just once," said the youngest,\nunder her breath.Then she clasped her fingers together and looked up\nanxiously at the elder girl, who glanced at her with severe reproach.Ain\'t you having a good time\n\'nuff without wishing for everything you set your eyes on?"Van Bibber wondered at this--why humans should want to ride around on\nthe swans in the first place, and why, if they had such a wild desire,\nthey should not gratify it."Why, it costs more\'n it costs to come all the way up town in an open\ncar," added the elder girl, as if in answer to his unspoken question.The younger girl sighed at this, and nodded her head in submission, but\nblinked longingly at the big swans and the parti- awning and the\nred seats."I beg your pardon," said Van Bibber, addressing himself uneasily to\nthe eldest girl with long hair, "but if the little girl would like to go\naround in one of those things, and--and hasn\'t brought the change with\nher, you know, I\'m sure I should be very glad if she\'d allow me to send\nher around."exclaimed the little girl, with a jump, and so sharply\nand in such a shrill voice that Van Bibber shuddered."I\'m afraid maw wouldn\'t like our taking money from any one we didn\'t\nknow," she said with dignity; "but if you\'re going anyway and want\ncompany--"\n\n"Oh!my, no," said Van Bibber, hurriedly.He tried to picture himself\nriding around the lake behind a tin swan with three little girls from\nthe East Side, and a lunch basket."Then," said the head of the trio, "we can\'t go."There was such a look of uncomplaining acceptance of this verdict on\nthe part of the two little girls, that Van Bibber felt uncomfortable.He\nlooked to the right and to the left, and then said desperately,\n"Well, come along."The young man in a blue flannel shirt, who did the\npaddling, smiled at Van Bibber\'s riding-breeches, which were so very\nloose at one end and so very tight at the other, and at his gloves\nand crop.The three little girls\nplaced the awful lunch basket on the front seat and sat on the middle\none, and Van Bibber cowered in the back.They were hushed in silent\necstasy when it started, and gave little gasps of pleasure when it\ncareened slightly in turning.It was shady under the awning, and the\nmotion was pleasant enough, but Van Bibber was so afraid some one would\nsee him that he failed to enjoy it.But as soon as they passed into the narrow straits and were shut in by\nthe bushes and were out of sight of the people, he relaxed, and began to\nplay the host.He pointed out the fishes among the rocks at the edges\nof the pool, and the sparrows and robins bathing and ruffling\ntheir feathers in the shallow water, and agreed with them about the\npossibility of bears, and even tigers, in the wild part of the island,\nalthough the glimpse of the gray helmet of a Park policeman made such a\nsupposition doubtful.And it really seemed as though they were enjoying it more than he\never enjoyed a trip up the Sound on a yacht or across the ocean on a\nrecord-breaking steamship.It seemed long enough before they got back to\nVan Bibber, but his guests were evidently but barely satisfied.Still,\nall the goodness in his nature would not allow him to go through that\nordeal again.He stepped out of the boat eagerly and helped out the girl with long\nhair as though she had been a princess and tipped the rude young man\nwho had laughed at him, but who was perspiring now with the work he had\ndone; and then as he turned to leave the dock he came face to face with\nA Girl He Knew and Her brother.Her brother said, "How\'re you, Van Bibber?Been taking a trip around\nthe world in eighty minutes?"And added in a low voice, "Introduce me to\nyour young lady friends from Hester Street.""Ah, how\'re you--quite a surprise!"gasped Van Bibber, while his late\nguests stared admiringly at the pretty young lady in the riding-habit,\nand utterly refused to move on."Been taking ride on the lake,"\nstammered Van Bibber; "most exhilarating.Young friends of mine--these\nyoung ladies never rode on lake, so I took \'em."Oh, yes, we saw you," said Her brother, dryly, while she only smiled at\nhim, but so kindly and with such perfect understanding that Van Bibber\ngrew red with pleasure and bought three long strings of tickets for the\nswans at some absurd discount, and gave each little girl a string."There," said Her brother to the little ladies from Hester Street, "now\nyou can take trips for a week without stopping.Don\'t try to smuggle in\nany laces, and don\'t forget to fee the smoking-room steward."The Girl He Knew said they were walking over to the stables, and that\nhe had better go get his other horse and join her, which was to be his\nreward for taking care of the young ladies.And the three little girls\nproceeded to use up the yards of tickets so industriously that they were\nsunburned when they reached the tenement, and went to bed dreaming of\na big white swan, and a beautiful young gentleman in patent-leather\nriding-boots and baggy breeches.VAN BIBBER\'S BURGLAR\n\n\nThere had been a dance up town, but as Van Bibber could not find Her\nthere, he accepted young Travers\'s suggestion to go over to Jersey City\nand see a "go" between "Dutchy" Mack and a <DW52> person professionally\nknown as the Black Diamond.John went back to the kitchen.They covered up all signs of their evening\ndress with their great-coats, and filled their pockets with cigars, for\nthe smoke which surrounds a "go" is trying to sensitive nostrils, and\nthey also fastened their watches to both key-chains.Alf Alpin, who was\nacting as master of ceremonies, was greatly pleased and flattered\nat their coming, and boisterously insisted on their sitting on the\nplatform.The fact was generally circulated among the spectators that\nthe "two gents in high hats" had come in a carriage, and this and their\npatent-leather boots made them objects of keen interest.It was even\nwhispered that they were the "parties" who were putting up the money\nto back the Black Diamond against the "Hester Street Jackson."This in\nitself entitled them to respect.Van Bibber was asked to hold the watch,\nbut he wisely declined the honor, which was given to Andy Spielman, the\nsporting reporter of the _Track and Ring_, whose watch-case was covered\nwith diamonds, and was just the sort of a watch a timekeeper should\nhold.It was two o\'clock before "Dutchy" Mack\'s backer threw the sponge\ninto the air, and three before they reached the city.They had another\nreporter in the cab with them besides the gentleman who had bravely\nheld the watch in the face of several offers to "do for" him; and as\nVan Bibber was ravenously hungry, and as he doubted that he could get\nanything at that hour at the club, they accepted Spielman\'s invitation\nand went for a porterhouse steak and onions at the Owl\'s Nest, Gus\nMcGowan\'s all-night restaurant on Third Avenue.It was a very dingy, dirty place, but it was as warm as the engine-room\nof a steamboat, and the steak was perfectly done and tender.It was\ntoo late to go to bed, so they sat around the table, with their chairs\ntipped back and their knees against its edge.The two club men had\nthrown off their great-coats, and their wide shirt fronts and silk\nfacings shone grandly in the smoky light of the oil lamps and the\nred glow from the grill in the corner.They talked about the life the\nreporters led, and the Philistines asked foolish questions, which the\ngentleman of the press answered without showing them how foolish they\nwere."And I suppose you have all sorts of curious adventures," said Van\nBibber, tentatively."Well, no, not what I would call adventures," said one of the reporters."I have never seen anything that could not be explained or attributed\ndirectly to some known cause, such as crime or poverty or drink.You may\nthink at first that you have stumbled on something strange and romantic,\nbut it comes to nothing.You would suppose that in a great city like\nthis one would come across something that could not be explained away\nsomething mysterious or out of the common, like Stevenson\'s Suicide\nClub.Dickens once told James Payn that the\nmost curious thing he ever saw In his rambles around London was a ragged\nman who stood crouching under the window of a great house where the\nowner was giving a ball.While the man hid beneath a window on the\nground floor, a woman wonderfully dressed and very beautiful raised the\nsash from the inside and dropped her bouquet down into the man\'s hand,\nand he nodded and stuck it under his coat and ran off with it."I call that, now, a really curious thing to see.But I have never come\nacross anything like it, and I have been in every part of this big city,\nand at every hour of the night and morning, and I am not lacking in\nimagination either, but no captured maidens have ever beckoned to me\nfrom barred windows nor \'white hands waved from a passing hansom.\'Balzac and De Musset and Stevenson suggest that they have had such\nadventures, but they never come to me.It is all commonplace and vulgar,\nand always ends in a police court or with a \'found drowned\' in the North\nRiver."McGowan, who had fallen into a doze behind the bar, woke suddenly and\nshivered and rubbed his shirt-sleeves briskly.A woman knocked at the\nside door and begged for a drink "for the love of heaven," and the man\nwho tended the grill told her to be off.They could hear her feeling\nher way against the wall and cursing as she staggered out of the alley.Three men came in with a hack driver and wanted everybody to drink\nwith them, and became insolent when the gentlemen declined, and were\nin consequence hustled out one at a time by McGowan, who went to sleep\nagain immediately, with his head resting among the cigar boxes and\npyramids of glasses at the back of the bar, and snored."You see," said the reporter, "it is all like this.Night in a great\ncity is not picturesque and it is not theatrical.It is sodden,\nsometimes brutal, exciting enough until you get used to it, but it runs\nin a groove.It is dramatic, but the plot is old and the motives and\ncharacters always the same."The rumble of heavy market wagons and the rattle of milk carts told\nthem that it was morning, and as they opened the door the cold fresh\nair swept into the place and made them wrap their collars around\ntheir throats and stamp their feet.The morning wind swept down the\ncross-street from the East River and the lights of the street lamps and\nof the saloon looked old and tawdry.Travers and the reporter went off\nto a Turkish bath, and the gentleman who held the watch, and who had\nbeen asleep for the last hour, dropped into a nighthawk and told the\nman to drive home.It was almost clear now and very cold, and Van Bibber\ndetermined to walk.He had the strange feeling one gets when one stays\nup until the sun rises, of having lost a day somewhere, and the dance\nhe had attended a few hours before seemed to have come off long ago, and\nthe fight in Jersey City was far back in the past.The houses along the cross-street through which he walked were as dead\nas so many blank walls, and only here and there a lace curtain waved out\nof the open window where some honest citizen was sleeping.The street\nwas quite deserted; not even a cat or a policeman moved on it and Van\nBibber\'s footsteps sounded brisk on the sidewalk.There was a great\nhouse at the corner of the avenue and the cross-street on which he was\nwalking.The house faced the avenue and a stone wall ran back to the\nbrown stone stable which opened on the side street.There was a door\nin this wall, and as Van Bibber approached it on his solitary walk it\nopened cautiously, and a man\'s head appeared in it for an instant and\nwas withdrawn again like a flash, and the door snapped to.Van Bibber\nstopped and looked at the door and at the house and up and down the\nstreet.The house was tightly closed, as though some one was lying\ninside dead, and the streets were still empty.Van Bibber could think of nothing in his appearance so dreadful as to\nfrighten an honest man, so he decided the face he had had a glimpse of\nmust belong to a dishonest one.It was none of his business, he assured\nhimself, but it was curious, and he liked adventure, and he would\nhave liked to prove his friend the reporter, who did not believe in\nadventure, in the wrong.So he approached the door silently, and jumped\nand caught at the top of the wall and stuck one foot on the handle of\nthe door, and, with the other on the knocker, drew himself up and looked\ncautiously down on the other side.He had done this so lightly that the\nonly noise he made was the rattle of the door-knob on which his foot had\nrested, and the man inside thought that the one outside was trying to\nopen the door, and placed his shoulder to it and pressed against it\nheavily.Van Bibber, from his perch on the top of the wall, looked down\ndirectly on the other\'s head and shoulders.He could see the top of the\nman\'s head only two feet below, and he also saw that in one hand he\nheld a revolver and that two bags filled with projecting articles of\ndifferent sizes lay at his feet.It did not need explanatory notes to tell Van Bibber that the man below\nhad robbed the big house on the corner, and that if it had not been for\nhis having passed when he did the burglar would have escaped with his\ntreasure.His first thought was that he was not a policeman, and that a\nfight with a burglar was not in his line of life; and this was followed\nby the thought that though the gentleman who owned the property in the\ntwo bags was of no interest to him, he was, as a respectable member of\nsociety, more entitled to consideration than the man with the revolver.The fact that he was now, whether he liked it or not, perched on the top\nof the wall like Humpty Dumpty, and that the burglar might see him\nand shoot him the next minute, had also an immediate influence on his\nmovements.So he balanced himself cautiously and noiselessly and dropped\nupon the man\'s head and shoulders, bringing him down to the flagged walk\nwith him and under him.The revolver went off once in the struggle, but\nbefore the burglar could know how or from where his assailant had come,\nVan Bibber was standing up over him and had driven his heel down on his\nhand and kicked the pistol out of his fingers.Then he stepped quickly\nto where it lay and picked it up and said, "Now, if you try to get up\nI\'ll shoot at you."He felt an unwarranted and ill-timedly humorous\ninclination to add, "and I\'ll probably miss you," but subdued it.The\nburglar, much to Van Bibber\'s astonishment, did not attempt to rise, but\nsat up with his hands locked across his knees and said: "Shoot ahead.His teeth were set and his face desperate and bitter, and hopeless to a\ndegree of utter hopelessness that Van Bibber had never imagined."Go ahead," reiterated the man, doggedly, "I won\'t move.Van Bibber felt the pistol loosening\nin his hand, and he was conscious of a strong inclination to lay it down\nand ask the burglar to tell him all about it."You haven\'t got much heart," said Van Bibber, finally."You\'re a pretty\npoor sort of a burglar, I should say.""I won\'t go back--I won\'t go\nback there alive.I\'ve served my time forever in that hole.If I have to\ngo back again--s\'help me if I don\'t do for a keeper and die for it.But\nI won\'t serve there no more."asked Van Bibber, gently, and greatly interested; "to\nprison?"cried the man, hoarsely: "to a grave.Look at my face," he said, "and look at my hair.That ought to tell you\nwhere I\'ve been.With all the color gone out of my skin, and all the\nlife out of my legs.I couldn\'t hurt you if\nI wanted to.I\'m a skeleton and a baby, I am.And\nnow you\'re going to send me back again for another lifetime.For twenty\nyears, this time, into that cold, forsaken hole, and after I done my\ntime so well and worked so hard."Van Bibber shifted the pistol from one\nhand to the other and eyed his prisoner doubtfully.he asked, seating himself on the steps\nof the kitchen and holding the revolver between his knees.The sun was\ndriving the morning mist away, and he had forgotten the cold."I got out yesterday," said the man.Van Bibber glanced at the bags and lifted the revolver."You didn\'t\nwaste much time," he said."No," answered the man, sullenly, "no, I didn\'t.I knew this place and\nI wanted money to get West to my folks, and the Society said I\'d have to\nwait until I earned it, and I couldn\'t wait.I haven\'t seen my wife\nfor seven years, nor my daughter.Seven years, young man; think of\nthat--seven years.Seven years without\nseeing your wife or your child!And they\'re straight people, they are,"\nhe added, hastily."My wife moved West after I was put away and took\nanother name, and my girl never knew nothing about me.I was to join \'em,\nand I thought I could lift enough here to get the fare, and now," he\nadded, dropping his face in his hands, "I\'ve got to go back.And I had\nmeant to live straight after I got West,--God help me, but I did!An\' I don\'t care whether you believe\nit or not neither," he added, fiercely."I didn\'t say whether I believed it or not," answered Van Bibber, with\ngrave consideration.He eyed the man for a brief space without speaking, and the burglar\nlooked back at him, doggedly and defiantly, and with not the faintest\nsuggestion of hope in his eyes, or of appeal for mercy.Perhaps it was\nbecause of this fact, or perhaps it was the wife and child that moved\nVan Bibber, but whatever his motives were, he acted on them promptly."I\nsuppose, though," he said, as though speaking to himself, "that I ought\nto give you up.""I\'ll never go back alive," said the burglar, quietly."Well, that\'s bad, too," said Van Bibber."Of course I don\'t know\nwhether you\'re lying or not, and as to your meaning to live honestly, I\nvery much doubt it; but I\'ll give you a ticket to wherever your wife is,\nand I\'ll see you on the train.And you can get off at the next station\nand rob my house to-morrow night, if you feel that way about it.Throw\nthose bags inside that door where the servant will see them before the\nmilkman does, and walk on out ahead of me, and keep your hands in your\npockets, and don\'t try to run.The man placed the bags inside the kitchen door; and, with a doubtful\nlook at his custodian, stepped out into the street, and walked, as he\nwas directed to do, toward the Grand Central station.Van Bibber kept\njust behind him, and kept turning the question over in his mind as to\nwhat he ought to do.He felt very guilty as he passed each policeman,\nbut he recovered himself when he thought of the wife and child who lived\nin the West, and who were "straight."asked Van Bibber, as he stood at the ticket-office window."Helena, Montana," answered the man with, for the first time, a look of\nrelief.Van Bibber bought the ticket and handed it to the burglar."I\nsuppose you know," he said, "that you can sell that at a place down town\nfor half the money.""Yes, I know that," said the burglar.There was a\nhalf-hour before the train left, and Van Bibber took his charge into the\nrestaurant and watched him eat everything placed before him, with his\neyes glancing all the while to the right or left.Then Van Bibber gave\nhim some money and told him to write to him, and shook hands with him.The man nodded eagerly and pulled off his hat as the car drew out of\nthe station; and Van Bibber came down town again with the shop girls and\nclerks going to work, still wondering if he had done the right thing.He went to his rooms and changed his clothes, took a cold bath, and\ncrossed over to Delmonico\'s for his breakfast, and, while the waiter\nlaid the cloth in the cafe, glanced at the headings in one of the\npapers.He scanned first with polite interest the account of the dance\non the night previous and noticed his name among those present.With\ngreater interest he read of the fight between "Dutchy" Mack and the\n"Black Diamond," and then he read carefully how "Abe" Hubbard, alias\n"Jimmie the Gent," a burglar, had broken jail in New Jersey, and had\nbeen traced to New York.There was a description of the man, and Van\nBibber breathed quickly as he read it."The detectives have a clew of\nhis whereabouts," the account said; "if he is still in the city they are\nconfident of recapturing him.But they fear that the same friends who\nhelped him to break jail will probably assist him from the country or to\nget out West.""They may do that," murmured Van Bibber to himself, with a smile of grim\ncontentment; "they probably will."Then he said to the waiter, "Oh, I don\'t know.Some bacon and eggs and\ngreen things and coffee."VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN\n\n\nYoung Van Bibber came up to town in June from Newport to see his lawyer\nabout the preparation of some papers that needed his signature.He found\nthe city very hot and close, and as dreary and as empty as a house that\nhas been shut up for some time while its usual occupants are away in the\ncountry.As he had to wait over for an afternoon train, and as he was down town,\nhe decided to lunch at a French restaurant near Washington Square, where\nsome one had told him you could get particular things particularly well\ncooked.The tables were set on a terrace with plants and flowers about\nthem, and covered with a tricolored awning.There were no jangling\nhorse-car bells nor dust to disturb him, and almost all the other tables\nwere unoccupied.The waiters leaned against these tables and chatted in\na French argot; and a cool breeze blew through the plants and billowed\nthe awning, so that, on the whole, Van Bibber was glad he had come.There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late\nbreakfast; two young artists with Van <DW18> beards, who ordered the most\nremarkable things in the same French argot that the waiters spoke; and a\nyoung lady and a young gentleman at the table next to his own.The young\nman\'s back was toward him, and he could only see the girl when the youth\nmoved to one side.She was very young and very pretty, and she seemed in\na most excited state of mind from the tip of her wide-brimmed, pointed\nFrench hat to the points of her patent-leather ties.She was strikingly\nwell-bred in appearance, and Van Bibber wondered why she should be\ndining alone with so young a man."It wasn\'t my fault," he heard the youth say earnestly."How could I\nknow he would be out of town?Your\ncousin is not the only clergyman in the city.""Of course not," said the girl, almost tearfully, "but they\'re not my\ncousins and he is, and that would have made it so much, oh, so very much\ndifferent."Runaway couple," commented Van Bibber.Read about\n\'em often; never seen \'em.He bent his head over an entree, but he could not help hearing what\nfollowed, for the young runaways were indifferent to all around them,\nand though he rattled his knife and fork in a most vulgar manner, they\ndid not heed him nor lower their voices."Well, what are you going to do?"said the girl, severely but not\nunkindly."It doesn\'t seem to me that you are exactly rising to the\noccasion.""Well, I don\'t know," answered the youth, easily.Nobody we know ever comes here, and if they did they are out of\ntown now.You go on and eat something, and I\'ll get a directory and look\nup a lot of clergymen\'s addresses, and then we can make out a list and\ndrive around in a cab until we find one who has not gone off on his\nvacation.We ought to be able to catch the Fall River boat back at\nfive this afternoon; then we can go right on to Boston from Fall River\nto-morrow morning and run down to Narragansett during the day.""They\'ll never forgive us," said the girl."Oh, well, that\'s all right," exclaimed the young man, cheerfully."Really, you\'re the most uncomfortable young person I ever ran away\nwith.One might think you were going to a funeral.You were willing\nenough two days ago, and now you don\'t help me at all.he asked, and then added, "but please don\'t say so, even if you are.""No, not sorry, exactly," said the girl; "but, indeed, Ted, it is going\nto make so much talk.If we only had a girl with us, or if you had a\nbest man, or if we had witnesses, as they do in England, and a parish\nregistry, or something of that sort; or if Cousin Harold had only been\nat home to do the marrying."The young gentleman called Ted did not look, judging from the expression\nof his shoulders, as if he were having a very good time.He picked at the food on his plate gloomily, and the girl took out her\nhandkerchief and then put it resolutely back again and smiled at him.The youth called the waiter and told him to bring a directory, and as he\nturned to give the order Van Bibber recognized him and he recognized Van\nBibber.Van Bibber knew him for a very nice boy, of a very good Boston\nfamily named Standish, and the younger of two sons.It was the elder who\nwas Van Bibber\'s particular friend.The girl saw nothing of this mutual\nrecognition, for she was looking with startled eyes at a hansom that had\ndashed up the side street and was turning the corner."Standish," said Van Bibber, jumping up and reaching for his hat, "pay\nthis chap for these things, will you, and I\'ll get rid of your brother."Van Bibber descended the steps lighting a cigar as the elder Standish\ncame up them on a jump."Wait a minute; where are you\ngoing?Why, it seems to rain Standishes to-day!First see your brother;\nthen I see you.Van Bibber answered these different questions to the effect that he had\nseen young Standish and Mrs.Standish not a half an hour before, and\nthat they were just then taking a cab for Jersey City, whence they were\nto depart for Chicago."The driver who brought them here, and who told me where they were, said\nthey could not have left this place by the time I would reach it," said\nthe elder brother, doubtfully."That\'s so," said the driver of the cab, who had listened curiously."I\nbrought \'em here not more\'n half an hour ago.Just had time to get back\nto the depot."Yes, but they have," said Van Bibber."However, if you get over to\nJersey City in time for the 2.30, you can reach Chicago almost as soon\nas they do.They are going to the Palmer House, they said.""Thank you, old fellow," shouted Standish, jumping back into his hansom.Nobody objected to the\nmarriage, only too young, you know."Don\'t mention it," said Van Bibber, politely."Now, then," said that young man, as he approached the frightened couple\ntrembling on the terrace, "I\'ve sent your brother off to Chicago.I\ndo not know why I selected Chicago as a place where one would go on a\nhoneymoon.But I\'m not used to lying and I\'m not very good at it.Now,\nif you will introduce me, I\'ll see what can be done toward getting you\ntwo babes out of the woods."Standish said, "Miss Cambridge, this is Mr.Cortlandt Van Bibber, of\nwhom you have heard my brother speak," and Miss Cambridge said she\nwas very glad to meet Mr.Van Bibber even under such peculiarly trying\ncircumstances."Now what you two want to do," said Van Bibber, addressing them as\nthough they were just about fifteen years old and he were at least\nforty, "is to give this thing all the publicity you can."chorused the two runaways, in violent protest."You were about to make a fatal mistake.You were about to go to some unknown clergyman of an unknown parish,\nwho would have married you in a back room, without a certificate or\na witness, just like any eloping farmer\'s daughter and lightning-rod\nagent.Why you were not married\nrespectably in church I don\'t know, and I do not intend to ask, but\na kind Providence has sent me to you to see that there is no talk nor\nscandal, which is such bad form, and which would have got your names\ninto all the papers.I am going to arrange this wedding properly, and\nyou will kindly remain here until I send a carriage for you.Now just\nrely on me entirely and eat your luncheon in peace.It\'s all going to\ncome out right--and allow me to recommend the salad, which is especially\ngood."Van Bibber first drove madly to the Little Church Around the Corner,\nwhere he told the kind old rector all about it, and arranged to have\nthe church open and the assistant organist in her place, and a\ndistrict-messenger boy to blow the bellows, punctually at three o\'clock."And now," he soliloquized, "I must get some names.It doesn\'t matter\nmuch whether they happen to know the high contracting parties or not,\nbut they must be names that everybody knows.Whoever is in town will be\nlunching at Delmonico\'s, and the men will be at the clubs."So he first\nwent to the big restaurant, where, as good luck would have it, he found\nMrs."Regy" Van Arnt and Mrs."Jack" Peabody, and the Misses Brookline,\nwho had run up the Sound for the day on the yacht _Minerva_ of the\nBoston Yacht Club, and he told them how things were and swore them to\nsecrecy, and told them to bring what men they could pick up.At the club he pressed four men into service who knew everybody and whom\neverybody knew, and when they protested that they had not been properly\ninvited and that they only knew the bride and groom by sight, he told\nthem that made no difference, as it was only their names he wanted.Then\nhe sent a messenger boy to get the biggest suit of rooms on the Fall\nRiver boat and another one for flowers, and then he put Mrs."Regy" Van\nArnt into a cab and sent her after the bride, and, as best man, he got\ninto another cab and carried off the groom."I have acted either as best man or usher forty-two times now," said Van\nBibber, as they drove to the church, "and this is the first time I ever\nappeared in either capacity in russia-leather shoes and a blue serge\nyachting suit.But then," he added, contentedly, "you ought to see the\nother fellows.One of them is in a striped flannel.""Regy" and Miss Cambridge wept a great deal on the way up town, but\nthe bride was smiling and happy when she walked up the aisle to meet her\nprospective husband, who looked exceedingly conscious before the eyes of\nthe men, all of whom he knew by sight or by name, and not one of whom he\nhad ever met before.But they all shook hands after it was over, and\nthe assistant organist played the Wedding March, and one of the club men\ninsisted in pulling a cheerful and jerky peal on the church bell in the\nabsence of the janitor, and then Van Bibber hurled an old shoe and a\nhandful of rice--which he had thoughtfully collected from the chef at\nthe club--after them as they drove off to the boat."Now," said Van Bibber, with a proud sigh of relief and satisfaction, "I\nwill send that to the papers, and when it is printed to-morrow it will\nread like one of the most orthodox and one of the smartest weddings of\nthe season.And yet I can\'t help thinking--"\n\n"Well?""Regy," as he paused doubtfully."Well, I can\'t help thinking," continued Van Bibber, "of Standish\'s\nolder brother racing around Chicago with the thermometer at 102 in the\nshade.I wish I had only sent him to Jersey City.It just shows," he\nadded, mournfully, "that when a man is not practised in lying, he should\nleave it alone."She told me that often in the\nnight when Silvain was sleeping she would rise softly and go to the\ngallery, in fear that Kristel was stealthily approaching them.He gazed at me, and did not speak--not that he was\nunable, but because it was part of the cunning of his nature.Silvain\ninformed me that Avicia expected her baby in three weeks from that\nday.I had not come empty-handed, and I left behind me welcome\nremembrances, promising to come again the following week.Upon seeing me, a woman of the village ran towards\nme, and whispered:\n\n"\'Kristel is here.\'"I followed the direction of her gaze, which was simply one of\ncuriosity, and saw a man standing on the beach, facing the lighthouse.Sandra went to the bedroom.I walked straight up to him, and touched him with my hand.He turned,\nand I recognised Kristel."I recognised him--yes; but not from any resemblance he bore to the\nKristel of former days.Had I met him under ordinary circumstances I\nshould not have known him.His thin face was covered with hair; his\neyes were sunken and wild; his bony wrists, his long fingers, seemed\nto be fleshless.I spoke to him, and mentioned my name.He heard me,\nbut did not reply.I begged him to speak, and he remained silent.After his first look at me he turned from me, and stood with his eyes\nin the direction of the lighthouse.I would not accept his reception\nof me; I continued to address him; I asked him upon what errand he had\ncome, and why he kept his eyes so fixedly upon the lighthouse.I gave\nhim information of myself, and said I should be pleased to see him in\nmy home--with a vague and foolish hope that he would accept the\ninvitation, and that I might be able to work upon his better nature.I did not dare to utter the name of\neither Silvain or Avicia, fearing that I should awake the demon that\nhad taken possession of his soul."By the time that I had exhausted what I thought it wise and good to\nsay, I found myself falling into a kind of fascination, produced by\nhis motionless attitude, and the fixed gaze in his unnaturally\nbrilliant eyes.It was a bright day, and I knew that my imagination\nwas playing me a trick, but I saw clearly with my mind\'s eye, the\nouter gallery of the lighthouse, and the figure of Avicia standing\nthereon, with her hair hanging loose, and a scarlet covering on her\nhead.Was it a spiritual reflection of what this silent, motionless\nman was gazing upon?I shuddered, and passed my hand across my eyes;\nthe vision was gone--but he gazed upon it still."I was compelled at length to leave him standing there upon the beach,\nand he took no notice of my departure."Others were observing him as well as I, and had watched me with\ncuriosity during the time I stood by his side.When I was among them\nthey asked if he had spoken to me."\'No,\' I replied, \'I could get no word from him.\'"\'Neither has he spoken to us,\' they said.\'Not a sound has passed his\nlips since his arrival.\'"\'Yesterday,\' they answered, \'and our first thought was that he would\nwant a boat to row to the lighthouse, but he did not ask for it.Surely he must wish to see his brother!There is something strange\nabout him, do you not think so?One of our women here insists that he\nis dumb.\'"\'He must be dumb,\' said the woman; \'else why should he not speak?\'"\'There was a jealousy between him and his brother,\' said an elderly\nwoman, \'about Avicia.\'exclaimed the woman who pronounced him\ndumb.\'Jealousy, like love, does not last for ever.She is not the\nonly woman in the world, and men have eyes.They must have made up\ntheir quarrel long ago.Besides, if he _was_ jealous still, which\nisn\'t in the least likely, that would not make him dumb!His tongue\nwould be all the looser for it.\'"\'More terrible,\' thought I, \'is the dread silence of that motionless\nman than all the storms of wrath his tongue could utter.\'"From what the villagers said, I knew that they were in ignorance of\nthe hatred which filled Kristel\'s heart, and I debated within myself\nwhat it was best to do.That the simple men of the village would not\nvoluntarily make themselves parties to any scheme of blind vengeance\non the part of one brother against another I was certain, but I was\nnot satisfied that it would be right to give them my whole confidence,\nand tell them all I knew.At the same time it would not be right to\nallow them to remain in complete ignorance, for by so doing they might\nbe made unwittingly to further Kristel\'s designs upon his brother\'s\nlife.There was a priest in the village, and I went to him, and under\nthe seal of secrecy revealed something, but not all, of the meaning of\nKristel\'s appearance."I accompanied him, and once more stood by the side of Kristel.The\npriest addressed him, counselled him, exhorted him, and, like myself,\ncould obtain no word from him.Kindlier speech I never heard, but it\nmade no impression upon Kristel."\'He _must_ be dumb,\' said the priest as we moved away."\'Not so,\' I said earnestly; \'were he dumb, and unable to hear what is\nsaid to him, he would certainly indicate by some kind of sign that\nspeech addressed to him was falling upon ears that were deaf.He is\npossessed by a demoniac obduracy, and his apparent indifference is but\na part of a fell design to which I should be afraid to give a name.\'"The priest was impressed by this view of the matter, which could not\nbut appeal successfully to a man\'s calm reason.\'If a man is determined not to speak, I\nhave no power to compel him.\'"\'It is in your power,\' I said, \'to prevent bloodshed.\'"\'Nothing less, I fear,\' I said.\'Lay an injunction upon the villagers\nnot to lend that man a boat, and not, under any pretext, to row him to\nthe lighthouse.\'"\'I am not at liberty to say more at the present moment,\' I said.\'I\nshall not leave the village to-day.I myself will see that man\'s\nbrother, and will obtain permission from him to reveal all I know.Meanwhile give not that soul-tossed wretch the opportunity of carrying\nout a scheme of ruthless vengeance which he has harboured for years.\'"\'Tell me explicitly what you wish me to do.\'That man, with the connivance or assistance\nof any person in this village, must not be enabled to get to the\nlighthouse.\'"And he mixed with the villagers, men and women, and laid upon them\nthe injunction I desired.With my mind thus set at ease for at least a\nfew hours, I engaged a couple of boatmen to row me to Silvain.I half\nexpected that Kristel would come forward with a request, made if not\nin speech in dumb show, to be allowed to accompany me, and I had\nresolved what action to take; but he made no step towards me.He gave\nno indication even of a knowledge of what was taking place within a\ndozen yards of him, although it was not possible that the putting off\nof the boat from the shore could have escaped his observation."\'If he is not deaf and dumb,\' said one of the rowers, \'he must have\ngone clean out of his senses.\'"\'Neither one nor the other,\' thought I; \'he is nursing his vengeance,\nand has decided upon some plan of action.\'"Silvain and Avicia were on the outer gallery, and when I joined them\nSilvain drew me aside."\'You have news of Kristel,\' he said.I nodded, and he continued: \'I\nknow without the telling."\'No human,\' he replied, with a sad smile.\'I see him standing upon\nthe beach, looking towards us.\'"In truth that was a physical impossibility, but I needed no further\nproof of the mysterious insight with which Silvain was gifted.I\nrelated to him all that had passed between me and Kristel and the\npriest, and of the precautions taken to keep from Kristel the means of\nreaching the lighthouse."\'That will not prevent him from coming, said Silvain; \'he is a fine\nswimmer.I myself, were I desperately pushed to it, would undertake to\nswim to the village.You hold to your\npromise, Louis, with respect to Avicia?\'"\'It is binding upon me,\' I replied;\'my word is given.\'Neither will my child be left without a counsellor.Louis, I shall never see the face of my child--I shall never feel his\nlittle hands about my neck!\'"\'Were it not for the tender sympathy I have for you,\' I said in a\ntone of reproof, \'I should feel inclined to be angry.Did you not\nconfess to me in former days that you could not see into the future?And here you are, raising up ghosts to make the present more bitter\nthan it is.Black as things appear, there are bright\nyears yet in store for you.\'"\'I cannot help my forebodings, Louis.True, I cannot, nor can any\nman, see into the future, but what can I do to turn my brother\'s hate\nfrom me?\'It was a cry of anguish wrung from his suffering heart.\'I\nthink of the days of our childhood, when we strolled in the woods with\nour arms round each other\'s necks, I think of the dreams we mapped of\nthe future.Running water by the side of which we sat, bending over to\nsee our faces, and making our lips meet in a shadowed kiss, flowers we\npicked in field and meadow, errands of mercy we went upon together,\ntwilight communings, the little sweethearts we had--all these innocent\nways of childhood rise before me, and fill me with anguish.What can I\ndo?--what can I do to bring him back to me in brotherly love?Louis, I\nhave a fear that I have never whispered to living soul.It is that\nAvicia may have twin children, as Kristel and I are, and they should\ngrow up to be as we are now!Would it not be better that they should\nbe born dead, or die young, when their souls are not stained with\nhatred of each other and with evil thoughts that render existence a\ncurse?\'"We were alone when he gave expression to his agonised feelings;\nAvicia had left us to attend to domestic duties.I could say nothing\nto comfort him; to harp upon one string of intended consolation to a\nman who is in no mood to accept it becomes, after a time, an\noppression.He paced up and down, twining his fingers convulsively,\nand presently said,\n\n"\'It would be too much, Louis, to ask you to remain with me a little\nwhile?\'"\'No,\' I replied, \'it would not.Indeed, it was partly in my mind to\nsuggest it.The crisis you have dreaded for many years has come, and\nif you wish me to stop with you a day or two I will willingly do so.It may be--I do not know how--that I can be of service to you.The\nboatmen are waiting in the boat below.I will write a letter to my\nwife, and they shall post it, informing her that I shall be absent\nfrom home perhaps until the end of the week, by which time I hope the\ncloud will have passed away.No thanks, Silvain; friendship would be a\npoor and valueless thing if one shrank from a sacrifice so slight.\'"I wrote my letter, and despatched it by the boatmen.Then we waited\nfor events; it was all that it was in our power to do."Avicia was very glad when she heard of my intention to remain with\nthem a while."\'Your companionship will do him good,\' she said.\'He has no one but\nme to talk to, and he speaks of but one subject.If this continues\nlong he will lose his reason.\'"The day passed, and night came on.There was but scanty living\naccommodation in the lighthouse, but a mattress was spread for me upon\nthe floor of the tiny kitchen; and there I was to sleep.Avicia and\nSilvain wished me to occupy their bed, but I would not have it so.Before retiring to rest, Silvain and I passed two or three hours in\nconverse; I purposely led the conversation into foreign channels, and\nwhen I wished him good-night I was rejoiced to perceive that I had\nsucceeded for a brief space in diverting his mind from the fears which\nweighed so heavily upon him."Nothing occurred during the night to disturb us; I awoke early, and\nlay waiting for sunrise; but no light came, and when, aroused by\nSilvain, I left my bed and went to the outer gallery, I was surprised\nto see that all surrounding space was wrapt in a thick mist."\'A great storm will soon be upon us,\' said Silvain."He was right; before noon the storm burst, and the sea was lashed\ninto fury.It was a relief to see the play of lightning upon the angry\nwaters, but it was terrible too, and I thought how awful and joyless a\nlone life must be when spent in such a home.This second day seemed as\nif it would never end, and it was only by my watch that I knew of the\napproach of night.With the sounds of the storm in my ears I lay down\nupon my mattress and fell asleep."I know not at what time of the night I awoke, but with black darkness\nupon and around me, I found myself sitting up, listening to sounds\nwithout which did not proceed from the conflict of the elements.At\nfirst I could not decide whether they were real or but the refrain of\na dream by which I had been disturbed; soon, however, I received\nindisputable evidence that they were not the creations of my fancy."The voice was Silvain\'s, and the words were uttered in outer space.When I retired to rest I had lain down in my clothes, removing only my\ncoat, and using it as a covering.I quickly put it on, and lit a lamp,\nto which a chain was attached, by which means it could be held over\nthe walls of the lighthouse.The lamp was scarcely lighted, when\nAvicia, but half dressed, rushed into the little room."Her eyes wandered round the room, seeking him.At that moment the\nvoice from without pierced the air."I threw my arms round Avicia, and held her fast.\'Are you, too, leagued against\nus?"It needed all my strength to restrain her from rushing out in her\nwild delirium, perhaps to her destruction.I whispered to her\nhurriedly that I intended to go to the outer gallery, and that she\nshould accompany me; and also that if she truly wished to be of\nassistance to her husband she must be calm.She ceased instantly to\nstruggle, and said in a tone of suppressed excitement,\n\n"\'Come, then.\'"I did not quit my hold of her, but I used now only one hand, which I\nclasped firmly round her wrist, my other being required for the\nlantern.The next moment we were standing upon the gallery, bending\nover.It was pitch dark, and we could see nothing; even the white\nspray of the waves, as they dashed against the stone walls, was not\nvisible to us; but we heard Silvain\'s voice, at intervals, appealing\nin frenzied tones to Kristel, who, it needed not the evidence of sight\nto know, was holding on to the chains and struggling with his brother.How the two came into that awful position was never discovered, and I\ncould only judge by inference that Kristel, in the dead of this deadly\nnight, had made his way by some means to the lighthouse, and was\nendeavouring to effect an entrance, when Silvain, awakened by his\nattempts, had gone out to him, and was instantly seized and dragged\ndown."So fearful and confused were the minutes that immediately followed\nthat I have but an indistinct impression of the occurrences of the\ntime, which will live ever within me as the most awful in my life.I\nknow that I never lost my grasp of Avicia, and that but for me she\nwould have flung herself over the walls; I know that the brothers were\nengaged in a struggle for life and death, and that Silvain continued\nto make the most pathetic appeals to Kristel to listen to him, and not\nto stain his soul with blood; I know that in those appeals there were\nthe tenderest references to their boyhood\'s days, to the love which\nhad existed between them, each for the other, to trivial incidents in\ntheir childhood, to their mother who worshipped them and was now\nlooking down upon them, to the hopes in which they had indulged of a\nlife of harmony and affection; I know that it struck me then as most\nterrible that during the whole of the struggle no word issued from\nKristel\'s lips; I know that there were heartrending appeals from\nAvicia to Kristel to spare her husband, and that there were tender\ncries from her to Silvain, and from Silvain to her; I know that,\nfinding a loose chain on the gallery, I lowered it to the combatants,\nand called out to Silvain--foolishly enough, in so far as he could\navail himself of it--to release himself from his brother\'s arms and\nseize it, and that I and Avicia would draw him up to safety; I know\nthat in one vivid flash of lightning I saw the struggling forms and\nthe beautiful white spray of the waves; I know that Silvain\'s voice\ngrew fainter and fainter until it was heard no more; I know that there\nwas the sound of a heavy body or bodies falling into the sea, that a\nshriek of woe and despair clove my heart like a knife, and that Avicia\nlay in my arms moaning and trembling.I bore her tenderly into her\nroom, and laid her on her bed."The storm ceased; no sound was heard without.The rising sun filled\nthe eastern horizon with loveliest hues of saffron and crimson.The\nsea was calm; there was no trace of tempest and human agony.By that\ntime Avicia was a mother, and lay with her babes pressed to her bosom.Silvain\'s fear was realised: he was the dead father of twin brothers."The assistant whom Avicia\'s father had engaged rowed me to the\nvillage, and there I enlisted the services of a woman, who accompanied\nme back to the lighthouse, and attended to Avicia.The mother lived\nbut two days after the birth of her babes.Until her last hour she was\ndelirious, but then she recovered her senses and recognised me."\'My dear Silvain told me,\' she said, in a weak, faint voice, \'that\nyou would be a friend to our children.Bless the few moments remaining\nto me by assuring me that you will not desert them.\'"I gave her the assurance for which she yearned, and she desired me to\ncall them by the names of Eric and Emilius.It rejoiced me that she\npassed away in peace; strange as it may seem, it was an inexpressible\nrelief to her bruised heart that the long agony was over.Her last\nwords were,\n\n"\'I trust you."And so, with her nerveless hand in mine, her spirit went out to her\nlover and husband."We buried her in the village churchyard, and the day was observed as\na day of mourning in that village by the sea."I thought I could not do better than leave the twin babes for a time\nin the charge of the woman I had engaged, and it occurred to me that\nit might not be unprofitable to have some inquiries and investigation\nmade with respect to the inheritance left by their grandfather to his\nsons Kristel and Silvain.I placed the matter in the hands of a shrewd\nlawyer, and he was enabled to recover a portion of what was due to\ntheir father.This was a great satisfaction to me, as it to some\nextent provided for the future of Eric and Emilius, and supplied the\nwherewithal for their education.It was my intention, when they\narrived at a certain age,

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Amid my career\nof travail, there was ever a bright form which animated exertion,\ninspired my invention, nerved my energy, and to gain whose heart and\nlife I first made many of those discoveries, and entered into many\nof those speculations, that have since been the foundation of my wide\nprosperity.\'Her faith was pledged to me; I lived upon her image; the day was even\ntalked of when I should bear her to the home that I had proudly prepared\nfor her.\'There came a young noble, a warrior who had never seen war, glittering\nwith gewgaws.He was quartered in the town where the mistress of my\nheart, who was soon to share my life and my fortunes, resided.The tale\nis too bitter not to be brief.He saw her, he sighed; I will hope that\nhe loved her; she gave him with rapture the heart which perhaps she\nfound she had never given to me; and instead of bearing the name I had\nonce hoped to have called her by, she pledged her faith at the altar to\none who, like you, was called, CONINGSBY.\'\'You see, I too have had my griefs.\'\'Dear sir,\' said Coningsby, rising and taking Mr.Millbank\'s hand, \'I am\nmost wretched; and yet I wish to part from you even with affection.You\nhave explained circumstances that have long perplexed me.A curse, I\nfear, is on our families.I have not mind enough at this moment even\nto ponder on my situation.I go; yes, I quit this\nHellingsley, where I came to be so happy, where I have been so happy.Nay, let me go, dear sir!I must be alone, I must try to think.And tell\nher, no, tell her nothing.Proceeding down the avenue with a rapid and distempered step, his\ncountenance lost, as it were, in a wild abstraction, Coningsby\nencountered Oswald Millbank.He stopped, collected his turbulent\nthoughts, and throwing on Oswald one look that seemed at the same time\nto communicate woe and to demand sympathy, flung himself into his arms.he exclaimed, and then added, in a broken voice, \'I need a\nfriend.\'Then in a hurried, impassioned, and somewhat incoherent strain, leaning\non Oswald\'s arm, as they walked on together, he poured forth all that\nhad occurred, all of which he had dreamed; his baffled bliss, his\nactual despair.there was little room for solace, and yet all\nthat earnest affection could inspire, and a sagacious brain and a brave\nspirit, were offered for his support, if not his consolation, by the\nfriend who was devoted to him.In the midst of this deep communion, teeming with every thought and\nsentiment that could enchain and absorb the spirit of man, they came to\none of the park-gates of Coningsby.The command of\nhis father was peremptory, that no member of his family, under any\ncircumstances, or for any consideration, should set his foot on that\ndomain.Lady Wallinger had once wished to have seen the Castle, and\nConingsby was only too happy in the prospect of escorting her and Edith\nover the place; but Oswald had then at once put his veto on the project,\nas a thing forbidden; and which, if put in practice, his father would\nnever pardon.So it passed off, and now Oswald himself was at the gates\nof that very domain with his friend who was about to enter them, his\nfriend whom he might never see again; that Coningsby who, from their\nboyish days, had been the idol of his life; whom he had lived to see\nappeal to his affections and his sympathy, and whom Oswald was now going\nto desert in the midst of his lonely and unsolaced woe.\'I ought not to enter here,\' said Oswald, holding the hand of Coningsby\nas he hesitated to advance; \'and yet there are duties more sacred even\nthan obedience to a father.I cannot leave you thus, friend of my best\nheart!\'The morning passed away in unceasing yet fruitless speculation on the\nfuture.One moment something was to happen, the next nothing could\noccur.Sometimes a beam of hope flashed over the fancy of Coningsby,\nand jumping up from the turf, on which they were reclining, he seemed\nto exult in his renovated energies; and then this sanguine paroxysm was\nsucceeded by a fit of depression so dark and dejected that nothing but\nthe presence of Oswald seemed to prevent Coningsby from flinging himself\ninto the waters of the Darl.The day was fast declining, and the inevitable moment of separation was\nat hand.Oswald wished to appear at the dinner-table of Hellingsley,\nthat no suspicion might arise in the mind of his father of his having\naccompanied Coningsby home.But just as he was beginning to mention the\nnecessity of his departure, a flash of lightning seemed to transfix the\nheavens.The sky was very dark; though studded here and there with dingy\nspots.The young men sprang up at the same time.\'We had better get out of these trees,\' said Oswald.\'We had better get to the Castle,\' said Coningsby.A clap of thunder that seemed to make the park quake broke over their\nheads, followed by some thick drops.The Castle was close at hand;\nOswald had avoided entering it; but the impending storm was so menacing\nthat, hurried on by Coningsby, he could make no resistance; and, in a\nfew minutes, the companions were watching the tempest from the windows\nof a room in Coningsby Castle.The fork-lightning flashed and scintillated from every quarter of the\nhorizon: the thunder broke over the Castle, as if the keep were rocking\nwith artillery: amid the momentary pauses of the explosion, the rain was\nheard descending like dissolving water-spouts.Nor was this one of those transient tempests that often agitate\nthe summer.Time advanced, and its fierceness was little mitigated.Sometimes there was a lull, though the violence of the rain never\nappeared to diminish; but then, as in some pitched fight between\ncontending hosts, when the fervour of the field seems for a moment to\nallay, fresh squadrons arrive and renew the hottest strife, so a low\nmoaning wind that was now at intervals faintly heard bore up a great\nreserve of electric vapour, that formed, as it were, into field in\nthe space between the Castle and Hellingsley, and then discharged its\nviolence on that fated district.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.\'You must not think of going home\nat present, my dear fellow,\' said the first.\'I am sure your father\nwould not be displeased.There is not a being here who even knows you,\nand if they did, what then?\'The servant entered the room, and inquired whether the gentlemen were\nready for dinner.\'By all means; come, my dear Millbank, I feel reckless as the tempest;\nlet us drown our cares in wine!\'Coningsby, in fact, was exhausted by all the agitation of the day, and\nall the harassing spectres of the future.He found wine a momentary\nsolace.He ordered the servants away, and for a moment felt a degree of\nwild satisfaction in the company of the brother of Edith.Thus they sat for a long time, talking only of one subject, and\nrepeating almost the same things, yet both felt happier in being\ntogether.Oswald had risen, and opening the window, examined the\napproaching night.The storm had lulled, though the rain still fell; in\nthe west was a streak of light.In a quarter of an hour, he calculated\non departing.As he was watching the wind he thought he heard the sound\nof wheels, which reminded him of Coningsby\'s promise to lend him a light\ncarriage for his return.They sat down once more; they had filled their glasses for the last\ntime; to pledge to their faithful friendship, and the happiness of\nConingsby and Edith; when the door of the room opened, and there\nappeared, MR.CHAPTER I.\n\n\nIt was the heart of the London season, nearly four years ago, twelve\nmonths having almost elapsed since the occurrence of those painful\npassages at Hellingsley which closed the last book of this history, and\nlong lines of carriages an hour before midnight, up the classic mount of\nSt.James and along Piccadilly, intimated that the world were received\nat some grand entertainment in Arlington Street.It was the town mansion of the noble family beneath whose roof at\nBeaumanoir we have more than once introduced the reader, to gain whose\ncourtyard was at this moment the object of emulous coachmen, and to\nenter whose saloons was to reward the martyr-like patience of their\nlords and ladies.Among the fortunate who had already succeeded in bowing to their hostess\nwere two gentlemen, who, ensconced in a good position, surveyed the\nscene, and made their observations on the passing guests.They\nwere gentlemen who, to judge from their general air and the great\nconsideration with which they were treated by those who were\noccasionally in their vicinity, were personages whose criticism bore\nauthority.\'I say, Jemmy,\' said the eldest, a dandy who had dined with the Regent,\nbut who was still a dandy, and who enjoyed life almost as much as in the\ndays when Carlton House occupied the terrace which still bears its name.\'I say, Jemmy, what a load of young fellows there are!Begin to think fellows are younger than they used to be.At this moment an individual who came under the fortunate designation\nof a young fellow, but whose assured carriage hardly intimated that\nthis was his first season in London, came up to the junior of the two\ncritics, and said, \'A pretty turn you played us yesterday at White\'s,\nMelton.\'My dear fellow, I am infinitely sorry; but I was obliged to go down to\nWindsor, and I missed the return train.\'A capital party, only you were wanted.We had Beaumanoir and Vere, and\nJack Tufton and Spraggs.\'He told us a story about the\nlittle Biron who was over here last year; I knew her at Paris; and an\nIndian screen.Melton\'s companion, as the young man\nmoved away.A young fellow now of two or three and twenty\nknows the world as men used to do after as many years of scrapes.I\nwonder where there is such a thing as a greenhorn.Effie Crabbs says\nthe reason he gives up his house is, that he has cleaned out the old\ngeneration, and that the new generation would clean him.\'\'Buckhurst is not in that sort of way: he swears by Henry Sydney, a\nyounger son of the Duke, whom you don\'t know; and young Coningsby; a\nsort of new set; new ideas and all that sort of thing.Beau tells me\na good deal about it; and when I was staying with the Everinghams,\nat Easter, they were full of it.Coningsby had just returned from his\ntravels, and they were quite on the _qui vive_.Lady Everingham is one\nof their set.I don\'t know what it is exactly; but I think we shall hear\nmore of it.\'\'A sort of animal magnetism, or unknown tongues, I take it from your\ndescription,\' said his companion.\'Well, I don\'t know what it is,\' said Mr.Melton; \'but it has got hold\nof all the young fellows who have just come out.Beau is a little bit\nhimself.I had some idea of giving my mind to it, they made such a fuss\nabout it at Everingham; but it requires a devilish deal of history, I\nbelieve, and all that sort of thing.\'\'It is difficult to turn to\nwith a new thing when you are not in the habit of it.\'They told me you had the gout,\nCassilis?\'\'So I had; but I have found out a fellow who cures the gout instanter.Pumicestone pills; sort\nof a charm, I believe, and all that kind of thing: they say it rubs the\ngout out of you.I sent him to Luxborough, who was very bad; cured him\ndirectly.\'Luxborough believes in the Millennium,\' said Mr.\'But here\'s a new thing that Melton has been telling me of, that all the\nworld is going to believe in,\' said Mr.Cassilis,\'something patronised\nby Lady Everingham.\'\'A very good patroness,\' said Mr.\'Young\nConingsby brought it from abroad; didn\'t you you say so, Jemmy?\'\'No, no, my dear fellow; it is not at all that sort of thing.\'\'But they say it requires a deuced deal of history,\' continued Mr.\'One must brush up one\'s Goldsmith.Canterton used to be the\nfellow for history at White\'s.He was always boring one with William the\nConqueror, Julius Caesar, and all that sort of thing.\'Ormsby, looking both sly and solemn, \'I\nshould not be surprised if, some day or another, we have a history about\nLady Everingham and young Coningsby.\'Melton; \'he is engaged to be married to her sister, Lady\nTheresa.\'Ormsby; \'well, you are a friend of the family, and\nI suppose you know.\'\'He is a devilish good-looking fellow, that young Coningsby,\' said Mr.\'All the women are in love with him, they say.Lady Eleanor\nDucie quite raves about him.\'\'By-the-bye, his grandfather has been very unwell,\' said Mr.\'I saw Lady Monmouth here just now,\' said Mr.\'Got an odd story at White\'s that Lord Monmouth was going to separate\nfrom her,\' said Mr.\'They are not going to separate, I believe,\' said Mr.Melton; \'but I\nrather think there was a foundation for the rumour.\'Melton, \'all I know is, that it was looked upon\nlast winter at Paris as a settled thing.\'\'There was some story about some Hungarian,\' said Mr.\'No, that blew over,\' said Mr.Melton; \'it was Trautsmansdorff the row\nwas about.\'Ormsby, as the friend of Lord and Lady Monmouth,\nremained shaking his head; but as a member of society, and therefore\ndelighting in small scandal, appropriating the gossip with the greatest\navidity.\'I should think old Monmouth was not the sort of fellow to blow up a\nwoman,\' said Mr.\'Provided she would leave him quietly,\' said Mr.\'Yes, Lord Monmouth never could live with a woman more than two years,\'\nsaid Mr.\'And that I thought at the time rather an\nobjection to his marriage.\'We must now briefly revert to what befell our hero after those unhappy\noccurrences in the midst of whose first woe we left him.Rigby at the Castle, Coningsby quitted\nit for London, and before a week had elapsed had embarked for Cadiz.He\nfelt a romantic interest in visiting the land to which Edith owed some\nblood, and in acquiring the language which he had often admired as she\nspoke it.A favourable opportunity permitted him in the autumn to visit\nAthens and the AEgean, which he much desired.In the pensive beauties\nof that delicate land, where perpetual autumn seems to reign, Coningsby\nfound solace.There is something in the character of Grecian scenery\nwhich blends with the humour of the melancholy and the feelings of\nthe sorrowful.The wish of his\ngrandfather had rendered it necessary for him to return to England\nsomewhat abruptly.Lord Monmouth had not visited his native country\nsince his marriage; but the period that had elapsed since that event had\nconsiderably improved the prospects of his party.The majority of the\nWhig Cabinet in the House of Commons by 1840 had become little more than\nnominal; and though it was circulated among their friends, as if from\nthe highest authority, that \'one was enough,\' there seemed daily a\nbetter chance of their being deprived even of that magical unit.For the\nfirst time in the history of this country since the introduction of the\nsystem of parliamentary sovereignty, the Government of England depended\non the fate of single elections; and indeed, by a single vote, it is\nremarkable to observe, the fate of the Whig Government was ultimately\ndecided.This critical state of affairs, duly reported to Lord Monmouth, revived\nhis political passions, and offered him that excitement which he was\never seeking, and yet for which he had often sighed.The Marquess, too,\nwas weary of Paris.Every day he found it more difficult to be amused.He, from whom nothing could be concealed,\nperceived that often, while she elaborately attempted to divert him, her\nmind was wandering elsewhere.Lord Monmouth was quite superior to all\npetty jealousy and the vulgar feelings of inferior mortals, but his\nsublime selfishness required devotion.He had calculated that a wife\nor a mistress who might be in love with another man, however powerfully\ntheir interests might prompt them, could not be so agreeable or amusing\nto their friends and husbands as if they had no such distracting hold\nupon their hearts or their fancy.Latterly at Paris, while Lucretia\nbecame each day more involved in the vortex of society, where all\nadmired and some adored her, Lord Monmouth fell into the easy habit of\ndining in his private rooms, sometimes tete-a-tete with Villebecque,\nwhose inexhaustible tales and adventures about a kind of society which\nLord Monmouth had always preferred infinitely to the polished and\nsomewhat insipid circles in which he was born, had rendered him the\nprime favourite of his great patron.Sometimes Villebecque, too, brought\na friend, male or otherwise, whom he thought invested with the rare\nfaculty of distraction: Lord Monmouth cared not who or what they were,\nprovided they were diverting.Villebecque had written to Coningsby at Rome, by his grandfather\'s\ndesire, to beg him to return to England and meet Lord Monmouth there.The letter was couched with all the respect and good feeling which\nVillebecque really entertained for him whom he addressed; still a letter\non such a subject from such a person was not agreeable to Coningsby, and\nhis reply to it was direct to his grandfather; Lord Monmouth, however,\nhad entirely given over writing letters.Coningsby had met at Paris, on his way to England, Lord and Lady\nEveringham, and he had returned with them.This revival of an old\nacquaintance was both agreeable and fortunate for our hero.The vivacity\nof a clever and charming woman pleasantly disturbed the brooding memory\nof Coningsby.There is no mortification however keen, no misery however\ndesperate, which the spirit of woman cannot in some degree lighten or\nalleviate.About, too, to make his formal entrance into the great\nworld, he could not have secured a more valuable and accomplished\nfemale friend.She gave him every instruction, every intimation that\nwas necessary; cleared the social difficulties which in some degree are\nexperienced on their entrance into the world even by the most highly\nconnected, unless they have this benign assistance; planted him\nimmediately in the position which was expedient; took care that he was\ninvited at once to the right houses; and, with the aid of her husband,\nthat he should become a member of the right clubs.\'And who is to have the blue ribbon, Lord Eskdale?\'said the Duchess to\nthat nobleman, as he entered and approached to pay his respects.\'If I were Melbourne, I would keep it open,\' replied his Lordship.\'It\nis a mistake to give away too quickly.\'\'But suppose they go out,\' said her Grace.there is always a last day to clear the House.The cliff will not be sapped before then.We made a\nmistake last year about the ladies.\'\'Quarrels about women are always a mistake.One should make it a rule to\ngive up to them, and then they are sure to give up to us.\'\'You have no great faith in our firmness?\'\'Male firmness is very often obstinacy: women have always something\nbetter, worth all qualities; they have tact.\'\'A compliment to the sex from so finished a critic as Lord Eskdale is\nappreciated.\'But at this moment the arrival of some guests terminated the\nconversation, and Lord Eskdale moved away, and approached a group which\nLady Everingham was enlightening.\'My dear Lord Fitz-booby,\' her Ladyship observed, \'in politics we\nrequire faith as well as in all other things.\'Lord Fitz-booby looked rather perplexed; but, possessed of considerable\nofficial experience, having held high posts, some in the cabinet, for\nnearly a quarter of a century, he was too versed to acknowledge that he\nhad not understood a single word that had been addressed to him for the\nlast ten minutes.He looked on with the same grave, attentive stolidity,\noccasionally nodding his head, as he was wont of yore when he received\na deputation on sugar duties or joint-stock banks, and when he made,\nas was his custom when particularly perplexed, an occasional note on a\nsheet of foolscap paper.\'An Opposition in an age of revolution,\' continued Lady Everingham,\n\'must be founded on principles.It cannot depend on mere personal\nability and party address taking advantage of circumstances.You have\nnot enunciated a principle for the last ten years; and when you seemed\non the point of acceding to power, it was not on a great question of\nnational interest, but a technical dispute respecting the constitution\nof an exhausted sugar colony.\'\'If you are a Conservative party, we wish to know what you want to\nconserve,\' said Lord Vere.\'If it had not been for the Whig abolition of slavery,\' said Lord\nFitz-booby, goaded into repartee, \'Jamaica would not have been an\nexhausted sugar colony.\'\'Then what you do want to conserve is slavery?\'\'No,\' said Lord Fitz-booby, \'I am never for retracing our steps.\'\'But will you advance, will you move?And where will you advance, and\nhow will you move?\'\'I think we have had quite enough of advancing,\' said his Lordship.\'I\nhad no idea your Ladyship was a member of the Movement party,\' he added,\nwith a sarcastic grin.\'But if it were bad, Lord Fitz-booby, to move where we are, as you\nand your friends have always maintained, how can you reconcile it to\nprinciple to remain there?\'\'I would make the best of a bad bargain,\' said Lord Fitz-booby.\'With\na Conservative government, a reformed Constitution would be less\ndangerous.\'\'What are your distinctive principles that\nrender the peril less?\'\'I appeal to Lord Eskdale,\' said Lord Fitz-booby; \'there is Lady\nEveringham turned quite a Radical, I declare.Is not your Lordship of\nopinion that the country must be safer with a Conservative government\nthan with a Liberal?\'\'I think the country is always tolerably secure,\' said Lord Eskdale.Lady Theresa, leaning on the arm of Mr.Lyle, came up at this moment,\nand unconsciously made a diversion in favour of Lord Fitz-booby.\'Pray, Theresa,\' said Lady Everingham, \'where is Mr.It so happened that on this day Coningsby\nand Henry Sydney dined at Grillion\'s, at an university club, where,\namong many friends whom Coningsby had not met for a long time, and among\ndelightful reminiscences, the unconscious hours stole on.It was late\nwhen they quitted Grillion\'s, and Coningsby\'s brougham was detained for\na considerable time before its driver could insinuate himself into the\nline, which indeed he would never have succeeded in doing had not he\nfortunately come across the coachman of the Duke of Agincourt, who being\nof the same politics as himself, belonging to the same club, and always\nblack-balling the same men, let him in from a legitimate party feeling;\nso they arrived in Arlington Street at a very late hour.Coningsby was springing up the staircase, now not so crowded as it had\nbeen, and met a retiring party; he was about to say a passing word to a\ngentleman as he went by, when, suddenly, Coningsby turned deadly pale.The gentleman could hardly be the cause, for it was the gracious and\nhandsome presence of Lord Beaumanoir: the lady resting on his arm was\nEdith.They moved on while he was motionless; yet Edith and himself\nhad exchanged glances.His was one of astonishment; but what was the\nexpression of hers?She must have recognised him before he had observed\nher.She was collected, and she expressed the purpose of her mind in\na distant and haughty recognition.Coningsby remained for a moment\nstupefied; then suddenly turning back, he bounded downstairs and hurried\ninto the cloak-room.He met Lady Wallinger; he spoke rapidly, he held\nher hand, did not listen to her answers, his eyes wandered about.There\nwere many persons present, at length he recognised Edith enveloped in\nher mantle.He went forward, he looked at her, as if he would have read\nher soul; he said something.She changed colour as he addressed her,\nbut seemed instantly by an effort to rally and regain her equanimity;\nreplied to his inquiries with extreme brevity, and Lady Wallinger\'s\ncarriage being announced, moved away with the same slight haughty salute\nas before, on the arm of Lord Beaumanoir.Sadness fell over the once happy family of Millbank after the departure\nof Coningsby from Hellingsley.When the first pang was over, Edith\nhad found some solace in the sympathy of her aunt, who had always\nappreciated and admired Coningsby; but it was a sympathy which aspired\nonly to soften sorrow, and not to create hope.But Lady Wallinger,\nthough she lengthened her visit for the sake of her niece, in time\nquitted them; and then the name of Coningsby was never heard by Edith.Her brother, shortly after the sorrowful and abrupt departure of his\nfriend, had gone to the factories, where he remained, and of which, in\nfuture, it was intended that he should assume the principal direction.Millbank himself, sustained at first by the society of his friend\nSir Joseph, to whom he was attached, and occupied with daily reports\nfrom his establishment and the transaction of the affairs with his\nnumerous and busy constituents, was for a while scarcely conscious of\nthe alteration which had taken place in the demeanour of his daughter.But when they were once more alone together, it was impossible any\nlonger to be blind to the great change.That happy and equable gaiety of\nspirit, which seemed to spring from an innocent enjoyment of existence,\nand which had ever distinguished Edith, was wanting.She was not indeed always moody and dispirited, but she was\nfitful, unequal in her tone.That temper whose sweetness had been a\ndomestic proverb had become a little uncertain.Not that her affection\nfor her father was diminished, but there were snatches of unusual\nirritability which momentarily escaped her, followed by bursts of\ntenderness that were the creatures of compunction.And often, after some\nhasty word, she would throw her arms round her father\'s neck with the\nfondness of remorse.She pursued her usual avocations, for she had\nreally too well-regulated a mind, she was in truth a person of\ntoo strong an intellect, to neglect any source of occupation and\ndistraction.Her flowers, her pencil, and her books supplied her with\nthese; and music soothed, and at times beguiled, her agitated thoughts.But there was no joy in the house, and in time Mr.Millbank was vexed, irritated, grieved.Edith, his Edith, the pride\nand delight of his existence, who had been to him only a source of\nexultation and felicity, was no longer happy, was perhaps pining away;\nand there was the appearance, the unjust appearance that he, her fond\nfather, was the cause and occasion of all this wretchedness.It would\nappear that the name of Coningsby, to which he now owed a great debt of\ngratitude, was still doomed to bear him mortification and misery.Truly\nhad the young man said that there was a curse upon their two families.And yet, on reflection, it still seemed to Mr.Millbank that he had\nacted with as much wisdom and real kindness as decision.The union was impossible; the speedier their\nseparation, therefore, clearly the better.Unfortunate, indeed, had been\nhis absence from Hellingsley; unquestionably his presence might have\nprevented the catastrophe.Millbank could not shut his eyes to the devotion of his son to\nConingsby.He felt he could count on no assistance in this respect from\nthat quarter.Yet how hard upon him that he should seem to figure as\na despot or a tyrant to his own children, whom he loved, when he had\nabsolutely acted in an inevitable manner!Edith seemed sad, Oswald\nsullen; all was changed.All the objects for which this clear-headed,\nstrong-minded, kind-hearted man had been working all his life, seemed\nto be frustrated.Because a young man had made love to his\ndaughter, who was really in no manner entitled to do so.Millbank found Hellingsley, under existing\ncircumstances, extremely wearisome; and he proposed to his daughter that\nthey should pay a visit to their earlier home.Edith assented without\ndifficulty, but without interest.Millbank immediately\nperceived, the change was a judicious one; for certainly the spirits\nof Edith seemed to improve after her return to their valley.There were\nmore objects of interest: change, too, is always beneficial.Millbank had been aware that Oswald had received a letter from\nConingsby, written before he quitted Spain, perhaps he might have\nrecognised a more satisfactory reason for the transient liveliness of\nhis daughter which had so greatly gratified him.About a month after Christmas, the meeting of Parliament summoned Mr.Millbank up to London; and he had wished Edith to accompany him.But\nLondon in February to Edith, without friends or connections, her father\nalways occupied and absent from her day and night, seemed to them\nall, on reflection, to be a life not very conducive to health or\ncheerfulness, and therefore she remained with her brother.Oswald had\nheard from Coningsby again from Rome; but at the period he wrote he did\nnot anticipate his return to England.His tone was affectionate, but\ndispirited.Lady Wallinger went up to London after Easter for the season, and Mr.Millbank, now that there was a constant companion for his daughter, took\na house and carried Edith back with him to London.Lady Wallinger,\nwho had great wealth and great tact, had obtained by degrees a\nnot inconsiderable position in society.She had a fine house in a\nfashionable situation, and gave profuse entertainments.The Whigs\nwere under obligations to her husband, and the great Whig ladies were\ngratified to find in his wife a polished and pleasing person, to whom\nthey could be courteous without any annoyance.So that Edith, under the\nauspices of her aunt, found herself at once in circles which otherwise\nshe might not easily have entered, but which her beauty, grace, and\nexperience of the most refined society of the Continent, qualified\nher to shine in.One evening they met the Marquis of Beaumanoir, their\nfriend of Rome and Paris, and admirer of Edith, who from that time was\nseldom from their side.His mother, the Duchess, immediately called both\non the Millbanks and the Wallingers; glad, not only to please her son,\nbut to express that consideration for Mr.Millbank which the Duke always\nwished to show.It was, however, of no use; nothing would induce Mr.Millbank ever to enter what he called aristocratic society.He liked the\nHouse of Commons; never paired off; never missed a moment of it; worked\nat committees all the morning, listened attentively to debates all the\nnight; always dined at Bellamy\'s when there was a house; and when there\nwas not, liked dining at the Fishmongers\' Company, the Russia Company,\ngreat Emigration banquets, and other joint-stock festivities.That was\nhis idea of rational society; business and pleasure combined; a good\ndinner, and good speeches afterwards.Edith was aware that Coningsby had returned to England, for her brother\nhad heard from him on his arrival; but Oswald had not heard since.A season in London only represented in the mind of Edith the chance,\nperhaps the certainty, of meeting Coningsby again; of communing together\nover the catastrophe of last summer; of soothing and solacing each\nother\'s unhappiness, and perhaps, with the sanguine imagination of\nyouth, foreseeing a more felicitous future.She had been nearly a\nfortnight in town, and though moving frequently in the same circles as\nConingsby, they had not yet met.It was one of those results which\ncould rarely occur; but even chance enters too frequently in the\nleague against lovers.The invitation to the assembly at ---- House was\ntherefore peculiarly gratifying to Edith, since she could scarcely\ndoubt that if Coningsby were in town, which her casual inquiries of Lord\nBeaumanoir induced her to believe was the case, he would be present.Never, therefore, had she repaired to an assembly with such a flattering\nspirit; and yet there was a fascinating anxiety about it that bewilders\nthe young heart.In vain Edith surveyed the rooms to catch the form of that being, whom\nfor a moment she had never ceased to cherish and muse over.He was not\nthere; and at the very moment when, disappointed and mortified, she most\nrequired solace, she learned from Mr.Melton that Lady Theresa Sydney,\nwhom she chanced to admire, was going to be married, and to Mr.His silence, perhaps his shunning of her were no\nlonger inexplicable.What a return for all her romantic devotion in her\nsad solitude at Hellingsley.Was this the end of their twilight rambles,\nand the sweet pathos of their mutual loves?There seemed to be no truth\nin man, no joy in life!All the feelings that she had so generously\nlavished, all returned upon herself.She could have burst into a passion\nof tears and buried herself in a cloister.Instead of that, civilisation made her listen with a serene though\ntortured countenance; but as soon as it was in her power, pleading a\nheadache to Lady Wallinger, she effected, or thought she had effected,\nher escape from a scene which harrowed her heart.As for Coningsby, he passed a sleepless night, agitated by the\nunexpected presence of Edith and distracted by the manner in which\nshe had received him.To say that her appearance had revived all his\npassionate affection for her would convey an unjust impression of the\nnature of his feelings.His affection had never for a moment swerved; it\nwas profound and firm.But unquestionably this sudden vision had brought\nbefore him, in startling and more vivid colours, the relations that\nsubsisted between them.There was the being whom he loved and who loved\nhim; and whatever were the barriers which the circumstances of life\nplaced against their union, they were partakers of the solemn sacrament\nof an unpolluted heart.Coningsby, as we have mentioned, had signified to Oswald his return to\nEngland: he had hitherto omitted to write again; not because his spirit\nfaltered, but he was wearied of whispering hope without foundation, and\nmourning over his chagrined fortunes.Once more in England, once more\nplaced in communication with his grandfather, he felt with increased\nconviction the difficulties which surrounded him.The society of Lady\nEveringham and her sister, who had been at the same time her visitor,\nhad been a relaxation, and a beneficial one, to a mind suffering\ntoo much from the tension of one idea.But Coningsby had treated the\nmatrimonial project of his gay-minded hostess with the courteous levity\nin which he believed it had first half originated.He admired and liked\nLady Theresa; but there was a reason why he should not marry her, even\nhad his own heart not been absorbed by one of those passions from which\nmen of deep and earnest character never emancipate themselves.After musing and meditating again and again over everything that had\noccurred, Coningsby fell asleep when the morning had far advanced,\nresolved to rise when a little refreshed and find out Lady Wallinger,\nwho, he felt sure, would receive him with kindness.Yet it was fated that this step should not be taken, for while he was\nat breakfast, his servant brought him a letter from Monmouth House,\napprising him that his grandfather wished to see him as soon as possible\non urgent business.Lord Monmouth was sitting in the same dressing-room in which he was\nfirst introduced to the reader; on the table were several packets of\npapers that were open and in course of reference; and he dictated his\nobservations to Monsieur Villebecque, who was writing at his left hand.Thus were they occupied when Coningsby was ushered into the room.\'You see, Harry,\' said Lord Monmouth, \'that I am much occupied to-day,\nyet the business on which I wish to communicate with you is so pressing\nthat it could not be postponed.\'He made a sign to Villebecque, and his\nsecretary instantly retired.\'I was right in pressing your return to England,\' continued Lord\nMonmouth to his grandson, who was a little anxious as to the impending\ncommunication, which he could not in any way anticipate.\'These are not\ntimes when young men should be out of sight.You may be astonished, but\nit is a fact.They are going to dissolve their own House of Commons.Notwithstanding this and the Queen\'s name, we can beat them; but the\nrace requires the finest jockeying.Tadpole has\nbeen here to me about Darlford; he came specially with a message, I may\nsay an appeal, from one to whom I can refuse nothing; the Government\ncount on the seat, though with the new Registration \'tis nearly a tie.If we had a good candidate we could win.He is too\nmuch of the old clique; used up; a hack; besides, a beaten horse.We are\nassured the name of Coningsby would be a host; there is a considerable\nsection who support the present fellow who will not vote against a\nConingsby.They have thought of you as a fit person, and I have approved\nof the suggestion.You will, therefore, be the candidate for Darlford\nwith my entire sanction and support, and I have no doubt you will be\nsuccessful.You may be sure I shall spare nothing: and it will be very\ngratifying to me, after being robbed of all our boroughs, that the only\nConingsby who cares to enter Parliament, should nevertheless be able to\ndo so as early as I could fairly desire.\'Millbank on the hustings of Darlford!The fierce passions,\nthe gross insults, the hot blood and the cool lies, the ruffianism and\nthe ribaldry, perhaps the domestic discomfiture and mortification, which\nhe was about to be the means of bringing on the roof he loved best\nin the world, occurred to him with anguish.The countenance of\nEdith, haughty and mournful last night, rose to him again.He saw her\ncanvassing for her father, and against him.And for what was\nhe to make this terrible and costly sacrifice For his ambition?Not even\nfor that Divinity or Daemon for which we all immolate so much!Mighty\nambition, forsooth, to succeed to the Rigbys!To enter the House of\nCommons a slave and a tool; to move according to instructions, and\nto labour for the low designs of petty spirits, without even the\nconsolation of being a dupe.What sympathy could there exist between\nConingsby and the \'great Conservative party,\' that for ten years in\nan age of revolution had never promulgated a principle; whose only\nintelligible and consistent policy seemed to be an attempt, very\ngrateful of course to the feelings of an English Royalist, to revive\nIrish Puritanism; who when in power in 1835 had used that power only to\nevince their utter ignorance of Church principles; and who were at this\nmoment, when Coningsby was formally solicited to join their ranks, in\nopen insurrection against the prerogatives of the English Monarchy?\'Do you anticipate then an immediate dissolution, sir?\'inquired\nConingsby after a moment\'s pause.\'We must anticipate it; though I think it doubtful.It may be next\nmonth; it may be in the autumn; they may tide over another year, as Lord\nEskdale thinks, and his opinion always weighs with me.Tadpole believes they will dissolve at once.But whether they dissolve\nnow, or in a month\'s time, or in the autumn, or next year, our course\nis clear.Monday next, there is a great Conservative dinner at Darlford.You\nmust attend it; that will be the finest opportunity in the world for you\nto announce yourself.\'\'Don\'t you think, sir,\' said Coningsby, \'that such an announcement would\nbe rather premature?It is, in fact, embarking in a contest which may\nlast a year; perhaps more.\'\'What you say is very true,\' said Lord Monmouth; \'no doubt it is very\ntroublesome; very disgusting; any canvassing is.But we must take things\nas we find them.You cannot get into Parliament now in the good old\ngentlemanlike way; and we ought to be thankful that this interest has\nbeen fostered for our purpose.\'Coningsby looked on the carpet, cleared his throat as if about to speak,\nand then gave something like a sigh.\'I think you had better be off the day after to-morrow,\' said Lord\nMonmouth.\'I have sent instructions to the steward to do all he can in\nso short a time, for I wish you to entertain the principal people.\'\'You are most kind, you are always most kind to me, dear sir,\' said\nConingsby, in a hesitating tone, and with an air of great embarrassment,\n\'but, in truth, I have no wish to enter Parliament.\'\'I feel that I am not sufficiently prepared for so great a\nresponsibility as a seat in the House of Commons,\' said Coningsby.How can any one have a more agreeable seat?The only person to\nwhom you are responsible is your own relation, who brings you in.And I\ndon\'t suppose there can be any difference on any point between us.You\nare certainly still young; but I was younger by nearly two years when\nI first went in; and I found no difficulty.All you have got to do is to vote with your party.As for speaking, if\nyou have a talent that way, take my advice; don\'t be in a hurry.Learn\nto know the House; learn the House to know you.If a man be discreet, he\ncannot enter Parliament too soon.\'\'It is not exactly that, sir,\' said Coningsby.\'Then what is it, my dear Harry?You see to-day I have much to do; yet\nas your business is pressing, I would not postpone seeing you an hour.I\nthought you would have been very much gratified.\'\'You mentioned that I had nothing to do but to vote with my party, sir,\'\nreplied Coningsby.\'You mean, of course, by that term what is understood\nby the Conservative party.\'\'I am sorry,\' said Coningsby, rather pale, but speaking with firmness,\n\'I am sorry that I could not support the Conservative party.\'exclaimed Lord Monmouth, starting in his seat,\'some woman\nhas got hold of him, and made him a Whig!\'\'No, my dear grandfather,\' said Coningsby, scarcely able to repress a\nsmile, serious as the interview was becoming, \'nothing of the kind, I\nassure you.No person can be more anti-Whig.\'\'I don\'t know what you are driving at, sir,\' said Lord Monmouth, in a\nhard, dry tone.\'I wish to be frank, sir,\' said Coningsby, \'and am very sensible of your\ngoodness in permitting me to speak to you on the subject.What I mean to\nsay is, that I have for a long time looked upon the Conservative party\nas a body who have betrayed their trust; more from ignorance, I admit,\nthan from design; yet clearly a body of individuals totally unequal\nto the exigencies of the epoch, and indeed unconscious of its real\ncharacter.\'\'Well, between ourselves, I am quite of the same opinion.But we must\nmount higher; we must go to \'28 for the real mischief.But what is the\nuse of lamenting the past?Peel is the only man; suited to the times and\nall that; at least we must say so, and try to believe so; we can\'t go\nback.And it is our own fault that we have let the chief power out of\nthe hands of our own order.It was never thought of in the time of your\ngreat-grandfather, sir.And if a commoner were for a season permitted\nto be the nominal Premier to do the detail, there was always a secret\ncommittee of great 1688 nobles to give him his instructions.\'\'I should be very sorry to see secret committees of great 1688 nobles\nagain,\' said Coningsby.\'Then what the devil do you want to see?\'\'Political faith,\' said Coningsby, \'instead of political infidelity.\'\'Before I support Conservative principles,\' continued Coningsby, \'I\nmerely wish to be informed what those principles aim to conserve.It\nwould not appear to be the prerogative of the Crown, since the principal\nportion of a Conservative oration now is an invective against a late\nroyal act which they describe as a Bed-chamber plot.Is it the Church\nwhich they wish to conserve?What is a threatened Appropriation Clause\nagainst an actual Church Commission in the hands of Parliamentary\nLaymen?Well, then, if it\nis neither the Crown nor the Church, whose rights and privileges this\nConservative party propose to vindicate, is it your House, the House\nof Lords, whose powers they are prepared to uphold?Is it not notorious\nthat the very man whom you have elected as your leader in that House,\ndeclares among his Conservative adherents, that henceforth the assembly\nthat used to furnish those very Committees of great revolution nobles\nthat you mention, is to initiate nothing; and, without a struggle, is\nto subside into that undisturbed repose which resembles the Imperial\ntranquillity that secured the frontiers by paying tribute?\'\'All this is vastly fine,\' said Lord Monmouth; \'but I see no means by\nwhich I can attain my object but by supporting Peel.After all, what is\nthe end of all parties and all politics?I want to\nturn our coronet into a ducal one, and to get your grandmother\'s barony\ncalled out of abeyance in your favour.It is impossible that Peel can\nrefuse me.I have already purchased an ample estate with the view\nof entailing it on you and your issue.You will make a considerable\nalliance; you may marry, if you please, Lady Theresa Sydney.Count on my at once entering into any arrangement\nconducive to your happiness.\'\'My dear grandfather, you have ever been to me only too kind and\ngenerous.\'\'To whom should I be kind but to you, my own blood, that has never\ncrossed me, and of whom I have reason to be proud?Yes, Harry, it\ngratifies me to hear you admired and to learn your success.All I want\nnow is to see you in Parliament.There is a sort of stiffness about every man, no matter what may be his\ntalents, who enters Parliament late in life; and now, fortunately, the\noccasion offers.You will go down on Friday; feed the notabilities\nwell; speak out; praise Peel; abuse O\'Connell and the ladies of the\nBed-chamber; anathematise all waverers; say a good deal about Ireland;\nstick to the Irish Registration Bill, that\'s a good card; and, above\nall, my dear Harry, don\'t spare that fellow Millbank.Remember, in\nturning him out you not only gain a vote for the Conservative cause\nand our coronet, but you crush my foe.Spare nothing for that object; I\ncount on you, boy.\'\'I should grieve to be backward in anything that concerned your\ninterest or your honour, sir,\' said Coningsby, with an air of great\nembarrassment.\'I am sure you would, I am sure you would,\' said Lord Monmouth, in a\ntone of some kindness.\'And I feel at this moment,\' continued Coningsby, \'that there is no\npersonal sacrifice which I am not prepared to make for them, except one.My interests, my affections, they should not be placed in the balance,\nif yours, sir, were at stake, though there are circumstances which might\ninvolve me in a position of as much mental distress as a man could well\nendure; but I claim for my convictions, my dear grandfather, a generous\ntolerance.\'\'I can\'t follow you, sir,\' said Lord Monmouth, again in his hard tone.\'Our interests are inseparable, and therefore there can never be\nany sacrifice of conduct on your part.What you mean by sacrifice of\naffections, I don\'t comprehend; but as for your opinions, you have no\nbusiness to have any other than those I uphold.\'I am sure I wish to express them with no unbecoming confidence,\'\nreplied Coningsby; \'I have never intruded them on your ear before;\nbut this being an occasion when you yourself said, sir, I was about\nto commence my public career, I confess I thought it was my duty to be\nfrank; I would not entail on myself long years of mortification by one\nof those ill-considered entrances into political life which so many\npublic men have cause to deplore.\'\'You go with your family, sir, like a gentleman; you are not to consider\nyour opinions, like a philosopher or a political adventurer.\'\'Yes, sir,\' said Coningsby, with animation, \'but men going with their\nfamilies like gentlemen, and losing sight of every principle on which\nthe society of this country ought to be established, produced the Reform\nBill.\'said Lord Monmouth; \'if the Duke had not\nquarrelled with Lord Grey on a Coal Committee, we should never have had\nthe Reform Bill.\'You are in as great peril now as you were in 1830,\' said Coningsby.\'No, no, no,\' said Lord Monmouth; \'the Tory party is organised now; they\nwill not catch us napping again: these Conservative Associations have\ndone the business.\'\'At the best to turn\nout the Whigs.And when you have turned out the Whigs, what then?You\nmay get your ducal coronet, sir.But a duke now is not so great a man\nas a baron was but a century back.We cannot struggle against the\nirresistible stream of circumstances.Power has left our order; this is\nnot an age for factitious aristocracy.As for my grandmother\'s barony, I\nshould look upon the termination of its abeyance in my favour as the\nact of my political extinction.What we want, sir, is not to fashion\nnew dukes and furbish up old baronies, but to establish great principles\nwhich may maintain the realm and secure the happiness of the people.Let\nme see authority once more honoured; a solemn reverence again the habit\nof our lives; let me see property acknowledging, as in the old days\nof faith, that labour is his twin brother, and that the essence of all\ntenure is the performance of duty; let results such as these be brought\nabout, and let me participate, however feebly, in the great fulfilment,\nand public life then indeed becomes a noble career, and a seat in\nParliament an enviable distinction.\'\'I tell you what it is, Harry,\' said Lord Monmouth, very drily,\'members\nof this family may think as they like, but they must act as I please.You must go down on Friday to Darlford and declare yourself a candidate\nfor the town, or I shall reconsider our mutual positions.I would say,\nyou must go to-morrow; but it is only courteous to Rigby to give him a\nprevious intimation of your movement.I\nsent for Rigby this morning on other business which now occupies me, and\nfind he is out of town.He will return to-morrow; and will be here at\nthree o\'clock, when you can meet him.You will meet him, I doubt not,\nlike a man of sense,\' added Lord Monmouth, looking at Coningsby with a\nglance such as he had never before encountered, \'who is not prepared to\nsacrifice all the objects of life for the pursuit of some fantastical\npuerilities.\'His Lordship rang a bell on his table for Villebecque; and to prevent\nany further conversation, resumed his papers.It would have been difficult for any person, unconscious of crime,\nto have felt more dejected than Coningsby when he rode out of the\ncourt-yard of Monmouth House.The love of Edith would have consoled\nhim for the destruction of his prosperity; the proud fulfilment of his\nambition might in time have proved some compensation for his crushed\naffections; but his present position seemed to offer no single source\nof solace.There came over him that irresistible conviction that is at\ntimes the dark doom of all of us, that the bright period of our life is\npast; that a future awaits us only of anxiety, failure, mortification,\ndespair; that none of our resplendent visions can ever be realised:\nand that we add but one more victim to the long and dreary catalogue of\nbaffled aspirations.Nor could he indeed by any combination see the means to extricate\nhimself from the perils that were encompassing him.There was something\nabout his grandfather that defied persuasion.Prone as eloquent\nyouth generally is to believe in the resistless power of its appeals,\nConingsby despaired at once of ever moving Lord Monmouth.There had been\na callous dryness in his manner, an unswerving purpose in his spirit,\nthat at once baffled all attempts at influence.Nor could Coningsby\nforget the look he received when he quitted the room.There was no\npossibility of mistaking it; it said at once, without periphrasis,\n\'Cross my purpose, and I will crush you!\'This was the moment when the sympathy, if not the counsels, of\nfriendship might have been grateful.A clever woman might have afforded\neven more than sympathy; some happy device that might have even released\nhim from the mesh in which he was involved.And once Coningsby had\nturned his horse\'s head to Park Lane to call on Lady Everingham.But\nsurely if there were a sacred secret in the world, it was the one which\nsubsisted between himself and Edith.Then there was Lady Wallinger; he could at least speak with freedom to\nher.He looked in for a moment at a club\nto take up the \'Court Guide\' and find her direction.A few men were\nstanding in a bow window.Cassilis say,\n\n\'So Beau, they say, is booked at last; the new beauty, have you heard?\'\'I saw him very sweet on her last night,\' rejoined his companion.\'Deuced deal, they say,\' replied Mr.The father is a cotton\nlord, and they all have loads of tin, you know.\'He is in Parliament, is not he?\'\'\'Gad, I believe he is,\' said Mr.Cassilis; \'I never know who is in\nParliament in these days.I remember when there were only ten men in the\nHouse of Commons who were not either members of Brookes\' or this place.\'I hear \'tis an old affair of Beau,\' said another gentleman.\'It was all\ndone a year ago at Rome or Paris.\'\'They say she refused him then,\' said Mr.\'Well, that is tolerably cool for a manufacturer\'s daughter,\' said his\nfriend.\'The Duke will be deuced glad to see Beau settled, I take it,\' said Mr.\'A good deal depends on the tin,\' said his friend.Coningsby threw down the \'Court Guide\' with a sinking heart.In spite\nof every insuperable difficulty, hitherto the end and object of all his\naspirations and all his exploits, sometimes even almost unconsciously\nto himself, was Edith.The strange manner of last night was\nfatally explained.The heart that once had been his was now another\'s.To the man who still loves there is in that conviction the most profound\nand desolate sorrow of which our nature is capable.All the recollection\nof the past, all the once-cherished prospects of the future, blend into\none bewildering anguish.Coningsby quitted the club, and mounting his\nhorse, rode rapidly out of town, almost unconscious of his direction.He found himself at length in a green lane near Willesden, silent and\nundisturbed; he pulled up his horse, and summoned all his mind to the\ncontemplation of his prospects.Now, should he return to his grandfather, accept his\nmission, and go down to Darlford on Friday?Favour and fortune, power,\nprosperity, rank, distinction would be the consequence of this step;\nmight not he add even vengeance?Was there to be no term to his\nendurance?Might not he teach this proud, prejudiced manufacturer, with\nall his virulence and despotic caprices, a memorable lesson?And his\ndaughter, too, this betrothed, after all, of a young noble, with her\nflush futurity of splendour and enjoyment, was she to hear of him only,\nif indeed she heard of him at all, as of one toiling or trifling in the\nhumbler positions of existence; and wonder, with a blush, that he ever\ncould have been the hero of her romantic girlhood?His cheek burnt at the possibility of such ignominy!It was a conjuncture in his life that required decision.He thought of\nhis companions who looked up to him with such ardent anticipations of\nhis fame, of delight in his career, and confidence in his leading; were\nall these high and fond fancies to be balked?On the very threshold of\nlife was he to blunder?\'Tis the first step that leads to all, and\nhis was to be a wilful error.He remembered his first visit to his\ngrandfather, and the delight of his friends at Eton at his report on his\nreturn.After eight years of initiation was he to lose that favour then\nso highly prized, when the results which they had so long counted on\nwere on the very eve of accomplishment?Parliament and riches, and rank\nand power; these were facts, realities, substances, that none could\nmistake.Was he to sacrifice them for speculations, theories, shadows,\nperhaps the vapours of a green and conceited brain?He was like Caesar by the starry river\'s side, watching the image of the\nplanets on its fatal waters.The sun set; the twilight spell fell upon his soul; the exaltation\nof his spirit died away.Beautiful thoughts, full of sweetness and\ntranquillity and consolation, came clustering round his heart like\nseraphs.He thought of Edith in her hours of fondness; he thought of\nthe pure and solemn moments when to mingle his name with the heroes of\nhumanity was his aspiration, and to achieve immortal fame the inspiring\npurpose of his life.What were the tawdry accidents of vulgar ambition\nto him?No domestic despot could deprive him of his intellect, his\nknowledge, the sustaining power of an unpolluted conscience.If he\npossessed the intelligence in which he had confidence, the world\nwould recognise his voice even if not placed upon a pedestal.If the\nprinciples of his philosophy were true, the great heart of the nation\nwould respond to their expression.Coningsby felt at this moment a\nprofound conviction which never again deserted him, that the conduct\nwhich would violate the affections of the heart, or the dictates of the\nconscience, however it may lead to immediate success, is a fatal error.Conscious that he was perhaps verging on some painful vicissitude of his\nlife, he devoted himself to a love that seemed hopeless, and to a fame\nthat was perhaps a dream.It was under the influence of these solemn resolutions that he wrote,\non his return home, a letter to Lord Monmouth, in which he expressed\nall that affection which he really felt for his grandfather, and all\nthe pangs which it cost him to adhere to the conclusions he had already\nannounced.In terms of tenderness, and even humility, he declined to\nbecome a candidate for Darlford, or even to enter Parliament, except as\nthe master of his own conduct.CHAPTER V.\n\n\nLady Monmouth was reclining on a sofa in that beautiful boudoir which\nhad been fitted up under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, but as he\nthen believed for the Princess Colonna.The walls were hung with amber\nsatin, painted by Delaroche with such subjects as might be expected from\nhis brilliant and picturesque pencil.Fair forms, heroes and heroines\nin dazzling costume, the offspring of chivalry merging into what is\ncommonly styled civilisation, moved in graceful or fantastic groups amid\npalaces and gardens.The ceiling, carved in the deep honeycomb fashion\nof the Saracens, was richly gilt and picked out in violet.Upon a violet\ncarpet of velvet was represented the marriage of Cupid and Psyche.It was about two hours after Coningsby had quitted Monmouth House, and\nFlora came in, sent for by Lady Monmouth as was her custom, to read to\nher as she was employed with some light work.\'\'Tis a new book of Sue,\' said Lucretia.Flora, seated by her side, began to read.Reading was an accomplishment\nwhich distinguished Flora; but to-day her voice faltered, her expression\nwas uncertain; she seemed but imperfectly to comprehend her page.More\nthan once Lady Monmouth looked round at her with an inquisitive glance.madam,\' she at last exclaimed, \'if you would but speak to Mr.said Lady Monmouth, turning quickly on the sofa; then,\ncollecting herself in an instant, she continued with less abruptness,\nand more suavity than usual, \'Tell me, Flora, what is it; what is the\nmatter?\'\'My Lord,\' sobbed Flora, \'has quarrelled with Mr.An expression of eager interest came over the countenance of Lucretia.\'I do not know they have quarrelled; it is not, perhaps, a right term;\nbut my Lord is very angry with Mr.\'Not very angry, I should think, Flora; and about what?\'very angry, madam,\' said Flora, shaking her head mournfully.\'My\nLord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr.Coningsby would never enter\nthe house again.\'Coningsby has only left this hour or two.He will not\ndo what my Lord wishes, about some seat in the Chamber.I do not know\nexactly what it is; but my Lord is in one of his moods of terror: my\nfather is frightened even to go into his room when he is so.\'Coningsby came, and he found that Mr.Lady Monmouth rose from her sofa, and walked once or twice up and down\nthe room.Then turning to Flora, she said, \'Go away now: the book is\nstupid; it does not amuse me.Stop: find out all you can for me about\nthe quarrel before I speak to Mr.Lucretia remained for some time in meditation;\nthen she wrote a few lines, which she despatched at once to Mr.What a great man was the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby!Here was one\nof the first peers of England, and one of the finest ladies in London,\nboth waiting with equal anxiety his return to town; and unable to\ntransact two affairs of vast importance, yet wholly unconnected, without\nhis interposition!What was the secret of the influence of this man,\nconfided in by everybody, trusted by none?His counsels were not deep,\nhis expedients were not felicitous; he had no feeling, and he could\ncreate no sympathy.It is that, in most of the transactions of life,\nthere is some portion which no one cares to accomplish, and which\neverybody wishes to be achieved.In the eye of the world he had constantly the appearance of being\nmixed up with high dealings, and negotiations and arrangements of fine\nmanagement, whereas in truth, notwithstanding his splendid livery and\nthe airs he gave himself in the servants\' hall, his real business in\nlife had ever been, to do the dirty work.Rigby had been shut up much at his villa of late.He was concocting,\nyou could not term it composing, an article, a\'very slashing article,\'\nwhich was to prove that the penny postage must be the destruction of the\naristocracy.It was a grand subject, treated in his highest style.His\nparallel portraits of Rowland Hill the conqueror of Almarez and Rowland\nHill the deviser of the cheap postage were enormously fine.It was full\nof passages in italics, little words in great capitals, and almost drew\ntears.The statistical details also were highly interesting and novel.Several of the old postmen, both twopenny and general, who had been in\noffice with himself, and who were inspired with an equal zeal against\nthat spirit of reform of which they had alike been victims, supplied him\nwith information which nothing but a breach of ministerial duty could\nhave furnished.The prophetic peroration as to the irresistible progress\nof democracy was almost as powerful as one of Rigby\'s speeches on\nAldborough or Amersham.There never was a fellow for giving a good\nhearty kick to the people like Rigby.Himself sprung from the dregs of\nthe populace, this was disinterested.What could be more patriotic and\nmagnanimous than his Jeremiads over the fall of the Montmorencis and the\nCrillons, or the possible catastrophe of the Percys and the Manners!The\ntruth of all this hullabaloo was that Rigby had a sly pension which,\nby an inevitable association of ideas, he always connected with the\nmaintenance of an aristocracy.All his rigmarole dissertations on the\nFrench revolution were impelled by this secret influence; and when he\nwailed over \'la guerre aux chateaux,\' and moaned like a mandrake over\nNottingham Castle in flames, the rogue had an eye all the while to\nquarter-day!Arriving in town the day after Coningsby\'s interview with his\ngrandfather, Mr.Rigby found a summons to Monmouth House waiting him,\nand an urgent note from Lucretia begging that he would permit nothing\nto prevent him seeing her for a few minutes before he called on the\nMarquess.Lucretia, acting on the unconscious intimation of Flora, had in the\ncourse of four-and-twenty hours obtained pretty ample and accurate\ndetails of the cause of contention between Coningsby and her husband.Rigby not only that Lord Monmouth was\nhighly incensed against his grandson, but that the cause of their\nmisunderstanding arose about a seat in the House of Commons, and that\nseat too the one which Mr.Rigby had long appropriated to himself,\nand over whose registration he had watched with such affectionate\nsolicitude.Lady Monmouth arranged this information like a firstrate artist, and\ngave it a grouping and a colour which produced the liveliest effect\nupon her confederate.The countenance of Rigby was almost ghastly as\nhe received the intelligence; a grin, half of malice, half of terror,\nplayed over his features.\'I told you to beware of him long ago,\' said Lady Monmouth.\'He is, he\nhas ever been, in the way of both of us.\'\'He is in my power,\' said Rigby.\'He is in love with the daughter of Millbank, the man who bought\nHellingsley.\'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, in a prolonged tone.\'He was at Coningsby all last summer, hanging about her.I found the\nyounger Millbank quite domiciliated at the Castle; a fact which, of\nitself, if known to Lord Monmouth, would ensure the lad\'s annihilation.\'\'And you kept this fine news for a winter campaign, my good Mr.Rigby,\'\nsaid Lady Monmouth, with a subtle smile.\'The time is not always ripe,\' said Mr.Let us not conceal it from ourselves that,\nsince his first visit to Coningsby, we have neither of us really been in\nthe same position which we then occupied, or believed we should occupy.My Lord, though you would scarcely believe it, has a weakness for this\nboy; and though I by my marriage, and you by your zealous ability,\nhave apparently secured a permanent hold upon his habits, I have never\ndoubted that when the crisis comes we shall find that the golden fruit\nis plucked by one who has not watched the garden.There is\nno reason why we two should clash together: we can both of us find what\nwe want, and more securely if we work in company.\'\'I trust my devotion to you has never been doubted, dear madam.\'Rid\nme of this Coningsby, and I will secure you all that you want.\'It shall be done,\' said Rigby; \'it must be done.If once the notion\ngets wind that one of the Castle family may perchance stand for\nDarlford, all the present combinations will be disorganised.\'So I hear for certain,\' said Lucretia.\'Be sure there is no time to\nlose.What does he want with you to-day?\'\'I know not: there are so many things.\'\'To be sure; and yet I cannot doubt he will speak of this quarrel.Whatever his mood, the subject may be\nintroduced.If good, you will guide him more easily; if dark, the love\nfor the Hellingsley girl, the fact of the brother being in his castle,\ndrinking his wine, riding his horses, ordering about his servants; you\nwill omit no details: a Millbank quite at home at Coningsby will lash\nhim to madness!Go,\ngo, or he may hear that you have arrived.I shall be at home all the\nmorning.It will be but gallant that you should pay me a little visit\nwhen you have transacted your business._Au revoir!_\'\n\nLady Monmouth took up again her French novel; but her eyes soon glanced\nover the page, unattached by its contents.Her own existence was too\ninteresting to find any excitement in fiction.It was nearly three years\nsince her marriage; that great step which she ever had a conviction was\nto lead to results still greater.Of late she had often been filled with\na presentiment that they were near at hand; never more so than on\nthis day.Irresistible was the current of associations that led her to\nmeditate on freedom, wealth, power; on a career which should at the same\ntime dazzle the imagination and gratify her heart.Notwithstanding the\ngossip of Paris, founded on no authentic knowledge of her husband\'s\ncharacter or information, based on the haphazard observations of the\nfloating multitude, Lucretia herself had no reason to fear that her\ninfluence over Lord Monmouth, if exerted, was materially diminished.But\nsatisfied that he had formed no other tie, with her ever the test of\nher position, she had not thought it expedient, and certainly would have\nfound it irksome, to maintain that influence by any ostentatious means.She knew that Lord Monmouth was capricious, easily wearied, soon palled;\nand that on men who have no affections, affection has no hold.Their\npassions or their fancies, on the contrary, as it seemed to her, are\nrather stimulated by neglect or indifference, provided that they are not\nsystematic; and the circumstance of a wife being admired by one who is\nnot her husband sometimes wonderfully revives the passion or renovates\nthe respect of him who should be devoted to her.The health of Lord Monmouth was the subject which never was long absent\nfrom the vigilance or meditation of Lucretia.She was well assured that\nhis life was no longer secure.She knew that after their marriage he had\nmade a will, which secured to her a large portion of his great wealth in\ncase of their having no issue, and after the accident at Paris all\nhope in that respect was over.Recently the extreme anxiety which Lord\nMonmouth had evinced about terminating the abeyance of the barony to\nwhich his first wife was a co-heiress in favour of his grandson, had\nalarmed Lucretia.To establish in the land another branch of the house\nof Coningsby was evidently the last excitement of Lord Monmouth, and\nperhaps a permanent one.If the idea were once accepted, notwithstanding\nthe limit to its endowment which Lord Monmouth might at the first start\ncontemplate, Lucretia had sufficiently studied his temperament to be\nconvinced that all his energies and all his resources would ultimately\nbe devoted to its practical fulfilment.Her original prejudice against\nConingsby and jealousy of his influence had therefore of late been\nconsiderably aggravated; and the intelligence that for the first time\nthere was a misunderstanding between Coningsby and her husband filled\nher with excitement and hope.She knew her Lord well enough to feel\nassured that the cause for displeasure in the present instance could not\nbe a light one; she resolved instantly to labour that it should not\nbe transient; and it so happened that she had applied for aid in this\nendeavour to the very individual in whose power it rested to accomplish\nall her desire, while in doing so he felt at the same time he was\ndefending his own position and advancing his own interests.Daniel moved to the bathroom.Lady Monmouth was now waiting with some excitement the return of Mr.His interview with his patron was of unusual length.An hour, and\nmore than an hour, had elapsed.Lady Monmouth again threw aside the book\nwhich more than once she had discarded.She paced the room, restless\nrather than disquieted.She had complete confidence in Rigby\'s ability\nfor the occasion; and with her knowledge of Lord Monmouth\'s character,\nshe could not contemplate the possibility of failure, if the\ncircumstances were adroitly introduced to his consideration.Still time\nstole on: the harassing and exhausting process of suspense was acting\non her nervous system.She began to think that Rigby had not found\nthe occasion favourable for the catastrophe; that Lord Monmouth, from\napprehension of disturbing Rigby and entailing explanations on himself,\nhad avoided the necessary communication; that her skilful combination\nfor the moment had missed.Two hours had now elapsed, and Lucretia, in a\nstate of considerable irritation, was about to inquire whether Mr.Rigby\nwere with his Lordship when the door of her boudoir opened, and that\ngentleman appeared.\'Now sit down and\ntell me what has passed.\'Lady Monmouth pointed to the seat which Flora had occupied.\'I thank your Ladyship,\' said Mr.Rigby, with a somewhat grave and yet\nperplexed expression of countenance, and seating himself at some little\ndistance from his companion, \'but I am very well here.\'Instead of responding to the invitation of Lady\nMonmouth to communicate with his usual readiness and volubility, Mr.Rigby was silent, and, if it were possible to use such an expression\nwith regard to such a gentleman, apparently embarrassed.\'Well,\' said Lady Monmouth, \'does he know about the Millbanks?\'\'His Lordship was greatly shocked,\' replied Mr.Rigby, with a pious\nexpression of features.As his Lordship\nvery justly observed, "It is impossible to say what is going on under my\nown roof, or to what I can trust."\'\'But he made an exception in your favour, I dare say, my dear Mr.\'Lord Monmouth was pleased to say that I possessed his entire\nconfidence,\' said Mr.Rigby, \'and that he looked to me in his\ndifficulties.\'\'The steps which his Lordship is about to take with reference to the\nestablishment generally,\' said Mr.Rigby, \'will allow the connection\nthat at present subsists between that gentleman and his noble relative,\nnow that Lord Monmouth\'s eyes are open to his real character, to\nterminate naturally, without the necessity of any formal explanation.\'\'But what do you mean by the steps he is going to take in his\nestablishment generally?\'\'Lord Monmouth thinks he requires change of scene.\'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, with\ngreat impatience.\'I hope he is not going again to that dreadful castle in Lancashire.\'\'Lord Monmouth was thinking that, as you were tired of Paris, you might\nfind some of the German Baths agreeable.\'\'Why, there is nothing that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as a German\nbathing-place!\'\'Then how capricious in him wanting to go to them?\'\'He does not want to go to them!\'said Lady Monmouth, in a lower voice, and\nlooking him full in the face with a glance seldom bestowed.There was a churlish and unusual look about Rigby.It was as if\nmalignant, and yet at the same time a little frightened, he had screwed\nhimself into doggedness.He suggests that if your Ladyship were\nto pass the summer at Kissengen, for example, and a paragraph in the\n_Morning Post_ were to announce that his Lordship was about to join you\nthere, all awkwardness would be removed; and no one could for a moment\ntake the liberty of supposing, even if his Lordship did not ultimately\nreach you, that anything like a separation had occurred.\'\'I would never have consented to\ninterfere in the affair, but to secure that most desirable point.\'\'I will see Lord Monmouth at once,\' said Lucretia, rising, her natural\npallor aggravated into a ghoul-like tint.\'His Lordship has gone out,\' said Mr.\'Our conversation, sir, then finishes; I wait his return.\'\'His Lordship will never return to Monmouth House again.\'And\nhe really thinks that I am to be crushed by such an instrument as this!He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not.\'Still anxious to secure an amicable separation,\' said Mr.Rigby, \'your\nLadyship must allow me to place the circumstances of the case fairly\nbefore your excellent judgment.Lord Monmouth has decided upon a course:\nyou know as well as I that he never swerves from his resolutions.He has\nleft peremptory instructions, and he will listen to no appeal.He has\nempowered me to represent to your Ladyship that he wishes in every way\nto consider your convenience.He suggests that everything, in short,\nshould be arranged as if his Lordship were himself unhappily no more;\nthat your Ladyship should at once enter into your jointure, which\nshall be made payable quarterly to your order, provided you can find\nit convenient to live upon the Continent,\' added Mr.Rigby, with some\nhesitation.\'Why, then, we will leave your Ladyship to the assertion of your\nrights.\'\'I beg your Ladyship\'s pardon.I speak as the friend of the family, the\ntrustee of your marriage settlement, well known also as Lord Monmouth\'s\nexecutor,\' said Mr.Rigby, his countenance gradually regaining its\nusual callous confidence, and some degree of self-complacency, as he\nremembered the good things which he enumerated.\'I have decided,\' said Lady Monmouth.Your\nmaster has mistaken my character and his own position.He shall rue the\nday that he assailed me.\'\'I should be sorry if there were any violence,\' said Mr.Rigby,\n\'especially as everything is left to my management and control.An\noffice, indeed, which I only accepted for your mutual advantage.I think, upon reflection, I might put before your Ladyship some\nconsiderations which might induce you, on the whole, to be of opinion\nthat it will be better for us to draw together in this business, as we\nhave hitherto, indeed, throughout an acquaintance now of some years.\'Rigby was assuming all his usual tone of brazen familiarity.\'Your self-confidence exceeds even Lord Monmouth\'s estimate of it,\' said\nLucretia.\'Now, now, you are unkind.I am\ninterfering in this business for your sake.It would have fallen to another, who would have fulfilled\nit without any delicacy and consideration for your feelings.View my\ninterposition in that light, my dear Lady Monmouth, and circumstances\nwill assume altogether a new colour.\'\'I beg that you will quit the house, sir.\'\'I would with pleasure, to oblige you, were\nit in my power; but Lord Monmouth has particularly desired that I should\ntake up my residence here permanently.For your Ladyship\'s sake, I wish\neverything to be accomplished with tranquillity, and, if possible,\nfriendliness and good feeling.You can have even a week for the\npreparations for your departure, if necessary.Any carriages, too, that you desire; your jewels, at least all\nthose that are not at the bankers\'.The arrangement about your jointure,\nyour letters of credit, even your passport, I will attend to myself;\nonly too happy if, by this painful interference, I have in any way\ncontributed to soften the annoyance which, at the first blush, you may\nnaturally experience, but which, like everything else, take my word,\nwill wear off.\'\'I shall send for Lord Eskdale,\' said Lady Monmouth.Rigby, \'that Lord Eskdale will give you the\nsame advice as myself, if he only reads your Ladyship\'s letters,\' he\nadded slowly, \'to Prince Trautsmansdorff.\'\'Pardon me,\' said Rigby, putting his hand in his pocket, as if to guard\nsome treasure, \'I have no wish to revive painful associations; but I\nhave them, and I must act upon them, if you persist in treating me as\na foe, who am in reality your best friend; which indeed I ought to be,\nhaving the honour of acting as trustee under your marriage settlement,\nand having known you so many years.\'\'Leave me for the present alone,\' said Lady Monmouth.\'Send me my\nservant, if I have one.I shall not remain here the week which you\nmention, but quit at once this house, which I wish I had never entered.Rigby, you are now lord of Monmouth House, and yet I cannot\nhelp feeling you too will be discharged before he dies.\'Rigby made Lady Monmouth a bow such as became the master of the\nhouse, and then withdrew.A paragraph in the _Morning Post_, a few days after his interview with\nhis grandfather, announcing that Lord and Lady Monmouth had quitted town\nfor the baths of Kissengen, startled Coningsby, who called the same day\nat Monmouth House in consequence.There he learnt more authentic details\nof their unexpected movements.It appeared that Lady Monmouth had\ncertainly departed; and the porter, with a rather sceptical visage,\ninformed Coningsby that Lord Monmouth was to follow; but when, he could\nnot tell.At present his Lordship was at Brighton, and in a few days was\nabout to take possession of a villa at Richmond, which had for some time\nbeen fitting up for him under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, who, as\nConingsby also learnt, now permanently resided at Monmouth House.All\nthis intelligence made Coningsby ponder.He was sufficiently acquainted\nwith the parties concerned to feel assured that he had not learnt the\nwhole truth.What had really taken place, and what was the real cause of\nthe occurrences, were equally mystical to him: all he was convinced of\nwas, that some great domestic revolution had been suddenly effected.Coningsby entertained for his grandfather a sincere affection.With the\nexception of their last unfortunate interview, he had experienced from\nLord Monmouth nothing but kindness both in phrase and deed.There was\nalso something in Lord Monmouth, when he pleased it, rather fascinating\nto young men; and as Coningsby had never occasioned him any feelings but\npleasurable ones, he was always disposed to make himself delightful to\nhis grandson.The experience of a consummate man of the world, advanced\nin life, detailed without rigidity to youth, with frankness and\nfacility, is bewitching.Lord Monmouth was never garrulous: he was\nalways pithy, and could be picturesque.He revealed a character in a\nsentence, and detected the ruling passion with the hand of a master.Besides, he had seen everybody and had done everything; and though, on\nthe whole, too indolent for conversation, and loving to be talked to,\nthese were circumstances which made his too rare communications the more\nprecious.With these feelings, Coningsby resolved, the moment that he learned that\nhis grandfather was established at Richmond, to pay him a visit.He\nwas informed that Lord Monmouth was at home, and he was shown into a\ndrawing-room, where he found two French ladies in their bonnets, whom he\nsoon discovered to be actresses.They also had come down to pay a visit\nto his grandfather, and were by no means displeased to pass the interval\nthat must elapse before they had that pleasure in chatting with his\ngrandson.Coningsby found them extremely amusing; with the finest\nspirits in the world, imperturbable good temper, and an unconscious\npractical philosophy that defied the devil Care and all his works.And\nwell it was that he found such agreeable companions, for time flowed on,\nand no summons arrived to call him to his grandfather\'s presence, and\nno herald to announce his grandfather\'s advent.The ladies and Coningsby\nhad exhausted badinage; they had examined and criticised all the\nfurniture, had rifled the vases of their prettiest flowers; and\nClotilde, who had already sung several times, was proposing a duet to\nErmengarde, when a servant entered, and told the ladies that a carriage\nwas in attendance to give them an airing, and after that Lord Monmouth\nhoped they would return and dine with him; then turning to Coningsby, he\ninformed him, with his lord\'s compliments, that Lord Monmouth was sorry\nhe was too much engaged to see him.Nothing was to be done but to put a tolerably good face upon it.\'Embrace Lord Monmouth for me,\' said Coningsby to his fair friends, \'and\ntell him I think it very unkind that he did not ask me to dinner with\nyou.\'Coningsby said this with a gay air, but really with a depressed spirit.He felt convinced that his grandfather was deeply displeased with him;\nand as he rode away from the villa, he could not resist the strong\nimpression that he was destined never to re-enter it.It so happened that the idle message which Coningsby had left\nfor his grandfather, and which he never seriously supposed for a moment\nthat his late companions would have given their host, operated entirely\nin his favour.Whatever were the feelings with respect to Coningsby at\nthe bottom of Lord Monmouth\'s heart, he was actuated in his refusal to\nsee him not more from displeasure than from an anticipatory horror of\nsomething like a scene.Even a surrender from Coningsby without terms,\nand an offer to declare himself a candidate for Darlford, or to do\nanything else that his grandfather wished, would have been disagreeable\nto Lord Monmouth in his present mood.As in politics a revolution is\noften followed by a season of torpor, so in the case of Lord Monmouth\nthe separation from his wife, which had for a long period occupied his\nmeditation, was succeeded by a vein of mental dissipation.He did not\nwish to be reminded by anything or any person that he had still in\nsome degree the misfortune of being a responsible member of society.He wanted to be surrounded by individuals who were above or below the\nconventional interests of what is called \'the World.\'He wanted to hear\nnothing of those painful and embarrassing influences which from our\ncontracted experience and want of enlightenment we magnify into such\nundue importance.For this purpose he wished to have about him persons\nwhose knowledge of the cares of life concerned only the means of\nexistence, and whose sense of its objects referred only to the sources\nof enjoyment; persons who had not been educated in the idolatry of\nRespectability; that is to say, of realising such an amount of what is\ntermed character by a hypocritical deference to the prejudices of the\ncommunity as may enable them, at suitable times, and under convenient\ncircumstances and disguises, to plunder the public.With these feelings, Lord Monmouth recoiled at this moment from\ngrandsons and relations and ties of all kinds.He did not wish to be\nreminded of his identity, but to swim unmolested and undisturbed in\nhis Epicurean dream.When, therefore, his fair visitors; Clotilde, who\nopened her mouth only to breathe roses and diamonds, and Ermengarde, who\nwas so good-natured that she sacrificed even her lovers to her friends;\nsaw him merely to exclaim at the same moment, and with the same voices\nof thrilling joyousness,--\n\n\'Why did not you ask him to dinner?\'And then, without waiting for his reply, entered with that rapidity of\nelocution which Frenchwomen can alone command into the catalogue of his\ncharms and accomplishments, Lord Monmouth began to regret that he really\nhad not seen Coningsby, who, it appeared, might have greatly contributed\nto the pleasure of the day.The message, which was duly given,\nhowever, settled the business.Lord Monmouth felt that any chance of\nexplanations, or even allusions to the past, was out of the question;\nand to defend himself from the accusations of his animated guests, he\nsaid,\n\n\'Well, he shall come to dine with you next time.\'There is no end to the influence of woman on our life.It is at the\nbottom of everything that happens to us.And so it was, that, in spite\nof all the combinations of Lucretia and Mr.Rigby, and the mortification\nand resentment of Lord Monmouth, the favourable impression he casually\nmade on a couple of French actresses occasioned Coningsby, before a\nmonth had elapsed since his memorable interview at Monmouth House, to\nreceive an invitation again to dine with his grandfather.Clotilde and Ermengarde had wits as sparkling\nas their eyes.There was a manager of the Opera, a great friend of\nVillebecque, and his wife, a splendid lady, who had been a prima donna\nof celebrity, and still had a commanding voice for a chamber; a Carlist\nnobleman who lived upon his traditions, and who, though without a sou,\ncould tell of a festival given by his family, before the revolution,\nwhich had cost a million of francs; and a Neapolitan physician, in whom\nLord Monmouth had great confidence, and who himself believed in the\nelixir vitae, made up the party, with Lucian Gay, Coningsby, and Mr.Our hero remarked that Villebecque on this occasion sat at the\nbottom of the table, but Flora did not appear.In the meantime, the month which brought about this satisfactory and\nat one time unexpected result was fruitful also in other circumstances\nstill more interesting.Coningsby and Edith met frequently, if to\nbreathe the same atmosphere in the same crowded saloons can be described\nas meeting; ever watching each other\'s movements, and yet studious never\nto encounter each other\'s glance.The charms of Miss Millbank had\nbecome an universal topic, they were celebrated in ball-rooms, they were\ndiscussed at clubs: Edith was the beauty of the season.All admired her,\nmany sighed even to express their admiration; but the devotion of Lord\nBeaumanoir, who always hovered about her, deterred them from a rivalry\nwhich might have made the boldest despair.As for Coningsby, he passed\nhis life principally with the various members of the Sydney family, and\nwas almost daily riding with Lady Everingham and her sister, generally\naccompanied by Lord Henry and his friend Eustace Lyle, between whom,\nindeed, and Coningsby there were relations of intimacy scarcely less\ninseparable.Coningsby had spoken to Lady Everingham of the rumoured\nmarriage of her elder brother, and found, although the family had not\nyet been formally apprised of it, she entertained little doubt of\nits ultimate occurrence.She admired Miss Millbank, with whom her\nacquaintance continued slight; and she wished, of course, that her\nbrother should marry and be happy.\'But Percy is often in love,\' she\nwould add, \'and never likes us to be very intimate with his inamoratas.He thinks it destroys the romance; and that domestic familiarity may\ncompromise his heroic character.However,\' she added, \'I really believe\nthat will be a match.\'On the whole, though he bore a serene aspect to the world, Coningsby\npassed this month in a state of restless misery.His soul was brooding\non one subject, and he had no confidant: he could not resist the spell\nthat impelled him to the society where Edith might at least be seen, and\nthe circle in which he lived was one in which her name was frequently\nmentioned.Alone, in his solitary rooms in the Albany, he felt all his\ndesolation; and often a few minutes before he figured in the world,\napparently followed and courted by all, he had been plunged in the\ndarkest fits of irremediable wretchedness.He had, of course, frequently met Lady Wallinger, but their salutations,\nthough never omitted, and on each side cordial, were brief.There seemed\nto be a tacit understanding between them not to refer to a subject\nfruitful in painful reminiscences.In the fulfilment of a project originally formed\nin the playing-fields of Eton, often recurred to at Cambridge, and\ncherished with the fondness with which men cling to a scheme of early\nyouth, Coningsby, Henry Sydney, Vere, and Buckhurst had engaged some\nmoors together this year; and in a few days they were about to quit town\nfor Scotland.They had pressed Eustace Lyle to accompany them, but he,\nwho in general seemed to have no pleasure greater than their society,\nhad surprised them by declining their invitation, with some vague\nmention that he rather thought he should go abroad.It was the last day of July, and all the world were at a breakfast\ngiven, at a fanciful cottage situate in beautiful gardens on the banks\nof the Thames, by Lady Everingham.The weather was as bright as the\nromances of Boccaccio; there were pyramids of strawberries, in bowls\ncolossal enough to hold orange-trees; and the choicest band filled the\nair with enchanting strains, while a brilliant multitude sauntered on\nturf like velvet, or roamed in desultory existence amid the quivering\nshades of winding walks.\'My fete was prophetic,\' said Lady Everingham, when she saw Coningsby.\'I am glad it is connected with an incident.Tell me what we are to\ncelebrate.\'\'Then I, too, will prophesy, and name the hero of the romance, Eustace\nLyle.\'\'You have been more prescient than I,\' said Lady Everingham, \'perhaps\nbecause I was thinking too much of some one else.\'\'It seems to me an union which all must acknowledge perfect.I have had my suspicions a long time; and when\nEustace refused to go to the moors with us, though I said nothing, I was\nconvinced.\'\'At any rate,\' said Lady Everingham, sighing, with a rather smiling\nface, \'we are kinsfolk, Mr.Coningsby; though I would gladly have wished\nto have been more.\'Happiness,\' he\nadded, in a mournful tone, \'I fear can never be mine.\'\'tis a tale too strange and sorrowful for a day when, like Seged,\nwe must all determine to be happy.\'\'Here comes a group that will make you gay,\' said Coningsby as he\nmoved on.Edith and the Wallingers, accompanied by Lord Beaumanoir, Mr.Melton, and Sir Charles Buckhurst, formed the party.They seemed profuse\nin their congratulations to Lady Everingham, having already learnt the\nintelligence from her brother.Coningsby stopped to speak to Lady St.Julians, who had still a daughter\nto marry.Both Augustina, who was at Coningsby Castle, and Clara\nIsabella, who ought to have been there, had each secured the right man.But Adelaide Victoria had now appeared, and Lady St.Julians had a great\nregard for the favourite grandson of Lord Monmouth, and also for the\ninfluential friend of Lord Vere and Sir Charles Buckhurst.In case\nConingsby did not determine to become her son-in-law himself, he might\ncounsel either of his friends to a judicious decision on an inevitable\nact.Ormsby, who seemed\noccupied with some delicacies.no, no, no; those days are passed.I think there is a little\neasterly wind with all this fine appearance.\'\'I am for in-door nature myself,\' said Lord Eskdale.\'Do you know, I do\nnot half like the way Monmouth is going on?He never gets out of that\nvilla of his.\'I had a letter from her to-day: she writes in good spirits.I am sorry\nit broke up, and yet I never thought it would last so long.\'\'I gave them two years,\' said Mr.\'Lord Monmouth lived with his\nfirst wife two years.And afterwards with the Mirandola at Milan, at\nleast nearly two years; it was a year and ten months.I must know,\nfor he called me in to settle affairs.I took the lady to the baths at\nLucca, on the pretence that Monmouth would meet us there.I remember I wanted\nto bet Cassilis, at White\'s, on it when he married; but I thought, being\nhis intimate friend; the oldest friend he has, indeed, and one of his\ntrustees; it was perhaps as well not to do it.\'\'You should have made the bet with himself,\' said Lord Eskdale, \'and\nthen there never would have been a separation.\'\'Hah, hah, hah!About an hour after this, Coningsby, who had just quitted the Duchess,\nmet, on a terrace by the river, Lady Wallinger, walking with Mrs.Guy\nFlouncey and a Russian Prince, whom that lady was enchanting.Coningsby\nwas about to pass with some slight courtesy, but Lady Wallinger stopped\nand would speak to him, on slight subjects, the weather and the fete,\nbut yet adroitly enough managed to make him turn and join her.Guy Flouncey walked on a little before with her Russian admirer.Lady\nWallinger followed with Coningsby.\'The match that has been proclaimed to-day has greatly surprised me,\'\nsaid Lady Wallinger.said Coningsby: \'I confess I was long prepared for it.And it\nseems to me the most natural alliance conceivable, and one that every\none must approve.\'\'Lady Everingham seems much surprised at it.\'Lady Everingham is a brilliant personage, and cannot deign to\nobserve obvious circumstances.\'Coningsby, that I always thought you were engaged to\nLady Theresa?\'\'Indeed, we were informed more than a month ago that you were positively\ngoing to be married to her.\'\'I am not one of those who can shift their affections with such\nrapidity, Lady Wallinger.\'\'You remember our meeting you on the\nstairs at ---- House, Mr.\'Edith had just been informed that you were going to be married to Lady\nTheresa.\'\'Not surely by him to whom she is herself going to be married?\'\'I am not aware that she is going to be married to any one.Lord\nBeaumanoir admires her, has always admired her.But Edith has given\nhim no encouragement, at least gave him no encouragement as long as she\nbelieved; but why dwell on such an unhappy subject, Mr.I\nam to blame; I have been to blame perhaps before, but indeed I think it\ncruel, very cruel, that Edith and you are kept asunder.\'\'You have always been my best, my dearest friend, and are the most\namiable and admirable of women.But tell me, is it indeed true that\nEdith is not going to be married?\'Guy Flouncey turned round, and assuring Lady\nWallinger that the Prince and herself had agreed to refer some point\nto her about the most transcendental ethics of flirtation, this deeply\ninteresting conversation was arrested, and Lady Wallinger, with\nbecoming suavity, was obliged to listen to the lady\'s lively appeal of\nexaggerated nonsense and the Prince\'s affected protests, while Coningsby\nwalked by her side, pale and agitated, and then offered his arm to Lady\nWallinger, which she accepted with an affectionate pressure.At the end\nof the terrace they met some other guests, and soon were immersed in the\nmultitude that thronged the lawn.\'There is Sir Joseph,\' said Lady Wallinger, and Coningsby looked up,\nand saw Edith on his arm.Lord\nBeaumanoir was there, but he seemed to shrink into nothing to-day before\nBuckhurst, who was captivated for the moment by Edith, and hearing\nthat no knight was resolute enough to try a fall with the Marquess, was\nimpelled by his talent for action to enter the lists.He had talked down\neverybody, unhorsed every cavalier.Nobody had a chance against him:\nhe answered all your questions before you asked them; contradicted\neverybody with the intrepidity of a Rigby; annihilated your anecdotes by\nhistoriettes infinitely more piquant; and if anybody chanced to make a\njoke which he could not excel, declared immediately that it was a Joe\nMiller.He was absurd, extravagant, grotesque, noisy; but he was young,\nrattling, and interesting, from his health and spirits.Edith was\nextremely amused by him, and was encouraging by her smile his spiritual\nexcesses, when they all suddenly met Lady Wallinger and Coningsby.The eyes of Edith and Coningsby met for the first time since they so\ncruelly encountered on the staircase of ---- House.A deep, quick blush\nsuffused her face, her eyes gleamed with a sudden coruscation; suddenly\nand quickly she put forth her hand.he presses once more that hand which permanently to retain is the\npassion of his life, yet which may never be his!It seemed that for the\nravishing delight of that moment he could have borne with cheerfulness\nall the dark and harrowing misery of the year that had passed away since\nhe embraced her in the woods of Hellingsley, and pledged his faith by\nthe waters of the rushing Darl.He seized the occasion which offered itself, a moment to walk by her\nside, and to snatch some brief instants of unreserved communion.\'And now we are to each other as before?\'\'And will be, come what come may.\'CHAPTER I.\n\n\nIt was merry Christmas at St.There was a yule log blazing\non every hearth in that wide domain, from the hall of the squire to the\npeasant\'s roof.The Buttery Hatch was open for the whole week from noon\nto sunset; all comers might take their fill, and each carry away as much\nbold beef, white bread, and jolly ale as a strong man could bear in\na basket with one hand.For every woman a red cloak, and a coat of\nbroadcloth for every man.All day long, carts laden with fuel and warm\nraiment were traversing the various districts, distributing comfort and\ndispensing cheer.For a Christian gentleman of high degree was Eustace\nLyle.Within his hall, too, he holds his revel, and his beauteous bride\nwelcomes their guests, from her noble parents to the faithful tenants of\nthe house.All classes are mingled in the joyous equality that becomes\nthe season, at once sacred and merry.There are carols for the eventful\neve, and mummers for the festive day.The Duke and Duchess, and every member of the family, had consented this\nyear to keep their Christmas with the newly-married couple.Coningsby,\ntoo, was there, and all his friends.The party was numerous, gay,\nhearty, and happy; for they were all united by sympathy.They were planning that Henry Sydney should be appointed Lord of\nMisrule, or ordained Abbot of Unreason at the least, so successful had\nbeen his revival of the Mummers, the Hobby-horse not forgotten.Their host had entrusted to Lord Henry the restoration of many old\nobservances; and the joyous feeling which this celebration of Christmas\nhad diffused throughout an extensive district was a fresh argument in\nfavour of Lord Henry\'s principle, that a mere mechanical mitigation of\nthe material necessities of the humbler classes, a mitigation which must\ninevitably be limited, can never alone avail sufficiently to ameliorate\ntheir condition; that their condition is not merely \'a knife and fork\nquestion,\' to use the coarse and shallow phrase of the Utilitarian\nschool; that a simple satisfaction of the grosser necessities of our\nnature will not make a happy people; that you must cultivate the heart\nas well as seek to content the belly; and that the surest means to\nelevate the character of the people is to appeal to their affections.There is nothing more interesting than to trace predisposition.An\nindefinite, yet strong sympathy with the peasantry of the realm had been\none of the characteristic sensibilities of Lord Henry at Eton.Yet a\nschoolboy, he had busied himself with their pastimes and the details of\ntheir cottage economy.As he advanced in life the horizon of his views\nexpanded with his intelligence and his experience; and the son of one of\nthe noblest of our houses, to whom the delights of life are offered with\nfatal facility, on the very threshold of his career he devoted his\ntime and thought, labour and life, to one vast and noble purpose, the\nelevation of the condition of the great body of the people.\'I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule,\' said Lord Henry: \'I will\nbe content with being his gentleman usher.\'\'It shall be put to the vote,\' said Lord Vere.\'No one has a chance against Buckhurst,\' said Coningsby.\'Now, Sir Charles,\' said Lady Everingham, \'your absolute sway is about\nto commence.\'The first thing must be my formal installation,\' said Buckhurst.\'I\nvote the Boar\'s head be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and\nBeau shall be the champion to challenge all who may question my right.Duke, you shall be my chief butler, the Duchess my herb-woman.She is to\nwalk before me, and scatter rosemary.Coningsby shall carry the Boar\'s\nhead; Lady Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the canticle; Lord\nEveringham shall be marshal of the lists, and put all in the stocks who\nare found sober and decorous; Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy\nLand, and Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse.Some must carry cups of\nHippocras, some lighted tapers; all must join in chorus.\'He ceased his instructions, and all hurried away to carry them into\neffect.Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies\nin robes of white, with garlands of flowers; some drew pieces of armour\nfrom the wall, and decked themselves with helm and hauberk; others waved\nancient banners.They brought in the Boar\'s head on a large silver dish,\nand Coningsby raised it aloft.They formed into procession, the Duchess\ndistributing rosemary; Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of\nTamerlane, his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility;\nand the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chanting the first verse of the\ncanticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa:\n\n  I.\n        Caput Apri defero\n        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar\'s heade in hande bring I,\n  With garlandes gay and rosemary:\n  I pray you all singe merrily,\n        Qui estis in convivio.Caput Apri defero\n        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar\'s heade I understande\n  Is the chief servyce in this lande\n  Loke whereever it be fande,\n        Servite cum cantico.Then they stopped; and the Lord\nof Misrule ascended his throne, and his courtiers formed round him\nin circle.Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their\nglittering arms, and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the\nBoar\'s head covered with garlands.It was a good picture, and the Lord\nof Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy.He was addressing\nhis court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense, when a servant\napproached Coningsby, and told him that he was wanted without.A despatch had arrived for him from\nLondon.Without any prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke\nthe seal with a trembling hand.His presence was immediately desired in\ntown: Lord Monmouth was dead.This was a crisis in the life of Coningsby; yet, like many critical\nepochs, the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware\nof its character.The first feeling which he experienced at the\nintelligence was sincere affliction.He was fond of his grandfather; had\nreceived great kindness from him, and at a period of life when it was\nmost welcome.The neglect and hardships of his early years, instead of\nleaving a prejudice against one who, by some, might be esteemed their\nauthor, had by their contrast only rendered Coningsby more keenly\nsensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his\nhappy youth.The next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable\nspeculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes.Lord\nMonmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for\nhim as became a near relative to whom he was attached, and in a manner\nwhich ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman.The\nallowance which Lord Monmouth had made him, as considerable as usually\naccorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers, might justify him in\nestimating his future patrimony as extremely ample.He was aware,\nindeed, that at a subsequent period his grandfather had projected for\nhim fortunes of a still more elevated character.He looked to Coningsby\nas the future representative of an ancient barony, and had been\npurchasing territory with the view of supporting the title.But\nConingsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being\nrealised.He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his\ngrandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford, he had at the\nmoment arrested arrangements which, from the tone of Lord Monmouth\'s\ncommunication, he believed were then in progress for that purpose;\nand he thought it improbable, with his knowledge of his grandfather\'s\nhabits, that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to\nresume before his decease the completion of these plans.Indeed there\nwas a period when, in adopting the course which he pursued with respect\nto Darlford, Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the\nlarge fortune which was to accompany the barony.Had not a separation\nbetween Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with\nConingsby\'s difference with his grandfather, he was conscious that the\nconsequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects; but\nthe absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture, its permanent\nremoval, indeed, from the scene, coupled with his fortunate though not\nformal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth, had long ago banished from his\nmemory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the\ntime to shut his eyes.Before he left town for Scotland he had made a\nfarewell visit to his grandfather, who, though not as cordial as in\nold days, had been gracious; and Coningsby, during his excursion to the\nmoors, and his various visits to the country, had continued at intervals\nto write to his grandfather, as had been for some years his custom.On\nthe whole, with an indefinite feeling which, in spite of many a rational\neffort, did nevertheless haunt his mind, that this great and sudden\nevent might exercise a vast and beneficial influence on his worldly\nposition, Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the\naffliction which he sincerely experienced, in the hope that he might at\nall events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms, her virtues,\nand her love.Although he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet\nreconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham, Coningsby was never\nlong without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life; and the\ncorrespondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney, while they\nwere at the moors, had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir\'s suit had\nterminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had\nquitted London.It was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town: he called at\nonce on Lord Eskdale, who was one of Lord Monmouth\'s executors; and he\npersuaded Coningsby, whom he saw depressed, to dine with him alone.\'You should not be seen at a club,\' said the good-natured peer; \'and I\nremember myself in old days what was the wealth of an Albanian larder.\'Lord Eskdale, at dinner, talked frankly of the disposition of Lord\nMonmouth\'s property.He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was\nhis grandfather\'s principal heir.\'I don\'t know whether you will be happier with a large fortune?\'\'It is a troublesome thing: nobody is satisfied with\nwhat you do with it; very often not yourself.To maintain an equable\nexpenditure; not to spend too much on one thing, too little on another,\nis an art.There must be a harmony, a keeping, in disbursement, which\nvery few men have.The thing to have is about ten\nthousand a year, and the world to think you have only five.There is\nsome enjoyment then; one is let alone.But the instant you have a large\nfortune, duties commence.And then impudent fellows borrow your money;\nand if you ask them for it again, they go about town saying you are a\nscrew.\'Lord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa, which latterly\nhe never quitted, at a little supper, with no persons near him but those\nwho were amusing.He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his\nlips, and being extremely polite, waited a few minutes before he asked\nClotilde, who was singing a sparkling drinking-song, to do him that\nservice.When, in accordance with his request, she reached him, it was\ntoo late.The ladies shrieked, being frightened: at first they were\nin despair, but, after reflection, they evinced some intention of\nplundering the house.Villebecque, who was absent at the moment, arrived\nin time; and everybody became orderly and broken-hearted.The body had been removed to Monmouth House, where it had been embalmed\nand laid in state.There was\nnobody in town; some distinguished connections, however, came up from\nthe country, though it was a period inconvenient for such movements.After the funeral, the will was to be read in the principal saloon of\nMonmouth House, one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the\nboyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof, and\nnow hung in black, adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer.The testamentary dispositions of the late lord were still unknown,\nthough the names of his executors had been announced by his family\nsolicitor, in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained.The executors under the will were Lord Eskdale, Mr.By a subsequent appointment Sidonia had been added.Coningsby, who had been chief mourner,\nstood on the right hand of the solicitor, who sat at the end of a long\ntable, round which, in groups, were ranged all who had attended the\nfuneral, including several of the superior members of the household,\namong them M. Villebecque.The solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in\nthe habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original\nwill, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was\ntherefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument.So saying,\nhe sat down, and breaking the seals of a large packet, he produced the\nwill of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained\nin his custody since its execution.By this will, of the date of 1829, the sum of 10,000_l._ was left to\nConingsby, then unknown to his grandfather; the same sum to Mr.There was a great number of legacies, none of superior amount, most of\nthem of less: these were chiefly left to old male companions, and women\nin various countries.There was an almost inconceivable number of small\nannuities to faithful servants, decayed actors, and obscure foreigners.The residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen, three of\nwhom had quitted this world before the legator; the bequests, therefore,\nhad lapsed.The fourth residuary legatee, in whom, according to the\nterms of the will, all would have consequently centred, was Mr.There followed several codicils which did not materially affect the\nprevious disposition; one of them leaving a legacy of 20,000_l._ to\nthe Princess Colonna; until they arrived at the latter part of the year\n1832, when a codicil increased the 10,000_l._ left under the will to\nConingsby to 50,000_l._.After Coningsby\'s visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change\noccurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth\'s estate.The legacy of\n50,000_l._ in his favour was revoked, and the same sum left to the\nPrincess Lucretia.A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr.Rigby; and\nConingsby was left sole residuary legatee.An estate of about\nnine thousand a year, which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased, and was\ntherefore in his own disposition, was left to Coningsby.Rigby was reduced to 20,000_l._, and the whole of his residue left\nto his issue by Lady Monmouth.In case he died without issue, the estate\nbequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account, and the residue then\nto be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson.It was\nunder this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor and\nto whom Lord Monmouth left, among others, the celebrated picture of\nthe Holy Family by Murillo, as his friend had often admired it.To Lord\nEskdale he left all his female miniatures, and to Mr.Ormsby his rare\nand splendid collection of French novels, and all his wines, except his\nTokay, which he left, with his library, to Sir Robert Peel; though this\nlegacy was afterwards revoked, in consequence of Sir Robert\'s conduct\nabout the Irish corporations.The solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water.While this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the\nroom, but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity\nof the lawyer.Coningsby was silent, his brow a little knit.Rigby\nwas pale and restless, but said nothing.Ormsby took a pinch of\nsnuff, and offered his box to Lord Eskdale, who was next to him.They\nexchanged glances, and made some observation about the weather.Sidonia\nstood apart, with his arms folded.He had not, of course attended the\nfuneral, nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby.\'Now, gentlemen,\' said the solicitor, \'if you please, I will proceed.\'They came to the year 1839, the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley.This\nappeared to be a critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth; while\nConingsby\'s reached to the culminating point.Rigby was reduced to\nhis original legacy under the will of 10,000_l._; a sum of equal amount\nwas bequeathed to Armand Villebecque, in acknowledgment of faithful\nservices; all the dispositions in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked,\nand she was limited to her moderate jointure of 3,000_l._ per annum,\nunder the marriage settlement; while everything, without reserve, was\nleft absolutely to Coningsby.A subsequent codicil determined that the 10,000_l._ left to Mr.Rigby\nshould be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay; but as some\ncompensation Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby\nthe bust of that gentleman, which he had himself presented to his\nLordship, and which, at his desire, had been placed in the vestibule\nat Coningsby Castle, from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth\'s\ndecease Mr.Rigby might wish, perhaps, to present it to some other\nfriend.Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr.As for Coningsby, he saw nobody.He maintained, during the extraordinary\nsituation in which he was placed, a firm demeanour; but serene and\nregulated as he appeared to the spectators, his nerves were really\nstrung to a high pitch.It bore the date of June 1840, and was\nmade at Brighton, immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth.It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great\nemergency.He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all\nright.He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed\nof, it must principally refer to the disinheritance of Coningsby,\nsecured by Rigby\'s well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what\nhad occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer.And then to whom\ncould Lord Monmouth leave his money?However he might cut and carve up\nhis fortunes, Rigby, and especially at a moment when he had so served\nhim, must come in for a considerable slice.All the dispositions in favour of\'my\ngrandson Harry Coningsby\' were revoked; and he inherited from his\ngrandfather only the interest of the sum of 10,000_l._ which had been\noriginally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood.The executors had\nthe power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper\nfor his advancement in life, provided always it was not placed in \'the\ncapital stock of any manufactory.\'Coningsby turned pale; he lost his abstracted look; he caught the eye\nof Rigby; he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious\ncountenance.What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was\nthought and sensation enough for a year; but it was as the flash that\nreveals a whole country, yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens.There was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle\nthese conventional calamities, a natural and sacred confidence in his\nyouth and health, and knowledge and convictions.Even the recollection\nof Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations.At\nleast the mightiest foe to their union was departed.All this was the impression of an instant, simultaneous with the reading\nof the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the\nMarquess of Monmouth left the sum of 30,000_l._ to Armand Villebecque;\nand all the rest, residue, and remainder of his unentailed property,\nwheresoever and whatsoever it might be, amounting in value to nearly a\nmillion sterling, was given, devised, and bequeathed to Flora, commonly\ncalled Flora Villebecque, the step-child of the said Armand Villebecque,\n\'but who is my natural daughter by Marie Estelle Matteau, an actress at\nthe Theatre Francais in the years 1811-15, by the name of Stella.\'said Coningsby, with a grave rather than agitated\ncountenance, to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him, without,\nhowever, any expression of condolence.\'This time next year you will not think so,\' said Sidonia.\'The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage,\' said Sidonia,\n\'is the condolence of the gentle world.For the present we\nwill not speak of it.\'So saying, Sidonia good-naturedly got Coningsby\nout of the room.They walked together to Sidonia\'s house in Carlton Gardens, neither of\nthem making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring\nwhere he had been, what he had been doing, since they last met, and\nhimself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little more feeling\nin his manner than was his custom.When they had arrived there, Sidonia\nordered their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the\ncommand and its appearance, he called Coningsby\'s attention to an old\nGerman painting he had just received, its brilliant colouring and quaint\ncostumes.\'Eat, and an appetite will come,\' said Sidonia, when he observed\nConingsby somewhat reluctant.\'Take some of that Chablis: it will put\nyou right; you will find it delicious.\'In this way some twenty minutes passed; their meal was over, and they\nwere alone together.\'I have been thinking all this time of your position,\' said Sidonia.\'A sorry one, I fear,\' said Coningsby.\'I really cannot see that,\' said his friend.\'You have experienced this\nmorning a disappointment, but not a calamity.If you had lost your eye\nit would have been a calamity: no combination of circumstances could\nhave given you another.There are really no miseries except natural\nmiseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions.What seems\nconventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently\nviewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one\'s life.\'\'I hope the day may come when I may feel this.\'\'Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is\nthe moment when you should clearly comprehend the circumstances which\nsurround you.You think, for\nexample, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because you\nhave lost the fortune on which you counted?\'\'I ask you again, which would you have rather lost, your grandfather\'s\ninheritance or your right leg?\'\'Most certainly my inheritance,\'\n\n\'Or your left arm?\'\'Would you have received the inheritance on condition that your front\nteeth should be knocked out?\'\'Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?\'\'Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.\'\'Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great.\'\'Why, you have put it in an ingenious point of view; and yet it is\nnot so easy to convince a man, that he should be content who has lost\neverything.\'\'You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer\nto the fortune that you have forfeited.How then can you be said to have\nlost everything?\'\'You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable\nknowledge, a fine courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible\nexperience.With each of these qualities one might make a fortune; the\ncombination ought to command the highest.\'\'You console me,\' said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter\nsmile.I think you are a most\nfortunate young man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if\nyou had been your grandfather\'s heir; perhaps less so.But I wish you\nto comprehend your position: if you understand it you will cease to\nlament.\'\'Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object.I make you no\noffers of fortune, because I know you would not accept them, and indeed\nI have no wish to see you a lounger in life.If you had inherited a\ngreat patrimony, it is possible your natural character and previous\nculture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a\nquestion, even with you.Now you are free; that is to say, you are free,\nif you are not in debt.A man who has not seen the world, whose fancy is\nharassed with glittering images of pleasures he has never experienced,\ncannot live on 300_l._ per annum; but you can.You have nothing to haunt\nyour thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of your studies.You have seen\nthe most beautiful women; you have banqueted in palaces; you know what\nheroes, and wits, and statesmen are made of: and you can draw on\nyour memory instead of your imagination for all those dazzling and\ninteresting objects that make the inexperienced restless, and are the\ncause of what are called scrapes.But you can do nothing if you be in\ndebt.Before, therefore, we proceed, I must beg you\nto be frank on this head.If you have any absolute or contingent\nincumbrances, tell me of them without reserve, and permit me to clear\nthem at once to any amount.You will sensibly oblige me in so doing:\nbecause I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start\nwith a clog my psychological observations will be imperfect.\'\'You are, indeed, a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay\nthem.My grandfather was so lavish in his\nallowance to me that I never got into difficulties.Besides, there\nare horses and things without end which I must sell, and money at\nDrummonds\'.\'\'That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt.I\nconceive there are two careers which deserve your consideration.In the\nfirst place there is Diplomacy.If you decide upon that, I can assist\nyou.There exist between me and the Minister such relations that I can\nat once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain.After that, much, if not all, depends on yourself.But I could advance\nyou, provided you were capable.You should, at least, not languish for\nwant of preferment.In an important post, I could throw in your way\nadvantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets.I doubt not your success, and for such a career,\nspeedy.Suppose\nyourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a chief court, or at\na critical post, with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate\nperspective; and, after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage.A Diplomatist is, after all,\na phantom.There is a want of nationality about his being.I always look\nupon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political\ncreeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which\npervades the career of an eminent citizen in a free and great country.\'\'You read my thoughts,\' said Coningsby.\'I should be sorry to sever\nmyself from England.\'\'There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career,\' said\nSidonia, \'which in England may give you all, the Bar.I am absolutely\npersuaded that with the requisite qualifications, and with perseverance,\nsuccess at the Bar is certain.It may be retarded or precipitated by\ncircumstances, but cannot be ultimately affected.You have a right to\ncount with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe\nfor them.You appear to me to have all the qualities necessary for the\nBar; and you may count on that perseverance which is indispensable, for\nthe reason I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your\nexperience.\'\'I have resolved,\' said Coningsby; \'I will try for the Great Seal.\'Alone in his chambers, no longer under the sustaining influence of\nSidonia\'s converse and counsel, the shades of night descending\nand bearing gloom to the gloomy, all the excitement of his spirit\nevaporated, the heart of Coningsby sank.All now depended on himself,\nand in that self he had no trust.And even success\ncould only be conducted to him by the course of many years.His career,\neven if prosperous, was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which\nthe heart of man could be called upon to sustain.Upon the stern altar\nof his fortunes he must immolate his first and enduring love.Before,\nhe had a perilous position to offer Edith; now he had none.The future\nmight then have aided them; there was no combination which could improve\nhis present.Under any circumstances he must, after all his thoughts and\nstudies, commence a new novitiate, and before he could enter the arena\nmust pass years of silent and obscure preparation.He looked up, his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley\nwhich she had given him in the days of their happy hearts.That was all\nthat was to remain of their loves.He was to bear it to the future\nscene of his labours, to remind him through revolving years of toil and\nroutine, that he too had had his romance, had roamed in fair gardens,\nand whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion.That drawing\nwas to become the altar-piece of his life.Coningsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep, waking often with a\nconsciousness of having experienced some great misfortune, yet with an\nindefinite conception of its nature.It was a gloomy day, a raw north-easter blowing up the cloisters of\nthe Albany, in which the fog was lingering, the newspaper on his\nbreakfast-table, full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather\'s\nwill, which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him.To the bright, bracing morn of that merry\nChristmas!That radiant and cheerful scene, and those gracious and\nbeaming personages, seemed another world and order of beings to the\none he now inhabited, and the people with whom he must now commune.It was the wild excitement of despair, the frenzied\nhope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin, that could alone have\ninspired such a hallucination!His\nenergies could rally no more.He gave orders that he was at home to no\none; and in his morning gown and slippers, with his feet resting on the\nfireplace, the once high-souled and noble-hearted Coningsby delivered\nhimself up to despair.The day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie.He was like a particle of chaos; at the best,\na glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades.Towards evening the wind\nchanged, the fog dispersed, there came a clear starry night, brisk and\nbright.Coningsby roused himself, dressed, and wrapping his cloak around\nhim, sallied forth.Once more in the mighty streets, surrounded by\nmillions, his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper\nposition.Well had Sidonia taught him, view everything in its relation\nto the rest.Here was the mightiest of\nmodern cities; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient.Whether he inherited or forfeited fortunes, what was it to the passing\nthrong?They would not share his splendour, or his luxury, or his\ncomfort.But a word from his lip, a thought from his brain, expressed\nat the right time, at the right place, might turn their hearts, might\ninfluence their passions, might change their opinions, might affect\ntheir destiny.As civilisation\nadvances, the accidents of life become each day less important.The power of man, his greatness and his glory, depend on essential\nqualities.Brains every day become more precious than blood.You must\ngive men new ideas, you must teach them new words, you must modify\ntheir manners, you must change their laws, you must root out prejudices,\nsubvert convictions, if you wish to be great.Greatness no longer\ndepends on rentals, the world is too rich; nor on pedigrees, the world\nis too knowing.\'The greatness of this city destroys my misery,\' said Coningsby, \'and my\ngenius shall conquer its greatness.\'This conviction of power in the midst of despair was a revelation of\nintrinsic strength.It is indeed the test of a creative spirit.From\nthat moment all petty fears for an ordinary future quitted him.He felt\nthat he must be prepared for great sacrifices, for infinite suffering;\nthat there must devolve on him a bitter inheritance of obscurity,\nstruggle, envy, and hatred, vulgar prejudice, base criticism, petty\nhostilities, but the dawn would break, and the hour arrive, when the\nwelcome morning hymn of his success and his fame would sound and be\nre-echoed.He returned to his rooms; calm, resolute.He slept the deep sleep of\na man void of anxiety, that has neither hope nor fear to haunt his\nvisions, but is prepared to rise on the morrow collected for the great\nhuman struggle.Fresh, vigorous, not rash or precipitate, yet\ndetermined to lose no time in idle meditation, Coningsby already\nresolved at once to quit his present residence, was projecting a visit\nto some legal quarter, where he intended in future to reside, when his\nservant brought him a note.Coningsby, with\ngreat earnestness, to do her the honour and the kindness of calling on\nher at his earliest convenience, at the hotel in Brook Street where she\nnow resided.It was an interview which Coningsby would rather have avoided; yet it\nseemed to him, after a moment\'s reflection, neither just, nor kind, nor\nmanly, to refuse her request.She was, after\nall, his kin.Was it for a moment to be supposed that he was envious of\nher lot?He replied, therefore, that in an hour he would wait upon her.In an hour, then, two individuals are to be brought together whose first\nmeeting was held under circumstances most strangely different.Then\nConingsby was the patron, a generous and spontaneous one, of a being\nobscure, almost friendless, and sinking under bitter mortification.His favour could not be the less appreciated because he was the\nchosen relative of a powerful noble.That noble was no more; his vast\ninheritance had devolved on the disregarded, even despised actress,\nwhose suffering emotions Coningsby had then soothed, and whose fortune\nhad risen on the destruction of all his prospects, and the balk of all\nhis aspirations.Flora was alone when Coningsby was ushered into the room.The extreme\ndelicacy of her appearance was increased by her deep mourning; and\nseated in a cushioned chair, from which she seemed to rise with an\neffort, she certainly presented little of the character of a fortunate\nand prosperous heiress.\'You are very good to come to me,\' she said, faintly smiling.Coningsby extended his hand to her affectionately, in which she placed\nher own, looking down much embarrassed.\'You have an agreeable situation here,\' said Coningsby, trying to break\nthe first awkwardness of their meeting.\'Yes; but I hope not to stop here long?\'\'No; I hope never to leave England!\'There was a slight pause; and then Flora sighed and said,\n\n\'I wish to speak to you on a subject that gives me pain; yet of which I\nmust speak.\'I am sure,\' said Coningsby, in a tone of great kindness, \'that you\ncould injure no one.\'\'It was not mine by any right, legal or moral.There were others who\nmight have urged an equal claim to it; and there are many who will now\nthink that you might have preferred a superior one.\'\'You had enemies; I was not one.They sought to benefit themselves by\ninjuring you.They have not benefited themselves; let them not say that\nthey have at least injured you.\'\'We will not care what they say,\' said Coningsby; \'I can sustain my\nlot.\'She sighed again with a downcast\nglance.Then looking up embarrassed and blushing deeply, she added, \'I\nwish to restore to you that fortune of which I have unconsciously and\nunwillingly deprived you.\'\'The fortune is yours, dear Flora, by every right,\' said Coningsby,\nmuch moved; \'and there is no one who wishes more fervently that it may\ncontribute to your happiness than I do.\'\'It is killing me,\' said Flora, mournfully; then speaking with unusual\nanimation, with a degree of excitement, she continued, \'I must tell what\nI feel.I am happy in the inheritance, if you\ngenerously receive it from me, because Providence has made me the means\nof baffling your enemies.I never thought to be so happy as I shall be\nif you will generously accept this fortune, always intended for you.I\nhave lived then for a purpose; I have not lived in vain; I have returned\nto you some service, however humble, for all your goodness to me in my\nunhappiness.\'\'You are, as I have ever thought you, the kindest and most\ntender-hearted of beings.But you misconceive our mutual positions,\nmy gentle Flora.The custom of the world does not permit such acts to\neither of us as you contemplate.It is left you by\none on whose affections you had the highest claim.I will not say\nthat so large an inheritance does not bring with it an alarming\nresponsibility; but you are not unequal to it.You have a good heart; you have good sense; you have a\nwell-principled being.Your spirit will mount with your fortunes, and\nblend with them.\'I shall soon learn to find content, if not happiness, from other\nsources,\' said Coningsby; \'and mere riches, however vast, could at no\ntime have secured my felicity.\'\'But they may secure that which brings felicity,\' said Flora, speaking\nin a choking voice, and not meeting the glance of Coningsby.\'You had\nsome views in life which displeased him who has done all this; they may\nbe, they must be, affected by this fatal caprice.Speak to me, for I\ncannot speak, dear Mr.Coningsby; do not let me believe that I, who\nwould sacrifice my life for your happiness, am the cause of such\ncalamities!\'\'Whatever be my lot, I repeat I can sustain it,\' said Coningsby, with a\ncheek of scarlet.he is angry with me,\' exclaimed Flora; \'he is angry with me!\'and\nthe tears stole down her pale cheek.dear Flora; I have no other feelings to you than those of\naffection and respect,\' and Coningsby, much agitated, drew his chair\nnearer to her, and took her hand.\'I am gratified by these kind wishes,\nthough they are utterly impracticable; but they are the witnesses of\nyour sweet disposition and your noble spirit.There never shall exist\nbetween us, under any circumstances, other feelings than those of kin\nand kindness.\'When she saw that, she started, and seemed to\nsummon all her energies.\'You are going,\' she exclaimed, \'and I have said nothing, I have said\nnothing; and I shall never see you again.This fortune is yours; it must be yours.Do\nnot think I am speaking from a momentary impulse.I have\nlived so much alone, I have had so little to deceive or to delude me,\nthat I know myself.If you will not let me do justice you declare my\ndoom.I cannot live if my existence is the cause of all your prospects\nbeing blasted, and the sweetest dreams of your life being defeated.When\nI die, these riches will be yours; that you cannot prevent.Refuse my\npresent offer, and you seal the fate of that unhappy Flora whose fragile\nlife has hung for years on the memory of your kindness.\'\'You must not say these words, dear Flora; you must not indulge in these\ngloomy feelings.You must live, and you must live happily.You have\nevery charm and virtue which should secure happiness.The duties and\nthe affections of existence will fall to your lot.It is one that will\nalways interest me, for I shall ever be your friend.You have conferred\non me one of the most delightful of feelings, gratitude, and for that I\nbless you.CHAPTER V.\n\n\nAbout a week after this interview with Flora, as Coningsby one morning\nwas about to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the\nTemple, to which his notice had been attracted, there was a loud ring, a\nbustle in the hall, and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst were ushered in.There never was such a cordial meeting; and yet the faces of his\nfriends were serious.The truth is, the paragraphs in the newspapers had\ncirculated in the country, they had written to Coningsby, and after a\nbrief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions.Immediately they\ncame up to town.Henry Sydney, a younger son, could offer little but\nsympathy, but he declared it was his intention also to study for the\nbar, so that they should not be divided.Buckhurst, after many embraces\nand some ordinary talk, took Coningsby aside, and said, \'My dear fellow,\nI have no objection to Henry Sydney hearing everything I say, but still\nthese are subjects which men like to be discussed in private.Of course\nI expect you to share my fortune.There was something in Buckhurst\'s fervent resolution very lovable and a\nlittle humorous, just enough to put one in good temper with human nature\nand life.If there were any fellow\'s fortune in the world that Coningsby\nwould share, Buckhurst\'s would have had the preference; but while he\npressed his hand, and with a glance in which a tear and a smile seemed\nto contend for mastery, he gently indicated why such arrangements were,\nwith our present manners, impossible.\'I see,\' said Buckhurst, after a moment\'s thought, \'I quite agree with\nyou.The thing cannot be done; and, to tell you the truth, a fortune\nis a bore.What I vote that we three do at once is, to take plenty of\nready-money, and enter the Austrian service.\'There is something in that,\' said Coningsby.\'In the meantime, suppose\nyou two fellows walk with me to the Temple, for I have an appointment to\nlook at some chambers.\'It was a fine day, and it was by no means a gloomy walk.Though the\ntwo friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth, and\nmiserable about their companion, once more in his society, and finding\nlittle difference in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their\nhabitual tone.As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple, which\nhe visited for the first time.The tombs in the\nchurch convinced him that the Crusades were the only career.He would\nhave himself become a law student if he might have prosecuted his\nstudies in chain armour.The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the\nmisfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion\nof his life amid these halls and courts, gardens and terraces, that\nmaintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century, so much\nof the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners.Henry Sydney was sanguine; he was reconciled to the disinheritance of\nConingsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to\nmake him a Lord Chancellor.These faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was\nestablished in Paper Buildings, and had become a pupil of a celebrated\nspecial pleader.They would have remained longer had not he himself\nsuggested that it was better that they should part.It seemed a terrible\ncatastrophe after all the visions of their boyish days, their college\ndreams, and their dazzling adventures in the world.\'And this is the end of Coningsby, the brilliant Coningsby, that we all\nloved, that was to be our leader!\'said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as\nthey quitted him.\'Well, come what may, life has lost something of its\nbloom.\'\'The great thing now,\' said Lord Henry, \'is to keep up the chain of\nour friendship.We must write to him very often, and contrive to be\nfrequently together.It is dreadful to think that in the ways of life\nour hearts may become estranged.I never felt more wretched than I do at\nthis moment, and yet I have faith that we shall not lose him.\'said Buckhurst; \'but I feel my plan about the Austrian service\nwas, after all, the only thing.He might\nhave been prime minister; several strangers have been; and as for war,\nlook at Brown and Laudohn, and half a hundred others.I had a much\nbetter chance of being a field-marshal than he has of being a Lord\nChancellor.\'\'I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will be Lord Chancellor,\' said\nHenry Sydney, gravely.This change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution.Mary travelled to the hallway.Within a month after the death of his grandfather\nhis name had been erased from all his fashionable clubs, and his horses\nand carriages sold, and he had become a student of the Temple.He\nentirely devoted himself to his new pursuit.His being was completely\nabsorbed in it.There was nothing to haunt his mind; no unexperienced\nscene or sensation of life to distract his intelligence.One sacred\nthought alone indeed there remained, shrined in the innermost sanctuary\nof his heart and consciousness.But it was a tradition, no longer a\nhope.The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of\nhis grandfather\'s will; had clearly ascertained the consequences to\nhimself, and had resolved on the course to pursue; he had communicated\nunreservedly with Oswald Millbank, and had renounced those pretensions\nto the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer.Millbank met Henry Sydney and\nBuckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby.Once more they were all\nfour together; but under what different circumstances, and with what\ndifferent prospects from those which attended their separation at Eton!Alone with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could\nnot convey.He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith; but\nthey would not conceal from themselves that, at this moment, and in the\npresent state of affairs, all was hopeless.In no way did Coningsby ever\npermit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his disinheritance.He\nwas, of course, silent on it to his other friends; as any communication\nof the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his\ninmost soul.The state of political parties in England in the spring of 1841 offered\na most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated\nin the first chapter of this work.The banners of the Conservative camp\nat this moment lowered on the Whig forces, as the gathering host of the\nNorman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex.The Whigs were not\nyet conquered, but they were doomed; and they themselves knew it.The\nmistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining\noffice in 1839; and, whether we consider their conduct in a national\nand constitutional light, or as a mere question of political tactics and\nparty prudence, it was unquestionably a great mistake; had infused into\nthe corps of Whig authority a kind of galvanic action, which only the\nsuperficial could mistake for vitality.Even to form a basis for their\nfuture operations, after the conjuncture of \'39, the Whigs were obliged\nto make a fresh inroad on the revenue, the daily increasing debility\nof which was now arresting attention and exciting public alarm.It was\nclear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial.Under all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Whig\nCabinet, in their final propositions, cannot be described as deficient\neither in boldness or prudence.The policy which they recommended was\nin itself a sagacious and spirited policy; but they erred in supposing\nthat, at the period it was brought forward, any measure promoted by the\nWhigs could have obtained general favour in the country.The Whigs were\nknown to be feeble; they were looked upon as tricksters.The country\nknew they were opposed by a powerful party; and though there certainly\nnever was any authority for the belief, the country did believe that\nthat powerful party were influenced by great principles; had in their\nview a definite and national policy; and would secure to England,\ninstead of a feeble administration and fluctuating opinions, energy and\na creed.The future effect of the Whig propositions of \'41 will not be\ndetrimental to that party, even if in the interval they be appropriated\npiecemeal, as will probably be the case, by their Conservative\nsuccessors.But for the moment, and in the plight in which the Whig\nparty found themselves, it was impossible to have devised measures more\nconducive to their precipitate fall.Great interests were menaced by a\nweak government.Tadpole and Taper\nsaw it in a moment.They snuffed the factious air, and felt the coming\nstorm.Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies,\nthere was a little latent jealousy between them.Tadpole worshipped\nRegistration: Taper, adored a Cry.Tadpole always maintained that it\nwas the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day;\nTaper, on the contrary, faithful to ancient traditions, was ever of\nopinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamour.It\nalways seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be\npopular; the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders\nnot being sufficiently apparent to be esteemed an adequate set-off\nagainst the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions; that the\nTadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places; and Taper had\nhad his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively\nagainst the New Poor-law, and for hiring several link-boys to bawl\na much-wronged lady\'s name in the Park when the Court prorogued\nParliament.And now, after all, in 1841, it seemed that Taper was right.There was\na great clamour in every quarter, and the clamour was against the Whigs\nand in favour of Conservative principles.What Canadian timber-merchants\nmeant by Conservative principles, it is not difficult to conjecture;\nor West Indian planters.It was tolerably clear on the hustings\nwhat squires and farmers, and their followers, meant by Conservative\nprinciples.What they mean by Conservative principles now is another\nquestion: and whether Conservative principles mean something higher than\na perpetuation of fiscal arrangements, some of them impolitic, none of\nthem important.But no matter what different bodies of men understood by\nthe cry in which they all joined, the Cry existed.Taper beat Tadpole;\nand the great Conservative party beat the shattered and exhausted Whigs.Notwithstanding the abstraction of his legal studies, Coningsby could\nnot be altogether insensible to the political crisis.In the political\nworld of course he never mixed, but the friends of his boyhood were\ndeeply interested in affairs, and they lost no opportunity which\nhe would permit them, of cultivating his society.Sandra went back to the hallway.Their occasional\nfellowship, a visit now and then to Sidonia, and a call sometimes\non Flora, who lived at Richmond, comprised his social relations.His\ngeneral acquaintance did not desert him, but he was out of sight, and\ndid not wish to be remembered.Ormsby asked him to dinner, and\noccasionally mourned over his fate in the bow window of White\'s; while\nLord Eskdale even went to see him in the Temple, was interested in his\nprogress, and said, with an encouraging look, that, when he was called\nto the bar, all his friends must join and get up the steam.Rigby, who was walking with the Duke of Agincourt,\nwhich was probably the reason he could not notice a lawyer.Lord Eskdale had obtained from Villebecque accurate details as to the\ncause of Coningsby being disinherited.Our hero, if one in such fallen\nfortunes may still be described as a hero, had mentioned to Lord Eskdale\nhis sorrow that his grandfather had died in anger with him; but Lord\nEskdale, without dwelling on the subject, had assured him that he had\nreason to believe that if Lord Monmouth had lived, affairs would have\nbeen different.He had altered the disposition of his property at a\nmoment of great and general irritation and excitement; and had been too\nindolent, perhaps really too indisposed, which he was unwilling ever to\nacknowledge, to recur to a calmer and more equitable settlement.Lord\nEskdale had been more frank with Sidonia, and had told him all about\nthe refusal to become a candidate for Darlford against Mr.Millbank; the\ncommunication of Rigby to Lord Monmouth, as to the presence of Oswald\nMillbank at the castle, and the love of Coningsby for his sister; all\nthese details, furnished by Villebecque to Lord Eskdale, had been truly\ntransferred by that nobleman to his co-executor; and Sidonia, when he\nhad sufficiently digested them, had made Lady Wallinger acquainted with\nthe whole history.The dissolution of the Whig Parliament by the Whigs, the project of\nwhich had reached Lord Monmouth a year before, and yet in which nobody\nbelieved to the last moment, at length took place.All the world was\ndispersed in the heart of the season, and our solitary student of the\nTemple, in his lonely chambers, notwithstanding all his efforts, found\nhis eye rather wander over the pages of Tidd and Chitty as he remembered\nthat the great event to which he had so looked forward was now\noccurring, and he, after all, was no actor in the mighty drama.It was\nto have been the epoch of his life; when he was to have found himself\nin that proud position for which all the studies, and meditations, and\nhigher impulses of his nature had been preparing him.It was a keen\ntrial of a man.Every one of his friends and old companions were\ncandidates, and with sanguine prospects.Lord Henry was certain for a\ndivision of his county; Buckhurst harangued a large agricultural\nborough in his vicinity; Eustace Lyle and Vere stood in coalition for\na Yorkshire town; and Oswald Millbank solicited the suffrages of an\nimportant manufacturing constituency.They sent their addresses to\nConingsby.He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence\nof his own mind; often recognised the very expressions to which he\nhad habituated them.Amid the confusion of a general election, no\nunimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to\nan isolated constituency; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements\nof political parties might have detected in these public declarations\nsome intimation of new views, and of a tone of political feeling that\nhas unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this\ncountry.It was the end of a sultry July day, the last ray of the sun shooting\ndown Pall Mall sweltering with dust; there was a crowd round the doors\nof the Carlton and the Reform Clubs, and every now and then an express\narrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph.He was going to dine at the Oxford\nand Cambridge Club, the only club on whose list he had retained his\nname, that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or\nCambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former\nfashionable acquaintances.The latter did not notice him, but Mr.Tadpole, more good-natured, bestowed on him a rough nod, not unmarked by\na slight expression of coarse pity.Coningsby ordered his dinner, and then took up the evening papers, where\nhe learnt the return of Vere and Lyle; and read a speech of Buckhurst\ndenouncing the Venetian Constitution, to the amazement of several\nthousand persons, apparently not a little terrified by this unknown\ndanger, now first introduced to their notice.Being true Englishmen,\nthey were all against Buckhurst\'s opponent, who was of the Venetian\nparty, and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities.Coningsby had dined, and was reading in the library, when a waiter\nbrought up a third edition of the _Sun_, with electioneering bulletins\nfrom the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour.Some large\nletters which expressed the name of Darlford caught his eye.There\nseemed great excitement in that borough; strange proceedings had\nhappened.The column was headed, \'Extraordinary Affair!His eye glanced over an animated speech of Mr.Millbank, his\ncountenance changed, his heart palpitated.Millbank had resigned\nthe representation of the town, but not from weakness; his avocations\ndemanded his presence; he had been requested to let his son supply his\nplace, but his son was otherwise provided for; he should always take a\ndeep interest in the town and trade of Darlford; he hoped that the\nlink between the borough and Hellingsley would be ever cherished; loud\ncheering; he wished in parting from them to take a step which should\nconciliate all parties, put an end to local heats and factious\ncontentions, and secure the town an able and worthy representative.For\nthese reasons he begged to propose to them a gentleman who bore a\nname which many of them greatly honoured; for himself, he knew the\nindividual, and it was his firm opinion that whether they considered his\ntalents, his character, or the ancient connection of his family with\nthe district, he could not propose a candidate more worthy of their\nconfidence than HARRY CONINGSBY, ESQ.This proposition was received with that wild enthusiasm which\noccasionally bursts out in the most civilised communities.The contest\nbetween Millbank and Rigby was equally balanced, neither party was\nover-confident.The Conservatives were not particularly zealous in\nbehalf of their champion; there was no Marquess of Monmouth and no\nConingsby Castle now to back him; he was fighting on his own resources,\nand he was a beaten horse.The Liberals did not like the prospect of a\ndefeat, and dreaded the mortification of Rigby\'s triumph.The Moderate\nmen, who thought more of local than political circumstances, liked the\nname of Coningsby.Millbank had dexterously prepared his leading\nsupporters for the substitution.Some traits of the character and\nconduct of Coningsby had been cleverly circulated.Thus there was a\ncombination of many favourable causes in his favour.In half an hour\'s\ntime his image was stamped on the brain of every inhabitant of the\nborough as an interesting and accomplished youth, who had been wronged,\nand who deserved to be rewarded.It was whispered that Rigby was his\nenemy.Rigby into the river, or to burn down his hotel, in case he was\nprudent enough not to show.Rigby determined to fight to the last.All his hopes were now staked on the successful result of this contest.It were impossible if he were returned that his friends could refuse him\nhigh office.The whole of Lord Monmouth\'s reduced legacy was devoted\nto this end.The third edition of the _Sun_ left Mr.Rigby in vain\nattempting to address an infuriated populace.Here was a revolution in the fortunes of our forlorn Coningsby!When his\ngrandfather first sent for him to Monmouth House, his destiny was\nnot verging on greater vicissitudes.He rose from his seat, and was\nsurprised that all the silent gentlemen who were about him did not mark\nhis agitation.It was now an hour\nto midnight, and to-morrow the almost unconscious candidate was to go to\nthe poll.In a tumult of suppressed emotion, Coningsby returned to his\nchambers.He found a letter in his box from Oswald Millbank, who had\nbeen twice at the Temple.Oswald had been returned without a contest,\nand had reached Darlford in time to hear Coningsby nominated.He set off\ninstantly to London, and left at his friend\'s chambers a rapid narrative\nof what had happened, with information that he should call on him\nagain on the morrow at nine o\'clock, when they were to repair together\nimmediately to Darlford in time for Coningsby to be chaired, for no one\nentertained a doubt of his triumph.Coningsby did not sleep a wink that night, and yet when he rose early\nfelt fresh enough for any exploit, however difficult or hazardous.He\nfelt as an Egyptian does when the Nile rises after its elevation had\nbeen despaired of.At the very lowest ebb of his fortunes, an event\nhad occurred which seemed to restore all.He dared not contemplate the\nultimate result of all these wonderful changes.Enough for him, that\nwhen all seemed dark, he was about to be returned to Parliament by\nthe father of Edith, and his vanquished rival who was to bite the dust\nbefore him was the author of all his misfortunes.Love, Vengeance,\nJustice, the glorious pride of having acted rightly, the triumphant\nsense of complete and absolute success, here were chaotic materials from\nwhich order was at length evolved; and all subsided in an overwhelming\nfeeling of gratitude to that Providence that had so signally protected\nhim.It seemed\nthat Oswald was as excited as Coningsby.His eye sparkled, his manner\nwas energetic.\'We must talk it all over during our journey.We have not a minute to\nspare.\'During that journey Coningsby learned something of the course of affairs\nwhich gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his\nfavour.We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of\nthe circumstances which had occasioned and attended the disinheritance\nof Coningsby.These he had told to Lady Wallinger, first by letter,\nafterwards in more detail on her arrival in London.Lady Wallinger had\nconferred with her husband.She was not surprised at the goodness of\nConingsby, and she sympathised with all his calamities.He had ever been\nthe favourite of her judgment, and her romance had always consisted in\nblending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith.Sir Joseph was a\njudicious man, who never cared to commit himself; a little selfish, but\ngood, just, and honourable, with some impulses, only a little afraid\nof them; but then his wife stepped in like an angel, and gave them the\nright direction.They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby\'s\nadmirable conduct, and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband\nshould express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison\nwith herself.Millbank, who stared; but Sir\nJoseph spoke feebly.Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence, and\nall her impressions, to Oswald and Edith.The younger Millbank talked\nwith his father, who, making no admissions, listened with interest,\ninveighed against Lord Monmouth, and condemned his will.Millbank made inquiries about Coningsby, took an\ninterest in his career, and, like Lord Eskdale, declared that when he\nwas called to the bar, his friends would have an opportunity to evince\ntheir sincerity.Affairs remained in this state, until Oswald thought\nthat circumstances were sufficiently ripe to urge his father on\nthe subject.The position which Oswald had assumed at Millbank had\nnecessarily made him acquainted with the affairs and fortune of his\nfather.When he computed the vast wealth which he knew was at his\nparent\'s command, and recalled Coningsby in his humble chambers, toiling\nafter all his noble efforts without any results, and his sister pining\nin a provincial solitude, Oswald began to curse wealth, and to\nask himself what was the use of all their marvellous industry and\nsupernatural skill?He addressed his father with that irresistible\nfrankness which a strong faith can alone inspire.What are the objects\nof wealth, if not to bless those who possess our hearts?The only\ndaughter, the friend to whom the only son was indebted for his life,\nhere are two beings surely whom one would care to bless, and both are\nunhappy.Millbank listened without prejudice, for he was already\nconvinced.But he felt some interest in the present conduct of\nConingsby.A Coningsby working for his bread was a novel incident for\nhim.He was resolved to\nconvince himself of the fact.And perhaps he would have gone on yet\nfor a little time, and watched the progress of the experiment,\nalready interested and delighted by what had reached him, had not the\ndissolution brought affairs to a crisis.The misery of Oswald at the\nposition of Coningsby, the silent sadness of Edith, his own conviction,\nwhich assured him that he could do nothing wiser or better than take\nthis young man to his heart, so ordained it that Mr.Millbank, who\nwas after all the creature of impulse, decided suddenly, and decided\nrightly.Never making a single admission to all the representations of\nhis son, Mr.Millbank in a moment did all that his son could have dared\nto desire.This is a very imperfect and crude intimation of what had occurred\nat Millbank and Hellingsley; yet it conveys a faint sketch of the\nenchanting intelligence that Oswald conveyed to Coningsby during their\nrapid travel.When they arrived at Birmingham, they found a messenger\nand a despatch, informing Coningsby, that at mid-day, at Darlford, he\nwas at the head of the poll by an overwhelming majority, and that Mr.He was, however, requested to remain at Birmingham,\nas they did not wish him to enter Darlford, except to be chaired, so\nhe was to arrive there in the morning.At Birmingham, therefore, they\nremained.There was Oswald\'s election to talk of as well as Coningsby\'s.They had\nhardly had time for this.Men must have been at school together, to enjoy the real fun of meeting\nthus, and realising boyish dreams.Often, years ago, they had talked\nof these things, and assumed these results; but those were words and\ndreams, these were positive facts; after some doubts and struggles, in\nthe freshness of their youth, Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby\nwere members of the British Parliament; public characters, responsible\nagents, with a career.This afternoon, at Birmingham, was as happy an afternoon as usually\nfalls to the lot of man.Both of these companions were labouring under\nthat degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity.Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful\nsubject.There was rapture in their again meeting under such\ncircumstances.Then there were their friends; that dear Buckhurst, who\nhad just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian, and all\ntheir companions of early days.What a sudden and marvellous change in\nall their destinies!Life was a pantomime; the wand was waved, and it\nseemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power,\nsprings of the great machine.A train arrived; restless they sallied forth, to seek diversion in the\ndispersion of the passengers.Coningsby and Millbank, with that glance,\na little inquisitive, even impertinent, if we must confess it, with\nwhich one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance,\nwere lounging on the platform.The train arrived; stopped; the doors\nwere thrown open, and from one of them emerged Mr.Coningsby, who\nhad dined, was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow,\nbut he refrained.He was evidently\nused up; a man without a resource; the sight of Coningsby his last blow;\nhe had met his fate.\'My dear fellow,\' said Coningsby, \'I remember I wanted you to dine with\nmy grandfather at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you.About eleven o\'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford\nstation.Here they were met by an anxious deputation, who received\nConingsby as if he were a prophet, and ushered him into a car covered\nwith satin and blue ribbons, and drawn by six beautiful grey horses,\ncaparisoned in his colours, and riden by postilions, whose very whips\nwere blue and white.Triumphant music sounded; banners waved; the\nmultitude were marshalled; the Freemasons, at the first opportunity,\nfell into the procession; the Odd Fellows joined it at the nearest\ncorner.Preceded and followed by thousands, with colours flying,\ntrumpets sounding, and endless huzzas, flags and handkerchiefs waving\nfrom every window, and every balcony filled with dames and maidens\nbedecked with his colours, Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic\nDarlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon.Uncovered, still\nin deep mourning, his fine figure, and graceful bearing, and his\nintelligent brow, at once won every female heart.The singularity was, that all were of the same opinion: everybody\ncheered him, every house was adorned with his colours.His triumphal\nreturn was no party question.Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked\ntogether like lambs at the head of his procession.The car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street.The broad street was so crowded, that, as\nevery one declared, you might have walked on the heads of the people.Every window was full; the very roofs were peopled.The car stopped,\nand the populace gave three cheers for Mr.Their late member,\nsurrounded by his friends, stood in the balcony, which was fitted up\nwith Coningsby\'s colours, and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic\nletters formed of dahlias.The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby\ncaught the form of Edith, who was leaning on her father\'s arm.The hustings were opposite the hotel, and here, after a while, Coningsby\nwas carried, and, stepping from his car, took up his post to address,\nfor the first time, a public assembly.Anxious as the people were\nto hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into\nsilence.He spoke; his\npowerful and rich tones reached every ear.In five minutes\' time every\none looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there\nnever was anything like this heard in Darlford before.He addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to\nsay; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in\nwhich he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which\nthey had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition\nof the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly\nchosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.He did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and\npopular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered.His\nlively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment.But when,\ntowards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the\ncharacter of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast\nthrong was singularly affected.There were a great many present at that\nmoment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly\nhave then died for him.Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had\nspoken from his own.Darlford\nbelieved in Coningsby: and a very good creed.And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel.The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands\nwith him.His friends, however, at last safely landed him.He sprang\nup the stairs; he was met by Mr.Millbank, who welcomed him with the\ngreatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.\'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,\' said\nConingsby.Millbank, \'it is to your own high principles, great\ntalents, and good heart.\'After he had been presented by the late member to the principal\npersonages in the borough, Mr.Millbank said,\n\n\'I think we must now give Mr.Come with me,\' he\nadded, \'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.\'Speaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in\nConingsby\'s with great affection opened the door of an apartment.There\nwas Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love.Their agitated\nhearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy.The father joined their\nhands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.It was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at\nHellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member\nfor Darlford.The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of\nMr.Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted\nthe newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its\noccupants.Millbank assured Coningsby,\nwere effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,\nof his son.An event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of\nConingsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no\nlonger necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with\nwhich her spirit had never greatly sympathised.Perhaps she might have\nlingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal\ninheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting\nher heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious\ninstrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing\nand encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her\nnature.The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from\nthat day she seemed gradually to decline.She died towards the end\nof the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she\nbequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith.Gratifying\nas it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not\nwithout a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.Edith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a\nmonument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful\nand gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart\nand his youth.They stand now on the threshold of public life.They are in the leash,\nbut in a moment they will be slipped.Will they\nmaintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in\nstudy and in solitude, they have embraced?Or will their courage exhaust\nitself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted\nridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the\ntawdry temptations of a low ambition?Will their skilled intelligence\nsubside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party?Will Vanity\nconfound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies?Or will\nthey remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and\nworship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise\nthe greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened\nworld the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed\nthe individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by\nbelieving in their own energies, and daring to be great?They also\nmurmured highly against the influence assumed by secular persons in\nexercising the rights of patronage, which they termed a rape upon the\nchastity of the Church.They censured and condemned as Erastian many of\nthe measures by which Government after the Revolution showed an\ninclination to interfere with the management of the Church, and they\npositively refused to take the oath of allegiance to King William and\nQueen Mary until they should, on their part, have sworn to the Solemn\nLeague--and Covenant, the Magna Charta, as they termed it, of the\nPresbyterian Church.This party, therefore, remained grumbling and dissatisfied, and made\nrepeated declarations against defections and causes of wrath, which, had\nthey been prosecuted as in the two former reigns, would have led to the\nsame consequence of open rebellion.But as the murmurers were allowed to\nhold their meetings uninterrupted, and to testify as much as they pleased\nagainst Socinianism, Erastianism, and all the compliances and defections\nof the time, their zeal, unfanned by persecution, died gradually away,\ntheir numbers became diminished, and they sunk into the scattered remnant\nof serious, scrupulous, and harmless enthusiasts, of whom Old Mortality,\nwhose legends have afforded the groundwork of my tale, may be taken as no\nbad representative.But in the years which immediately succeeded the\nRevolution, the Cameronians continued a sect strong in numbers and\nvehement in their political opinions, whom Government wished to\ndiscourage, while they prudently temporised with them.These men formed\none violent party in the State; and the Episcopalian and Jacobite\ninterest, notwithstanding their ancient and national animosity, yet\nrepeatedly endeavoured to intrigue among them, and avail themselves of\ntheir discontents, to obtain their assistance in recalling the Stewart\nfamily.The Revolutionary Government in the mean while, was supported by\nthe great bulk of the Lowland interest, who were chiefly disposed to a\nmoderate Presbytery, and formed in a great measure the party who in the\nformer oppressive reigns were stigmatized by the Cameronians for having\nexercised that form of worship under the declaration of Indulgence issued\nby Charles II.Such was the state of parties in Scotland immediately\nsubsequent to the Revolution.It was on a delightful summer evening that a stranger, well mounted, and\nhaving the appearance of a military man of rank, rode down a winding\ndescent which terminated in view of the romantic ruins of Bothwell Castle\nand the river Clyde, which winds so beautifully between rocks and woods\nto sweep around the towers formerly built by Aymer de Valence.Bothwell\nBridge was at a little distance, and also in sight.The opposite field,\nonce the scene of slaughter and conflict, now lay as placid and quiet as\nthe surface of a summer lake.The trees and bushes, which grew around in\nromantic variety of shade, were hardly seen to stir under the influence\nof the evening breeze.The very murmur of the river seemed to soften\nitself into unison with the stillness of the scene around.The path through which the traveller descended was occasionally shaded by\ndetached trees of great size, and elsewhere by the hedges and boughs of\nflourishing orchards, now laden with summer fruits.The nearest object of consequence was a farmhouse, or, it might be, the\nabode of a small proprietor, situated on the side of a sunny bank which\nwas covered by apple and pear trees.At the foot of the path which led up\nto this modest mansion was a small cottage, pretty much in the situation\nof a porter\'s lodge, though obviously not designed for such a purpose.The hut seemed comfortable, and more neatly arranged than is usual in\nScotland.It had its little garden, where some fruit-trees and bushes\nwere mingled with kitchen herbs; a cow and six sheep fed in a paddock\nhard by; the cock strutted and crowed, and summoned his family around him\nbefore the door; a heap of brushwood and turf, neatly made up, indicated\nthat the winter fuel was provided; and the thin blue smoke which ascended\nfrom the straw-bound chimney, and winded slowly out from among the green\ntrees, showed that the evening meal was in the act of being made ready.To complete the little scene of rural peace and comfort, a girl of about\nfive years old was fetching water in a pitcher from a beautiful fountain\nof the purest transparency, which bubbled up at the root of a decayed old\noak-tree about twenty yards from the end of the cottage.The stranger reined up his horse and called to the little nymph, desiring\nto know the way to Fairy Knowe.The child set down her water-pitcher,\nhardly understanding what was said to her, put her fair flaxen hair apart\non her brows, and opened her round blue eyes with the wondering "What\'s\nyour wull?"which is usually a peasant\'s first answer, if it can be\ncalled one, to all questions whatever."I wish to know the way to Fairy Knowe.""Mammie, mammie," exclaimed the little rustic, running towards the door\nof the hut, "come out and speak to the gentleman."Her mother appeared,--a handsome young country-woman, to whose features,\noriginally sly and espiegle in expression, matrimony had given that\ndecent matronly air which peculiarly marks the peasant\'s wife of\nScotland.She had an infant in one arm, and with the other she smoothed\ndown her apron, to which hung a chubby child of two years old.The elder\ngirl, whom the traveller had first seen, fell back behind her mother as\nsoon as she appeared, and kept that station, occasionally peeping out to\nlook at the stranger.said the woman, with an air of respectful\nbreeding not quite common in her rank of life, but without anything\nresembling forwardness.The stranger looked at her with great earnestness for a moment, and then\nreplied, "I am seeking a place called Fairy Knowe, and a man called\nCuthbert Headrigg."It\'s my gudeman, sir," said the young woman, with a smile of welcome."Will you alight, sir, and come into our puir dwelling?--Cuddie,\nCuddie,"--a white-headed rogue of four years appeared at the door of the\nhut--"rin awa, my bonny man, and tell your father a gentleman wants him.Or, stay,--Jenny, ye\'ll hae mair sense: rin ye awa and tell him; he\'s\ndown at the Four-acres Park.--Winna ye light down and bide a blink, sir?Or would ye take a mouthfu\' o\' bread and cheese, or a drink o\' ale, till\nour gudeman comes.It\'s gude ale, though I shouldna say sae that brews\nit; but ploughmanlads work hard, and maun hae something to keep their\nhearts abune by ordinar, sae I aye pit a gude gowpin o\' maut to the\nbrowst."As the stranger declined her courteous offers, Cuddie, the reader\'s old\nacquaintance, made his appearance in person.His countenance still\npresented the same mixture of apparent dulness with occasional sparkles,\nwhich indicated the craft so often found in the clouted shoe.He looked\non the rider as on one whom he never had before seen, and, like his\ndaughter and wife, opened the conversation with the regular query,\n"What\'s your wull wi\' me, sir?""I have a curiosity to ask some questions about this country," said the\ntraveller, "and I was directed to you as an intelligent man who can\nanswer them.""Nae doubt, sir," said Cuddie, after a moment\'s hesitation."But I would\nfirst like to ken what sort of questions they are.I hae had sae mony\nquestions speered at me in my day, and in sic queer ways, that if ye kend\na\', ye wadna wonder at my jalousing a\' thing about them.My mother gar \'d\nme learn the Single Carritch, whilk was a great vex; then I behoved to\nlearn about my godfathers and godmothers to please the auld leddy; and\nwhiles I jumbled them thegether and pleased nane o\' them; and when I cam\nto man\'s yestate, cam another kind o\' questioning in fashion that I liked\nwaur than Effectual Calling; and the \'did promise and vow\' of the tape\nwere yokit to the end o\' the tother.Sae ye see, sir, I aye like to hear\nquestions asked befor I answer them.""You have nothing to apprehend from mine, my good friend; they only\nrelate to the state of the country."replied Cuddie; "ou, the country\'s weel eneugh, an it werena\nthat dour deevil, Claver\'se (they ca\' him Dundee now), that\'s stirring\nabout yet in the Highlands, they say, wi\' a\' the Donalds and Duncans and\nDugalds, that ever wore bottomless breeks, driving about wi\' him, to set\nthings asteer again, now we hae gotten them a\' reasonably weel settled.But Mackay will pit him down, there\'s little doubt o\' that; he\'ll gie him\nhis fairing, I\'ll be caution for it.""What makes you so positive of that, my friend?""I heard it wi\' my ain lugs," answered Cuddie, "foretauld to him by a man\nthat had been three hours stane dead, and came back to this earth again\njust to tell him his mind.It was at a place they ca\' Drumshinnel.""I can hardly believe you, my friend.""Ye might ask my mither, then, if she were in life," said Cuddie; "it was\nher explained it a\' to me, for I thought the man had only been wounded.At ony rate, he spake of the casting out of the Stewarts by their very\nnames, and the vengeance that was brewing for Claver\'se and his dragoons.They ca\'d the man Habakkuk Mucklewrath; his brain was a wee ajee, but he\nwas a braw preacher for a\' that.""You seem," said the stranger, "to live in a rich and peaceful country.""It\'s no to compleen o\', sir, an we get the crap weel in," quoth Cuddie;\n"but if ye had seen the blude rinnin\' as fast on the tap o\' that brigg\nyonder as ever the water ran below it, ye wadna hae thought it sae bonnie\na spectacle."I was waiting upon Monmouth that\nmorning, my good friend, and did see some part of the action," said the\nstranger."Then ye saw a bonny stour," said Cuddie, "that sail serve me for\nfighting a\' the days o\' my life.I judged ye wad be a trooper, by your\nred scarlet lace-coat and your looped hat.""And which side were you upon, my friend?"continued the inquisitive\nstranger.retorted Cuddie, with a knowing look, or what he designed for\nsuch,--"there\'s nae use in telling that, unless I kend wha was asking\nme.""I commend your prudence, but it is unnecessary; I know you acted on that\noccasion as servant to Henry Morton."said Cuddie, in surprise, "how came ye by that secret?No that I\nneed care a bodee about it, for the sun\'s on our side o\' the hedge now.I\nwish my master were living to get a blink o\'t.""He was lost in the vessel gaun to that weary Holland,--clean lost; and\na\' body perished, and my poor master amang them.Neither man nor mouse\nwas ever heard o\' mair.""You had some regard for him, then?"His face was made of a fiddle, as they say, for a\'\nbody that looked on him liked him.Oh, an ye\nhad but seen him down at the brigg there, fleeing about like a fleeing\ndragon to gar folk fight that had unto little will till \'t!There was he\nand that sour Whigamore they ca\'d Burley: if twa men could hae won a\nfield, we wadna hae gotten our skins paid that day.""You mention Burley: do you know if he yet lives?"Folk say he was abroad, and our sufferers wad\nhold no communion wi\' him, because o\' his having murdered the archbishop.Sae he cam hame ten times dourer than ever, and broke aff wi\' mony o\' the\nPresbyterians; and at this last coming of the Prince of Orange he could\nget nae countenance nor command for fear of his deevilish temper, and he\nhasna been heard of since; only some folk say that pride and anger hae\ndriven him clean wud.""And--and," said the traveller, after considerable hesitation,--"do you\nknow anything of Lord Evan dale?""<DW37> I ken onything o\' Lord Evandale?Is not my young leddy up\nby yonder at the house, that\'s as gude as married to him?""No, only what they ca\' betrothed,--me and my wife were witnesses.It\'s\nno mony months bypast; it was a lang courtship,--few folk kend the reason\nby Jenny and mysell.I downa bide to see ye\nsitting up there, and the clouds are casting up thick in the west ower\nGlasgow-ward, and maist skeily folk think that bodes rain."In fact, a deep black cloud had already surmounted the setting sun; a few\nlarge drops of rain fell, and the murmurs of distant thunder were heard."The deil\'s in this man," said Cuddie to himself; "I wish he would either\nlight aff or ride on, that he may quarter himsell in Hamilton or the\nshower begin."But the rider sate motionless on his horse for two or three moments after\nhis last question, like one exhausted by some uncommon effort.At length,\nrecovering himself as if with a sudden and painful effort, he asked\nCuddie "if Lady Margaret Bellenden still lived.""She does," replied Cuddie, "but in a very sma\' way.They hae been a sad\nchanged family since thae rough times began; they hae suffered eneugh\nfirst and last,--and to lose the auld Tower and a\' the bonny barony and\nthe holms that I hae pleughed sae often, and the Mains, and my kale-yard,\nthat I suld hae gotten back again, and a\' for naething, as \'a body may\nsay, but just the want o\' some bits of sheep-skin that were lost in the\nconfusion of the taking of Tillietudlem.""I have heard something of this," said the stranger, deepening his voice\nand averting his head."I have some interest in the family, and would\nwillingly help them if I could.Can you give me a bed in your house\nto-night, my friend?""It\'s but a corner of a place, sir," said Cuddie, "but we\'se try, rather\nthan ye suld ride on in the rain and thunner; for, to be free wi\' ye,\nsir, I think ye seem no that ower weel.""I am liable to a dizziness," said the stranger, "but it will soon wear\noff.""I ken we can gie ye a decent supper, sir," said Cuddie; "and we\'ll see\nabout a bed as weel as we can.We wad be laith a stranger suld lack what\nwe have, though we are jimply provided for in beds rather; for Jenny has\nsae mony bairns (God bless them and her) that troth I maun speak to Lord\nEvandale to gie us a bit eik, or outshot o\' some sort, to the onstead.""I shall be easily accommodated," said the stranger, as he entered the\nhouse."And ye may rely on your naig being weel sorted," said Cuddie; "I ken\nweel what belangs to suppering a horse, and this is a very gude ane."Cuddie took the horse to the little cow-house, and called to his wife to\nattend in the mean while to the stranger\'s accommodation.The officer\nentered, and threw himself on a settle at some distance from the fire,\nand carefully turning his back to the little lattice window.Headrigg, if the reader pleases, requested him to lay aside the\ncloak, belt, and flapped hat which he wore upon his journey, but he\nexcused himself under pretence of feeling cold, and, to divert the time\ntill Cuddie\'s return, he entered into some chat with the children,\ncarefully avoiding, during the interval, the inquisitive glances of his\nlandlady.Our broken friendships we deplore,\n                    And loves of youth that are no more.Cuddie soon returned, assuring the stranger, with a cheerful voice, "that\nthe horse was properly suppered up, and that the gudewife should make a\nbed up for him at the house, mair purpose-like and comfortable than the\nlike o\' them could gie him."said the stranger, with an interrupted and\nbroken voice."No, stir, they\'re awa wi\' a\' the servants,--they keep only twa nowadays,\nand my gudewife there has the keys and the charge, though she\'s no a\nfee\'d servant.She has been born and bred in the family, and has a\' trust\nand management.If they were there, we behovedna to take sic freedom\nwithout their order; but when they are awa, they will be weel pleased we\nserve a stranger gentleman.Miss Bellenden wad help a\' the haill warld,\nan her power were as gude as her will; and her grandmother, Leddy\nMargaret, has an unto respect for the gentry, and she\'s no ill to the\npoor bodies neither.--And now, wife, what for are ye no getting forrit\nwi\' the sowens?""Never mind, lad," rejoined Jenny, "ye sall hae them in gude time; I ken\nweel that ye like your brose het."Cuddie fidgeted and laughed with a peculiar expression of intelligence at\nthis repartee, which was followed by a dialogue of little consequence\nbetwixt his wife and him, in which the stranger took no share.At length\nhe suddenly interrupted them by the question: "Can you tell me when Lord\nEvandale\'s marriage takes place?""Very soon, we expect," answered Jenny, before it was possible for her\nhusband to reply; "it wad hae been ower afore now, but for the death o\'\nauld Major Bellenden."said the stranger; "I heard at Edinburgh he was\nno more."He couldna be said to haud up his head after his brother\'s wife and his\nniece were turned out o\' their ain house; and he had himsell sair\nborrowing siller to stand the law,--but it was in the latter end o\' King\nJames\'s days; and Basil Olifant, who claimed the estate, turned a <DW7>\nto please the managers, and then naething was to be refused him.Sae the\nlaw gaed again the leddies at last, after they had fought a weary sort o\'\nyears about it; and, as I said before, the major ne\'er held up his head\nagain.And then cam the pitting awa o\' the Stewart line; and, though he\nhad but little reason to like them, he couldna brook that, and it clean\nbroke the heart o\' him; and creditors cam to Charnwood and cleaned out a\'\nthat was there,--he was never rich, the gude auld man, for he dow\'d na\nsee onybody want.""He was indeed," said the stranger, with a faltering voice, "an admirable\nman,--that is, I have heard that he was so.So the ladies were left\nwithout fortune, as well as without a protector?""They will neither want the tane nor the tother while Lord Evandale\nlives," said Jenny; "he has been a true friend in their griefs.E\'en to\nthe house they live in is his lordship\'s; and never man, as my auld\ngudemother used to say, since the days of the Patriarch Jacob, served sae\nlang and sae sair for a wife as gude Lord Evandale has dune.""And why," said the stranger, with a voice that quivered with emotion,\n"why was he not sooner rewarded by the object of his attachment?""There was the lawsuit to be ended," said Jenny readily, "forby many\nother family arrangements.""Na, but," said Cuddie, "there was another reason forby; for the young\nleddy--"\n\n"Whisht, hand your tongue, and sup your sowens," said his wife; "I see\nthe gentleman\'s far frae weel, and downa eat our coarse supper.I wad\nkill him a chicken in an instant.""There is no occasion," said the stranger; "I shall want only a glass of\nwater, and to be left alone.""You\'ll gie yoursell the trouble then to follow me," said Jenny, lighting\na small lantern, "and I\'ll show you the way."Cuddie also proffered his assistance; but his wife reminded him, "That\nthe bairns would be left to fight thegither, and coup ane anither into\nthe fire," so that he remained to take charge of the menage.His wife led the way up a little winding path, which, after threading\nsome thickets of sweetbrier and honeysuckle, conducted to the back-door\nof a small garden.Jenny undid the latch, and they passed through an\nold-fashioned flower-garden, with its clipped yew hedges and formal\nparterres, to a glass-sashed door, which she opened with a master-key,\nand lighting a candle, which she placed upon a small work-table, asked\npardon for leaving him there for a few minutes, until she prepared his\napartment.She did not exceed five minutes in these preparations; but\nwhen she returned, was startled to find that the stranger had sunk\nforward with his head upon the table, in what she at first apprehended to\nbe a swoon.As she advanced to him, however, she could discover by his\nshort-drawn sobs that it was a paroxysm of mental agony.She prudently\ndrew back until he raised his head, and then showing herself, without\nseeming to have observed his agitation, informed him that his bed was\nprepared.The stranger gazed at her a moment, as if to collect the sense\nof her words.She repeated them; and only bending his head, as an\nindication that he understood her, he entered the apartment, the door of\nwhich she pointed out to him.It was a small bedchamber, used, as she\ninformed him, by Lord Evandale when a guest at Fairy Knowe, connecting,\non one side, with a little china-cabinet which opened to the garden, and\non the other, with a saloon, from which it was only separated by a thin\nwainscot partition.Having wished the stranger better health and good\nrest, Jenny descended as speedily as she could to her own mansion.she exclaimed to her helpmate as she entered, "I doubt\nwe\'re ruined folk!"returned the imperturbed\nCuddie, who was one of those persons who do not easily take alarm at\nanything."Wha d\' ye think yon gentleman is?Oh that ever ye suld hae asked him to\nlight here!""Why, wha the muckle deil d\'ye say he is?There\'s nae law against\nharbouring and intercommunicating now," said Cuddie; "sae, Whig or Tory,\nwhat need we care wha he be?""Ay, but it\'s ane will ding Lord Evandale\'s marriage ajee yet, if it\'s\nno the better looked to," said Jenny; "it\'s Miss Edith\'s first joe, your\nain auld maister, Cuddie."exclaimed Cuddie, starting up, "Crow ye that I am\nblind?"Ay, but, Cuddie lad," replied Jenny, "though ye are no blind, ye are no\nsae notice-taking as I am.""Weel, what for needs ye cast that up to me just now; or what did ye see\nabout the man that was like our Maister Harry?""I jaloused his keeping his face frae us,\nand speaking wi\' a madelike voice, sae I e\'en tried him wi\' some tales\no lang syne; and when I spake o\' the brose, ye ken, he didna just\nlaugh,--he\'s ower grave for that nowadays, but he gae a gledge wi\' his\nee that I kend he took up what I said.And a\' his distress is about Miss\nEdith\'s marriage; and I ne\'er saw a man mair taen down wi\' true love in\nmy days,--I might say man or woman, only I mind how ill Miss Edith was\nwhen she first gat word that him and you (ye muckle graceless loon) were\ncoming against Tillietudlem wi\' the rebels.--But what\'s the matter wi\'\nthe man now?""What\'s the matter wi\' me indeed!"said Cuddie, who was again hastily\nputting on some of the garments he had stripped himself of; "am I no gaun\nup this instant to see my maister?""Atweel, Cuddie, ye are gaun nae sic gate," said Jenny, coolly and\nresolutely."D \'ye think I am to be John\nTamson\'s man, and maistered by women a\' the days o\' my life?""And whase man wad ye be?And wha wad ye hae to maister ye but me,\nCuddie, lad?""I\'ll gar ye comprehend in the making of a\nhay-band.Naebody kens that this young gentleman is living but oursells;\nand frae that he keeps himsell up sae close, I am judging that he\'s\npurposing, if he fand Miss Edith either married, or just gaun to be\nmarried, he wad just slide awa easy, and gie them nae mair trouble.But\nif Miss Edith kend that he was living, and if she were standing before\nthe very minister wi\' Lord Evandale when it was tauld to her, I\'se\nwarrant she wad say No when she suld say Yes.""Weel," replied Cuddie, "and what\'s my business wi\' that?If Miss Edith\nlikes her auld joe better than her new ane, what for suld she no be free\nto change her mind like other folk?Ye ken, Jenny, Halliday aye threeps\nhe had a promise frae yoursell.""Halliday\'s a liar, and ye\'re naething but a gomeril to hearken till him,\nCuddie.And then for this leddy\'s choice, lack-a-day!ye may be sure a\'\nthe gowd Mr.Morton has is on the outside o\' his coat; and how can he\nkeep Leddy Margaret and the young leddy?""Nae doubt the auld laird left his\nhousekeeper the liferent, as he heard nought o\' his nephew; but it\'s but\nspeaking the auld wife fair, and they may a\' live brawly thegither, Leddy\nMargaret and a\'.""Rout tout, lad," replied Jenny; "ye ken them little to think leddies o\'\ntheir rank wad set up house wi\' auld Ailie Wilson, when they\'re maist\nower proud to take favours frae Lord Evandale himsell.Na, na, they maun\nfollow the camp, if she tak Morton.""That wad sort ill wi\' the auld leddy, to be sure," said Cuddie; "she wad\nhardly win ower a lang day in the baggage-wain.""Then sic a flyting as there wad be between them, a\' about Whig and\nTory," continued Jenny."To be sure," said Cuddie, "the auld leddy\'s unto kittle in thae\npoints.""And then, Cuddie," continued his helpmate, who had reserved her\nstrongest argument to the last, "if this marriage wi\' Lord Evandale is\nbroken off, what comes o\' our ain bit free house, and the kale-yard, and\nthe cow\'s grass?I trow that baith us and thae bonny bairns will be\nturned on the wide warld!"Here Jenny began to whimper; Cuddie writhed himself this way and that\nway, the very picture of indecision.At length he broke out, "Weel,\nwoman, canna ye tell us what we suld do, without a\' this din about it?""Just do naething at a\'," said Jenny."Never seem to ken onything about\nthis gentleman, and for your life say a word that he suld hae been here,\nor up at the house!An I had kend, I wad hae gien him my ain bed, and\nsleepit in the byre or he had gane up by; but it canna be helpit now.The\nneist thing\'s to get him cannily awa the morn, and I judge he\'ll be in\nnae hurry to come back again."said Cuddie; "and maun I no speak to him, then?""For your life, no," said Jenny."Ye\'re no obliged to ken him; and I\nwadna hae tauld ye, only I feared ye wad ken him in the morning.""Aweel," said Cuddie, sighing heavily, "I\'se awa to pleugh the outfield\nthen; for if I am no to speak to him, I wad rather be out o\' the gate.""Very right, my dear hinny," replied Jenny."Naebody has better sense than\nyou when ye crack a bit wi\' me ower your affairs; but ye suld ne\'er do\nonything aff hand out o\' your ain head.""Ane wad think it\'s true," quoth Cuddie; "for I hae aye had some carline\nor quean or another to gar me gang their gate instead o\' my ain.There\nwas first my mither," he continued, as he undressed and tumbled himself\ninto bed; "then there was Leddy Margaret didna let me ca\' my soul my ain;\nthen my mither and her quarrelled, and pu\'ed me twa ways at anes, as if\nilk ane had an end o\' me, like Punch and the Deevil rugging about the\nBaker at the fair; and now I hae gotten a wife," he murmured in\ncontinuation, as he stowed the blankets around his person, "and she\'s\nlike to tak the guiding o\' me a\' thegither.""And amna I the best guide ye ever had in a\' your life?"said Jenny, as\nshe closed the conversation by assuming her place beside her husband and\nextinguishing the candle.Leaving this couple to their repose, we have next to inform the reader\nthat, early on the next morning, two ladies on horseback, attended by\ntheir servants, arrived at the house of Fairy Knowe, whom, to Jenny\'s\nutter confusion, she instantly recognised as Miss Bellenden and Lady\nEmily Hamilton, a sister of Lord Evandale."Had I no better gang to the house to put things to rights?"said Jenny,\nconfounded with this unexpected apparition."We want nothing but the pass-key," said Miss Bellenden; "Gudyill will\nopen the windows of the little parlour.""The little parlour\'s locked, and the lock\'s, spoiled," answered Jenny,\nwho recollected the local spmpathy between that apartment and the\nbedchamber of her guest."In the red parlour, then," said Miss Bellenden, and rode up to the front\nof the house, but by an approach different from that through which Morton\nhad been conducted."All will be out," thought Jenny, "unless I can get him smuggled out of\nthe house the back way."So saying, she sped up the bank in great tribulation and uncertainty."I had better hae said at ante there was a stranger there," was her next\nnatural reflection."But then they wad hae been for asking him to\nbreakfast.what will I do?--And there\'s Gudyill walking in\nthe garden too!"she exclaimed internally on approaching the wicket; "and\nI daurna gang in the back way till he\'s aff the coast.In this state of perplexity she approached the cidevant butler, with the\npurpose of decoying him out of the garden.But John Gudyill\'s temper was\nnot improved by his decline in rank and increase in years.Like many\npeevish people, too, he seemed to have an intuitive perception as to what\nwas most likely to teaze those whom he conversed with; and, on the\npresent occasion, all Jenny\'s efforts to remove him from the garden\nserved only to root him in it as fast as if he had been one of the\nshrubs.Unluckily, also, he had commenced florist during his residence at Fairy\nKnowe; and, leaving all other things to the charge of Lady Emily\'s\nservant, his first care was dedicated to the flowers, which he had taken\nunder his special protection, and which he propped, dug, and watered,\nprosing all the while upon their respective merits to poor Jenny, who\nstood by him trembling and almost crying with anxiety, fear, and\nimpatience.Fate seemed determined to win a match against Jenny this unfortunate\nmorning.As soon as the ladies entered the house, they observed that the\ndoor of the little parlour--the very apartment out of which she was\ndesirous of excluding them on account of its contiguity to the room in\nwhich Morton slept--was not only unlocked, but absolutely ajar.Miss\nBellenden was too much engaged with her own immediate subjects of\nreflection to take much notice of the circumstance, but, desiring the\nservant to open the window-shutters, walked into the room along with her\nfriend."He is not yet come," she said.Why\nexpress so anxious a wish that we should meet him here?And why not come\nto Castle Dinnan, as he proposed?I own, my dear Emily, that, even\nengaged as we are to each other, and with the sanction of your presence,\nI do not feel that I have done quite right in indulging him.""Evandale was never capricious," answered his sister; "I am sure he will\nsatisfy us with his reasons, and if he does not, I will help you to scold\nhim.""What I chiefly fear," said Edith, "is his having engaged in some of the\nplots of this fluctuating and unhappy time.I know his heart is with that\ndreadful Claverhouse and his army, and I believe he would have joined\nthem ere now but for my uncle\'s death, which gave him so much additional\ntrouble on our account.How singular that one so rational and so deeply\nsensible of the errors of the exiled family should be ready to risk all\nfor their restoration!"answered Lady Emily,--"it is a point of honour with\nEvandale.Our family have always been loyal; he served long in the\nGuards; the Viscount of Dundee was his commander and his friend for\nyears; he is looked on with an evil eye by many of his own relations, who\nset down his inactivity to the score of want of spirit.You must be\naware, my dear Edith, how often family connections and early\npredilections influence our actions more than abstract arguments.But I\ntrust Evandale will continue quiet,--though, to tell you truth, I believe\nyou are the only one who can keep him so.""You can furnish him with the Scriptural apology for not going forth with\nthe host,--\'he has married a wife, and therefore cannot come.\'""I have promised," said Edith, in a faint voice; "but I trust I shall not\nbe urged on the score of time.""Nay," said Lady Emily, "I will leave Evandale (and here he comes) to\nplead his own cause.""Stay, stay, for God\'s sake!"said Edith, endeavouring to detain her."Not I, not I," said the young lady, making her escape; "the third person\nmakes a silly figure on such occasions.When you want me for breakfast, I\nwill be found in the willow-walk by the river."As she tripped out of the room, Lord Evandale entered."Good-morrow,\nBrother, and good-by till breakfast-time," said the lively young lady;\n"I trust you will give Miss Bellenden some good reasons for disturbing\nher rest so early in the morning."And so saying, she left them together, without waiting a reply."And now, my lord," said Edith, "may I desire to know the meaning of your\nsingular request to meet you here at so early an hour?"She was about to add that she hardly felt herself excusable in having\ncomplied with it; but upon looking at the person whom she addressed, she\nwas struck dumb by the singular and agitated expression of his\ncountenance, and interrupted herself to exclaim, "For God\'s sake, what is\nthe matter?""His Majesty\'s faithful subjects have gained a great and most decisive\nvictory near Blair of Athole; but, alas!my gallant friend Lord Dundee--"\n\n"Has fallen?"said Edith, anticipating the rest of his tidings."True, most true: he has fallen in the arms of victory, and not a man\nremains of talents and influence sufficient to fill up his loss in King\nJames\'s service.This, Edith, is no time for temporizing with our duty.I\nhave given directions to raise my followers, and I must take leave of you\nthis evening.""Do not think of it, my lord," answered Edith; "your life is--essential\nto your friends,--do not throw it away in an adventure so rash.What can\nyour single arm, and the few tenants or servants who might follow you, do\nagainst the force of almost all Scotland, the Highland clans only\nexcepted?""Listen to me, Edith," said Lord Evandale."I am not so rash as you may\nsuppose me, nor are my present motives of such light importance as to\naffect only those personally dependent on myself.The Life Guards, with\nwhom I served so long, although new-modelled and new-officered by the\nPrince of Orange, retain a predilection for the cause of their rightful\nmaster; and "--and here he whispered as if he feared even the walls of\nthe apartment had ears--"when my foot is known to be in the stirrup, two\nregiments of cavalry have sworn to renounce the usurper\'s service, and\nfight under my orders.They delayed only till Dundee should descend into\nthe Lowlands; but since he is no more, which of his successors dare take\nthat decisive step, unless encouraged by the troops declaring themselves!Meantime, the zeal of the soldiers will die away.I must bring them to a\ndecision while their hearts are glowing with the victory their old leader\nhas obtained, and burning to avenge his untimely death.""And will you, on the faith of such men as you know these soldiers to\nbe," said Edith, "take a part of such dreadful moment?""I will," said Lord Evandale,--"I must; my honour and loyalty are both\npledged for it.""And all for the sake," continued Miss Bellenden, "of a prince whose\nmeasures, while he was on the throne, no one could condemn more than Lord\nEvandale?""Most true," replied Lord Evandale; "and as I resented, even during the\nplenitude of his power, his innovations on Church and State, like a\nfreeborn subject, I am determined I will assert his real rights, when he\nis in adversity, like a loyal one.Let courtiers and sycophants flatter\npower and desert misfortune; I will neither do the one nor the other.""And if you are determined to act what my feeble judgment must still term\nrashly, why give yourself the pain of this untimely meeting?""Were it not enough to answer," said Lord Evandale, "that, ere rushing on\nbattle, I wished to bid adieu to my betrothed bride?Surely it is judging\ncoldly of my feelings, and showing too plainly the indifference of your\nown, to question my motive for a request so natural.""But why in this place, my lord," said Edith; "and why with such peculiar\ncircumstances of mystery?""Because," he replied, putting a letter into her hand, "I have yet\nanother request, which I dare hardly proffer, even when prefaced by these\ncredentials."In haste and terror, Edith glanced over the letter, which was from her\ngrandmother."My dearest childe," such was its tenor in style and spelling, "I\n     never more deeply regretted the reumatizm, which disqualified me\n     from riding on horseback, than at this present writing, when I would\n     most have wished to be where this paper will soon be, that is at\n     Fairy Knowe, with my poor dear Willie\'s only child.But it is the\n     will of God I should not be with her, which I conclude to be the\n     case, as much for the pain I now suffer, as because it hath now not\n     given way either to cammomile poultices or to decoxion of wild\n     mustard, wherewith I have often relieved others.Therefore, I must\n     tell you, by writing instead of word of mouth, that, as my young\n     Lord Evandale is called to the present campaign, both by his honour\n     and his duty, he hath earnestly solicited me that the bonds of holy\n     matrimony be knitted before his departure to the wars between you\n     and him, in implement of the indenture formerly entered into for\n     that effeck, whereuntill, as I see no raisonable objexion, so I\n     trust that you, who have been always a good and obedient childe,\n     will not devize any which has less than raison.It is trew that the\n     contrax of our house have heretofore been celebrated in a manner\n     more befitting our Rank, and not in private, and with few witnesses,\n     as a thing done in a corner.But it has been Heaven\'s own free will,\n     as well as those of the kingdom where we live, to take away from us\n     our estate, and from the King his throne.Yet I trust He will yet\n     restore the rightful heir to the throne, and turn his heart to the\n     true Protestant Episcopal faith, which I have the better right to\n     expect to see even with my old eyes, as I have beheld the royal\n     family when they were struggling as sorely with masterful usurpers\n     and rebels as they are now; that is to say, when his most sacred\n     Majesty, Charles the Second of happy memory, honoured our poor house\n     of Tillietudlem by taking his _disjune_ therein," etc., etc., etc.We will not abuse the reader\'s patience by quoting more of Lady\nMargaret\'s prolix epistle.Suffice it to say that it closed by laying her\ncommands on her grandchild to consent to the solemnization of her\nmarriage without loss of time."I never thought till this instant," said Edith, dropping the letter from\nher hand, "that Lord Evandale would have acted ungenerously.""And how can you apply such a\nterm to my desire to call you mine, ere I part from you, perhaps for\never?""Lord Evandale ought to have remembered," said Edith, "that when his\nperseverance, and, I must add, a due sense of his merit and of the\nobligations we owed him, wrung from me a slow consent that I would one\nday comply with his wishes, I made it my condition that I should not be\npressed to a hasty accomplishment of my promise; and now he avails\nhimself of his interest with my only remaining relative to hurry me with\nprecipitate and even indelicate importunity.There is more selfishness\nthan generosity, my lord, in such eager and urgent solicitation."Lord Evandale, evidently much hurt, took two or three turns through the\napartment ere he replied to this accusation; at length he spoke: "I\nshould have escaped this painful charge, durst I at once have mentioned\nto Miss Bellendon my principal reason for urging this request.It is one\nwhich she will probably despise on her own account, but which ought to\nweigh with her for the sake of Lady Margaret.My death in battle must\ngive my whole estate to my heirs of entail; my forfeiture as a traitor,\nby the usurping Government, may vest it in the Prince of Orange or some\nDutch favourite.In either case, my venerable friend and betrothed bride\nmust remain unprotected and in poverty.Vested with the rights and\nprovisions of Lady Evandale, Edith will find, in the power of supporting\nher aged parent, some consolation for having condescended to share the\ntitles and fortunes of one who does not pretend to be worthy of her."Edith was struck dumb by an argument which she had not expected, and was\ncompelled to acknowledge that Lord Evandale\'s suit was urged with\ndelicacy as well as with consideration."And yet," she said, "such is the waywardness with which my heart reverts\nto former times that I cannot," she burst into tears, "suppress a degree\nof ominous reluctance at fulfilling my engagement upon such a brief\nsummons.""We have already fully considered this painful subject," said Lord\nEvandale; "and I hoped, my dear Edith, your own inquiries, as well as\nmine, had fully convinced you that these regrets were fruitless."said Edith, with a deep sigh, which, as if by an\nunexpected echo, was repeated from the adjoining apartment.Miss\nBellenden started at the sound, and scarcely composed herself upon Lord\nEvandale\'s assurances that she had heard but the echo of her own\nrespiration."It sounded strangely distinct," she said, "and almost ominous; but my\nfeelings are so harassed that the slightest trifle agitates them."Lord Evandale eagerly attempted to soothe her alarm, and reconcile her to\na measure which, however hasty, appeared to him the only means by which\nhe could secure her independence.He urged his claim in virtue of the\ncontract, her grandmother\'s wish and command, the propriety of insuring\nher comfort and independence, and touched lightly on his own long\nattachment, which he had evinced by so many and such various services.These Edith felt the more, the less they were insisted upon; and at\nlength, as she had nothing to oppose to his ardour, excepting a causeless\nreluctance which she herself was ashamed to oppose against so much\ngenerosity, she was compelled to rest upon the impossibility of having\nthe ceremony performed upon such hasty notice, at such a time and place.But for all this Lord Evandale was prepared, and he explained, with\njoyful alacrity, that the former chaplain of his regiment was in\nattendance at the Lodge with a faithful domestic, once a non-commissioned\nofficer in the same corps; that his sister was also possessed of the\nsecret; and that Headrigg and his wife might be added to the list of\nwitnesses, if agreeable to Miss Bellenden.As to the place, he had chosen\nit on very purpose.The marriage was to remain a secret, since Lord\nEvandale was to depart in disguise very soon after it was solemnized,--a\ncircumstance which, had their union been public, must have drawn upon him\nthe attention of the Government, as being altogether unaccountable,\nunless from his being engaged in some dangerous design.Having hastily\nurged these motives and explained his arrangements, he ran, without\nwaiting for an answer, to summon his sister to attend his bride, while he\nwent in search of the other persons whose presence was necessary.When Lady Emily arrived, she found her friend in an agony of tears, of\nwhich she was at some loss to comprehend the reason, being one of those\ndamsels who think there is nothing either wonderful or terrible in\nmatrimony, and joining with most who knew him in thinking that it could\nnot be rendered peculiarly alarming by Lord Evandale being the\nbridegroom.Influenced by these feelings, she exhausted in succession all\nthe usual arguments for courage, and all the expressions of sympathy and\ncondolence ordinarily employed on such occasions.But when Lady Emily\nbeheld her future sister-in-law deaf to all those ordinary topics of\nconsolation; when she beheld tears follow fast and without intermission\ndown cheeks as pale as marble; when she felt that the hand which she\npressed in order to enforce her arguments turned cold within her grasp,\nand lay, like that of a corpse, insensible and unresponsive to her\ncaresses, her feelings of sympathy gave way to those of hurt pride and\npettish displeasure."I must own," she said, "that I am something at a loss to understand all\nthis, Miss Bellenden.Months have passed since you agreed to marry my\nbrother, and you have postponed the fulfilment of your engagement from\none period to another, as if you had to avoid some dishonourable or\nhighly disagreeable connection.I think I can answer for Lord Evandale\nthat he will seek no woman\'s hand against her inclination; and, though\nhis sister, I may boldly say that he does not need to urge any lady\nfurther than her inclinations carry her.You will forgive me, Miss\nBellenden; but your present distress augurs ill for my brother\'s future\nhappiness, and I must needs say that he does not merit all these\nexpressions of dislike and dolour, and that they seem an odd return for\nan attachment which he has manifested so long, and in so many ways.""You are right, Lady Emily," said Edith, drying her eyes and endeavouring\nto resume her natural manner, though still betrayed by her faltering\nvoice and the paleness of her cheeks,--"you are quite right; Lord\nEvandale merits such usage from no one, least of all from her whom he has\nhonoured with his regard.But if I have given way, for the last time, to\na sudden and irresistible burst of feeling, it is my consolation, Lady\nEmily, that your brother knows the cause, that I have hid nothing from\nhim, and that he at least is not apprehensive of finding in Edith\nBellenden a wife undeserving of his affection.But still you are right,\nand I merit your censure for indulging for a moment fruitless regret and\npainful remembrances.It shall be so no longer; my lot is cast with\nEvandale, and with him I am resolved to bear it.Nothing shall in future\noccur to excite his complaints or the resentment of his relations; no\nidle recollections of other days shall intervene to prevent the zealous\nand affectionate discharge of my duty; no vain illusions recall the\nmemory of other days--"\n\nAs she spoke these words, she slowly raised her eyes, which had before\nbeen hidden by her hand, to the latticed window of her apartment, which\nwas partly open, uttered a dismal shriek, and fainted.Lady Emily turned\nher eyes in the same direction, but saw only the shadow of a man, which\nseemed to disappear from the window, and, terrified more by the state of\nEdith than by the apparition she had herself witnessed, she uttered\nshriek upon shriek for assistance.Her brother soon arrived, with the\nchaplain and Jenny Dennison; but strong and vigorous remedies were\nnecessary ere they could recall Miss Bellenden to sense and motion.Even\nthen her language was wild and incoherent.[Illustration: Uttered A Dismal Shriek, And Fainted--224]\n\n\n"Press me no farther," she said to Lord Evandale,--"it cannot be; Heaven\nand earth, the living and the dead, have leagued themselves against this\nill-omened union.Take all I can give,--my sisterly regard, my devoted\nfriendship.I will love you as a sister and serve you as a bondswoman,\nbut never speak to me more of marriage."The astonishment of Lord Evandale may easily be conceived."Emily," he said to his sister, "this is your doing.I was accursed when\nI thought of bringing you here; some of your confounded folly has driven\nher mad!""On my word, Brother," answered Lady Emily, "you\'re sufficient to drive\nall the women in Scotland mad.Because your mistress seems much disposed\nto jilt you, you quarrel with your sister, who has been arguing in your\ncause, and had brought her to a quiet hearing, when, all of a sudden, a\nman looked in at a window, whom her crazed sensibility mistook either for\nyou or some one else, and has treated us gratis with an excellent tragic\nscene."said Lord Evandale, in impatient displeasure."Miss Bellenden is incapable of trifling with me; and yet what else could\nhave--"\n\n"Hush!said Jenny, whose interest lay particularly in shifting\nfurther inquiry; "for Heaven\'s sake, my lord, speak low, for my lady\nbegins to recover."Edith was no sooner somewhat restored to herself than she begged, in a\nfeeble voice, to be left alone with Lord Evandale.All retreated,--Jenny\nwith her usual air of officious simplicity, Lady Emily and the chaplain\nwith that of awakened curiosity.No sooner had they left the apartment\nthan Edith beckoned Lord Evandale to sit beside her on the couch; her\nnext motion was to take his hand, in spite of his surprised resistance,\nto her lips; her last was to sink from her seat and to clasp his knees.I must deal most\nuntruly by you, and break a solemn engagement.You have my friendship, my\nhighest regard, my most sincere gratitude; you have more,--you have my\nword and my faith; but--oh, forgive me, for the fault is not mine--you\nhave not my love, and I cannot marry you without a sin!""You dream, my dearest Edith!"said Evandale, perplexed in the utmost\ndegree, "you let your imagination beguile you; this is but some delusion\nof an over-sensitive mind.The person whom you preferred to me has been\nlong in a better world, where your unavailing regret cannot follow him,\nor, if it could, would only diminish his happiness.""You are mistaken, Lord Evandale," said Edith, solemnly; "I am not a\nsleep-walker or a madwoman.No, I could not have believed from any one\nwhat I have seen.But, having seen him, I must believe mine own eyes."asked Lord Evandale, in great anxiety."Henry Morton," replied Edith, uttering these two words as if they were\nher last, and very nearly fainting when she had done so."Miss Bellenden," said Lord Evandale, "you treat me like a fool or a\nchild.If you repent your engagement to me," he continued, indignantly,\n"I am not a man to enforce it against your inclination; but deal with me\nas a man, and forbear this trifling."He was about to go on, when he perceived, from her quivering eye and\npallid cheek, that nothing less than imposture was intended, and that by\nwhatever means her imagination had been so impressed, it was really\ndisturbed by unaffected awe and terror.He changed his tone, and exerted\nall his eloquence in endeavouring to soothe and extract from her the\nsecret cause of such terror.she repeated,--"I saw Henry Morton stand at that window, and\nlook into the apartment at the moment I was on the point of abjuring him\nfor ever.His face was darker, thinner, and paler than it was wont to be;\nhis dress was a horseman\'s cloak, and hat looped down over his face; his\nexpression was like that he wore on that dreadful morning when he was\nexamined by Claverhouse at Tillietudlem.Ask your sister, ask Lady Emily,\nif she did not see him as well as I. I know what has called him up,--he\ncame to upbraid me, that, while my heart was with him in the deep and\ndead sea, I was about to give my hand to another.My lord, it is ended\nbetween you and me; be the consequences what they will, she cannot marry\nwhose union disturbs the repose of the dead."said Evandale, as he paced the room, half mad himself with\nsurprise and vexation, "her fine understanding must be totally\noverthrown, and that by the effort which she has made to comply with my\nill-timed, though well-meant, request.Without rest and attention her\nhealth is ruined for ever."At this moment the door opened, and Halliday, who had been Lord\nEvandale\'s principal personal attendant since they both left the Guards\non the Revolution, stumbled into the room with a countenance as pale and\nghastly as terror could paint it."What is the matter next, Halliday?""Any\ndiscovery of the--"\n\nHe had just recollection sufficient to stop short in the midst of the\ndangerous sentence."No, sir," said Halliday, "it is not that, nor anything like that; but I\nhave seen a ghost!"said Lord Evandale, forced altogether out\nof his patience."Has all mankind sworn to go mad in order to drive me\nso?"The ghost of Henry Morton, the Whig captain at Bothwell Bridge," replied\nHalliday."He passed by me like a fire-flaught when I was in the garden!""This is midsummer madness," said Lord Evandale, "or there is some\nstrange villainy afloat.Jenny, attend your lady to her chamber, while I\nendeavour to find a clue to all this."But Lord Evandale\'s inquiries were in vain.Jenny, who might have given\n(had she chosen) a very satisfactory explanation, had an interest to\nleave the matter in darkness; and interest was a matter which now weighed\nprincipally with Jenny, since the possession of an active and\naffectionate husband in her own proper right had altogether allayed her\nspirit of coquetry.She had made the best use of the first moments of\nconfusion hastily to remove all traces of any one having slept in the\napartment adjoining to the parlour, and even to erase the mark of\nfootsteps beneath the window, through which she conjectured Morton\'s face\nhad been seen, while attempting, ere he left the garden, to gain one look\nat her whom he had so long loved, and was now on the point of losing for\never.That he had passed Halliday in the garden was equally clear; and\nshe learned from her elder boy, whom she had employed to have the\nstranger\'s horse saddled and ready for his departure, that he had rushed\ninto the stable, thrown the child a broad gold piece, and, mounting his\nhorse, had ridden with fearful rapidity down towards the Clyde.The\nsecret was, therefore, in their own family, and Jenny was resolved it\nshould remain so."For, to be sure," she said, "although her lady and Halliday kend Mr.Morton by broad daylight, that was nae reason I suld own to kenning him\nin the gloaming and by candlelight, and him keeping his face frae Cuddie\nand me a\' the time."So she stood resolutely upon the negative when examined by Lord Evandale.As for Halliday, he could only say that as he entered the garden-door,\nthe supposed apparition met him, walking swiftly, and with a visage on\nwhich anger and grief appeared to be contending."He knew him well," he said, "having been repeatedly guard upon him, and\nobliged to write down his marks of stature and visage in case of escape.But what should make him\nhaunt the country where he was neither hanged nor shot, he, the said\nHalliday, did not pretend to conceive.Lady Emily confessed she had seen the face of a man at the window, but\nher evidence went no farther.John Gudyill deponed _nil novit in causa_.He had left his gardening to get his morning dram just at the time when\nthe apparition had taken place.Lady Emily\'s servant was waiting orders\nin the kitchen, and there was not another being within a quarter of a\nmile of the house.Lord Evandale returned perplexed and dissatisfied in the highest degree\nat beholding a plan which he thought necessary not less for the\nprotection of Edith in contingent circumstances, than for the assurance\nof his own happiness, and which he had brought so very near perfection,\nthus broken off without any apparent or rational cause.His knowledge of\nEdith\'s character set her beyond the suspicion of covering any capricious\nchange of determination by a pretended vision.But he would have set the\napparition down to the influence of an overstrained imagination, agitated\nby the circumstances in which she had so suddenly been placed, had it not\nbeen for the coinciding testimony of Halliday, who had no reason for\nthinking of Morton more than any other person, and knew nothing of Miss\nBellenden\'s vision when he promulgated his own.On the other hand, it\nseemed in the highest degree improbable that Morton, so long and so\nvainly sought after, and who was, with such good reason, supposed to be\nlost when the "Vryheid" of Rotterdam went down with crew and passengers,\nshould be alive and lurking in this country, where there was no longer\nany reason why he should not openly show himself, since the present\nGovernment favoured his party in politics.When Lord Evandale reluctantly\nbrought himself to communicate these doubts to the chaplain, in order to\nobtain his opinion, he could only obtain a long lecture on demonology, in\nwhich, after quoting Delrio and Burthoog and De L\'Ancre on the subject of\napparitions, together with sundry civilians and common lawyers on the\nnature of testimony, the learned gentleman expressed his definite and\ndetermined opinion to be, either that there had been an actual apparition\nof the deceased Henry Morton\'s spirit, the possibility of which he was,\nas a divine and a philosopher, neither fully prepared to admit or to\ndeny; or else that the said Henry Morton, being still in _rerum natura_,\nhad appeared in his proper person that morning; or, finally, that some\nstrong _deceptio visus_, or striking similitude of person, had deceived\nthe eyes of Miss Bellenden and of Thomas Halliday.Which of these was the\nmost probable hypothesis, the doctor declined to pronounce, but expressed\nhimself ready to die in the opinion that one or other of them had\noccasioned that morning\'s disturbance.Lord Evandale soon had additional cause for distressful anxiety.Miss\nBellenden was declared to be dangerously ill."I will not leave this place," he exclaimed, "till she is pronounced to\nbe in safety.I neither can nor ought to do so; for whatever may have\nbeen the immediate occasion of her illness, I gave the first cause for it\nby my unhappy solicitation."He established himself, therefore, as a guest in the family, which the\npresence of his sister, as well as of Lady Margaret Bellenden (who, in\ndespite of her rheumatism, caused herself to be transported thither when\nshe heard of her granddaughter\'s illness), rendered a step equally\nnatural and delicate.And thus he anxiously awaited until, without injury\nto her health, Edith could sustain a final explanation ere his departure\non his expedition."She shall never," said the generous young man, "look on her engagement\nwith me as the means of fettering her to a union, the idea of which seems\nalmost to unhinge her understanding."Where once my careless childhood strayed,\n               A stranger yet to pain.Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College.It is not by corporal wants and infirmities only that men of the most\ndistinguished talents are levelled, during their lifetime, with the\ncommon mass of mankind.There are periods of mental agitation when the\nfirmest of mortals must be ranked with the weakest of his brethren, and\nwhen, in paying the general tax of humanity, his distresses are even\naggravated by feeling that he transgresses, in the indulgence of his\ngrief, the rules of religion and philosophy by which he endeavours in\ngeneral to regulate his passions and his actions.It was during such a\nparoxysm that the unfortunate Morton left Fairy Knowe.To know that his\nlong-loved and still-beloved Edith, whose image had filled his mind for\nso many years, was on the point of marriage to his early rival, who had\nlaid claim to her heart by so many services as hardly left her a title to\nrefuse his addresses, bitter as the intelligence was, yet came not as an\nunexpected blow.During his residence abroad he had once written to Edith.It was to bid\nher farewell for ever, and to conjure her to forget him.He had requested\nher not to answer his letter; yet he half hoped, for many a day, that she\nmight transgress his injunction.The letter never reached her to whom it\nwas addressed, and Morton, ignorant of its miscarriage, could only\nconclude himself laid aside and forgotten, according to his own\nself-denying request.All that he had heard of their mutual relations\nsince his return to Scotland prepared him to expect that he could only\nlook upon Miss Bellenden as the betrothed bride of Lord Evandale; and\neven if freed from the burden of obligation to the latter, it would still\nhave been inconsistent with Morton\'s generosity of disposition to disturb\ntheir arrangements, by attempting the assertion of a claim proscribed by\nabsence, never sanctioned by the consent of friends, and barred by a\nthousand circumstances of difficulty.Why then did he seek the cottage\nwhich their broken fortunes had now rendered the retreat of Lady Margaret\nBellenden and her granddaughter?He yielded, we are under the necessity\nof acknowledging, to the impulse of an inconsistent wish which many might\nhave felt in his situation.Accident apprised him, while travelling towards his native district, that\nthe ladies, near whose mansion he must necessarily pass, were absent; and\nlearning that Cuddie and his wife acted as their principal domestics, he\ncould not resist pausing at their cottage to learn, if possible, the real\nprogress which Lord Evandale had made in the affections of Miss Bellen\nden--alas!This rash experiment ended as we have\nrelated, and he parted from the house of Fairy Knowe, conscious that he\nwas still beloved by Edith, yet compelled, by faith and honour, to\nrelinquish her for ever.With what feelings he must have listened to the\ndialogue between Lord Evandale and Edith, the greater part of which he\ninvoluntarily overheard, the reader must conceive, for we dare not\nattempt to describe them.An hundred times he was tempted to burst upon\ntheir interview, or to exclaim aloud, "Edith, I yet live!"and as often\nthe recollection of her plighted troth, and of the debt of gratitude\nwhich he owed Lord Evandale (to whose influence with Claverhouse he\njustly ascribed his escape from torture and from death), withheld him\nfrom a rashness which might indeed have involved all in further distress,\nbut gave little prospect of forwarding his own happiness.He repressed\nforcibly these selfish emotions, though with an agony which thrilled his\nevery nerve.was his internal oath, "never will I add a thorn to thy\npillow.That which Heaven has ordained, let it be; and let me not add, by\nmy selfish sorrows, one atom\'s weight to the burden thou hast to bear.I\nwas dead to thee when thy resolution was adopted; and never, never shalt\nthou know that Henry Morton still lives!"As he formed this resolution, diffident of his own power to keep it, and\nseeking that firmness in flight which was every moment shaken by his\ncontinuing within hearing of Edith\'s voice, he hastily rushed from his\napartment by the little closet and the sashed door which led to the\ngarden.But firmly as he thought his resolution was fixed, he could not leave the\nspot where the last tones of a voice so beloved still vibrated on his\near, without endeavouring to avail himself of the opportunity which the\nparlour window afforded to steal one last glance at the lovely speaker.It was in this attempt, made while Edith seemed to have her eyes\nunalterably bent upon the ground, that Morton\'s presence was detected by\nher raising them suddenly.So soon as her wild scream made this known to\nthe unfortunate object of a passion so constant, and which seemed so\nill-fated, he hurried from the place as if pursued by the furies.He\npassed Halliday in the garden without recognising or even being sensible\nthat he had seen him, threw himself on his horse, and, by a sort of\ninstinct rather than recollection, took the first by-road in preference\nto the public route to Hamilton.In all probability this prevented Lord Evandale from learning that he was\nactually in existence; for the news that the Highlanders had obtained a\ndecisive victory at Killiecrankie had occasioned an accurate look-out to\nbe kept, by order of the Government, on all the passes, for fear of some\ncommotion among the Lowland Jacobites.They did not omit to post\nsentinels on Bothwell Bridge; and as these men had not seen any traveller\npass westward in that direction, and as, besides, their comrades\nstationed in the village of Bothwell were equally positive that none had\ngone eastward, the apparition, in the existence of which Edith and\nHalliday were equally positive, became yet more mysterious in the\njudgment of Lord Evandale, who was finally inclined to settle in the\nbelief that the heated and disturbed imagination of Edith had summoned up\nthe phantom she stated herself to have seen, and that Halliday had, in\nsome unaccountable manner, been infected by the same superstition.Meanwhile, the by-path which Morton pursued, with all the speed which his\nvigorous horse could exert, brought him in a very few seconds to the\nbrink of the Clyde, at a spot marked with the feet of horses, who were\nconducted to it as a watering-place.The steed, urged as he was to the\ngallop, did not pause a single instant, but, throwing himself into the\nriver, was soon beyond his depth.The plunge which the animal made as his\nfeet quitted the ground, with the feeling that the cold water rose above\nhis swordbelt, were the first incidents which recalled Morton, whose\nmovements had been hitherto mechanical, to the necessity of taking\nmeasures for preserving himself and the noble animal which he bestrode.A\nperfect master of all manly exercises, the management of a horse in water\nwas as familiar to him as when upon a meadow.He directed the animal\'s\ncourse somewhat down the stream towards a low plain, or holm, which\nseemed to promise an easy egress from the river.In the first and second\nattempt to get on shore, the horse was frustrated by the nature of the\nground, and nearly fell backwards on his rider.The instinct of\nself-preservation seldom fails, even in the most desperate circumstances,\nto recall the human mind to some degree of equipoise, unless when\naltogether distracted by terror, and Morton was obliged to the danger in\nwhich he was placed for complete recovery of his self-possession.A third\nattempt, at a spot more carefully and judiciously selected, succeeded\nbetter than the former, and placed the horse and his rider in safety upon\nthe farther and left-hand bank of the Clyde."But whither," said Morton, in the bitterness of his heart, "am I now to\ndirect my course?or rather, what does it signify to which point of the\ncompass a wretch so forlorn betakes himself?I would to God, could the\nwish be without a sin, that these dark waters had flowed over me, and\ndrowned my recollection of that which was, and that which is!"The sense of impatience, which the disturbed state of his feelings had\noccasioned, scarcely had vented itself in these violent expressions, ere\nhe was struck with shame at having given way to such a paroxysm.He\nremembered how signally the life which he now held so lightly in the\nbitterness of his disappointment had been preserved through the almost\nincessant perils which had beset him since he entered upon his public\ncareer.he said, "and worse than a fool, to set light by that\nexistence which Heaven has so often preserved in the most marvellous\nmanner.Something there yet remains for me in this world, were it only to\nbear my sorrows like a man, and to aid those who need my assistance.What\nhave I seen, what have I heard, but the very conclusion of that which I\nknew was to happen?They"--he durst not utter their names even in\nsoliloquy--"they are embarrassed and in difficulties.She is stripped of\nher inheritance, and he seems rushing on some dangerous career, with\nwhich, but for the low voice in which he spoke, I might have become\nacquainted.Are there no means to aid or to warn them?"As he pondered upon this topic, forcibly withdrawing his mind from his\nown disappointment, and compelling his attention to the affairs of Edith\nand her betrothed husband, the letter of Burley, long forgotten, suddenly\nrushed on his memory, like a ray of light darting through a mist."Their ruin must have been his work," was his internal conclusion."If it\ncan be repaired, it must be through his means, or by information obtained\nfrom him.Stern, crafty, and enthusiastic as he\nis, my plain and downright rectitude of purpose has more than once\nprevailed with him.I will seek him out, at least; and who knows what\ninfluence the information I may acquire from him may have on the fortunes\nof those whom I shall never see more, and who will probably never learn\nthat I am now suppressing my own grief, to add, if possible, to their\nhappiness."Animated by these hopes, though the foundation was but slight, he sought\nthe nearest way to the high-road; and as all the tracks through the\nvalley were known to him since he hunted through them in youth, he had no\nother difficulty than that of surmounting one or two enclosures, ere he\nfound himself on the road to the small burgh where the feast of the\npopinjay had been celebrated.He journeyed in a state of mind sad indeed\nand dejected, yet relieved from its earlier and more intolerable state of\nanguish; for virtuous resolution and manly disinterestedness seldom fail\nto restore tranquillity even where they cannot create happiness.He\nturned his thoughts with strong effort upon the means of discovering\nBurley, and the chance there was of extracting from him any knowledge\nwhich he might possess favourable to her in whose cause he interested\nhimself; and at length formed the resolution of guiding himself by the\ncircumstances in which he might discover the object of his quest,\ntrusting that, from Cuddie\'s account of a schism betwixt Burley and his\nbrethren of the Presbyterian persuasion, he might find him less\nrancorously disposed against Miss Bellenden, and inclined to exert the\npower which he asserted himself to possess over her fortunes, more\nfavourably than heretofore.Noontide had passed away when our traveller found himself in the\nneighbourhood of his deceased uncle\'s habitation of Milnwood.It rose\namong glades and groves that were chequered with a thousand early\nrecollections of joy and sorrow, and made upon Morton that mournful\nimpression, soft and affecting, yet, withal, soothing, which the\nsensitive mind usually receives from a return to the haunts of childhood\nand early youth, after having experienced the vicissitudes and tempests\nof public life.A strong desire came upon him to visit the house itself."Old Alison," he thought, "will not know me, more than the honest couple\nwhom I saw yesterday.I may indulge my curiosity, and proceed on my\njourney, without her having any knowledge of my existence.I think they\nsaid my uncle had bequeathed to her my family mansion,--well, be it so.I\nhave enough to sorrow for, to enable me to dispense with lamenting such a\ndisappointment as that; and yet methinks he has chosen an odd successor\nin my grumbling old dame, to a line of respectable, if not distinguished,\nancestry.Let it be as it may, I will visit the old mansion at least once\nmore."The house of Milnwood, even in its best days, had nothing cheerful about\nit; but its gloom appeared to be doubled under the auspices of the old\nhousekeeper.Everything, indeed, was in repair; there were no slates\ndeficient upon the steep grey roof, and no panes broken in the narrow\nwindows.But the grass in the court-yard looked as if the foot of man had\nnot been there for years; the doors were carefully locked, and that which\nadmitted to the hall seemed to have been shut for a length of time, since\nthe spiders had fairly drawn their webs over the door-way and the\nstaples.Living sight or sound there was none, until, after much\nknocking, Morton heard the little window, through which it was\nusual to reconnoitre visitors, open with much caution.The face of\nAlison, puckered with some score of wrinkles in addition to those with\nwhich it was furrowed when Morton left Scotland, now presented itself,\nenveloped in a _toy_, from under the protection of which some of her grey\ntresses had escaped in a manner more picturesque than beautiful, while\nher shrill, tremulous voice demanded the cause of the knocking."I wish to speak an instant with one Alison Wilson, who resides here,"\nsaid Henry."She\'s no at hame the day," answered Mrs.Wilson, _in propria persona_,\nthe state of whose headdress, perhaps, inspired her with this direct mode\nof denying herself; "and ye are but a mislear\'d person to speer for her\nin sic a manner.Ye might hae had an M under your belt for Mistress\nWilson of Milnwood.""I beg pardon," said Morton, internally smiling at finding in old Ailie\nthe same jealousy of disrespect which she used to exhibit upon former\noccasions,--"I beg pardon; I am but a stranger in this country, and have\nbeen so long abroad that I have almost forgotten my own language."said Ailie; "then maybe ye may hae\nheard of a young gentleman of this country that they ca\' Henry Morton?""I have heard," said Morton, "of such a name in Germany.""Then bide a wee bit where ye are, friend; or stay,--gang round by the\nback o\' the house, and ye\'ll find a laigh door; it\'s on the latch, for\nit\'s never barred till sunset.Ye \'ll open \'t,--and tak care ye dinna fa\'\nower the tub, for the entry\'s dark,--and then ye\'ll turn to the right,\nand then ye\'ll hand straught forward, and then ye\'ll turn to the right\nagain, and ye \'ll tak heed o\' the cellarstairs, and then ye \'ll be at the\ndoor o\' the little kitchen,--it\'s a\' the kitchen that\'s at Milnwood\nnow,--and I\'ll come down t\'ye, and whate\'er ye wad say to Mistress\nWilson ye may very safely tell it to me."A stranger might have had some difficulty, notwithstanding the minuteness\nof the directions supplied by Ailie, to pilot himself in safety through\nthe dark labyrinth of passages that led from the back-door to the little\nkitchen; but Henry was too well acquainted with the navigation of these\nstraits to experience danger, either from the Scylla which lurked on one\nside in shape of a bucking tub, or the Charybdis which yawned on the\nother in the profundity of a winding cellar-stair.His only impediment\narose from the snarling and vehement barking of a small cocking spaniel,\nonce his own property, but which, unlike to the faithful Argus, saw his\nmaster return from his wanderings without any symptom of recognition.said Morton to himself, on being disowned by\nhis former favourite."I am so changed that no breathing creature that I\nhave known and loved will now acknowledge me!"At this moment he had reached the kitchen; and soon after, the tread of\nAlison\'s high heels, and the pat of the crutch-handled cane which served\nat once to prop and to guide her footsteps, were heard upon the\nstairs,--an annunciation which continued for some time ere she fairly\nreached the kitchen.Morton had, therefore, time to survey the slender preparations for\nhousekeeping which were now sufficient in the house of his ancestors.The\nfire, though coals are plenty in that neighbourhood, was husbanded with\nthe closest attention to economy of fuel, and the small pipkin, in which\nwas preparing the dinner of the old woman and her maid-of-all-work, a\ngirl of twelve years old, intimated, by its thin and watery vapour, that\nAilie had not mended her cheer with her improved fortune.When she entered, the head, which nodded with self-importance; the\nfeatures, in which an irritable peevishness, acquired by habit and\nindulgence, strove with a temper naturally affectionate and good-natured;\nthe coif; the apron; the blue-checked gown,--were all those of old Ailie;\nbut laced pinners, hastily put on to meet the stranger, with some other\ntrifling articles of decoration, marked the difference between Mrs.Wilson, life-rentrix of Milnwood, and the housekeeper of the late\nproprietor."What were ye pleased to want wi\' Mrs.Wilson,"\nwas her first address; for the five minutes time which she had gained for\nthe business of the toilet entitled her, she conceived, to assume the\nfull merit of her illustrious name, and shine forth on her guest in\nunchastened splendour.Morton\'s sensations, confounded between the past\nand present, fairly confused him so much that he would have had\ndifficulty in answering her, even if he had known well what to say.But\nas he had not determined what character he was to adopt while concealing\nthat which was properly his own, he had an additional reason for\nremaining silent.Wilson, in perplexity, and with some apprehension,\nrepeated her question."What were ye pleased to want wi\' me, sir?"Pardon me, madam," answered Henry, "it was of one Silas Morton I spoke.""It was his father, then, ye kent o\', the brother o\' the late Milnwood?Ye canna mind him abroad, I wad think,--he was come hame afore ye were\nborn.I thought ye had brought me news of poor Maister Harry.""It was from my father I learned to know Colonel Morton," said Henry; "of\nthe son I know little or nothing,--rumour says he died abroad on his\npassage to Holland.""That\'s ower like to be true," said the old woman with a sigh, "and mony\na tear it\'s cost my auld een.His uncle, poor gentleman, just sough\'d awa\nwi\' it in his mouth.He had been gieing me preceeze directions anent the\nbread and the wine and the brandy at his burial, and how often it was to\nbe handed round the company (for, dead or alive, he was a prudent,\nfrugal, painstaking man), and then he said, said he, \'Ailie,\' (he aye\nca\'d me Ailie; we were auld acquaintance), \'Ailie, take ye care and haud\nthe gear weel thegither; for the name of Morton of Milnwood\'s gane out\nlike the last sough of an auld sang.\'And sae he fell out o\' ae dwam into\nanother, and ne\'er spak a word mair, unless it were something we cou\'dna\nmak out, about a dipped candle being gude eneugh to see to dee wi\'.He\ncou\'d ne\'er bide to see a moulded ane, and there was ane, by ill luck, on\nthe table."Wilson was thus detailing the last moments of the old miser,\nMorton was pressingly engaged in diverting the assiduous curiosity of the\ndog, which, recovered from his first surprise, and combining former\nrecollections, had, after much snuffing and examination, begun a course\nof capering and jumping upon the stranger which threatened every instant\nto betray him.At length, in the urgency of his impatience, Morton could\nnot forbear exclaiming, in a tone of hasty impatience, "Down, Elphin!"Ye ken our dog\'s name," said the old lady, struck with great and sudden\nsurprise,--"ye ken our dog\'s name, and it\'s no a common ane.And the\ncreature kens you too," she continued, in a more agitated and shriller\ntone,--"God guide us!So saying, the poor old woman threw herself around Morton\'s neck, cling\nto him, kissed him as if he had been actually her child, and wept for\njoy.There was no parrying the discovery, if he could have had the heart\nto attempt any further disguise.He returned the embrace with the most\ngrateful warmth, and answered,--\n\n"I do indeed live, dear Ailie, to thank you for all your kindness, past\nand present, and to rejoice that there is at least one friend to welcome\nme to my native country."exclaimed Ailie, "ye\'ll hae mony friends,--ye \'ll hae mony\nfriends; for ye will hae gear, hinny,--ye will hae gear.Heaven mak ye a\ngude guide o\'t!she continued, pushing him back from her\nwith her trembling hand and shrivelled arm, and gazing in his face as if\nto read, at more convenient distance, the ravages which sorrow rather\nthan time had made on his face,--"Eh, sirs!ye\'re sair altered, hinny;\nyour face is turned pale, and your een are sunken, and your bonny\nred-and-white cheeks are turned a\' dark and sun-burnt.mony\'s the comely face they destroy.--And when cam ye here, hinny?And what for did ye na\nwrite to us?And how cam ye to pass yoursell for dead?And what for did\nye come creepin\' to your ain house as if ye had been an unto body, to gie\npoor auld Ailie sic a start?"It was some time ere Morton could overcome his own emotion so as to give\nthe kind old woman the information which we shall communicate to our\nreaders in the next chapter.Aumerle that was,\n               But that is gone for being Richard\'s friend;\n               And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.The scene of explanation was hastily removed from the little kitchen to\nMrs.Wilson\'s own matted room,--the very same which she had occupied as\nhousekeeper, and which she continued to retain."It was," she said,\n"better secured against sifting winds than the hall, which she had found\ndangerous to her rheumatisms, and it was more fitting for her use than\nthe late Milnwood\'s apartment, honest man, which gave her sad thoughts;"\nand as for the great oak parlour, it was never opened but to be aired,\nwashed, and dusted, according to the invariable practice of the family,\nunless upon their most solemn festivals.In the matted room, therefore,\nthey were settled, surrounded by pickle-pots and conserves of all kinds,\nwhich the ci-devant housekeeper continued to compound, out of mere habit,\nalthough neither she herself, nor any one else, ever partook of the\ncomfits which she so regularly prepared.Morton, adapting his narrative to the comprehension of his auditor,\ninformed her briefly of the wreck of the vessel and the loss of all\nhands, excepting two or three common seamen who had early secured the\nskiff, and were just putting off from the vessel when he leaped from the\ndeck into their boat, and unexpectedly, as well as contrary to their\ninclination, made himself partner of their voyage and of their safety.Landed at Flushing, he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer\nwho had been in service with his father.By his advice, he shunned going\nimmediately to the Hague, but forwarded his letters to the court of the\nStadtholder."Our prince," said the veteran, "must as yet keep terms with his\nfather-in-law and with your King Charles; and to approach him in the\ncharacter of a Scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to\ndistinguish you by his favour.Wait, therefore, his orders, without\nforcing yourself on his notice; observe the strictest prudence and\nretirement; assume for the present a different name; shun the company of\nthe British exiles; and, depend upon it, you will not repent your\nprudence."The old friend of Silas Morton argued justly.After a considerable time\nhad elapsed, the Prince of Orange, in a progress through the United\nStates, came to the town where Morton, impatient at his situation and the\nincognito which he was obliged to observe, still continued, nevertheless,\nto be a resident.He had an hour of private interview assigned, in which\nthe prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence, his\nprudence, and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of\nhis native country, their motives and their purposes."I would gladly," said William, "attach you to my own person; but that\ncannot be without giving offence in England.But I will do as much for\nyou, as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed, as for\nthe recommendations you have brought me.Here is a commission in a Swiss\nregiment at present in garrison in a distant province, where you will\nmeet few or none of your countrymen.Continue to be Captain Melville, and\nlet the name of Morton sleep till better days.""Thus began my fortune," continued Morton; "and my services have, on\nvarious occasions, been distinguished by his Royal Highness, until the\nmoment that brought him to Britain as our political deliverer.His\ncommands must excuse my silence to my few friends in Scotland; and I\nwonder not at the report of my death, considering the wreck of the\nvessel, and that I found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with\nwhich I was furnished by the liberality of some of them,--a circumstance\nwhich must have confirmed the belief that I had perished.""But, dear hinny," asked Mrs.Wilson, "did ye find nae Scotch body at the\nPrince of Oranger\'s court that kend ye?I wad hae thought Morton o\'\nMilnwood was kend a\' through the country.""I was purposely engaged in distant service," said Morton, "until a\nperiod when few, without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours,\nAilie, would have known the stripling Morton in Major-General Melville.""Malville was your mother\'s name," said Mrs.Wilson; "but Morton sounds\nfar bonnier in my auld lugs.And when ye tak up the lairdship, ye maun\ntak the auld name and designation again.""I am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other, Ailie,\nfor I have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from\nevery one but you; and as for the lairdship of Milnwood, it is in as good\nhands.""As gude hands, hinny!"re-echoed Ailie; "I\'m hopefu\' ye are no meaning\nmine?The rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me.And I\'m ower\nfailed to tak a helpmate, though Wylie Mactrickit the writer was very\npressing, and spak very civilly; but I\'m ower auld a cat to draw that\nstrae before me.He canna whilliwhaw me as he\'s dune mony a ane.And then\nI thought aye ye wad come back, and I wad get my pickle meal and my soup\nmilk, and keep a\' things right about ye as I used to do in your puir\nuncle\'s time, and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive\nand guide the gear canny.Ye\'ll hae learned that in Holland, I\'se\nwarrant, for they\'re thrifty folk there, as I hear tell.--But ye\'ll be\nfor keeping rather a mair house than puir auld Milnwood that\'s gave; and,\nindeed, I would approve o\' your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as\nthree times a-week,--it keeps the wind out o\' the stamack.""We will talk of all this another time," said Morton, surprised at the\ngenerosity upon a large scale which mingled in Ailie\'s thoughts and\nactions with habitual and sordid parsimony, and at the odd contrast\nbetween her love of saving and indifference to self-acquisition."You\nmust know," he continued, "that I am in this country only for a few days\non some special business of importance to the Government, and therefore,\nAilie, not a word of having seen me.At some other time I will acquaint\nyou fully with my motives and intentions.""E\'en be it sae, my jo," replied Ailie, "I can keep a secret like my\nneighbours; and weel auld Milnwood kend it, honest man, for he tauld me\nwhere he keepit his gear, and that\'s what maist folk like to hae as\nprivate as possibly may be.--But come awa wi\' me, hinny, till I show ye\nthe oak-parlour how grandly it\'s keepit, just as if ye had been expected\nhaine every day,--I loot naebody sort it but my ain hands.It was a kind\no\' divertisement to me, though whiles the tear wan into my ee, and I said\nto mysell, What needs I fash wi\' grates and carpets and cushions and the\nmuckle brass candlesticks ony mair?for they\'ll ne\'er come hame that\naught it rightfully."With these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum, the\nscrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment, as its high\nstate of good order constituted the very pride of her heart.Morton, as\nhe followed her into the room, underwent a rebuke for not "dighting his\nshune," which showed that Ailie had not relinquished her habits of\nauthority.On entering the oak-parlour he could not but recollect the\nfeelings of solemn awe with which, when a boy, he had been affected at\nhis occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed\nhad not its equal save in the halls of princes.It may be readily\nsupposed that the worked-worsted chairs, with their short ebony legs and\nlong upright backs, had lost much of their influence over his mind; that\nthe large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour; that the green\nworsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the Arras loom; and that the\nroom looked, on the whole, dark, gloomy, and disconsolate.Yet there were\ntwo objects, "The counterfeit presentment of two brothers," which,\ndissimilar as those described by Hamlet, affected his mind with a variety\nof sensations.One full-length portrait represented his father in\ncomplete armour, with a countenance indicating his masculine and\ndetermined character; and the other set forth his uncle, in velvet and\nbrocade, looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery, though entirely\nindebted for it to the liberality of the painter."It was an idle fancy," Ailie said, "to dress the honest auld man in thae\nexpensive fal-lalls that he ne\'er wore in his life, instead o\' his douce\nRaploch grey, and his band wi\' the narrow edging."In private, Morton could not help being much of her opinion; for anything\napproaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly\nperson of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done\non his mean and money-making features.He now extricated himself from\nAilie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood, while her own\nhands made an addition to the dinner she was preparing,--an incident no\notherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl, which, for any\nevent of less importance than the arrival of Henry Morton, might have\ncackled on to a good old age ere Ailie could have been guilty of the\nextravagance of killing and dressing it.The meal was seasoned by talk of\nold times and by the plans which Ailie laid out for futurity, in which\nshe assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one,\nand planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as\ngovernante.Morton let the old woman enjoy her day-dreams and\ncastle-building during moments of such pleasure, and deferred till some\nfitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and\nspend his life upon the Continent.His next care was to lay aside his military dress, which he considered\nlikely to render more difficult his researches after Burley.He exchanged\nit--for a grey doublet and cloak, formerly his usual attire at Milnwood,\nand which Mrs.Wilson produced from a chest of walnut-tree, wherein she\nhad laid them aside, without forgetting carefully to brush and air them\nfrom time to time.Morton retained his sword and fire-arms, without which\nfew persons travelled in those unsettled times.When he appeared in his\nnew attire, Mrs.Wilson was first thankful "that they fitted him sae\ndecently, since, though he was nae fatter, yet he looked mair manly than\nwhen he was taen frae Milnwood."Next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she\ncalled "beet-masters to the new," and was far advanced in the history of\na velvet cloak belonging to the late Milnwood, which had first been\nconverted to a velvet doublet, and then into a pair of breeches, and\nappeared each time as good as new, when Morton interrupted her account of\nits transmigration to bid her good-by.He gave, indeed, a sufficient shock to her feelings, by expressing the\nnecessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening.And whar wad ye\nsleep but in your ain house, after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame?""I feel all the unkindness of it, Ailie, but it must be so; and that was\nthe reason that I attempted to conceal myself from you, as I suspected\nyou would not let me part from you so easily.""But whar are ye gaun, then?""Saw e\'er mortal een\nthe like o\' you, just to come ae moment, and flee awa like an arrow out\nof a bow the neist?""I must go down," replied Morton, "to Niel Blane the Piper\'s Howff; he\ncan give me a bed, I suppose?"I\'se warrant can he," replied Ailie, "and gar ye pay weel for \'t\ninto the bargain.Laddie, I daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign\nparts, to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed, and might hae baith\nfor naething, and thanks t\' ye for accepting them.""I assure you, Ailie," said Morton, desirous to silence her\nremonstrances, "that this is a business of great importance, in which I\nmay be a great gainer, and cannot possibly be a loser.""I dinna see how that can be, if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o\'\ntwal shillings Scots for your supper; but young folks are aye\nventuresome, and think to get siller that way.My puir auld master took\na surer gate, and never parted wi\' it when he had anes gotten \'t."Persevering in his desperate resolution, Morton took leave of Ailie, and\nmounted his horse to proceed to the little town, after exacting a solemn\npromise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard\nfrom him."I am not very extravagant," was his natural reflection, as he trotted\nslowly towards the town; "but were Ailie and I to set up house together,\nas she proposes, I think my profusion would break the good old creature\'s\nheart before a week were out."Where\'s the jolly host\n               You told me of?\'T has been my custom ever\n               To parley with mine host.Morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable\nadventure, and alighted at the little inn.It had occurred to him more\nthan once, while upon his journey, that his resumption of the dress which\nhe had worn while a youth, although favourable to his views in other\nrespects, might render it']
