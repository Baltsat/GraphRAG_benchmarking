EPISODIC MEMORY: ['[56] This would,\nin my opinion, be the course to follow during the south-west monsoon,\nwhile during the north-east monsoon there is usually so much rain that\nneither the salt river nor the water mills would be required, while\nmoreover during that time there is little danger of an attack.These\nthree plans being adopted, the banks of the moat could be protected by\na wall of coral stone to prevent the earth being washed away by the\nwater, as the present rocky bed of the moat is sufficiently strong\nto serve as a foundation for it.The moat has already been dug to\nits proper breadth, which is 10 roods.In my opinion there are two other defects in this Castle: the one\nis as regards the embrazures, the other is in the new horse stable\nand carpenters\' yard, which are on the south side just outside the\nopposite bank of the moat.I think these ought to be altered, for\nthe reasons stated in our letter to Colombo of November 30, 1695.I\nwas however opposed by the Constable-Major Toorse in his letter of\nDecember 16 next, and his proposal was approved in Batavia by letter\nof July 3 following.Sandra moved to the kitchen.This work will therefore have to remain as it is,\nalthough it appears that we did not explain ourselves sufficiently;\nbecause Their Excellencies seem to think that this yard and stable\nwere within the knowledge of His Excellency van Mydregt.John travelled to the kitchen.It is true\nthat the plan for them was submitted to His Excellency, as may be seen\nfrom the point submitted by the late Mr.Blom on February 17, 1692,\nand April 29, 1691, but no answer was ever received with regard to\nthis matter, on account of the death of His Excellency van Mydregt,\n[57] and I have an idea that they were not at all according to his\nwish.However, the yard and stable will have to remain, and with\nregard to the embrazures the directions of the Constable-Major must\nbe followed.If it be recommended that the deepening of the moat is possible\nwithout danger to the fort, and if the plan of the water mills and\nbanks be not approved, so that a dry moat would have to suffice,\nI think the outer wall might be completed and the ground between\nthe rocks be sown with a certain kind of thorn called in Mallabaar\nOldeaalwelam and in Dutch Hane sporen (cock spurs), on account of\ntheir resemblance to such spurs in shape and stiffness.This would\nform a covering of natural caltrops, because these thorns are so sharp\nthat they will penetrate even the soles of shoes, which, besides,\nall soldiers in this country do not wear.Another advantage in these\nthorns is that they do not easily take fire and do not grow higher\nthan 2 or 2 1/2 feet above the ground, while the plants grow in quite\na tangled mass.I thought it might be of some use to mention this here.The present bridge of the fort is built of palmyra wood, as I found\non my arrival from Batavia; but as the stone pillars have already\nbeen erected for the construction of a drawbridge, this work must be\ncompleted as soon as the timber that I ordered from the Wanni for this\npurpose arrives.In the carpenters\' yard some timber will be found that\nwas prepared three years ago for the frame of this drawbridge, which,\nperhaps, could yet be utilized if it has been well preserved.This\nwork will have to be hurried on, for the present bridge is dangerous\nfor anything heavy to pass over it, such as elephants, &c. It will\nalso be much better to have a drawbridge for the fortification.The\nbridge must be built as broad as the space between the pillars and\nthe opposite catches will permit, and it must have a strong wooden\nrailing on either side, which may be preserved for many years by\nthe application of pitch and tar, while iron is soon wasted in this\ncountry unless one always has a large quantity of paint and linseed\noil.Yet, an iron railing is more ornamental, so I leave this matter\nto Your Honours.[51]\n\nThe fortress Hammenhiel is in good condition, but the sand bank\nupon which it is built has been undermined by the last storm in the\nbeginning of December during the north-east monsoon.Sandra journeyed to the office.The damage must\nbe remedied with stones.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.In this fortress a reservoir paved with\nDutch bricks has been built to collect and preserve the rain water,\nbut it has been built so high that it reaches above the parapets\nand may thus be easily ruined by an enemy, as I have pointed out in\nmy letter to Colombo of September 8, 1694.As this is a new work it\nwill have to remain as present, until such time as alterations can\nbe made.The ramparts of this fortress, which are hollow, have been\nroofed with beams, over which a floor of stone and chunam has been\nlaid, with a view to the space below being utilized for the storing\nof provisions and ammunition.This is a mistake, as the beams are\nliable to decay and the floor has to support the weight of the canon,\nso that there would be danger in turning the guns round for fear of\nthe floor breaking down.So far back as the time of Commandeur Blom\na beginning was made to replace this roof by an entire stone vault,\nwhich is an important work.The gate of the fortress, which is still\ncovered with beams, must also be vaulted.[52]\n\nPonneryn and the passes Pyl, Elephant, and Buschutter only\nrequire a stone water tank, but they must not be as high as that of\nHammenhiel.Dutch bricks were applied for from Jaffnapatam on February\n17, 1692, and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo\npromised to send them here as soon as they should arrive from the\nFatherland, so that Your Honours must wait for these.Ponneryn is\nnot so much in want of a reservoir, as it has a well with fairly good\ndrink water.[53]\n\nThe work that demands the chief attention in Manaar is the deepening\nof the moat, as the fortifications, dwelling houses, and stores are\ncompleted.But since this work has to be chiefly carried out by the\nCompany\'s slaves, it will take some time to complete it.There are\nalso several elevations near the fort which will have to be reduced,\nso that they may not at any time become a source of danger.During\nmy circuit on two or three occasions the Opperhoofd and the Council\nat Manaar applied for lime to be sent from here, as no more coral\nstone for the burning of lime was to be found there.This takes\naway the Company\'s sloops from their usual employment, and the\nofficials have been informed that they must get the lime made\nfrom the pearl shells which are found in abundance in the bay of\nCondaatje as remains of the fishery.Daniel travelled to the garden.John moved to the hallway.It makes very good lime, and\nthe forests in the neighbourhood provide the fuel, and the lime can\nthen be brought to Manaar in pontons and tonys.Information on this\nsubject may be found in the correspondence between this station and\nJaffnapatam.Care must be taken that the lime of the pearl shells\nis used for nothing but the little work that has yet to be done in\nthe fort, such as the pavements for the canons and the floors of the\ngalleries in the dwelling houses.The Opperhoofd and other officers\nwho up to now have been living outside the fort must now move into\nit, as there are many reasons why it is undesirable that they should\nreside outside--a practice, besides, which is against the Company\'s\nrules with regard to military stations in India.(54)\n\nProvisions and ammunition of war are matters of foremost consideration\nif we desire to have our minds at ease with regard to these stations,\nfor the one is necessary for the maintenance of the garrison and the\nofficials, while the other is the instrument of defence.These two\nthings ought at all times to be well provided.His late Excellency\nvan Mydregt for this reason very wisely ordered that every station\nshould be stocked with provisions for two years, as may be seen in\nthe letter sent from Negapatam bearing date March 17, 1688.This is\nwith regard to the Castle, but as regards the outstations it will be\nsufficient if they are provided with rice for six or eight months.On\naccount of the great expense the Castle has not of late been provided\nfor two years, but this will soon be changed now that the passage to\nTrincomalee and Batticaloa has been opened, even if the scarcity in\nCoromandel should continue, or if the Theuver should still persist in\nhis prohibition of the importation of nely from Tondy.I have heard,\nhowever, that this veto has been withdrawn, and that vessels with this\ngrain will soon arrive here.If this rumour be true and if a good\ndeal of rice is sent here from Cotjaar, Tammelegan, and Batticaloa,\na large quantity of it might be purchased on behalf of the Company\nwith authority of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of\nColombo, which might be obtained by means of our sloops.Perhaps\nalso the people of Jaffnapatam who come here with their grain may be\nprevailed upon to deliver it to the Company at 50 per cent.or so\nless, as may be agreed upon.This they owe to their lawful lords,\nsince the Company has to spend so much in governing and protecting\nthem.Sanction to this measure was granted by His Excellency van\nMydregt in his letter from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of June 12, 1688,\nwhich may be looked up.If a calculation be made of the quantity of\nprovisions required for two years, I think it would be found that it\nis no less than 300 lasts of rice a year.This includes provisions\nfor the garrison and those who would have to come into the fort in\ncase of a siege, so that 600 lasts would be required for two years,\na last being equal to 3,000 lb.or 75 Ceylon parras, thus in all\n45,000 parras.At the rate of one parra per month for each person,\n1,875 people could be maintained for two years with this store of\nrice.This would be about the number of people the Company would\nhave to provide for in case of necessity, considering that there are\naccording to the latest regulations 600 Company\'s servants, while\nthere are according to the latest enumeration 1,212 women, children,\nand slaves in the town, making a total of 1,812 persons who have to be\nfed; so that the above calculation is fairly correct.Sometimes also\nManaar will have to be provided, because Mantotte does not yield a\nsufficient quantity of nely to supply that fort for two years.This\nmust also be included in the calculation, and if Your Honours are\nwell provided in this manner you will be in a position to assist some\nof the married soldiers, the orphanage, and the poor house with rice\nfrom the Company\'s stores in times of scarcity, and will be able to\nprevent the sale in rice being monopolized again.Daniel went back to the bedroom.It was the intention\nof His Excellency van Mydregt that at such times the Company\'s stores\nshould be opened and the rice sold below the bazaar price.Sandra went back to the office.Care must\nbe taken that this favour is not abused, because it has happened\nthat some of the Company\'s servants sent natives on their behalf,\nwho then sold the rice in small quantities at the market price.This\nwas mentioned in our letter to Colombo of October 1 and December 12,\n1695.The Company can hardly have too much rice in store, for it can\nalways be disposed of with profit when necessary, and therefore I think\n600 lasts need not be the limit, so long as there is a sufficient\nnumber of vessels available to bring it.But as rice alone will not\nsuffice, other things, such as salt, pepper, bacon, meat, &c., must\nalso be considered.Salt may be obtained in sufficient quantities\nin this Commandement, but pepper has to be obtained from Colombo,\nand therefore this spice must never be sold or issued from the store\nhouses until the new supply arrives, keeping always 3,000 or 4,000\nlb.Daniel travelled to the hallway.Bacon and meat also have to be obtained from Colombo,\nand His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo were kind\nenough to send us on my verbal request ten kegs of each from Galle\nlast August by the ship "Nederland."But I find that it has become\nstale already, and it must be changed for new as soon as possible,\nwith authority of His Excellency and the Council, in order that it may\nnot go further bad.In compliance with the orders of His Excellency\nvan Mydregt in his letter of November 23, 1687, the old meat and\nbacon must be returned to Colombo, and a new supply sent here every\nthree or four years, the stale meat being supplied in Colombo to\nsome of the Company\'s vessels.But considering that His Excellency\nthe Governor and the Council of Colombo are not always in a position\nto supply Jaffnapatam with a sufficient quantity of meat and bacon,\nas there are so many other stations in Ceylon to be provided for,\nit would be well to keep in mind the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen\nthat in emergencies 1,000 or 1,200 cattle could be captured and kept\nwithin the fort, where they could be made to graze on the large plain,\nwhile as much straw from the nely would have to be collected as could\nbe got together to feed these animals as long as possible.This\nsmall loss the inhabitants would have to bear, as the Company has to\nprotect them and their lands, and if we are victorious a recompense\ncould be made afterwards.I would also advise that as much carrawaat\n[58] as could be found in the quarters of the Carreas, Palwelys,\n[59] and other fishermen should be brought into the fort; because\nthis dried fish makes a very good and durable provision, except\nfor the smell.The provision of arrack must also not be forgotten,\nbecause used moderately this drink does as much good to our people as\nit does harm when taken in large quantities.As I have heard so many\ncomplaints about the arrack here, as well as in Trincomalee, at the\npearl fishery, at Coromandel, &c., it is apparent that the Company is\nnot properly served in this respect.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.On this account also some arrack\nwas returned from Negapatam and the Bay of Condaatje.Henceforth\nno arrack must be accepted which has not been tested by experts,\nneither for storing in the warehouses nor for sending to the different\nstations, because at present I cannot say whether it is adulterated by\nthe people who deliver it to the Company or by those who receive it\nin the stores, or even by those who transport it in the sloops.With\nregard to the munitions of war, I think nothing need be stated here,\nbut that there is a sufficient stock of it, because by the last stock\ntaking on August 31, 1696, it appears that there is a sufficient\nstore of canons, gun-carriages, gunpowder, round and long grenades,\ninstruments for storming, filled fire bombs, caseshot-bags, martavandes\nfor the keeping of gunpowder, and everything that pertains to the\nartillery.The Arsenal is likewise sufficiently provided with guns,\nmuskets, bullets, native side muskets, &c. I would only recommend that\nYour Honours would continue to have ramrods made for all the musket\nbarrels which are still lying there, suitable timber for which may be\nfound in the Wanni.It is from there also that the boards are obtained\nfor gun-carriages.And as I found that some had not been completed,\nI think this work ought to be continued, so that they may be ready\nwhen wanted.No doubt His Excellency the Governor and the Council of\nColombo will be willing to send a sufficient quantity of pitch and\ntar for the preservation both of the sloops']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['He probably brought with him in 1610 his wife,\nwho gave birth to his daughter Bermuda, born on the Somers Islands at\nthe time of the shipwreck.Hamor gives\nhim the distinction of being the first in the colony to try, in 1612,\nthe planting and raising of tobacco."No man [he adds] hath labored to\nhis power, by good example there and worthy encouragement into England\nby his letters, than he hath done, witness his marriage with Powhatan\'s\ndaughter, one of rude education, manners barbarous and cursed\ngeneration, meerely for the good and honor of the plantation: and\nleast any man should conceive that some sinister respects allured him\nhereunto, I have made bold, contrary to his knowledge, in the end of my\ntreatise to insert the true coppie of his letter written to Sir Thomas\nDale."The letter is a long, labored, and curious document, and comes nearer to\na theological treatise than any love-letter we have on record.Why Rolfe did not speak to Dale, whom he saw every day,\ninstead of inflicting upon him this painful document, in which the\nflutterings of a too susceptible widower\'s heart are hidden under a\ngreat resolve of self-sacrifice, is not plain.The letter protests in a tedious preamble that the writer is moved\nentirely by the Spirit of God, and continues:\n\n"Let therefore this my well advised protestation, which here I make\nbetween God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the\ndreadful day of judgment (when the secrets of all men\'s hearts shall be\nopened) to condemne me herein, if my chiefest interest and purpose be\nnot to strive with all my power of body and mind, in the undertaking\nof so weighty a matter, no way led (so far forth as man\'s weakness may\npermit) with the unbridled desire of carnall affection; but for the good\nof this plantation, for the honour of our countrie, for the glory of\nGod, for my owne salvation, and for the converting to the true knowledge\nof God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creature, namely Pokahuntas.To whom my heartie and best thoughts are, and have a long time bin so\nentangled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I was even\nawearied to unwinde myself thereout."Master Rolfe goes on to describe the mighty war in his meditations on\nthis subject, in which he had set before his eyes the frailty of mankind\nand his proneness to evil and wicked thoughts.He is aware of God\'s\ndispleasure against the sons of Levi and Israel for marrying strange\nwives, and this has caused him to look about warily and with good\ncircumspection "into the grounds and principall agitations which should\nthus provoke me to be in love with one, whose education hath bin rude,\nher manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so discrepant in\nall nurtriture from myselfe, that oftentimes with feare and trembling,\nI have ended my private controversie with this: surely these are\nwicked instigations, fetched by him who seeketh and delighteth in man\'s\ndistruction; and so with fervent prayers to be ever preserved from such\ndiabolical assaults (as I looke those to be) I have taken some rest."The good man was desperately in love and wanted to marry the Indian, and\nconsequently he got no peace; and still being tormented with her image,\nwhether she was absent or present, he set out to produce an ingenious\nreason (to show the world) for marrying her.He continues:\n\n"Thus when I thought I had obtained my peace and quietnesse, beholde\nanother, but more gracious tentation hath made breaches into my holiest\nand strongest meditations; with which I have been put to a new triall,\nin a straighter manner than the former; for besides the weary passions\nand sufferings which I have dailey, hourely, yea and in my sleepe\nindured, even awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissnesse,\nand carelessnesse, refusing and neglecting to perform the duteie of a\ngood Christian, pulling me by the eare, and crying: Why dost thou not\nindeavor to make her a Christian?Mary went to the bedroom.And these have happened to my greater\nwonder, even when she hath been furthest seperated from me, which\nin common reason (were it not an undoubted work of God) might breede\nforgetfulnesse of a far more worthie creature."He accurately describes the symptoms and appears to understand the\nremedy, but he is after a large-sized motive:\n\n"Besides, I say the holy Spirit of God hath often demanded of me, why I\nwas created?If not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but\nto labour in the Lord\'s vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and\nincrease the fruites thereof, daily adding with the good husband in the\ngospell, somewhat to the tallent, that in the ends the fruites may be\nreaped, to the comfort of the labourer in this life, and his salvation\nin the world to come.... Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance\nof love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge\nof God, her capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness\nto receive anie good impression, and also the spirituall, besides her\nowne incitements stirring me up hereunto."The "incitements" gave him courage, so that he exclaims: "Shall I be of\nso untoward a disposition, as to refuse to lead the blind into the right\nway?Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give bread to the hungrie, or\nuncharitable, as not to cover the naked?"It wasn\'t to be thought of, such wickedness; and so Master Rolfe screwed\nup his courage to marry the glorious Princess, from whom thousands\nof people were afterwards so anxious to be descended.But he made the\nsacrifice for the glory of the country, the benefit of the plantation,\nand the conversion of the unregenerate, and other and lower motive\nhe vigorously repels: "Now, if the vulgar sort, who square all men\'s\nactions by the base rule of their own filthinesse, shall tax or taunt\nmee in this my godly labour: let them know it is not hungry appetite, to\ngorge myselfe with incontinency; sure (if I would and were so sensually\ninclined) I might satisfy such desire, though not without a seared\nconscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eie, and less\nfearefull in the offense unlawfully committed.Nor am I in so desperate\nan estate, that I regard not what becometh of me; nor am I out of hope\nbut one day to see my country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in\nbirth, but there to obtain a mach to my great con\'tent.... But shall it\nplease God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to fulfill\nmy ends before set down) I will heartily accept of it as a godly taxe\nappointed me, and I will never cease (God assisting me) untill I have\naccomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a worke, in which I will\ndaily pray God to bless me, to mine and her eternal happiness."It is to be hoped that if sanctimonious John wrote any love-letters to\nAmonata they had less cant in them than this.But it was pleasing to Sir\nThomas Dale, who was a man to appreciate the high motives of Mr.In a letter which he despatched from Jamestown, June 18, 1614, to a\nreverend friend in London, he describes the expedition when Pocahontas\nwas carried up the river, and adds the information that when she went on\nshore, "she would not talk to any of them, scarcely to them of the best\nsort, and to them only, that if her father had loved her, he would not\nvalue her less than old swords, pieces, or axes; wherefore she would\nstill dwell with the Englishmen who loved her.""Powhatan\'s daughter [the letter continues] I caused to be carefully\ninstructed in Christian Religion, who after she had made some good\nprogress therein, renounced publically her countrey idolatry, openly\nconfessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired, baptized, and is\nsince married to an English Gentleman of good understanding (as by his\nletter unto me, containing the reasons for his marriage of her you may\nperceive), an other knot to bind this peace the stronger.Her father\nand friends gave approbation to it, and her uncle gave her to him in\nthe church; she lives civilly and lovingly with him, and I trust will\nincrease in goodness, as the knowledge of God increaseth in her.She\nwill goe into England with me, and were it but the gayning of this one\nsoule, I will think my time, toile, and present stay well spent."Hamor also appends to his narration a short letter, of the same date\nwith the above, from the minister Alexander Whittaker, the genuineness\nof which is questioned.In speaking of the good deeds of Sir Thomas Dale\nit says: "But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa, the\ndaughter of Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English\nGentleman--Master Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her\ncountrey Idolatry, and confessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and was\nbaptized, which thing Sir Thomas Dale had laboured a long time to ground\nher in."If, as this proclaims, she was married after her conversion,\nthen Rolfe\'s tender conscience must have given him another twist for\nwedding her, when the reason for marrying her (her conversion) had\nceased with her baptism.His marriage, according to this, was a pure\nwork of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It\nis not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her\ndetention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate\nof the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,\nboth of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious\nsubjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,\nfor it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to\nLondon.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may\nsuppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to\nconvert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever\nmay have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor\nDale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED\n\nSir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet\nGovernor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the\nchange in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had\nbeen held in common by the company, and there had been no division of\nproperty or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime\nland was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began\nat once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the\ncolonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort\nto fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter\'s to spread vital\npiety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,\nagainst "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The\nTwo Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers\nthe charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,\nabandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable\nlabour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first\nsettling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these\naspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were\njails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision\nall brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a\nprivate he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States\nGeneral in 1611 granted him three years\' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and\nfrugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a\nsoldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some\ninjurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,\nhe pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for\nsettling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,\nthe Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the\nthree hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,\nthat not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and\ncrazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards\nwith credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in\n1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and\ndied in 1620 from the effects of the climate.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.He was twice married, and\nhis second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him\nand received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Why should you not wear rubber boots or\n          overshoes in the house?Why should you change under-clothing night and\n          morning?Where should the night-dress be placed in the\n          morning?What should be done with the bed-clothes?Name the four kinds of work about which you\n          have learned.How are the organs of the body kept at work?[Illustration: W]E have five ways of learning about all things around\nus.We can see them, touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear them.Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing, are called the five senses.You already know something about them, for you are using them all the\ntime.In this lesson, you will learn a little more about seeing and hearing.In the middle of your eye is a round, black spot, called the pupil.This\npupil is only a hole with a muscle around it.When you are in the light,\nthe muscle draws up, and makes the pupil small, because you can get all\nthe light you need through a small opening.When you are in the dark,\nthe muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to let in more light.The pupils of the cat\'s eyes are very large in the dark.They want all\nthe light they can get, to see if there are any mice about.[Illustration: _The eyelashes and the tear-glands._]\n\nThe pupil of the eye opens into a little, round room where the nerve of\nsight is.This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not\nbear too much light.It carries to the brain an account of every thing\nwe see.We might say the eye is taking pictures for us all day long, and that\nthe nerve of sight is describing these pictures to the brain.The nerves of sight need great care, for they are very delicate.Do not face a bright light when you are reading or studying.While\nwriting, you should sit so that the light will come from the left side;\nthen the shadow of your hand will not fall upon your work.One or two true stories may help you to remember that you must take good\ncare of your eyes.The nerve of sight can not bear too bright a light.It asks to have the\npupil made small, and even the eyelid curtains put down, when the light\nis too strong.Once, there was a boy who said boastfully to his playmates: "Let us see\nwhich of us can look straight at the sun for the longest time."Then they foolishly began to look']

Consul at Bruges, in Belgium, to the Secretary of State,\npublished in the Washington City _Telegraph_ of a late date, will fully\nexplain what is meant by the "Great Scare in Belgium."Our extracts are not taken continuously, as the entire document would be\ntoo voluminous for our pages.But where breaks appear we have indicated\nthe hiatus in the usual manner by asterisks, or by brief explanations.Daniel travelled to the office.BRUGES, December 12, 1872.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.HAMILTON FISH,\n                     Secretary of State.SIR: In pursuance of special instructions recently received from\n   Washington (containing inclosures from Prof.Henry of the\n   Smithsonian Institute, and Prof.Lovering of Harvard), I\n   proceeded on Wednesday last to the scene of operations at the\n   "International Exploring Works," and beg leave to submit the\n   following circumstantial report:\n\n   Before proceeding to detail the actual state of affairs at\n   Dudzeele, near the line of canal connecting Bruges with the North\n   Sea, it may not be out of place to furnish a succinct history of\n   the origin of the explorations out of which the present alarming\n   events have arisen.It will be remembered by the State Department\n   that during the short interregnum of the provisional government\n   of France, under Lamartine and Cavaignac, in 1848, a proposition\n   was submitted by France to the governments of the United States,\n   Great Britain and Russia, and which was subsequently extended to\n   King Leopold of Belgium, to create an "International Board for\n   Subterranean Exploration" in furtherance of science, and in\n   order, primarily, to test the truth of the theory of igneous\n   central fusion, first propounded by Leibnitz, and afterward\n   embraced by most of contemporary geologists; but also with the\n   further objects of ascertaining the magnetic condition of the\n   earth\'s crust, the variations of the needle at great depths, and\n   finally to set at rest the doubts of some of the English\n   mineralogists concerning the permanency of the coal measures,\n   about which considerable alarm had been felt in all the\n   manufacturing centers of Europe.The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by Prof.Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved by Sir Roderick\n   Murchison, at that time President of the Royal Society of Great\n   Britain.To this project Arago lent the weight of his great name,\n   and Nesselrode affixed the approval of Russia, it being one of\n   the last official acts performed by that veteran statesman.The programme called for annual appropriations by each of the\n   above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000 each), the\n   appointment of commissioners and a general superintendent, the\n   selection of a site for prosecuting the undertaking, and a board\n   of scientific visitors, consisting of one member from each\n   country.It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first few\n   months after the organization of the commission.Watson, of\n   Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called "Prairie\n   Geology," was selected by President Fillmore, as the first\n   representative of the United States; Russia sent Olgokoff;\n   France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward Sabine, the present\n   President of the Royal Society; and Belgium, Dr.Secchi, since so\n   famous for his spectroscopic observations on the fixed stars.These gentlemen, after organizing at Paris, spent almost an\n   entire year in traveling before a site for the scene of\n   operations was selected.Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the\n   first ground was broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the\n   neighborhood of Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.The considerations which led to the choice of this locality were\n   the following: First, it was the most central, regarding the\n   capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was easy of\n   access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and St.Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being situated\n   within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond or west Scheldt;\n   thirdly, and perhaps as the most important consideration of all,\n   it was the seat of the deepest shaft in the world, namely, the\n   old salt mine at Dudzeele, which had been worked from the time of\n   the Romans down to the commencement of the present century, at\n   which time it was abandoned, principally on account of the\n   intense heat at the bottom of the excavation, and which could not\n   be entirely overcome except by the most costly scientific\n   appliances.There was still another reason, which, in the estimation of at\n   least one member of the commission, Prof.Watson, overrode them\n   all--the exceptional increase of heat with depth, which was its\n   main characteristic.Daniel went back to the hallway.The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,\n   may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the principal\n   modern geologists, based primarily upon the hypothesis of Kant\n   (that the solar universe was originally an immense mass of\n   incandescent vapor gradually cooled and hardened after being\n   thrown off from the grand central body--afterward elaborated by\n   La Place into the present nebular hypothesis)--that "the globe\n   was once in a state of igneous fusion, and that as its heated\n   mass began to cool, an exterior crust was formed, first very\n   thin, and afterward gradually increasing until it attained its\n   present thickness, which has been variously estimated at from ten\n   to two hundred miles.During the process of gradual\n   refrigeration, some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly\n   than others, and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being\n   unequal, the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner\n   parts, and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also\n   producing all volcanic action."The arguments in favor of this\n   doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the most\n   prominent:\n\n   _First._ The form of the earth is just that which an igneous\n   liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an axial\n   revolution similar to that of our earth.Not many years ago\n   Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised a most\n   ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory of the Royal\n   Society, he actually was enabled, by injecting a flame into a\n   vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the phenomena of the formation of\n   the solar universe, as contended for by La Place and by Humboldt\n   in his "Cosmos."_Secondly._ It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases\n   with depth, in all subterranean excavations.This is the\n   invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive measures must\n   always be devised and used, by means generally of air apparatus,\n   to temper the heat as the depth is augmented, else deep mining\n   would have to be abandoned.The rate of increase has been\n   variously estimated by different scientists in widely distant\n   portions of the globe.A few of them may be mentioned at this\n   place, since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that\n   led to the present most deplorable results.The editor of the _Journal of Science_, in April, 1832,\n   calculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines\n   in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of increase at one\n   degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four English feet.In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the\n   thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the\n   solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine hundred\n   feet.The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined by Mr.Fox, at\n   the depth of thirteen hundred and eighty feet, gave on average\n   result of four degrees for every seventy-five feet.Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines in\n   Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of Saxony, and\n   from the copper mines in the Caucasus, together with an\n   examination of the tin mines of Cornwall and the coal mines in\n   the north of England, and found the average to be at least one\n   degree of Fahrenheit for every thirty-seven English feet.Cordier, on the contrary, considers this amount somewhat\n   overstated and reduces the general average to one degree\n   Centigrade for every twenty-five metres, or about one degree of\n   Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet English measure._Thirdly._ That the lavas taken from all parts of the world, when\n   subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that they all proceed\n   from a common source; and\n\n   _Fourthly._ On no other hypothesis can we account for the change\n   of climate indicated by fossils.The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no less\n   than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English measure.At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the 10th of\n   April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three hundred and\n   seventy feet, the thermometer marking forty-eight degrees\n   Fahrenheit at the surface; this would give the enormous heat of\n   one hundred and twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of\n   the mine.Of course, without ventilation no human being could\n   long survive in such an atmosphere, and the first operations of\n   the commission were directed to remedy this inconvenience.The report then proceeds to give the details of a very successful\ncontrivance for forcing air into the shaft at the greatest depths, only\na portion of which do we deem it important to quote, as follows:\n\n   The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point, was ten\n   hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old bridge, the stone\n   piers of which were very near together, having been built by the\n   emperor Hadrian in the early part of the second century.The rise\n   of the tide in the North Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to\n   eighteen feet, thus producing a current almost as rapid as that\n   of the Mersey at Liverpool.The commissioners determined to\n   utilize this force, in preference to the erection of expensive\n   steam works at the mouth of the mine.A plan was submitted by\n   Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted.John travelled to the bathroom.Turbine wheels were built,\n   covering the space betwixt each arch, movable, and adapted to the\n   rise and fall of the tide.Gates were also constructed between\n   each arch, and a head of water, ranging from ten to fifteen feet\n   fall, provided for each turn of the tide--both in the ebb and the\n   flow, so that there should be a continuous motion to the\n   machinery.Near the mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron\n   reservoirs were constructed, capable of holding from one hundred\n   and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of\n   compressed air, the average rate of condensation being about two\n   hundred atmospheres.These reservoirs were properly connected\n   with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large cast-iron\n   mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at an almost\n   nominal cost.It was by the same power of compressed air that the']

and foremost in the van of the grand army, will be our gallant\nyoung friend,\n\n                                 COLONEL FREDDY.IT took a great many Saturday afternoons to finish the story of "Colonel\nFreddy," and the children returned to it at each reading with renewed\nand breathless interest.George and Helen couldn\'t help jumping up off\ntheir seats once or twice and clapping their hands with delight when\nanything specially exciting took place in the pages of the wonderful\nstory that was seen "before it was printed," and a great many "oh\'s" and\n"ah\'s" testified to their appreciation of the gallant "Dashahed\nZouaves."They laughed over the captive Tom, and cried over the true\nstory of the old sergeant; and when at length the very last word had\nbeen read, and their mother had laid down the manuscript, George sprang\nup once more, exclaiming; "Oh, I wish I could be a boy soldier!Mamma,\nmayn\'t I recruit a regiment and camp out too?"Mary journeyed to the bathroom.cried his sister; "I wish I had been Jessie; what a\npity it wasn\'t all true!""And what if I should tell you," said their mother, laughing, "that a\nlittle bird has whispered in my ear that \'Colonel Freddy\' was\nwonderfully like your little Long Island friend Hilton R----?""Oh, something funny I heard about him last summer; never mind what!"The children wisely concluded that it was no use to ask any more\nquestions; at the same moment solemnly resolving that the very next time\nthey paid a visit to their aunt, who lived at Astoria, they would beg\nher to let them drive over to Mr.R----\'s place, and find out all about\nit.After this, there were no more readings for several Saturdays; but at\nlast one morning when the children had almost given up all hopes of more\nstories, George opened his eyes on the sock hanging against the door,\nwhich looked more bulgy than ever.he shouted; "Aunt Fanny\'s\ndaughter hasn\'t forgotten us, after all!"and dressing himself in a\ndouble quick, helter-skelter fashion, George dashed out into the entry,\nforgot his good resolution, and slid down the banisters like a streak of\nlightning and began pummelling on his sister\'s door with both fists;\nshouting, "Come, get up!here\'s another Sock story for\nus!"This delightful announcement was quite sufficient to make Helen\'s\nstockings, which she was just drawing on in a lazy fashion, fly up to\ntheir places in a hurry; then she popped her button-over boots on the\nwrong feet, and had to take them off and try again; and, in short, the\nwhole of her dressing was an excellent illustration of that time-honored\nmaxim, "The more _haste_, the worse _speed_;" George, meanwhile,\nperforming a distracted Indian war dance in the entry outside, until his\nfather opened his door and wanted to know what the racket was all about.At this moment Helen came out, and the two children scampered down\nstairs, and sitting down side by side on the sofa, they proceeded to\nexamine this second instalment of the Sock stories.They found it was\nagain a whole book; and the title, on a little page by itself, read\n"GERMAN SOCKS.""These must be more stories like that\ndear \'Little White Angel.\'"And so they proved to be; for, on their mother\'s commencing to read the\nfirst story, it was found to be called, "God\'s Pensioners;" and\ncommenced, "It was a cold--" but stop!This book was

if\nfascinated at his one eye."Yes, come to your pa," said Donovan, jeeringly."I like little\ngals--\'specially when they\'re my own.""Yes, you be, and don\'t you deny it.The little girl began to cry in nervous terror, and Donovan laughed,\nthinking it a good joke."Well, it\'ll do after breakfast," he said."Sit up, child, and we\'ll see\nwhat the ould woman has got for us."Donovan did not excel as a cook, but Althea managed to eat a little\nbread and butter, for neither of which articles the lady of the house\nwas responsible.When the meal was over she said:\n\n"Now, will you take me back to New York?""You are not going back at all," said Hugh."You are our little girl,\nand you are going to live with us."Althea looked from one to the other in terror.Was it possible they\ncould be in earnest?She was forced to believe it, and was overwhelmed\nat the prospect.She burst into a tempest of sobs.Mary moved to the kitchen.Hugh Donovan\'s face darkened, and his anger was kindled."Stop it now, if you know what\'s best for yourself!"Althea was terrified, but she could not at once control her emotion.John went back to the office.Her husband took it,\nand brandished it menacingly."Yes," said Althea, trembling, stopping short, as if fascinated."Then you\'ll feel it if you don\'t stop your howlin\'."Althea gazed at him horror-stricken."I thought you\'d come to your senses," he said, in a tone of\nsatisfaction."Kape her safe, old woman, till she knows how to behave."In silent misery the little girl sat down and watched Mrs.Donovan as\nshe cleared away the table, and washed the dishes.It was dull and\nhopeless work for her.Mordaunt and Dan,\nand wished she could be with them again.The thought so saddened her that she burst into a low moan, which\nat once drew the attention of Mrs."I can\'t help it," moaned Althea.See here, now," and the woman displayed the whip\nwith which her husband had threatened the child."I\'ll give ye something\nto cry for.""Oh, don\'t--don\'t beat me!""Ye want to run away," said Mrs.I mean I won\'t unless you let me."asked Althea, with her little heart\nsinking at the thought."No, Katy, you may go wid me when I go to the market," answered Mrs.John moved to the bathroom."Shure, if you\'ll be a good gal, I\'ll give you all the pleasure\nI can."Althea waited half an hour, and then was provided with a ragged\nsun-bonnet, with which, concealing her sad face, she emerged from the\nhouse, and walked to a small market, where Mrs.Donovan obtained her\nsupplies for dinner.Troubled as she was, Althea looked about her with a child\'s curiosity on\nher way through the strange streets.It served to divert her from her\nsorrow."Shure it\'s my little Katy," said the woman, with a significant wink\nwhich prevented further questioning.Althea wished to deny this, but she did not dare to.She had become\nafraid of her new guardians.She felt\nsure that he would take her away from these wicked people, but how was\nDan to know where she was.The poor child\'s lips quivered, and she could\nhardly refrain from crying.It was so late when Dan heard of Althea\'s disappearance that he felt it\nnecessary to wait till morning before taking any steps toward her\nrecovery."I\'ll find her, mother," he said, confidently."Do not lie awake\nthinking of her, for it won\'t do any good."I didn\'t know how much I loved the dear child\ntill I lost her.""I am not so hopeful as you, Dan.I fear that I shall never see her\nagain."Now, mother, I am going to bed, but I shall be up\nbright and early in the morning, and then to work.""You won\'t have any time, Dan.Rogers,\ntelling him my reasons, and he will be sure not to object.If Althea is\nto be found, I will find her within a week."Mordaunt some courage, but she could not\nfeel as sanguine of success as Dan.In the morning Dan sought out Nancy, and took down her account of how\nthe little girl had been spirited away."So she went away in a carriage, Nancy?""Can you tell me what sort of a looking man it was that took her away?"I was struck dumb, you see, wid hearing how your\nmother broke her leg, and I didn\'t think to look at him sharp.""You can tell if he was an old man or a young one."He was betwixt and betwane."Now, what kind of a carriage was it?""Jist a hack like them at the square.""No; shure they all look alike to me."Dan made more inquiries, but elicited nothing further that was likely to\nbe of service to him.After a little reflection he decided to go to Union Square and\ninterview some of the drivers waiting for passengers there.He did so, but the driver who had actually been employed by Hartley was\nabsent, and he learned nothing.One driver, however, remembered carrying\na gentleman and child to a house on Twenty-seventh street, between\nEighth and Ninth avenues.Dan thought the clew of sufficient importance to be followed up.His\ncourage rose when, on inquiring at the house mentioned, he learned that\na child had actually been brought there."May I see the child, madam?""If you like," answered the lady, in surprise.She appeared in a short time with a boy of about Althea\'s age."It is a little girl I am inquiring after," he said."You would\nhave saved me some trouble.""I begin to think I am not as good a detective as I thought," said Dan\nto himself."I am on a false scent, that is sure."When he had been asking questions of the cab-drivers he had not been\nunobserved.John Hartley, who knew Dan by sight, laughed in his sleeve\nas he noted our hero\'s inquiries."You may be a smart boy, my lad," he said to himself, "but I don\'t think\nyou\'ll find the child.I have a great mind to give you a hint."He approached Dan, and observed, in a friendly way:\n\n"Are you in search of your little sister?""Yes, sir," returned Dan, eagerly."I am not sure, but possibly I may.I occupy a room directly opposite\nthe house in which you board.""Did you see Althea carried away?""Yes; I was sitting at my window when I saw a hack stop at your door.The door-bell was rung by a man who descended from the hack, and shortly\nafterward your sister came out, and was put into the carriage.""What was the man\'s appearance, sir?"So much the better," thought Hartley, with satisfaction."He was a little taller than myself, I should say," he answered, "and I\nbelieve his hair was brown"--Hartley\'s was black."I am sorry I can\'t\nremember more particularly."I came down into the street before the cab\ndrove away, and I heard the gentleman referred to say, in a low voice,\n\'Drive to Harlem.\'"Sandra journeyed to the bathroom."Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully.Sandra went back to the garden."That puts me on the right\ntrack."I wish I could tell you more," said Hartley, with a queer smile."If you find your little sister, I should be glad if you would let me\nknow," continued Hartley, chuckling inwardly."I will, sir, if you will let me know your name and address.""My name is John Franklin, and I live in the house directly opposite\nyours, No."All right, sir; I will note it down."John Hartley looked after Dan with a smile."My dear young friend," he said to himself, "it goes to my heart to\ndeceive you, you are so innocent and confiding.I wish you much joy of\nyour search in Harlem.I think it will be some time before I receive\nintelligence of your success.Still I will keep my room here, and look\nafter you a little.I am really afraid your business will suffer while\nyou are wandering about."John Hartley had already written to London, and he was prepared to wait\nthree weeks or more for an answer to his proposition.Meanwhile he had\none source of uneasiness.His funds were getting low, and unless Harriet\nVernon responded favorably to his proposal, he was liable to be\nseriously embarrassed.He had on previous similar occasions had recourse\nto the gaming-table, but Fortune did not always decide in his favor.He\ndid not dare to hazard the small sum he had on hand, lest want of\nsuccess should imperil the bold scheme for obtaining an income at his\nchild\'s expense.At this critical point in his fortunes he fell in with a Western\nadventurer, who, by a sort of freemasonry, recognizing Hartley\'s want of\ncharacter, cautiously sounded him as to becoming a partner in a\nhazardous but probably profitable enterprise.It was to procure some\ngenuine certificates of stock in a Western railway for a small number of\nshares, say five or ten, and raise them ingeniously to fifty and a\nhundred, and then pledge them as collateral in Wall street for a\ncorresponding sum of money.John Hartley, if an honest man, would have indignantly declined the\novertures; but he was not endowed with Roman virtue.He made a cautious\ninvestigation to ascertain how great was the danger of detection, and\nhow well the enterprise would pay.The answer to the second question was\nso satisfactory that he made up his mind to run the necessary risk.Blake and he came to a definite understanding, and matters were put in\ntrain.Certificates were readily obtained, and by the help of a skillful\naccomplice, who did the work for a specified sum, were ingeniously\nraised tenfold.Then Blake, assuming the dress and manners of a thriving business man\nfrom Syracuse, negotiated a loan, pledging the raised certificate as\ncollateral.The private banker put it away among his securities without\na doubt or suspicion, and Blake and Hartley divided a thousand dollars\nbetween them.John Hartley was very much elated by his success.The pecuniary\nassistance came just in the nick of time, when his purse was very low."It\'s a good thing to have more than one string to your bow," he\nthought."Not but that my little game in getting hold of the child is\nlikely to pay well.Harriet Vernon will find that I have the whip-hand\nof her.Mary went to the hallway.She must come to my terms, sooner or later."At that very moment Harriet Vernon was embarking at Liverpool on a\nCunard steamer.Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.She had received the letter of her brother-in-law, and\ndecided to answer it in person.DAN DISGUISES HIMSELF.For several days Dan strolled about Harlem, using his eyes to good\nadvantage.As a pretext he carried with him a few morning papers for\nsale.Armed with these he entered shops and saloons without exciting\nsurprise or suspicion.But he discovered not a trace of the lost girl.One day, as he was riding home in the Third avenue cars, there flashed\nupon his mind a conviction that he was on a wrong scent."Is it']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["And, thanks to her true womanhood, she nursed them at the\nbreast.There were no bottle babies in the Hall family.Tradition has it\nthat she endured the pains of childbirth with unusual fortitude, hardly\nneeding a physician.But this seeming strength was due in part to an\nunwise modesty.Aunt Katy's household\nconsisted of herself and Suza Fairfield, eleven years old, and it was\nsupposed by the Demitt relations, that when Aunt Katy died, a will would\nturn up in favor of Suza Fairfield.Tom Ditamus had moved from the backwoods of the Cumberland mountains\nto the Ohio river, and not pleased with the surroundings of his adopted\nlocality, made up his mind to return to his old home.Tom had a wife and\ntwo dirty children.Tom's wife was a pussy-cat woman, and obeyed all of\nTom's commands without ever stopping to think on the subject of “woman's\nrights.” Tom was a sulky fellow; his forehead retreated from his\neyebrows, at an angle of forty-five degrees, to the top of his head; his\nskull had a greater distance between the ears than it had fore and aft';\na dark shade hung in the corner of his eye, and he stood six feet above\nthe dirt with square shoulders.Tom was too great a coward to steal, and\ntoo lazy to work.Tom intended to return to his old home in a covered\nwagon drawn by an ox team.The Demitt relations held a council, and appointed one of their number\nto confer with Tom Ditamus and engage him to take Suza Fairfield--with\nhis family and in his wagon--to the backwoods of the Cumberland\nMountains.For, they said, thus spirited away Aunt Katy would never hear\nfrom her; and Aunt Katy's money, when broken loose from where she\nwas damming it up, by the death of the old thing would flow in its\nlegitimate channel.And the hard-favored and the hard-hearted Tom agreed to perform the job\nfor ten dollars.It was in the fall of the year and a foggy morning.Daniel went back to the garden.John went back to the bathroom.When the atmosphere\nis heavy the cold of the night produces a mist by condensing the\ndampness of the river, called fog; it is sometimes so thick, early in\nthe morning, that the eye cannot penetrate it more than one hundred\nyards.Tom was ready to start, and fortunately for him, seeing Suza Fairfield\npassing his camp, he approached her.She thought he wished to make some\ninquiry, and stood still until the strong man caught her by the arm,\nwith one hand in the other hand he held an ugly gag, and told her if she\nmade any noise he would put the bit in her mouth and tie the straps on\nthe back of her head.The child made one scream, but as Tom prepared to\ngag her she submitted, and Tom placed her in his covered wagon between\nhis dirty children, giving the gag to his wife, and commanding her if\nSuza made the slightest noise to put the bridle on her, and in the dense\nclouds of fog Tom drove his wagon south.Suza realized that she was captured, but for what purpose she could not\ndivine; with a brave heart--far above her years--she determined to make\nher escape the first night, for after that she said, mentally, she\nwould be unable to find home.She sat quietly and passed the day in\nreflection, and resolved in her mind that she would leave the caravan of\nTom Ditamus that night, or die in the attempt.She remembered the words\nof Aunt Katy--“Discretion is the better part of valor”--and upon that\ntheory the little orphan formed her plan.The team traveled slow, for Tom was compelled to let them rest--in the\nwarm part of the day--the sun at last disappeared behind the western\nhorizon.To the unspeakable delight of the little prisoner, in a dark\nwood by the shore of a creek, Tom encamped for the night, building a\nfire by the side of a large log.The party in the wagon, excepting Suza,\nwere permitted to come out and sit by the fire.While Tom's wife was\npreparing supper, Suza imploringly begged Tom to let her come to the\nfire, for she had something to tell him.Tom at last consented, but said\ncautiously, “you must talk low.”\n\n“_Oh!I will talk so easy_,” said Suza, in a stage whisper.She was\npermitted to take her seat with the party on a small log, and here for\nan hour she entertained them with stories of abuse that she had received\nfrom the _old witch, Aunt Katy_, and emphatically declared that she\nwould go anywhere to get away from the _old witch_.The orphan girl, eleven years of age, threw Tom Dita-mus, a man\nthirty-five years of age, entirely off his guard.Tom thought he had a\n_soft thing_ and the whole party were soon sound asleep, except Suza.With a step as light as a timid cat, Suza Fairfield left Tom Ditamus and\nhis family sleeping soundly on the bank of the creek in the dark woods,\nand sped toward Port William.They had traveled only ten miles with\na lazy ox team and the active feet of the little captive could soon\nretrace the distance, if she did not lose the way; to make assurance.doubly sure, Suza determined to follow the Kentucky river, for she knew\nthat would take her to Port William; the road was part of the way on the\nbank of the river, but sometimes diverged into the hills a considerable\ndistance from the river.At those places Suza would follow the river,\nthough her path was through dense woods and in places thickly set with\nunderbrush and briars.Onward the brave little girl would struggle,\nuntil again relieved by the friendly road making its appearance again\nupon the bank of the river, and then the nimble little feet would travel\nat the rate of four miles an hour.Again Suza would have to take to\nthe dark woods, with no lamp to guide her footsteps but the twinkling\ndistant star.In one of these ventures Suza was brought to a stand, by\nthe mouth of White's creek pouring its lazy waters into the Kentucky\nriver.An owl\nbroke the stillness of the night on the opposite side of the creek.The\nlast note of his voice seemed to say, _come over--over--little gal_.Suza sank upon the ground and wept bitterly.It is said that the cry of\na goose once saved Rome.The seemingly taunting cry of the owl did not\nsave Suza, but her own good sense taught her that she could trace the\ncreek on the south side until she would find a ford, and when across\nthe creek retrace it back on the north side to the unerring river; and\nalthough this unexpected fate had perhaps doubled her task, she had\nresolved to perform it.John went to the bedroom.She remembered Aunt Katy's words, “if there is\na will, there is a way,” and onward she sped for two long hours.Suza\nfollowed the zigzag course of the bewildering creek, and found herself\nat last in the big road stretching up from the water of the creek.She recognized the ford, for here she had passed in the hateful prison\nwagon, and remembered that the water was not more than one foot deep.Suza pulled off her little shoes and waded the creek; when upon the\nnorth side she looked at the dark woods, on the north bank of the creek,\nand at the friendly road, so open and smooth to her little feet, and\nsaid, mentally, “this road will lead me to Port William, and I will\nfollow it, if Tom Ditamus does catch me;” and Onward she sped.Daniel moved to the bathroom.The dawn of morning had illuminated the eastern sky, when Suza Fairfield\nbeheld the broad and, beautiful bottom land of the Ohio river.No mariner that ever circumnavigated the globe could have beheld his\nstarting point with more delight than Suza Fairfield beheld the chimneys\nin Port William.She was soon upon the home street, and saw the chimney\nof Aunt Katy's house; no smoke was rising from it as from others;\neverything about the premises was as still as the breath of life on the\nDead Sea.Suza approached the back yard, the door of Aunt Katy's room\nwas not fastened, it turned upon its hinges as Suza touched it; Aunt\nKaty's bed was not tumbled; the fire had burned down; in front of the\nsmoldering coals Aunt Katy sat upon her easy chair, her face buried in\nher hands, elbows upon her knees--Suza paused--_Aunt Katy sleeps_; a\nmoment's reflection, and then Suza laid her tiny hand upon the gray\nhead of the sleeping woman, and pronounced the words, nearest her little\nheart in a soft, mellow tone, “A-u-n-t K-a-t-y.”\n\nIn an instant Aunt Katy Demitt was pressing Suza Fairfield close to her\nold faithful heart.Old and young tears were mingled together for a few minutes, and then\nSuza related her capture and escape as we have recorded it; at the close\nof which Suza was nearly out of breath.Aunt Katy threw herself upon her\nknees by the bedside and covered her face with the palms of her hands.Suza reflected, and thought of something she had not related, and\nstarting toward the old mother with the words on her tongue when the\nAngel of observation placed his finger on her lips, with the audible\nsound of _hush!_ Aunt Katy's praying.Aunt Katy rose from her posture with the words: “I understand it all my\nchild; the Demitts want you out of the way.Well, if they get the few\nfour pences that I am able to scrape together old Katy Demitt will give\n'em the last sock that she ever expects to knit; forewarned, fore-armed,\nmy child.As for Tom Ditamus, he may go for what he is worth.He has\nsome of the Demitt-money, no doubt, and I have a warning that will last\nme to the grave.Old Demitt had one fault, but God knows his kinsfolk\nhave thousands.”\n\nAunt Katy took Suza by the hand and led her to the hiding place, and\nSuza Fairfield, for the first time, beheld Aunt Katy's money--five\nhundred dollars in gold and silver--and the old foster mother's will,\nbequeathing all her earthly possessions to Suza Fairfield.The will was\nwitnessed by old Ballard and old Father Tearful.And from thence forward\nSuza was the only person in the wide world in full possession of Aunt\nKaty Demitt's secrets.Tantalized by her relations, Aunt Katy was like a\nstudent of botany, confined in the center of a large plain with a single\nflower, for she doated on Suza Fairfield with a love seldom realized by\na foster mother.Tom Ditamus awoke the next morning (perhaps about the time Suza entered\nPort William) and found the little prisoner gone.Tom did not care; he\nhad his money, and he yoked up his cattle and traveled on.We must now look forward more than a decade in order to speak of Don\nCarlo, the hero of Shirt-Tail Bend, whom, in our haste to speak of other\nparties, we left at the half-way castle in a senseless condition, on the\nfatal day of the explosion of the Red Stone.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.The half-way castle was one of the first brick houses ever built on the\nOhio river.It had long been the property of infant heirs, and rented\nout or left unoccupied; it stood on the southern bank of the river\nabout half way between Louisville and Cincinnati, hence the name of\nthe half-way castle.Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.Don Carlo was severely stunned, but not fatally\ninjured; he had sold out in Shirt-Tail Bend, and was returning to the\nhome of his childhood when the dreadful accident occured.Don had\nsaved a little sum of money with which he had purchased a small farm in\nKentucky, and began to reflect that he was a bachelor.Numerous friends\nhad often reminded him that a brave young lady had rushed into the\nwater and dragged his lifeless body to the friendly shore, when in a few\nminutes more he would have been lost forever.Twelve months or more after these events a camp meeting was announced to\ncome off in the neighborhood of Port William.Camp meetings frequently\noccurred at that day in Kentucky.The members of the church, or at least\na large portion of them, would prepare to camp out and hold a protracted\nmeeting.When the time and place were selected some of the interested\nparties would visit the nearest saw mill and borrow several wagon loads\nof lumber, draw it to the place selected, which was always in the woods\nnear some stream or fountain of water, with the plank placed upon logs\nor stumps, they would erect the stand or pulpit, around the same, on\nthree sides at most, they would arrange planks for seats by placing them\nupon logs and stumps; they would also build shanties and partly fill\nthem with straw, upon which the campers slept.Fires were kindled\noutside for cooking purposes.Here they would preach and pray, hold\nprayer meetings and love feasts night and day, sometimes for two or\nthree weeks.On the Sabbath day the whole country, old and young, for\nten miles around, would attend the camp meeting.Don Carlo said to a friend: “I shall attend the camp meeting, for I have\nentertained a secret desire for a long time to make the acquaintance of\nthe young lady who it is said saved my life from the wreck of the Red\nStone.”\n\nThe camp meeting will afford the opportunity.Don and his friend were standing upon the camp ground; the\npeople were pouring in from all directions; two young ladies passed them\non their way to the stand; one of them attracted Don Carlo's attention,\nshe was not a blonde nor a brunette, but half way between the two,\ninheriting the beauty of each.Don said to his friend;\n\n“There goes the prettiest woman in America.”\n\nThen rubbing his hand over his forehead, continued;\n\n“You are acquainted with people here, I wish you would make some inquiry\nof that lady's name and family.”\n\n“I thought you was hunting the girl that pulled you out of the river,”\n said his friend, sarcastically.“Yes, but I want to know the lady that has just passed us,” said Don,\ngravely.It has puzzled mental\nphilosophers of all ages; and no one has ever told us why a man will\nlove one woman above all the balance of God's creatures.And then, the\nstrangest secret in the problem is, that a third party can see nothing\nlovable in the woman so adored by her lord.No wonder, the ancient Greeks represented cupid as blind.Sandra went back to the office.No, they did\nnot represent him as blind, but only blind folded, which undoubtedly\nleaves the impression that the love-god may peep under the bandage; and\nwe advise all young people to take advantage of that trick--look before\nyou love.History has proven that persons of the same temperament should\nnot marry, for their children are apt to inherit the _bad_ qualities\nof each parent; while upon the other hand, when opposites marry the\nchildren are apt to inherit the _good_ qualities of each parent.Marriage is the most important step taken in life.When a young man goes\nout into the world to seek fame and _fortune_ the energies of his mind\nare apt to concentrate upon the problem of obtaining a large fortune.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.The wife is thought of as a convenience, the love-god is consulted and\nfancy rules the occasion.Now let me say to all young men, the family is\nthe great object of life, you may pile millions together, and it is all\nscattered as soon as you are dead.A man's children are his only living\nand permanent representatives.You should not therefore consult fancy with regard to fortune or other\ntrivial things, but in the name of all the gods, at once consult common\nsense in regard to the family you produce.While Don's friend was upon the tour of inquiry to ascertain the\nidentity of the handsome young"]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['I never even told the boys when they left New York that\nthey were bound for Peru on a mission in which I was greatly interested.I thought that perhaps they would get along better and have a merrier\ntime if they were not loaded down with official business.”\n\n“That wouldn’t have made any difference!” announced Carl.“We’d have\ngone right along having as much fun as if we were in our right minds!”\n\n“When I started away from the hangar in the _Ann_,” Mr.Havens\ncontinued, with a smile at the interruption, “I soon saw that some one\nin New York was interested in my remaining away from Peru.”\n\n“Redfern’s friends of course!” suggested Mellen.“Exactly!” replied the millionaire.“And Redfern’s friends appeared on the scene last night, too,” Jimmie\ndecided.“And they managed to make quite a hit on their first\nappearance, too,” he continued.“And this man Doran is at present ready\nfor another engagement if you please.He’s a foxy chap!”\n\n“I’m sorry he got away!” Mellen observed.“Yes, it’s too bad,” Mr.Havens agreed, “but, in any event, we couldn’t\nhave kept him in prison here isolated from his friends.”\n\n“There’s one good thing about it,” Ben observed, “and that is that we’ve\nalready set a trap to catch him.”\n\n“How’s that?” asked the millionaire.Mellen has employed a detective to follow Doran’s companion on the\ntheory that sometime, somewhere, the two will get together again.”\n\n“That’s a very good idea!” Mr.“Now about this man Redfern,” Mr.“Is he believed to be\nstill in the mountains of Peru?”\n\n“I have at least one very good reason for supposing so,” answered the\nmillionaire.“Yes, I think he is still there.”\n\n“Give us the good reason!” exclaimed Carl.“I guess we want to know how\nto size things up as we go along!”\n\n“The very good reason is this,” replied Mr.Daniel moved to the office.Havens with a smile, “the\nminute we started in our airships for the mountains of Peru, obstacles\nbegan to gather in our way.The friends or accomplices of Redfern began\nto flutter the instant we headed toward Peru.”\n\n“That strikes me as being a good and sufficient reason for believing\nthat he is still there!” Mellen commented.“Yes, I think it is!” replied the millionaire.“And it is an especially\ngood reason,” he went on, “when you understand that all our previous\nplans and schemes for Redfern’s capture have never evoked the slightest\nresistance.”\n\n“Then the embezzler is in Peru, all right, all right!” laughed Carl.“But Peru is a very large country,” suggested Mr.“There’s a good deal of land in the country,” agreed Jimmie.“When you\ncome to measure the soil that stands up on end, I guess you’d find Peru\nabout as large as the United States of America!”\n\n“What are the prospects?” asked Mellen.“What I mean,” he continued, “is\nthis: Can you put your finger on any one spot on the map of Peru and\nsay—look there first for Redfern.”\n\n“Yes,” replied Mr.Havens, “I think I can.If you ask me to do it, I’ll\njust cover Lake Titicaca with my thumb and tell you to pull Redfern out\nof the water as soon as you get to that part of old Incaland!”\n\n“Je-rusalem!” exclaimed Jimmie.“And that takes us right down to the\nhaunted temple!”\n\n“What kind of a lake is this Titicaca?” asked Glenn.“Don’t you ever read anything except base-ball stories and police court\nrecords?” asked Ben, turning to his friend.John journeyed to the kitchen.“Before I was seven years\nold I knew that Lake Titicaca is larger than Lake Erie; that it is five\ninches higher in the summer than in the winter, and that the longer you\nkeep a piece of iron or steel in it the brighter it will become.”\n\n“Is it a fact that the waters of this lake do not rust metal?” asked\nMellen.“That seems to me to be a peculiar circumstance.”\n\n“I have often heard it stated as a fact,” replied Mr.“Ask any one who knows, if you won’t believe me,” Ben went on with a\nprovoking smile.“It is said that Lake Titicaca represents the oldest\ncivilization in the world.There are temples built of stones larger than\nthose used in the pyramids of Egypt.John moved to the garden.The stones have remained in\nposition after a century because of the nicety with which they are\nfitted together.It is said to be impossible to drive the finest needle\nbetween the seams of the walls composed of granite rocks.”\n\n“But what did they want to build such temples and fortresses for?”\ndemanded Jimmie.“Why didn’t they spend more time playing base-ball?”\n\n“You’re a nut on base-ball!” laughed Ben.“The temples which exist to-day were there when the Incas settled the\ncountry,” the boy continued.“They knew no more of their origin than we\ndo at this time!”\n\n“They may be a million years old!” exclaimed Carl.“Perhaps that’s as good a guess as any,” replied Ben.“We don’t know how\nold they are, and never shall know.”\n\n“Isn’t it a little remarkable,” said Mellen, “that an act of\nembezzlement committed in New York City more than two years ago should\nlead to a visit to ruined temples in Peru?”\n\n“Now about this Lake Titicaca, about which Ben has given us a bit of\nhistory,” Mr.Havens said, after replying briefly to Mellen’s question.“We have every reason to believe that Redfern has been living in some of\nthe ancient structures bordering the lake.”\n\n“Did you ever try to unearth the East Side person who wrote the letter\nyou have just referred to?” asked Ben.John went to the bedroom.“We have spent thousands of dollars in quest of that person,” replied\nthe millionaire, “and all to no purpose.”\n\n“And what do we do to-morrow?” asked Jimmie, breaking into the\nconversation in true boy-fashion.“Why, we’re going to start for Peru!” cried Carl.“And the haunted temples!” laughed Ben.“Honest, boys,” he went on, “I\ndon’t believe there’s anything in this haunted temple yarn.There may be\ntemples which are being guarded from the ravages of the superstitious by\ninterested persons who occasionally play the ghost, but so far as any\nsupernatural manifestations are concerned the idea is ridiculous.”\n\n“Don’t you ever say anything like that in the vicinity of Lake\nTiticaca,” Mellen suggested.“If you do, the natives will suddenly\ndiscover that you are robbers, bent on plunder, and some night, your\nbodies may find a resting-place at the bottom of the lake.”\n\n“Do they really believe the temples to be haunted?” asked Glenn.“There are people in whose interest the superstition is kept up,”\nreplied Ben.“These interested people would doubtless gladly perform the\nstunt just suggested by Mellen.”\n\n“I think I’ve got the combination now!” Jimmie laughed.“See if I’m\nright.The temples still hold stores of gold, and those searching for\nthe treasure are keeping adventurous people away by making the ghost\nwalk.”\n\n“That’s the idea!” Ben replied.“And, look here!” Sam broke in.“Why shouldn’t this man Redfern have a\nchoice collection of ghosts of his own?”\n\n“That’s an idea, too,” Mr.“I’ll bet he has!” Jimmie insisted.Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.“Then we’ll examine the homes of the ghosts first,” grinned Jimmie.“We’ll walk up to the portal and say: ‘Mr.Ghost, if you’ll materialize\nRedfern, we’ll give you half of the reward offered for him by the trust\ncompany.’ That ought to bring him, don’t you think?”\n\n“And here’s another idea,” Sam interrupted.“If Redfern has ghosts in\nthe temple in which he is hiding—if he really is hiding in a Peruvian\ntemple—his ghosts will be the most active ghosts on the job.In other\nwords, we’ll hear more about his haunted temple than any other haunted\ntemple in all Peru.His ghosts will be in a constant state of eruption!”\n\n“And that’s another good idea,” suggested Mr.“Oh, Sam is wise all right,” Jimmie went on.“I knew that the minute he\ntold me about unearthing the provisions in the tent before he knew\nwhether the savages were coming back!”\n\n“Gentlemen,” began Sam, with one of his smooth smiles, “I was so hungry\nthat I didn’t much care whether the savages came back or not.It\nappeared to me then that the last morsel of food that had passed my lips\nhad exhausted itself at a period farther away than the birth of Adam!”\n\n“You must have been good and hungry!” laughed Mellen.“What did you wander off into that country for?” asked Jimmie.“You\nmight have known better.”\n\n“I couldn’t remain in the Canal Zone,” replied Sam, “because no one\nwould give me a job.Everybody seemed to want to talk to me for my own\ngood.Even the chief in charge of the Gatun dam contract told me——”\n\n“Do you know the chief in charge of the Gatun dam contract?” asked\nHavens, casually.“You spoke of him a moment ago as if you had met him\npersonally.”\n\n“Well, you see,” Sam went on, hesitatingly, “you see I just happened\nto——”\n\nThe confusion of the young man was so great that no further questions\nwere asked of him at that time, but all understood that he had\ninadvertently lifted a curtain which revealed previous acquaintance with\nmen like the chief in charge of the Gatun dam.The boy certainly was a\nmystery, and they all decided to learn the truth about him before\nparting company.Havens said, breaking a rather oppressive silence, “are we\nall ready for the roof of the world to-morrow?”\n\n“You bet we’re all ready!” cried Jimmie.“I’m ready right now!” exclaimed Carl.“Will you go with us, Sam?” asked Mr.“I should be glad to!” was the reply.No more was said on the subject at that time, yet all saw by the\nexpression on the tramp’s face how grateful he was for this new chance\nin life which Mr.“Jerusalem!” exclaimed Jimmie in a moment, jumping to his feet and\nrushing toward the door.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.“I’ve forgotten something!”\n\n“Something important?” asked Ben.I should say so!” replied Jimmie.“I forgot to eat my\ndinner, and I haven’t had any supper yet!”\n\n“How did you come to do it?” asked Mellen.“I didn’t wake up!” was the reply.“And now,” the boy went on, “you see\nI’ve got to go and eat two meals all at once.”\n\n“I’ll eat one of them for you,” suggested Sam.“And I’ll eat the other!” volunteered Ben.“Yes you will,” grinned Jimmie.I\nwas indeed surprised to find that those fellows did not pursue me, nor\ncan I in any other way account for it, but by supposing, what is not\nimprobable, that, as they were strangers as well as myself, and had all\nthe appearance of banditti or ruffians flying out of the dominions of\nthe Pope, the woman of the house did not care to trust them with her\nhorses.From the Modanese I continued my journey, more leisurely through\nthe Parmesan, the Milanese, and part of the Venetian territory, to\nChiavenna, subject to the Grisons, who abhor the very name of the\nInquisition, and are ever ready to receive and protect all who, flying\nfrom it, take refuge, as many Italians do, in their dominions.Still\nI carefully concealed who I was, and whence I came, for, though no\nInquisition prevails among the Swiss, yet the Pope\'s nuncio who resides\nat Lucerne, (a popish canton through which I was to pass,) might have\npersuaded the magistrate to stop me as an apostate and deserter from the\norder.Having rested a few days at Chiavenna, I resumed my journey quite\nrefreshed, continuing it through the country of the Grisons, and the two\nsmall cantons of Ury and Underwald, to the canton of Lucerne.There\nI missed my way, as I was quite unacquainted with the country, and\ndiscovering a city at a distance, was advancing to it, but slowly, as I\nknew not where I was, when a countryman whom I met, informed me that the\ncity before me was Lucerne.Daniel travelled to the hallway.Upon that intelligence, I turned out of the\nroad as soon as the countryman was out of sight, and that night I\npassed with a good natured shepherd in his cottage, who supplied me with\nsheep\'s milk, and my horse with plenty of grass.I set out early next\nmorning, making my way westward, as I knew that Berne lay west of\nLucerne.But, after a few miles, the country proved very mountainous,\nand having travelled the whole day over mountains I was overtaken among\nthem by night.As I was looking out for a place where I might shelter\nmyself during the night, against the snow and rain, (for it both snowed\nand rained,) I perceived a light at a distance, and making towards it,\nI got into a kind of foot-path, but so narrow and rugged that I was\nobliged to lead my horse, and feel my way with one foot, (having no\nlight to direct me,) before I durst move the other.Thus, with much\ndifficulty I reached the place where the light was, a poor little\ncottage, and knocking at the door, was asked by a man within who I was,\nand what I wanted?I answered that I was a stranger and had lost my way.exclaimed the man, "ThereSandra moved to the bedroom.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['With that he dropped his coarse grey horseman\'s coat from his shoulders,\nand, extending his strong brawny arms with a look of determined\nresolution, he offered himself to the contest.The soldier was nothing\nabashed by the muscular frame, broad chest, square shoulders, and hardy\nlook of his antagonist, but, whistling with great composure, unbuckled\nhis belt, and laid aside his military coat.The company stood round them,\nanxious for the event.In the first struggle the trooper seemed to have some advantage, and also\nin the second, though neither could be considered as decisive.But it was\nplain he had put his whole strength too suddenly forth, against an\nantagonist possessed of great endurance, skill, vigour, and length of\nwind.In the third close, the countryman lifted his opponent fairly from\nthe floor, and hurled him to the ground with such violence, that he lay\nfor an instant stunned and motionless.His comrade Halliday immediately\ndrew his sword; "You have killed my sergeant," he exclaimed to the\nvictorious wrestler, "and by all that is sacred you shall answer it!"Mary journeyed to the office.cried Morton and his companions, "it was all fair play;\nyour comrade sought a fall, and he has got it.""That is true enough," said Bothwell, as he slowly rose; "put up your\nbilbo, Tom.I did not think there was a crop-ear of them all could have\nlaid the best cap and feather in the King\'s Life-Guards on the floor of a\nrascally change-house.--Hark ye, friend, give me your hand."Mary travelled to the garden."I promise you," said Bothwell, squeezing his hand\nvery hard, "that the time will come when we shall meet again, and try\nthis game over in a more earnest manner.""And I\'ll promise you," said the stranger, returning the grasp with equal\nfirmness, "that when we next meet, I will lay your head as low as it lay\neven now, when you shall lack the power to lift it up again.""Well, beloved," answered Bothwell, "if thou be\'st a whig, thou art a\nstout and a brave one, and so good even to thee--Hadst best take thy nag\nbefore the Cornet makes the round; for, I promise thee, he has stay\'d\nless suspicious-looking persons."The stranger seemed to think that the hint was not to be neglected; he\nflung down his reckoning, and going into the stable, saddled and brought\nout a powerful black horse, now recruited by rest and forage, and turning\nto Morton, observed, "I ride towards Milnwood, which I hear is your home;\nwill you give me the advantage and protection of your company?""Certainly," said Morton; although there was something of gloomy and\nrelentless severity in the man\'s manner from which his mind recoiled.His\ncompanions, after a courteous good-night, broke up and went off in\ndifferent directions, some keeping them company for about a mile, until\nthey dropped off one by one, and the travellers were left alone.The company had not long left the Howff, as Blane\'s public-house was\ncalled, when the trumpets and kettle-drums sounded.The troopers got\nunder arms in the market-place at this unexpected summons, while, with\nfaces of anxiety and earnestness, Cornet Grahame, a kinsman of\nClaverhouse, and the Provost of the borough, followed by half-a-dozen\nsoldiers, and town-officers with halberts, entered the apartment of Niel\nBlane.were the first words which the Cornet spoke; "let no\nman leave the house.--So, Bothwell, how comes this?Did you not hear them\nsound boot and saddle?""He was just going to quarters, sir," said his comrade; "he has had a bad\nfall.""If you neglect duty in this way,\nyour royal blood will hardly protect you.""You should have been at quarters, Sergeant Bothwell," replied the\nofficer; "you have lost a golden opportunity.John travelled to the office.Here are news come that the\nArchbishop of St Andrews has been strangely and foully assassinated by a\nbody of the rebel whigs, who pursued and stopped his carriage on\nMagus-Muir, near the town of St Andrews, dragged him out, and dispatched\nhim with their swords and daggers."[Note: The general account of this\nact of assassination is to be found in all histories of the period.A\nmore particular narrative may be found in the words of one of the actors,\nJames Russell, in the Appendix to Kirkton\'s History of the Church of\nScotland, published by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Esquire.4to,\nEdinburgh, 1817.]"Here are their descriptions," continued the Cornet, pulling out a\nproclamation, "the reward of a thousand merks is on each of their heads.""The test, the test, and the qualification!"said Bothwell to Halliday;\n"I know the meaning now--Zounds, that we should not have stopt him!Go\nsaddle our horses, Halliday.--Was there one of the men, Cornet, very\nstout and square-made, double-chested, thin in the flanks, hawk-nosed?""Stay, stay," said Cornet Grahame, "let me look at the paper.--Hackston\nof Rathillet, tall, thin, black-haired.""That is not my man," said Bothwell."John Balfour, called Burley, aquiline nose, red-haired, five feet\neight inches in height"--"It is he--it is the very man!"said\nBothwell,--"skellies fearfully with one eye?""Right," continued Grahame, "rode a strong black horse, taken from the\nprimate at the time of the murder.""The very man," exclaimed Bothwell, "and the very horse!he was in this\nroom not a quarter of an hour since."A few hasty enquiries tended still more to confirm the opinion, that the\nreserved and stern stranger was Balfour of Burley, the actual commander\nof the band of assassins, who, in the fury of misguided zeal, had\nmurdered the primate, whom they accidentally met, as they were searching\nfor another person against whom they bore enmity.[Note: One Carmichael,\nsheriff-depute in Fife, who had been active in enforcing the penal\nmeasures against non-conformists.He was on the moors hunting, but\nreceiving accidental information that a party was out in quest of him, he\nreturned home, and escaped the fate designed for him, which befell his\npatron the Archbishop.]Daniel journeyed to the garden.In their excited imagination the casual\nrencounter had the appearance of a providential interference, and they\nput to death the archbishop, with circumstances of great and cold-blooded\ncruelty, under the belief, that the Lord, as they expressed it, had\ndelivered him into their hands.[Note:  Murderers of Archbishop Sharpe.The leader of this party was\n     David Hackston, of Rathillet, a gentleman of ancient birth and good\n     estate.Sandra journeyed to the garden.He had been profligate in his younger days, but having been\n     led from curiosity to attend the conventicles of the nonconforming\n     clergy, he adopted their principles in the fullest extent.It\n     appears, that Hackston had some personal quarrel with Archbishop\n     Sharpe, which induced him to decline the command of the party when\n     the slaughter was determined upon, fearing his acceptance might be\n     ascribed to motives of personal enmity.He felt himself free in\n     conscience, however, to be present; and when the archbishop, dragged\n     from his carriage, crawled towards him on his knees for protection,\n     he replied coldly, "Sir, I will never lay a finger on you."It is\n     remarkable that Hackston, as well as a shepherd who was also\n     present, but passive, on the occasion, were the only two of the\n     party of assassins who suffered death by the hands of the\n     executioner.On Hackston refusing the command, it was by universal suffrage\n     conferred on John Balfour of Kinloch, called Burley, who was\n     Hackston\'s brother-in-law.He is described "as a little man,\n     squint-eyed, and of a very fierce aspect."--"He was," adds the same\n     author, "by some reckoned none of the most religious; yet he was\n     always reckoned zealous and honest-hearted, courageous in every\n     enterprise, and a brave soldier, seldom any escaping that came into\n     his hands.He was the principal actor in killing that arch-traitor\n     to the Lord and his church, James Sharpe.""Horse, horse, and pursue, my lads!"John went back to the bedroom.exclaimed Cornet Grahame; "the\nmurdering dog\'s head is worth its weight in gold."CHAPTER V.\n\n               Arouse thee, youth!--it is no human call--\n               God\'s church is leaguer\'d--haste to man the wall;\n               Haste where the Redcross banners wave on high,\n               Signal of honour\'d death, or victory!Morton and his companion had attained some distance from the town before\neither of them addressed the other.There was something, as we have\nobserved, repulsive in the manner of the stranger, which prevented Morton\nfrom opening the conversation, and he himself seemed to have no desire to\ntalk, until, on a sudden, he abruptly demanded, "What has your father\'s\nson to do with such profane mummeries as I find you this day engaged in?""I do my duty as a subject, and pursue my harmless recreations according\nto my own pleasure," replied Morton, somewhat offended."Is it your duty, think you, or that of any Christian young man, to bear\narms in their cause who have poured out the blood of God\'s saints in the\nwilderness as if it had been water?or is it a lawful recreation to waste\ntime in shooting at a bunch of feathers, and close your evening with\nwinebibbing in public-houses and market-towns, when He that is mighty is\ncome into the land with his fan in his hand, to purge the wheat from the\nchaff?""I suppose from your style of conversation," said Morton, "that you are\none of those who have thought proper to stand out against the government.I must remind you that you are unnecessarily using dangerous language in\nthe presence of a mere stranger, and that the times do not render it safe\nfor me to listen to it."Sandra journeyed to the bedroom."Thou canst not help it, Henry Morton," said his companion; "thy Master\nhas his uses for thee, and when he calls, thou must obey.Mary moved to the office.Well wot I thou\nhast not heard the call of a true preacher, or thou hadst ere now been\nwhat thou wilt assuredly one day become.""We are of the presbyterian persuasion, like yourself," said Morton; for\nhis uncle\'s family attended the ministry of one of those numerous\npresbyterian clergymen, who, complying with certain regulations, were\nlicensed to preach without interruption from the government.This\nindulgence, as it was called, made a great schism among the\npresbyterians, and those who accepted of it were severely censured by the\nmore rigid sectaries, who refused the proffered terms.The stranger,\ntherefore, answered with great disdain to Morton\'s profession of faith."That is but an equivocation--a poor equivocation.Ye listen on the\nSabbath to a cold, worldly, time-serving discourse, from one who forgets\nhis high commission so much as to hold his apostleship by the favour of\nthe courtiers and the false prelates, and ye call that hearing the word!Of all the baits with which the devil has fished for souls in these days\nof blood and darkness, that Black Indulgence has been the most\ndestructive.An awful dispensation it has been, a smiting of the shepherd\nand a scattering of the sheep upon the mountains--an uplifting of one\nChristian banner against another, and a fighting of the wars of darkness\nwith the swords of the children of light!""My uncle," said Morton, "is of opinion, that we enjoy a reasonable\nfreedom of conscience under the indulged clergymen, and I must\nnecessarily be guided by his sentiments respecting the choice of a place\nof worship for his family."Daniel went back to the office."Your uncle," said the horseman, "is one of those to whom the least lamb\nin his own folds at Milnwood is dearer than the whole Christian flock.He\nis one that could willingly bend down to the golden-calf of Bethel, and\nwould have fished for the dust thereof when it was ground to powder and\ncast upon the waters.Thy father was a man of another stamp.""My father," replied Morton, "was indeed a brave and gallant man.And you\nmay have heard, sir, that he fought for that royal family in whose name I\nwas this day carrying arms.""Ay; and had he lived to see these days, he would have cursed the hour he\never drew sword in their cause.But more of this hereafter--I promise\nthee full surely that thy hour will come, and then the words thou hast\nnow heard will stick in thy bosom like barbed arrows.He pointed towards a pass leading up into a wild extent of dreary and\ndesolate hills; but as he was about to turn his horse\'s head into the\nrugged path, which led from the high-road in that direction, an old woman\nwrapped in a red cloak, who was sitting by the cross-way, arose, and\napproaching him, said, in a mysterious tone of voice, "If ye be of our\nain folk, gangna up the pass the night for your lives.There is a lion in\nthe path, that is there.John travelled to the hallway.The curate of Brotherstane and ten soldiers hae\nbeset the pass, to hae the lives of ony of our puir wanderers that\nventure that gate to join wi\' Hamilton and Dingwall.""Have the persecuted folk drawn to any head among themselves?""About sixty or seventy horse and foot," said the old dame; "but, ewhow!they are puirly armed, and warse fended wi\' victual.""God will help his own," said the horseman."Which way shall I take to\njoin them?""It\'s a mere impossibility this night," said the woman, "the troopers\nkeep sae strict a guard;

"and can you give me\nhiding there?""I have," said the old woman, "a hut by the way-side, it may be a mile\nfrom hence; but four men of Belial, called dragoons, are lodged therein,\nto spoil my household goods at their pleasure, because I will not wait\nupon the thowless, thriftless, fissenless ministry of that carnal man,\nJohn Halftext, the curate.""Good night, good woman, and thanks for thy counsel," said the stranger,\nas he rode away."The blessings of the promise upon you," returned the old dame;

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['One would prefer to qualify the\nfirst clause, by admitting how much Christianity has done for Europe\neven with its old organisation, and to restrict the charge of failure\nwithin the limits of the modern time.Whether in changed forms and with new supplements the teaching of its\nfounder is destined to be the chief inspirer of that social and human\nsentiment which seems to be the only spiritual bond capable of uniting\nmen together again in a common and effective faith, is a question which\nit is unnecessary to discuss here.\'_They talk about the first centuries\nof Christianity_,\' said De Maistre, \'_I would not be sure that they are\nover yet_.\'Perhaps not; only if the first centuries are not yet over,\nit is certain that the Christianity of the future will have to be so\ndifferent from the Christianity of the past, as to demand or deserve\nanother name.Even if Christianity, itself renewed, could successfully encounter the\nachievement of renewing society, De Maistre\'s ideal of a spiritual power\ncontrolling the temporal power, and conciliating peoples with their\nrulers by persuasion and a coercion only moral, appears to have little\nchance of being realised.The separation of the two powers is sealed,\nwith a completeness that is increasingly visible.The principles on\nwhich the process of the emancipation of politics is being so rapidly\ncarried on, demonstrate that the most marked tendencies of modern\ncivilisation are strongly hostile to a renewal in any imaginable shape,\nor at any future time, of a connection whether of virtual subordination\nor nominal equality, which has laid such enormous burdens on the\nconsciences and understandings of men.If the Church has the uppermost\nhand, except in primitive times, it destroys freedom; if the State is\nsupreme, it destroys spirituality.The free Church in the free State is\nan idea that every day more fully recommends itself to the public\nopinion of Europe, and the sovereignty of the Pope, like that of all\nother spiritual potentates, can only be exercised over those who choose\nof their own accord to submit to it; a sovereignty of a kind which De\nMaistre thought not much above anarchy.To conclude, De Maistre\'s mind was of the highest type of those who fill\nthe air with the arbitrary assumptions of theology, and the abstractions\nof the metaphysical stage of thought.Daniel went to the office.At every point you meet the\nperemptorily declared volition of a divine being, or the ontological\nproperty of a natural object.The French Revolution is explained by the\nwill of God; and the kings reign because they have the _esprit royal_.Every truth is absolute, not relative; every explanation is universal,\nnot historic.These differences in method and point of view amply\nexplain his arrival at conclusions that seem so monstrous to men who\nlook upon all knowledge as relative, and insist that the only possible\nroad to true opinion lies away from volitions and abstractions in the\npositive generalisations of experience.There can be no more\nsatisfactory proof of the rapidity with which we are leaving these\nancient methods, and the social results which they produced, than the\nwillingness with which every rightly instructed mind now admits how\nindispensable were the first, and how beneficial the second.Those can\nbest appreciate De Maistre and his school, what excellence lay in their\naspirations, what wisdom in their system, who know most clearly why\ntheir aspirations were hopeless, and what makes their system an\nanachronism.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[10] De Maistre forgot or underestimated the services of Leo the\nIsaurian whose repulse of the Caliph\'s forces at Constantinople (A.D.717) was perhaps as important for Europe as the more renowned victory of\nCharles Martel.But then Leo was an Iconoclast and heretic.Finlay\'s\n_Byzantine Empire_, pp.[11] _Du Pape_, bk.[12] _Du Pape_, bk.Mary travelled to the garden.\'The Greeks,\' he\nsays, \'had at times only a secondary share in the ecclesiastical\ncontroversies in the Eastern Church, though the circumstance of these\ncontroversies having been carried on in the Greek language has made the\nnatives of Western Europe attribute them to a philosophic, speculative,\nand polemic spirit, inherent in the Hellenic mind.A very slight\nexamination of history is sufficient to prove that several of the\nheresies which disturbed the Eastern Church had their origin in the more\nprofound religious ideas of the oriental nations, and that many of the\nopinions called heretical were in a great measure expressions of the\nmental nationality of the Syrians, Armenians, Egyptians, and Persians,\nand had no conception whatever with the Greek mind.\'--_Byzantine Empire,\nfrom 716 to 1057_, p.263) remarks very truly, that \'the religious or\ntheological portion of Popery, as a section of the Christian Church, is\nreally Greek; and it is only the ecclesiastical, political, and\ntheoretic peculiarities of the fabric which can be considered as the\nwork of the Latin Church.\'[14] Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen in the _Saturday Review_, Sept.[15] _Du Pape_, bk.[16] _Ib._ bk.[17] _Ib._ bk.Sandra went to the kitchen.[18] \'_Il n\'y a point de souverainete qui pour le bonheur des hommes, et\npour le sien surtout, ne soit bornee de quelque maniere, mais dans\nl\'interieur de ces bornes, placees comme il plait a Dieu, elle est\ntoujours et partout absolue et tenue pour infaillible.Et quand je parle\nde l\'exercice legitime de la souverainete, je n\'entends point ou je ne\ndis point l\'exercice_ juste, _ce qui produirait une amphibologie\ndangereuse, a moins que par ce dernier mot on ne veuille dire que tout\nce qu\'elle opine dans son cercle est_ juste ou tenu pour tel, _ce qui\nest la verite.C\'est ainsi qu\'un tribunal supreme, tant qu\'il ne sort\npas de ses attributions, est toujours juste_; car c\'est la meme chose\nDANS LA PRATIQUE, d\'etre infaillible, ou de se tromper sans appel.\'--Bk.[19] Thomassin, the eminent French theologian, flourished from the\nmiddle to the end of the seventeenth century.The aim of his writings\ngenerally was to reconcile conflicting opinions on discipline or\ndoctrine by exhibiting a true sense in all.In this spirit he wrote on\nthe Pope and the Councils, and on the never-ending question of Grace.Among other things, he insisted that all languages could be traced to\nthe Hebrew.He wrote a defence of the edict in which Lewis XIV.revoked\nthe Edict of Nantes, contending that it was less harsh than some of the\ndecrees of Theodosius and Justinian, which the holiest fathers of the\nChurch had not scrupled to approve--an argument which would now be\nthought somewhat too dangerous for common use, as cutting both ways.Gibbon made use of his _Discipline de l\'Eglise_ in the twentieth\nchapter, and elsewhere.[20] _Du Pape_, bk.[22] Littre, _Auguste Comte et la Phil.[23] _Du Pape_, Conclusion, p.*       *       *       *       *\n\nEND OF VOL.*       *       *       *       *\n\n_Printed by_ R.& R.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['“I know it by the tombstone,” observes Ruby, cheerfully, as they close\nthe gates behind them.“It’s a grey tombstone, and mamma’s name below\na lot of others.This is it, I think,” adds the child, pausing before\na rather desolate-looking grey slab.“Yes, there’s her name at the\nfoot, ‘Janet Stuart,’ and dad says that was her favourite text that’s\nunderneath--‘Surely I come quickly.Even so come, Lord Jesus.’\nI’ll put down the flowers.Sandra moved to the bathroom.I wonder,” says Ruby, looking up into Jack’s\nface with a sudden glad wonder on her own, “if mamma can look down from\nheaven, and see you and me here, and be glad that somebody’s putting\nflowers on her grave at last.”\n\n“She will have other things to be glad about, I think, little Ruby,”\nJack Kirke says very gently.“But she will be glad, I am sure, if she\nsees us--and I think she does,” the young man adds reverently--“that\nthrough all those years her little girl has not forgotten her.”\n\n“But I don’t remember her,” says Ruby, looking up with puzzled eyes.“Only dad says that before she died she said that he was to tell me\nthat she would be waiting for me, and that she had prayed the Lord\nJesus that I might be one of His jewels.I’m not!” cries\nRuby, with a little choke in her voice.“And if I’m not, the Lord Jesus\nwill never gather me, and I’ll never see my mamma again.Even up in\nheaven she might p’raps feel sorry if some day I wasn’t there too.”\n\n“I know,” Jack says quickly.He puts his arm about the little girl’s\nshoulders, and his own heart goes out in a great leap to this child who\nis wondering, as he himself not so very long ago, in a strange mazed\nway, wondered too, if even ’midst heaven’s glories another will “feel\nsorry” because those left behind will not one far day join them there.“I felt that too,” the young man goes on quietly.“But it’s all right\nnow, dear little Ruby red.Everything seemed so dark when Wat died,\nand I cried out in my misery that the God who could let such things be\nwas no God for me.But bit by bit, after a terrible time of doubt, the\nmists lifted, and God seemed to let me know that He had done the very\nbest possible for Wat in taking him away, though I couldn’t understand\njust yet why.The one thing left for me to do now was to make quite\nsure that one day I should meet Wat again, and I couldn’t rest till\nI made sure of that.It’s so simple, Ruby, just to believe in the\ndear Lord Jesus, so simple, that when at last I found out about it, I\nwondered how I could have doubted so long.I can’t speak about such\nthings,” the young fellow adds huskily, “but I felt that if you feel\nabout your mother as I did about Wat, that I must help you.Don’t you\nsee, dear, just to trust in Christ with all your heart that He is able\nto save you, and He _will_.It was only for Wat’s sake that I tried to\nlove Him first; but now I love Him for His own.”\n\nIt has cost Ruby’s friend more than the child knows to make even this\nsimple confession of his faith.But I think that in heaven’s morning\nJack’s crown will be all the brighter for the words he spoke to a\ndoubting little girl on a never-to-be-forgotten winter’s day.For it is\nsaid that even those who but give to drink of a cup of cold water for\nthe dear Christ’s sake shall in no wise lose their reward.“I love you, Jack,” is all Ruby says, with a squeeze of her friend’s\nhand.“And if I do see mamma in heaven some day, I’ll tell her how\ngood you’ve been to me.Jack, won’t it be nice if we’re all there\ntogether, Wat and you, and dad and mamma and me?”\n\nJack does not answer just for a moment.The young fellow’s heart has\ngone out with one of those sudden agonizing rushes of longing to the\nbrother whom he has loved, ay, and still loves, more than life itself.It _must_ be better for Wat--of that Jack with all his loyal heart\nfeels sure; but oh, how desolately empty is the world to the brother\nJack left behind!One far day God will let they two meet again;\nthat too Jack knows; but oh, for one hour of the dear old here and\nnow!In the golden streets of the new Jerusalem Jack will look into\nthe sorrowless eyes of one whom God has placed for ever above all\ntrouble, sorrow, and pain; but the lad’s heart cries out with a fierce\nyearning for no glorified spirit with crown-decked brow, but the dear\nold Wat with the leal home love shining out of his eyes, and the warm\nhand-clasp of brotherly affection.Fairer than all earthly music the\nsong of the redeemed may ring throughout the courts of heaven; but\nsweeter far in those fond ears will sound the well-loved tones which\nJack Kirke has known since he was a child.“Yes, dear,” Jack says, with a swift, sudden smile for the eager little\nface uplifted to his, “it _will_ be nice.So we must make sure that we\nwon’t disappoint them, mustn’t we?”\n\nAnother face than Ruby’s uprises before the young man’s eyes as he\nspeaks, the face of the brother whose going had made all the difference\nto Jack’s life; but who, up in heaven, had brought him nearer to God\nthan he ever could have done on earth.Not a dead face, as Jack had\nlooked his last upon it, but bright and loving as in the dear old days\nwhen the world seemed made for those two, who dreamed such great things\nof the wonderful “may be” to come.But now God has raised Wat higher\nthan even his airy castles have ever reached--to heaven itself, and\nbrought Jack, by the agony of loss, very near unto Himself.No, Jack\ndetermines, he must make sure that he will never disappoint Wat.The red sun, like a ball of fire, is setting behind the dark, leafless\ntree-tops when at last they turn to go, and everything is very still,\nsave for the faint ripple of the burn through the long flats of field\nas it flows out to meet the sea.Fast clasped in Jack’s is Ruby’s\nlittle hand; but a stronger arm than his is guiding both Jack and\nRuby onward.In the dawning, neither Wat nor Ruby’s mother need fear\ndisappointment now.Daniel moved to the bedroom.“I’m glad I came,” says Ruby in a very quiet little voice as the train\ngoes whizzing home.“There was nobody to come but me, you see, me and\ndad, for dad says that mamma had no relations when he married her.They\nwere all dead, and she had to be a governess to keep herself.Dad says\nthat he never saw any one so brave as my own mamma was.”\n\n“See and grow up like her, then, little Ruby,” Jack says with one of\nhis bright, kindly smiles.John went to the office.“It’s the best sight in the world to see a\nbrave woman; at least _I_ think so,” adds the young man, smiling down\ninto the big brown eyes looking up into his.He can hardly help marvelling, even to himself, at the situation in\nwhich he now finds himself.How Wat would have laughed in the old\ndays at the idea of Jack ever troubling himself with a child, Jack,\nwho had been best known, if not exactly as a child-hater, at least as\na child-avoider.Is it Wat’s mantle\ndropped from the skies, the memory of that elder brother’s kindly\nheart, which has softened the younger’s, and made him “kind,” as Ruby\none long gone day had tried to be, to all whom he comes in contact\nwith?For Wat’s sake Jack had first tried to do right; ay, but now it\nis for a greater than that dear brother’s, even for Christ’s.Valiant-for-Truth of old renown, Wat has left as sword the legacy of\nhis great and beautiful charity to the young brother who is to succeed\nhim in the pilgrimage.“Jack,” Ruby whispers that evening as she kisses her friend good night,\n“I’m going to try--you know.I don’t want to disappoint mamma.”\n\nUp in heaven I wonder if the angels were glad that night.There is an old, old verse ringing in my ears, none the\nless true that he who spoke it in the far away days has long since gone\nhome to God: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of\nthe firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars\nfor ever and ever.”\n\nSurely, in the dawning of that “summer morn” Jack’s crown will not be a\nstarless one.John went back to the kitchen.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nMAY.“For God above\n    Is great to grant, as mighty to make,\n  And creates the love to reward the love:\n    I claim you still for my own love’s sake!”\n\n                                     BROWNING.Ruby comes into the drawing-room one afternoon to find the facsimile of\nthe photograph in Jack’s pocket-book sitting with Mrs.“This is our little Australian, May,” the elder lady says, stretching\nout her hand to Ruby.“Ruby, darling, this is Miss Leslie.Perhaps Jack\nmay have told you about her.”\n\n“How do you do, dear?” Miss May Leslie asks.She has a sweet, clear\nvoice, and just now does not look half so dreamy as in her photograph,\nRuby thinks.Mary travelled to the office.Her dark green frock and black velvet hat with ostrich\ntips set off her fair hair and delicately tinted face to perfection,\nand her blue eyes are shining as she holds out her hand to the little\ngirl.“I’ve seen your photograph,” Ruby announces, looking up into the sweet\nface above her.“It fell out of Jack’s pocket-book one day.He has it\nthere with Wat’s.I’m going to give him mine to carry there too; for\nJack says he only keeps the people he likes best in it.”\n\nMiss Leslie grows suddenly, and to Ruby it seems unaccountably, as red\nas her own red frock.But for all that the little girl cannot help\nthinking that she does not look altogether ill-pleased.Kirke\nsmiles in rather an embarrassed way.“Have you been long in Scotland, Ruby?” the young lady questions, as\nthough desirous of changing the subject.“We came about the beginning of December,” Ruby returns.Daniel journeyed to the office.And then she\ntoo puts rather an irrelevant question: “Are you May?”\n\n“Well, yes, I suppose I am May,” Miss Leslie answers, laughing in spite\nof herself.“But how did you know my name, Ruby?”\n\n“Jack told her, I suppose.Was that it, Ruby?” says Jack’s mother.“And\nthis is a child, May, who, when she is told a thing, never forgets it.Isn’t that so, little girlie?”\n\n“No, but Jack didn’t tell me,” Ruby answers, lifting wide eyes to her\nhostess.“I just guessed that you must be May whenever I came in, and\nthen I heard auntie call you it.” For at Mrs.Kirke’s own request,\nthe little girl has conferred upon her this familiar title.“I’ve got\na dolly called after you,” goes on the child with sweet candour.“May\nKirke’s her name, and Jack says it’s the prettiest name he ever heard,\n‘May Kirke,’ I mean.For you see the dolly came from Jack, and when I\ncould only call her half after him, I called her the other half after\nyou.”\n\n“But, my dear little girl, how did you know my name?” May asks in some\namazement.Her eyes are sparkling as she puts the question.No one\ncould accuse May Leslie of being dreamy now.“It was on the card,” Ruby announces, triumphantly.John went to the hallway.Well is it for Jack\nthat he is not at hand to hear all these disclosures.“Jack left it\nbehind him at Glengarry when he stayed a night with us, and your name\nwas on it.John went to the bathroom.Then I knew some other little girl must have given it to\nJack.I didn’t know then that she would be big and grown-up like you.”\n\n“Ruby!I am afraid that you are a sad little tell-tale,” Mrs.It is rather a sore point with her that this pink-and-white\ngirl should have slighted her only son so far as to refuse his hand\nand heart.Poor Jack, he had had more sorrows to bear than Walter’s\ndeath when he left the land of his birth at that sad time.In the fond\nmother’s eyes May is not half good enough for her darling son; but\nMay’s offence is none the more to be condoned on that account.“I must really be going, Mrs.Kirke,” the young lady says, rising.She\ncannot bear that any more of Ruby’s revelations, however welcome to\nher own ears, shall be made in the presence of Jack’s mother.“I have\ninflicted quite a visitation upon you as it is.You will come and see\nme, darling, won’t you?” this to Ruby.Kirke if she will be\nso kind as to bring you some day.”\n\n“And I’ll bring May Kirke too,” Ruby cries.It may have been the\nfirelight which sends an added redness to the other May’s cheeks, as\nRuby utters the name which Jack has said is “the prettiest he has ever\nheard.”\n\nRuby escorts her new-found friend down to the hall door, issuing from\nwhich Miss Leslie runs full tilt against a young man coming in.“Oh, Jack,” Ruby cries, “you’re just in time!Miss May’s just going\naway.I’ve forgotten her other name, so I’m just going to call her Miss\nMay.”\n\n“May I see you home?” Jack Kirke asks.“It is too dark now for you to\ngo by yourself.” He looks straight into the eyes of the girl he has\nknown since she was a child, the girl who has refused his honest love\nbecause she had no love to give in return, and May']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"To be shut in here for three years would be enough to drive\nany one crazy, I say."Sandra travelled to the garden."You will notice," said the coroner, "that the only entrance to the bath\nis through the library or her ladyship\'s bedroom.No one could have let\nhimself down through the skylight, as it is protected by iron bars.""It was here and in the library that Lord Wilmersley spent his time, and\nit was here in the right-hand corner of the bath that his body was\ndiscovered this morning by one of the housemaids.The spot, as you see,\nis exactly opposite her ladyship\'s door and that door was found open,\njust as it stands at present.Now the housemaids swear that they always\nfound it closed and it is their belief that his lordship used to lock\nher ladyship in her rooms before retiring to his own quarters for the\nnight.At all events they were never allowed to see her ladyship or\nenter her apartments unless his lordship or her ladyship\'s maid was also\npresent.""At about what time is Lord Wilmersley supposed to have been killed?""Judging from the condition of the body, the doctor thinks that the\nmurder was committed between eleven and twelve P.M.," replied the\ncoroner; "and whoever fired the shot must have stood five or six feet\nfrom Lord Wilmersley; in all probability, therefore, in the doorway of\nthe bedroom.Nothing has been touched, and you see\nthat neither here nor in the swimming-bath are there signs of a\nstruggle.""The door leading into the hall was found locked?""Then how did the house-man enter?"asked Cyril, pointing to a door to\nhis left."Into the sitting-room," replied the coroner, throwing it open."It was\nhere, I am told, that Lady Wilmersley usually spent the morning."It was a large, pleasant room panelled in white.A few faded pastels of\nby-gone beauties ornamented the walls.A gilt cage in which slumbered a\ncanary hung in one of the windows.Cyril looked eagerly about him for\nsome traces of its late occupant\'s personality; but except for a piece\nof unfinished needlework, lying on a small table near the fireplace,\nthere was nothing to betray the owner\'s taste or occupations.Mary moved to the bathroom."And there is no way out of this room except through the bedroom?"Judson thought of that and has tapped the walls.""These windows as well as those in the bedroom are fitted with heavy\niron bars."Who was the last person known to have seen Lord Wilmersley alive?"He carried coffee into the swimming-bath at a quarter past\nnine, as was his daily custom."And he swears that in passing out through the library he heard\nthe bolt click behind him."John went back to the bathroom."What sort of a person is Mustapha?""Lord Wilmersley brought him back with him when he returned from the\nEast.He had the greatest confidence in him," said the vicar."Do you know what his fellow-servants think of him," inquired Cyril,\naddressing the coroner.I fancy he is not a favourite, but no one\nhas actually said anything against him.""How few of us are able to\novercome our inborn British suspicion of the foreigner!""See, here is his\nlordship\'s desk.There are the drawers in which the L300 were found, and\nyet any one could have picked that lock.""Into Lord Wilmersley\'s bedroom, the window of which is also provided\nwith iron bars.""And that room has no exit but this?"If the murderer came from outside, he must have got in\nthrough one of these windows, which are the only ones in this wing which\nhave no protection, and this one was found ajar--but it may have been\nused only as an exit, not as an entrance."Even a woman would have no difficulty in jumping to\nthe ground."But it couldn\'t have been a burglar," said the vicar, "for what object\ncould a thief have for destroying a portrait?""Oh, didn\'t you know that her ladyship\'s portrait was found cut into\nshreds?""And a pair of Lady Wilmersley\'s scissors lay on the floor in front of\nit," added the vicar."Let me see it," cried Cyril.Going to a corner of the room the vicar pulled aside a velvet curtain\nbehind which hung the wreck of a picture.The canvas was slashed from\ntop to bottom.No trace of the face was left; only a small piece of fair\nhair was still distinguishable.Cyril grasped Twombley\'s arm.And his mysterious _protegee_ was\ndark!"What--what was the colour of Lady Wilmersley\'s hair?""A very pale yellow," replied the coroner.For the convenience of my readers I give a diagram of Lord and Lady\nWilmersley\'s apartments.[Illustration:\n    X. Spot where Lord Wilmersley\'s body was found.CHAPTER V\n\nTHE DETECTIVE DETECTS\n\n\n"A very pale yellow!"Every fact, every inference had seemed to prove beyond the shadow of a\ndoubt that his _protegee_ and Lady Wilmersley were one and the same\nperson.Was it possible that she could have worn a wig?No, for he\nremembered that in lifting her veil, he had inadvertently pulled her\nhair a little and had admired the way it grew on her temples."Why does the colour of her ladyship\'s hair interest you, my lord?"Cyril blushed with confusion as he realised that all three men were\nwatching him with evident astonishment.What a fool he was not to have\nbeen able to conceal his surprise!However, as it was not his cousin\'s murderess he was hiding, he felt he\nhad nothing to fear from the detective, so ignoring him he turned to Mr.Twombley and said with a forced laugh:\n\n"I must be losing my mind, for I distinctly remember hearing a friend of\nmine rave about Lady Wilmersley\'s dark beauty."Rather a fishy\nexplanation, thought poor Cyril; but really his powers of invention were\nexhausted.The latter was no longer looking at\nhim, but was contemplating his watch-chain with absorbed attention."Never had seen her,\nI suppose; no one ever did, you know, except out driving.""It was either a silly joke or my memory is in a bad shape," said Cyril."Luckily it is a matter of no consequence.What is of vital importance,\nhowever," he continued, turning to the detective, "is that her ladyship\nshould be secured immediately.No one is safe while she is still at\nlarge.""It is unfortunate," replied the detective, "that no photograph of her\nladyship can be found, but we have telegraphed her description all over\nthe country.""What is her description, by the way?""Here it is, my lord," said Judson, handing Cyril a printed sheet."Height, 5 feet 3; weight, about 9 stone 2; hair, very fair, inclined to\nbe wavy; nose, straight; mouth, small; eyes, blue; face, oval," read\nCyril."Well, I suppose that will have to do, but of course that\ndescription would fit half the women in England."Twombley, when you said just now that no one knew her, did you mean\nthat literally?""Nobody in the county did; I\'m sure of that."Is it possible that even you never saw her?""Then so far as you know, the only person outside the castle she could\ncommunicate with was the doctor.John went to the hallway."Why, the doctor who had charge of her case, of course," replied Cyril\nimpatiently."I never heard of her having a doctor.""Do you mean to say that Wilmersley kept her in confinement without\norders from a physician?"There must have been some one,"\nfaltered the vicar a trifle abashed."You never, however, inquired by what authority he kept his wife shut\nup?""I never insulted Lord Wilmersley by questioning the wisdom of his\nconduct or the integrity of his motives, and I repeat that there was\nundoubtedly some physician in attendance on Lady Wilmersley, only I do\nnot happen to know who he is.""Well, I must clear this matter up at once."Who was her ladyship\'s physician?""My lady never \'ad one; leastways not till yesterday.""Yes, my lord, yesterday afternoon two gentlemen drove up in a fly and\none of them says \'is name is Dr.Brown and that \'e was expected, and \'is\nlordship said as how I was to show them in here, and so I did.""You think they came to see her ladyship?""Yes, my lord, and at dinner her ladyship seemed very much upset.She\ndidn\'t eat a morsel, though \'is lordship urged \'er ever so.""But why should a doctor\'s visit upset her ladyship?"The butler pursed his lips and looked mysterious."I can\'t say, my\nlord.""Nonsense, you\'ve some idea in your head."Well, my lord, me and Charles, we thought as she was afraid they were\ngoing to lock \'er up."exclaimed the vicar, clasping his\nhands."But, sir, her ladyship wasn\'t crazy!They all say so, but it isn\'t\ntrue.Me and Charles \'ave watched \'er at table day in and day out and\nwe\'re willing to swear that she isn\'t any more crazy than--than me!Please excuse the liberty, but I never thought \'er ladyship was treated\nright, I never did.""Why, you told me yourself that his lordship was devoted to her.""So \'e was, my lord, so \'e was.""If her ladyship is not insane, why do you think his lordship kept her a\nprisoner here?""Well, my lord, some people \'ave thought that it was jealousy as made\nhim do it.""That," exclaimed the vicar, "is a vile calumny, which I have done my\nbest to refute.""So jealousy was the motive generally ascribed to my cousin\'s treatment\nof his wife?""Not generally, far from it; but I regret to say that there are people\nwho professed to believe it.""Did her ladyship have a nurse?"asked Cyril, addressing the butler."No, my lord, only a maid."Valdriguez is a very respectable person, my lord.""Perhaps, my lord, I don\'t pronounce it just right."Yes, my lord, she was here first in the time of Lord Wilmersley\'s\nmother, and \'is lordship brought \'er back again when he returned from\n\'is \'oneymoon.Lady Wilmersley never left these rooms without \'aving\neither \'is lordship, Mustapha, or Valdriguez with \'er.""Very good, Douglas, you can go now."cried Cyril when the door closed behind the\nbutler."Here in civilised England a poor young creature is kept in\nconfinement with a Spanish woman and a Turk to watch over her, and no\none thinks of demanding an investigation!Never liked the man myself--confess it now--but I\ndidn\'t know anything against him."I am deeply pained by your attitude to your unfortunate cousin, who\npaid with his life for his devotion to an afflicted woman.I feel it my\nduty to say that your suspicions are unworthy of you.I must go now; I\nhave some parochial duties to attend to."And with scant ceremony the\nvicar stalked out of the room.Can\'t be late for\ndinner--wife, you know.Why don\'t you come with me--gloomy\nhere--delighted to put you up.It\'s awfully good of you\nto suggest it, though.""Not at all; sorry you won\'t come.See you at the inquest," said\nTwombley as he took his departure followed by the coroner.Before him\non the desk lay his cousin\'s blotter.Its white surface still bore the\nimpress of the latter\'s thick, sprawling handwriting.That chair not so\nmany hours ago had held his unwieldy form.The murdered man\'s presence\nseemed to permeate the room.Mary moved to the kitchen.The heavy,\nperfume-laden air stifled him.He could hear nothing but\nthe tumultuous beating of his own heart.Yet he was sure, warned by some\nmysterious instinct, that he was not alone.He longed to move, but terror riveted him to the spot.John went to the bedroom.A vision of his\ncousin\'s baleful eyes rose before him with horrible vividness.He could\nfeel their vindictive glare scorching him.No, he must face the--thing--come what might.Throwing back his\nhead defiantly, he wheeled around--the detective was at his elbow!Cyril\ngave a gasp of relief and wiped the tell-tale perspiration from his\nforehead.What a shocking state\nhis nerves were in!"Can you spare me a few minutes, my lord?"Whenever the detective spoke,\nCyril had the curious impression as of a voice issuing from a fog.So\ngrey, so effaced, so absolutely characterless was the man\'s exterior!His voice, on the other hand, was excessively individual.There lurked\nin it a suggestion of assertiveness, of aggressiveness even.Cyril was\nconscious of a sudden dread of this strong, insistent personality, lying\nas it were at ambush within that envelope of a body, that envelope which\nhe felt he could never penetrate, which gave no indication whether it\nconcealed a friend or enemy, a saint or villain."I shall not detain you long," Judson added, as Cyril did not answer\nimmediately."Come into the drawing-room," said Cyril, leading the way there.Thank God, he could breathe freely once more, thought Cyril, as he flung\nhimself into the comfortable depths of a chintz-covered sofa.How\ndelightfully wholesome and commonplace was this room!The air, a trifle\nchill, notwithstanding the coal fire burning on the hearth, was like\nbalm to his fevered senses.Sandra travelled to the hallway.He no longer understood the terror which had so lately possessed him.How could he ever have dignified this remarkably\nunremarkable little man with his pompous manner into a mysterious and\npossibly hostile force."Sit down, Judson," said Cyril carelessly."My lord, am I not right in supposing that I am unknown to you?Let me tell you then, my lord, that I am the\nreceptacle of the secrets of most, if not all, of the aristocracy."I\'ll take good care, he thought, that mine don\'t\nswell the number."That being the case, it is clear that my reputation for discretion is\nunassailable.You see the force of that argument, my lord?""Anything, therefore, which I may discover during the course of this\ninvestigation, you may rest assured will be kept absolutely secret.""You can, therefore, confide in me without fear,"\ncontinued the detective.Cyril was surprised and a little startled."What makes you think I have anything to confide?""It is quite obvious, my lord, that you are holding something\nback--something which would explain your attitude towards Lady\nWilmersley.""I don\'t follow you," replied Cyril, on his guard."You have given every one to understand that you have never seen her\nladyship.You take up a stranger\'s cause very warmly, my lord.""I trust I shall always espouse the cause of every persecuted woman.""But how are you sure that she was persecuted?Every one praises his\nlordship\'s devotion to her.He gave her everything she could wish for\nexcept liberty.If she was insane, his conduct deserves great praise.""But you yourself urged me to secure her as soon as possible because you\nwere afraid she might do further harm," Judson reminded him.Mary went to the hallway."That was before I heard Douglas\'s testimony.He has seen her daily for\nthree years and swears she is sane.""And the opinion of an ignorant servant is sufficient to make you\ncondemn his lordship without further proof?""If Lady Wilmersley is perfectly sane, it seems to me incredible that\nshe did not manage to escape years ago.A note dropped out of her\ncarriage would have brought the whole countryside to her rescue.Why,\nshe had only to appeal to this very same butler, who is convinced of her\nsanity, and Lord Wilmers']
