EPISODIC MEMORY: ['In the lower\nstrata of air there was scarcely any wind, and the rain came down\nvertically, copiously, and without beating violence.The sun-warmed earth\ntook in every drop like a great sponge.Beyond the first muttered warning to the little May party in the grove\nthere was no thunder.The patter of the rain was a gentle lullaby to Amy,\nand at last she was wakened by a ray of sunlight playing upon her face,\nyet she still heard the soft fall of rain.With the elasticity of youth,\nshe sprang up, feeling that the other cloud that had shadowed her\nthoughts might soon pass also.As she went singing down the stairway,\nWebb called from the front door: "Amy, look here!The cloud still hung heavily over the eastern\nmountains, while against it was a magnificent arch, and so distinctly\ndefined that its feet appeared to rest on the two banks of the river.They watched it in silence until it faded away, and the whole scene,\ncrowned with flowers and opening foliage tinted like blossoms of varied\nhues, was gemmed with crystals by the now unclouded sun, for the soft\nrain had clung to everything, from the loftiest tree-top to the tiniest\nspire of grass.Flame-like orioles were flashing through the perfumed\nair.Robins, with their heads lifted heavenward, were singing as\nrapturously as if they were saints rather than rollicking gormandizers.Every bird that had a voice was lifting it up in thanksgiving, but clear,\nsweet, and distinct above them all came the notes of the wood-thrush,\nwith his Beethoven-like melody."Have you no words for a scene like this, Webb?"My wonder\nexceeds even my admiration, for the greater part of this infinite variety\nof beauty is created out of so few materials and by so simple yet\nmysterious a method that I can scarcely believe it, although I see it and\nknow it.Men have always agreed to worship the genius which could achieve\nthe most with the least.And yet the basis of nearly all we see is a\nmicroscopic cell endowed with essential powers.That large apple-tree\nyonder, whose buds are becoming so pink, started from one of these minute\ncells, and all the growth, beauty, and fruitfulness since attained were\nthe result of the power of this one cell to add to itself myriads of like\ncells, which form the whole structure.It is cell adding cells that is\ntransforming the world around us."He spoke earnestly, and almost as if\nhe were thinking aloud, and he looked like one in the presence of a\nmystery that awed him.The hue of Amy\'s eyes deepened, and her face\nflushed in her quickened interest.Her own mind had been turning to\nkindred thoughts and questionings.She had passed beyond the period when\na mind like hers could be satisfied with the mere surface of things, and\nWebb\'s direct approach to the very foundation principles of what she saw\nsent a thrill through all her nerves as an heroic deed would have done."Can you not show me one of those cells with your microscope?""Yes, easily, and some of its contents through the cell\'s transparent\nwalls, as, for instance, the minute grains of _chlorophyll_, that is, the\ngreen of leaves.All the hues of foliage and flowers are caused by what\nthe cells contain, and these, to a certain extent, can be seen and\nanalyzed.But there is one thing within the cell which I cannot show you,\nand which has never been seen, and yet it accounts for everything, and is\nthe architect of all--life.When we reach the cell we are at the\nthreshold of this mysterious presence.We can\nsee its work, for its workshop is under our eye, and in this minute shop\nit is building all the vegetation of the world, but the artisan itself\never remains invisible.""Ah, Webb, do not say artisan, but rather artist.Does not the beauty all\naround us prove it?Surely there is but one explanation, the one papa\ntaught me: it is the power of God.He is in the little as well as in the\ngreat."Well, Amy," he replied, smilingly, "the faith taught you by your father\nis, to my mind, more rational than any of the explanations that I have\nread, and I have studied several.But then I know little, indeed,\ncompared with multitudes of others.I am sure, however, that the life of\nGod is in some way the source of all the life we see.But perplexing\nquestions arise on every side.Much of life is so repulsive and noxious--\nBut there!what a fog-bank I am leading you into this crystal May\nevening!Most young girls would vote me an insufferable bore should I\ntalk to them in this style.""So much the worse for the young girls then.I should think they would\nfeel that no compliment could exceed that of being talked to as if they\nhad brains.But I do not wish to put on learned airs.You know how\nignorant I am of even the beginnings of this knowledge.All that I can\nsay is that I am not content to be ignorant.Mary went back to the hallway.The curiosity of Mother Eve\nis growing stronger every day; and is it strange that it should turn\ntoward the objects, so beautiful and yet so mysterious, that meet my eyes\non every side?""No," said he, musingly, "the strange thing is that people have so little\ncuriosity in regard to their surroundings.Why, multitudes of intelligent\npersons are almost as indifferent as the cattle that browse around among\nthe trees and flowers.I once used to\ninvestigate things, but did not see them.I have thought about it very\nmuch this spring.It is said that great painters and sculptors study\nanatomy as well as outward form.Perhaps here is a good hint for those\nwho are trying to appreciate nature.I am not so shallow as to imagine\nthat I can ever understand nature any more than I can you with your\ndirect, honest gaze.So to the thoughtful mystery is ever close at hand,\nbut it seems no little thing to trace back what one sees as far as one\ncan, and you have made me feel that it is a great thing to see the Divine\nArtist\'s finished work."They were now joined by others, and the perfect beauty of the evening as\nit slowly faded into night attracted much attention from all the family.The new moon hung in the afterglow of the western sky, and as the dusk\ndeepened the weird notes of the whip-poor-will were heard for the first\ntime from the mountain-sides.At the supper-table Leonard beamed on every one."A rain like this, after\na week of sunshine has warmed the earth" he exclaimed, "is worth millions\nto the country."Yes," added his father, "the old Indian sign, the unfolding of the oak\nleaves, indicates that it is now safe to plant.After long years of observation I am satisfied that the true secret\nof success in farming is the doing of everything at just the right time.Crops put in too early or too late often partially fail; but if the right\nconditions are complied with from the beginning, they start with a vigor\nwhich is not lost until maturity."Burt indulged in a gayety that was phenomenal even for him, but after\nsupper he disappeared.Amy retired to her room early, but she sat a long\ntime at her window and looked out into the warm, fragrant night.She had\nforgotten poor Burt, who was thinking of her, as in his unrest he rode\nmile after mile, holding his spirited horse down to a walk.She had\nalmost forgotten Webb, but she thought deeply of his words, of the life\nthat was working all around her so silently and yet so powerfully.Unseen\nit had created the beauty she had enjoyed that day.From the very\ncontrast of ideas it made her think of death, of her father, who once had\nbeen so strong and full of life.The mystery of one seemed as great as\nthat of the other, and a loneliness such as she had not felt before for\nmonths depressed her."I wish I could talk to Webb again," she thought."He says he does not\nunderstand me.It would seem\nthat when one began to think nothing that appeared simple before is\nunderstood; but his words are strong and assured.He leads one to the\nboundaries of the known, and then says, quietly, we can go no further;\nbut he makes you feel that what is beyond is all right.Oh, I wish Burt\nwas like him!"CHAPTER XXX\n\nSPRING-TIME PASSION\n\n\nBut little chance had Amy to talk with Webb for the next few days.He had\nseen the cloud on Burt\'s brow, and had observed that he was suspicious,\nunhappy, and irritable; that reason and good sense were not in the\nascendant; and he understood his brother sufficiently well to believe\nthat his attack must run its natural course, as like fevers had done\nbefore.From what he had seen he also thought that Amy could deal with\nBurt better than any one else, for although high-strung, he was also\nmanly and generous when once he got his bearings.In his present mood he\nwould bitterly resent interference from any one, but would be bound to\nobey Amy and to respect her wishes.Therefore he took especial pains to\nbe most kindly, but also to appear busy and pre-occupied.It must not be thought that Burt was offensive or even openly obtrusive\nin his attentions.He was far too well-bred for that.There was nothing\nfor which even his mother could reprove him, or of which Amy herself\ncould complain.It was the suit itself from which she shrank, or rather\nwhich she would put off indefinitely.But Burt was not disposed to put\nanything that he craved into the distance.Spring-tide impulses were in\nhis veins, and his heart was so overcharged that it must find expression.A long, exquisite day had merged into\na moonlight evening.The apple-blossoms were in all their white-and-pink\nglory, and filled the summer-like air with a fragrance as delicate as\nthat of the arbutus.The petals of the cherry were floating down like\nsnow in every passing breeze, glimmering momentarily in the pale\nradiance.The night was growing so beautiful that Amy was tempted to\nstroll out in the grounds, and soon she yielded to a fancy to see the\neffect of moonlight through an apple-tree that towered like a mound of\nsnow at some little distance from the house.She would not have been\nhuman had the witchery of the May evening been without its influence.If\nBurt could have understood her, this was his opportunity.If he had come\nwith step and tone that accorded with the quiet evening, and simply said,\n"Amy, you know--you have seen that I love you; what hope can you give\nme?"she in her present mood would have answered him as gently and\nfrankly as a child.She might have laughingly pointed him to the tree,\nand said: "See, it is in blossom now.It will be a long time before you\npick the apples.If you will be sensible, and treat me as\nyou would Johnnie, were she older, I will ride and walk with you, and be\nas nice to you as I can."But this Burt could not do and still remain Burt.He was like an\novercharged cloud, and when he spoke at last his words seemed to the\nsensitive girl to have the vividness and abruptness of the lightning.It\nwas her custom to make a special toilet for the evening, and when she had\ncome down to supper with a rose in her hair, and dressed in some light\nclinging fabric, she had proved so attractive to the young fellow that he\nfelt that the limit of his restraint was reached.He would appeal to her\nso earnestly, so passionately, as to kindle her cold nature.In his lack\nof appreciation of Amy he had come to deem this his true course, and she\nunconsciously enabled him to carry out the rash plan.He had seen her\nstroll away, and had followed her until she should be so far from the\nhouse that she must listen.As she emerged from under the apple-tree,\nthrough which as a white cloud she had been looking at the moon, he\nappeared so suddenly as to startle her, and without any gentle reassurance\nhe seized her hand, and poured out his feelings in a way that at first\nwounded and frightened her."Burt," she cried, "why do you speak to me so?Can\'t you see that I do\nnot feel as you do?I\'ve given you no reason to say such words to me."Are you as cold and elusive as this moonlight?I\nhave waited patiently, and now I must and will speak.Every man has a\nright to speak and a right to an answer.""Well then," she replied, her spirit rising; "if you will insist on my\nbeing a woman instead of a young girl just coming from the shadow of a\ngreat sorrow, I also have my rights.I\'ve tried to show you gently and\nwith all the tact I possessed that I did not want to think about such\nthings.I\'m just at the beginning of my girlhood and I want to be a young\ngirl as long as I can and not an engaged young woman.No matter who spoke\nthe words you have said, they would pain me.Why couldn\'t you see this\nfrom my manner and save both yourself and me from this scene?I\'ll gladly\nbe your loving sister, but you must not speak to me in this way again.""You refuse me then," he said, throwing back his head haughtily.I simply tell you that I won\'t listen to such words from\nany one.Why can\'t you be sensible and understand me?I no more wish to\ntalk about such things than do Alf and Johnnie.""I do understand you," he exclaimed, passionately, "and better perhaps\nthan you understand yourself.You are a woman, but\nyou seem to lack a woman\'s heart, as far as I am concerned;" and with a\ngesture that was very tragic and despairing he strode away.She was deeply troubled and incensed also, and she returned to the house\nwith drooping head and fast-falling tears."Why, Amy, what is the matter?"Looking up, she saw Webb coming down the\npiazza steps.Yielding to her impulse, she sprang forward and took his\narm, as she said:\n\n"Webb, you have always acted toward me like a brother.is it unnatural in me that I do not wish to hear\nsuch words as Burt would speak to-night?All I ask is that he will let me\nstay a happy young girl till I am ready for something else.This is no\nway for a flower to bloom"--she snatched the rose from her hair, and\npushed open the red petals--"and yet Burt expects me to respond at once\nto feelings that I do not even understand.If it\'s best in the future--but\nsurely I\'ve a right to my freedom for a long time yet.Tell me, do you\nthink I\'m unnatural?""No, Amy," he answered, gently."It is because you are so perfectly\nnatural, so true to your girlhood, that you feel as you do.In that\nlittle parable of the rose you explain yourself fully.You have no cause\nfor self-reproach, nor has Burt for complaint.You say you do not understand me, and yet always prove that\nyou do.If Burt would only treat me as you do, I should be perfectly\nhappy.""Well, Burt\'s good-hearted, but sometimes he mislays his judgment," said\nWebb, laughing.There is no occasion for any high\ntragedy on his part or for grieving on yours.You go and tell mother all\nabout it, and just how you feel.She is the right one to manage this\naffair, and her influence over Burt is almost unbounded.Do this, and,\ntake my word for it, all will soon be serene."Amy felt that night what it is to have a mother\'s\nboundless love and sympathy, and she went to her rest comforted, soothed,\nand more assured as to the future than she had been for a long time."How\nquiet and sensible Webb was about it all!"was her last smiling thought\nbefore she slept.His thought as he strolled away in the moonlight after\nshe left him was, "It is just as if I half believed.She has the mind of\na woman, but the heart of a child.Burt did not stroll; he strode mile after mile, and the uncomfortable\nfeeling that he had been very unwise, to say the least, and perhaps very\nunjust, was growing upon him.When at last he returned, his mother called\nto him through the open door.Clifford always\nobtained the confidence of her children, and they ever found that it was\nsacred.All that can be said, therefore, was, that he came from her\npresence penitent, ashamed, and hopeful.His mood may best be explained,\nperhaps, by a note written before he retired."My dear sister Amy," it\nran, "I wish to ask your pardon.I was\nso blinded and engrossed by my own feelings that I did not understand\nyou.I have proved myself unworthy of even a sister\'s love; but I will\ntry to make amends.Do not judge me harshly because I was so headlong.There is no use in trying to disguise the truth.What I have said so\nunwisely and prematurely I cannot unsay, and I shall always be true to my\nwords.But I will wait patiently as long as you please; and if you find,\nin future years, that you cannot feel as I do, I will not complain or\nblame you, however sad the truth may be to me.In the meantime, let there\nbe no constraint between us.Let me become once more your trusted brother\nBurt."This note he pushed under her door, and then slept too soundly for\nthe blighted youth he had a few hours before deemed himself.He felt a little embarrassed at the prospect of meeting her the next\nmorning, but she broke the ice at once by coming to him on the piazza and\nextending her hand in smiling frankness as she said: "You are neither\nunjust nor ungenerous, Burt, or you would not have written me such a\nnote.As you said the first evening I came, we\nshall have jolly times together."The young fellow was immensely relieved and grateful, and he showed it.Soon afterward he went about the affairs of the day happier than he had\nbeen for a long time.Indeed, it soon became evident that his explosion\non the previous evening had cleared the air generally.Amy felt that the\none threatening cloud had sunk below the horizon.As the days passed, and\nBurt proved that he could keep his promise, her thoughts grew as serene\nas those of Johnnie.Her household duties were not very many, and yet she\ndid certain things regularly.The old people found that she rarely forgot\nthem, and she had the grace to see when she could help and cheer.Attentions that must be constantly asked for have little charm.A day\nrarely passed that did she not give one or more of its best hours to her\nmusic and drawing; for, while she never expected to excel in these arts,\nshe had already learned that they would enable her to give much pleasure\nto others.Her pencil, also, was of great assistance in her study of\nout-door life, for the fixed attention which it required to draw a plant,\ntree, or bit of scenery revealed its characteristics.She had been even\nmore interested in the unfolding of the leaf-buds than in the flowering\nof the trees, and the gradual advance of the foliage, like a tinted\ncloud, up the mountain-<DW72>s, was something she never tired of watching.When she spoke of this one day to Webb, he replied:\n\n"I have often wondered that more is not said and written about our spring\nfoliage, before it passes into its general hue of green.To me it has a\nmore delicate beauty and charm than anything seen in October.Different\ntrees have their distinct coloring now as then, but it is evanescent, and\nthe shades usually are less clearly marked.This very fact, however,\nteaches the eye to have a nicety of distinction that is pleasing."The blossoms faded from the trees, and\nthe miniature fruit was soon apparent.The strawberry rows, that had been\nlike lines of snow, were now full of little promising cones.The grass\ngrew so lusty and strong that the dandelions were hidden except as the\nbreeze caught up the winged seeds that the tuneful yellow-birds often\nseized in the air.The rye had almost reached its height, and Johnnie\nsaid it was "as good as going to the ocean to see it wave."At last the\nswelling buds on the rose-bushes proclaimed the advent of June.CHAPTER XXXI\n\nJUNE AND HONEY-BEES\n\n\nIt is said that there is no heaven anywhere for those incapable of\nrecognizing and enjoying it.Be this as it may, the month of June is a\nsegment of heaven annually bestowed on those whose eyes and ears have been\nopened to beauty in sight and sound.Indeed, what sense in man is not\ngratified to the point of imaginary perfection during this early fruition\nof the varied promise of spring?Even to the sense of touch, how exquisite\nis the "feel" of the fragrant rose-petals, the soft young foliage that has\ntransformed the world, and the queer downy fledglings in innumerable nests!To the eye informed by a heart in love with nature the longest days of the\nyear are all too short to note half that exists and takes place.Who sees\nand distinguishes the varied blossoming of the many kinds of grain and\ngrasses that are waving in every field?And yet here is a beauty as\ndistinct and delicate as can be found in some of Mendelssohn\'s "Songs\nwithout Words"--blossomings so odd, delicate, and evanescent as to suggest\na child\'s dream of a flower.Place them under a strong glass, and who can\nfail to wonder at the miracles of form and color that are revealed?From\nthese tiny flowerets the scale runs upward until it touches the hybrid\nrose.During this period, also, many of the forest trees emulate the wild\nflowers at their feet until their inflorescence culminates in the white\ncord-like fringe that foretells the spiny chestnut burrs.So much has been written comparing this exquisite season when spring\npasses insensibly into summer with the fulfilled prophecy of girlhood,\nthat no attempt shall be made to repeat the simile.Amy\'s birthday should\nhave been in May, but it came early in June.May was still in her heart,\nand might linger there indefinitely; but her mind, her thoughts, kept\npace with nature as unconsciously as the flowers that bloomed in their\nseason.There were little remembrances from all the family, but Webb\'s\ngift promised the most pleasure.It was a powerful opera-glass; and as he\nhanded it to her on the piazza in the early morning he said:\n\n"Our troupe are all here now, Amy, and I thought that you would like to\nsee the singers, and observe their costumes and expressions.Some birds\nhave a good deal of expression and a very charming manner while singing--a\nmanner much more to my taste than that of many a _prima donna_ whom I\nhave heard, although my taste may be uncultivated.Focus your glass on that\nindigo-bird in yonder tree-top.Don\'t you see him?--the one that is\nfavoring us with such a lively strain, beginning with a repetition of\nshort, sprightly notes.The glass may enable you to see his markings\naccurately."and it grows so deep and rich about\nthe head, throat, and breast!How plain I can see him, even to the black\nvelvet under his eyes!John moved to the garden.Why, I can look\nright into his little throat, and almost imagine I see the notes he is\nflinging abroad so vivaciously.I can even make out his claws closed on a\ntwig, and the dew on the leaves around him is like gems.Truly, Webb, you\nwere inspired when you thought of this gift.""Yes," he replied, quietly, looking much pleased, however, "with a very\nhonest wish to add to your enjoyment of the summer.I must confess, too,\nthat I had one thought at least for myself.You have described the\nindigo-bird far more accurately than I could have done, although I have\nseen it every summer as long as I can remember.You have taught me to\nsee; why should I not help you to see more when I can do it so easily?My\nthought was that you would lend me the glass occasionally, so that I\nmight try to keep pace with you.I\'ve been using the microscope too\nmuch--prying into nature, as Burt would say, with the spirit of an\nanatomist.""I shall value the glass a great deal more if you share it with me," she\nsaid, simply, with a sincere, direct gaze into his eyes; "and be assured,\nWebb," she added, earnestly, "you are helping me more than I can help\nyou.I\'m not an artist, and never can be, but if I were I should want\nsomething more than mere surface, however beautiful it might be.Think of\nit, Webb, I\'m eighteen to-day, and I know so little!You always make me\nfeel that there is so much to learn, and, what is more, that it is worth\nknowing.You should have been a teacher, for you would make the children\nfeel, when learning their lessons, as Alf does when after game.she added, sweeping the scene with her\nglass."I can go every day now on an exploring expedition.Clifford came in a little late, rubbing his hands felicitously, as he\nsaid:\n\n"I have just come from the apiary, and think we shall have another swarm\nto-day.Did you ever hear the old saying, Amy,\n\n  \'A swarm of bees in June\n   Is worth a silver spoon\'?Sandra moved to the kitchen.If one comes out to-day, and we hive it safely, we shall call it yours, and\nyou shall have the honey.""How much you are all doing to sweeten my life!"she said, laughing; "but I\nnever expected the present of a swarm of bees.I assure you it is a gift\nthat you will have to keep for me, and yet I should like to see how the\nbees swarm, and how you hive them.I\'ve heard that bees\nare so wise, and know when people are afraid of them.""You can fix yourself up with a thick veil and a pair of gloves so that\nthere will be no danger, and your swarm of bees, when once in hive, will\ntake care of themselves, and help take care of you.That\'s the beauty of\nbee-culture.""Our bees are literally in clover this year," Leonard remarked."That heavy\ncoating of wood-ashes that I gave to a half-acre near the apiary proved\nmost effective, and the plot now looks as if a flurry of snow had passed\nover it, the white clover blossoms are so thick.That is something I could\nnever understand, Webb.Wood-ashes will always bring white clover.It\'s\nhard to believe that it all comes from seed dormant in the ground.""Well, it does," was the reply."A great many think that the ashes simply produce conditions in the soil\nwhich generate the clover."That would not be simple at all, and if any one could\nprove it he would make a sensation in the scientific world.""Now, Len, here\'s your chance," laughed Burt."Just imagine what a halo of\nglory you would get by setting the scientific world agape with wonder!""I could make the scientific world gape in a much easier way," Leonard\nreplied, dryly."Well, Amy, if you are as fond of honey as I am, you will\nthink a swarm of bees a very nice present.Fancy buckwheat cakes eaten with\nhoney made from buckwheat blossoms!There\'s a conjunction that gives to\nwinter an unflagging charm.If the old Hebrews felt as I do, a land flowing\nwith milk and honey must have been very alluring.Such a land the valley of\nthe Hudson certainly is.It\'s one of the finest grass regions of the world,\nand grass means milk; and the extensive raspberry fields along its banks\nmean honey.White clover is all very well, but I\'ve noticed that when the\nraspberry-bushes are in bloom they are alive with bees.I believe even the\nlocust-trees would be deserted for these insignificant little blossoms\nthat, like many plain people, are well worth close acquaintance.""The linden-tree, which also blooms this month," added Webb, "furnishes the\nrichest harvest for the honeybees, and I don\'t believe they would leave its\nblossoms for any others.I wish there were more lindens in this region, for\nthey are as ornamental as they are useful.I\'ve read that they are largely\ncultivated in Russia for the sake of the bees.Mary moved to the office.The honey made from the\nlinden or bass-wood blossoms is said to be crystal in its transparency, and\nunsurpassed in delicacy of flavor."Clifford, "I shall look after the apiary to-day.That\'s\ngood lazy work for an old man.You can help me watch at a safe distance,\nAmy, and protected, as I said, if they swarm.It wouldn\'t be well for you\nto go too near the hives at first, you know," he added, in laughing\ngallantry, "for they might mistake you for a flower.They are so well\nacquainted with me that I raise neither expectations nor fears.You needn\'t\ncome out before ten o\'clock, for they don\'t swarm until toward midday."With shy steps, and well protected, Amy approached the apiary, near which\nthe old gentleman was sitting in placid fearlessness under the shade of a\nmaple, the honey of whose spring blossoms was already in the hive.For a\ntime she kept at a most respectful distance, but, as the bees did not\nnotice her, she at last drew nearer, and removed her veil, and with the aid\nof her glass saw the indefatigable workers coming in and going out with\nsuch celerity that they seemed to be assuring each other that there were\ntons of honey now to be had for the gathering.The bees grew into large\ninsects under her powerful lenses, and their forms and movements were very\ndistinct.Suddenly from the entrance of one hive near Mr.Clifford, which\nshe happened to be covering with her glass, she saw pouring out a perfect\ntorrent of bees.She started back in affright, but Mr.Clifford told her to\nstand still, and she noted that he quietly kept his seat, while following\nthrough his gold-rimmed spectacles the swirling, swaying stream that rushed\ninto the upper air.The combined hum smote the ear with its intensity.Each\nbee was describing circles with almost the swiftness of light, and there\nwere such numbers that they formed a nebulous living mass.Involuntarily\nshe crouched down in the grass.In a few moments, however, she saw the\nswarm draw together and cluster like a great black ball on a bough of a\nsmall pear-tree.The queen had alighted, and all her subjects gathered\naround her."Ah," chuckled the old gentleman, rising quietly, "they couldn\'t have been\nmore sensible if they had been human--not half so sensible in that case,\nperhaps.I think you will have your swarm now without doubt.That\'s the\nbeauty of these Italian bees when they are kept pure: they are so quiet and\nsensible.Come away now, until I return prepared to hive them."The young girl obeyed with alacrity, and was almost trembling with\nexcitement, to which fear as well as the novelty of the scene contributed\nnot a little.Clifford soon returned, well protected and prepared for\nhis work.Taking an empty hive, he placed it on the ground in a secluded\nspot, and laid before its entrances a broad, smooth board.Then he mounted\na step-ladder, holding in his left hand a large tin pan, and gently brushed\nthe bees into it as if they had been inanimate things.A sheet had first\nbeen spread beneath the pear-tree to catch those that did not fall into the\npan.Touched thus gently and carefully, the immense vitality of the swarm\nremained dormant; but a rough, sudden movement would have transformed it\ninstantly into a vengeful cloud of insects, each animated by the one\nimpulse to use its stiletto.Corning down from the ladder he turned the pan\ntoward Amy, and with her glass she saw that it was nearly half full of a\ncrawling, seething mass that fairly made her shudder.But much experience\nrendered the old gentleman confident, and he only smiled as he carried the\npan of bees to the empty hive, and poured them out on the board before it.The sheet was next gathered up and placed near the hive also, and then the\nold gentleman backed slowly and quietly away until he had joined Amy, to\nwhom he said, "My part of the work is now done, and I think we shall soon\nsee them enter the hive."He was right, for within twenty minutes every bee\nhad disappeared within the new domicile."To-night I will place the hive on\nthe platform with the others, and to-morrow your bees will be at work for\nyou, Amy.I don\'t wonder you are so interested, for of all insects I think\nbees take the palm.It is possible that the swarm will not fancy their new\nquarters, and will come out again, but it is not probable.Screened by this\nbush, you can watch in perfect safety;" and he left her well content, with\nher glass fixed on the apiary.Having satisfied herself for the time with observing the workers coming and\ngoing, she went around to the white clover-field to see the process of\ngathering the honey.She had long since learned that bees while at work are\nharmless, unless so cornered that they sting in self-defence.Sitting on a\nrock at the edge of the clover-field, she listened to the drowsy monotone\nof innumerable wings.Then she bent her glass on a clover head, and it grew\nat once into a collection of little white tubes or jars in which from\nearth, air, and dew nature distilled the nectar that the bees were\ngathering.The intent workers stood on their heads and emptied these\nfragrant honey-jars with marvellous quickness.They knew when they were\nloaded, and in straight lines as geometrically true as the hexagon cells in\nwhich the honey would be stored they darted to their hives.When the day\ngrew warm she returned to the house and read, with a wonder and delight\nwhich no fairy tale had ever produced, John Burroughs\'s paper, "The\nPastoral Bees," which Webb had found for her before going to his work.To\nher childish credulity fairy lore had been more interesting than wonderful,\nbut the instincts and habits of these children of nature touched on\nmysteries that can never be solved.At dinner the experiences of the apiary were discussed, and Leonard asked,\n"Do you think the old-fashioned custom of beating tin pans and blowing\nhorns influences a swarm to alight?The custom is still maintained by some\npeople in the vicinity.""It is no longer practiced by scientific\nbee-keepers, and yet it is founded on the principle that anything which\ndisconcerts the bees may change their plans.It is said that water or dry\nearth thrown into a whirling swarm will sometimes cause it to alight or\nreturn to the hive.""Your speaking of blowing horns," said Mr.Clifford, laughing, "recalls a\nhiving experience that occurred seventy years ago.I was a boy then, but\nwas so punctured with stings on a June day like this that a vivid\nimpression was made on my memory.A\nneighbor, a quaint old man who lived very near, had gained the reputation\nof an expert at this business.I can see him now, with his high stove-pipe\nhat, and his gnarled, wrinkled visage, which he shrouded in a green veil\nwhen hiving a swarm.He was a good-hearted old fellow, but very rough in\nhis talk.He had been to sea in early life, and profanity had become the\ncharacteristic of his vernacular.Well, word came one morning that the bees\nwere swarming, and a minute later I aroused the old man, who was smoking\nand dozing on his porch.I don\'t believe you ever ran faster, Alf, than I\ndid then.Hiving bees was the old fellow\'s hobby and pride, and he dived\ninto his cottage, smashing his clay pipe on the way, with the haste of an\nattacked soldier seizing his weapons.In a moment he was out with all his\nparaphernalia.To me was given a fish-horn of portentous size and sound.The\'skips,\' which were the old fashioned straw hives that the bears so\noften emptied for our forefathers, stood in a large door-yard, over which\nthe swarm was circling.As we arrived on the scene the women were coming\nfrom the house with tin pans, and nearly all the family were out-of-doors.It so happened that an old white horse was grazing in the yard, and at this\ncritical moment was near the end of the bench on which stood the hives.Coming up behind him, I thoughtlessly let off a terrific blast from my\nhorn, at which he, terrified, kicked viciously.Over went a straw skip, and\nin a moment we had another swarm of bees on hand that we had not bargained\nfor.Dropping my horn, I covered my face with my arm, and ran for life to\nthe house, but I must have been stung twenty times before I escaped.The\nbees seemed everywhere, and as mad as hornets.Although half wild with\npain, I had to laugh as I saw the old man frantically trying to adjust his\nveil, meanwhile almost dancing in his anguish.In half a minute he\nsuccumbed, and tore into a wood-shed.Everybody went to cover instantly\nexcept the white horse, and he had nowhere to go, but galloped around the\nyard as if possessed.This only made matters worse, for innocent as he was,\nthe bees justly regarded him as the cause of all the trouble.At last, in\nhis uncontrollable agony, he floundered over a stone wall, and disappeared.For an hour or two it was almost as much as one\'s life was worth to venture\nout.The old man, shrouded and mittened, at last crept off homeward to\nnurse his wounds and his wrath, and he made the air fairly sulphurous\naround him with his oaths.But that kind of sulphuric treatment did not\naffect the bees, for I observed from a window that at one point nearest the\nskips he began to run, and he kept up a lively pace until within his door.What became of the swarm we expected to hive I do not know.That night we destroyed the irate swarm whose skip had\nbeen kicked over, and peace was restored.""If you had told that story at the breakfast-table," said Amy, as soon as\nthe laugh caused by the old gentleman\'s account had subsided, "you could\nnever have induced me to be present this morning, even at such a respectful\ndistance.""An old man who lives not far from us has wonderful success with bees,"\nLeonard remarked."He has over fifty hives in a space not more than twenty\nfeet square, and I do not think there is a tenth of an acre in his whole\nlot, which is in the centre of a village.To this bare little plot his bees\nbring honey from every side, so that for his purpose he practically owns\nthis entire region.He potters around them so much that, as far as he is\nconcerned, they are as docile as barn-door fowls, and he says he minds a\nsting no more than a mosquito bite.There are half a dozen small trees and\nbushes in his little yard, and his bees are so accommodating that they\nrarely swarm elsewhere than on these low trees within a lew feet of the\nskips.He also places mullein stalks on a pole, and the swarms often\ncluster on them.He told me that on one day last summer he had ten swarms\nto look after, and that he hived them all; and he says that his wife is as\ngood at the work as he is.On a pole which forms the corner of a little\npoultry-coop he keeps the record of the swarms of each season, and for last\nsummer there are sixty-one notches.A year ago this month four swarms went\ninto a barrel that stood in a corner of his yard, and he left them there.By fall they had filled the barrel with honey, and then, in his vernacular,\nhe \'tuck it up\'; that is, he killed the bees, and removed all the honey.""That is the regular bee-phrase in this region.If a hive is to be emptied\nand the bees destroyed, or a bee tree to be cut down, the act is described\nas \'taking up\' the hive or tree," Burt explained."By the way, Amy," he\nadded, "we must give you a little bee-hunting experience in the mountains\nnext October.We can leave you with a\nguard at some high point, when we strike a bee-line, and we might not be\nlong in finding the tree.""We\'ll put the expedition right down on the fall programme," she said,\nsmilingly.Clifford, she continued: "You spoke in\npraise of Italian bees."Really only two distinct kinds--our native brownish-black bees, and the\nItalians imported by Mr.S. B. Parsons and others about fifteen years ago.There is a cross or hybrid between these two kinds that are said to be so\nill-natured that it is unsafe to go anywhere near their hives.""Burt," said Webb, "you must remember reading in Virgil of the \'golden\nbees.\'""Yes, indistinctly; but none of them ever got in my bonnet or made much\nimpression.I don\'t like bees, nor do they like me.They respect only the\ndeliberation of profound gravity and wisdom.Father has these qualities by\nthe right of years, and Webb by nature, and their very presence soothes the\nirascible insects; but when I go among them they fairly bristle with\nstings.Give me a horse, and the more spirited the better.""Oh, no, Burt; can\'t give you any," said Leonard, with his humorous\ntwinkle."I\'ll sell you one, though, cheap.""Yes, that vicious, uncouth brute that you bought because so cheap.I told\nyou that you were\'sold\' at the same time with the horse.""I admit it," was the rueful reply."If he ever balks again as he did\nto-day, I shall be tempted to shoot him."He in few\nThus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still\nOn th\' other side the centre, where I grasp\'d\nTh\' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.Thou wast on th\' other side, so long as I\nDescended; when I turn\'d, thou didst o\'erpass\nThat point, to which from ev\'ry part is dragg\'d\nAll heavy substance.Thou art now arriv\'d\nUnder the hemisphere opposed to that,\nWhich the great continent doth overspread,\nAnd underneath whose canopy expir\'d\nThe Man, that was born sinless, and so liv\'d.Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,\nWhose other aspect is Judecca.Morn\nHere rises, when there evening sets: and he,\nWhose shaggy pile was scal\'d, yet standeth fix\'d,\nAs at the first.On this part he fell down\nFrom heav\'n; and th\' earth, here prominent before,\nThrough fear of him did veil her with the sea,\nAnd to our hemisphere retir\'d.Perchance\nTo shun him was the vacant space left here\nBy what of firm land on this side appears,\nThat sprang aloof."There is a place beneath,\nFrom Belzebub as distant, as extends\nThe vaulted tomb, discover\'d not by sight,\nBut by the sound of brooklet, that descends\nThis way along the hollow of a rock,\nWhich, as it winds with no precipitous course,\nThe wave hath eaten.By that hidden way\nMy guide and I did enter, to return\nTo the fair world: and heedless of repose\nWe climbed, he first, I following his steps,\nTill on our view the beautiful lights of heav\'n\nDawn\'d through a circular opening in the cave:\nThus issuing we again beheld the stars.Daniel moved to the office.[Illustration: (omnibus)]\n\nHe is telling the others of a spot he knows in Normandy, where one can\npaint--full of quaint farm-houses, with thatched roofs; picturesque\nroadsides, rich in foliage; bright waving fields, and cool green\nwoods, and purling streams; quaint gardens, choked with lavender and\nroses and hollyhocks--and all this fair land running to the white sand\nof the beach, with the blue sea beyond.He will write to old Pere\nJaqueline that they are all coming--it is just the place in which to\npose a model "en plein air,"--and Suzanne, his model, being a Normande\nherself, grows enthusiastic at the thought of going down again to the\nsea.Long before she became a Parisienne, and when her beautiful hair\nwas a tangled shock of curls, she used to go out in the big boats,\nwith the fisherwomen--barefooted, brown, and happy.She tells them of\nthose good days, and then they all go into the Taverne to dine, filled\nwith the idea of the new trip, and dreaming of dinners under the\ntrees, of "Tripes a la mode de Caen," Normandy cider, and a lot of new\nsketches besides.[Illustration: (shop front)]\n\nAlready the tables within are well filled.The long room, with its newer\nannex, is as brilliant as a jewel box--the walls rich in tiled panels\nsuggesting the life of the Quarter, the woodwork in gold and light oak,\nthe big panels of the rich gold ceiling exquisitely painted.At one of the tables two very chic young women are dining with a young\nFrenchman, his hair and dress in close imitation of the Duc d\'Orleans.A strikingly pretty woman, in a scarlet-spangled gown as red as her\nlips, is dining with a well-built, soldierly-looking man in black; they\nsit side by side as is the custom here.The woman reminds one of a red lizard--a salamander--her "svelte" body\nseemingly boneless in its gown of clinging scales.Her hair is\npurple-black and freshly onduled; her skin as white as ivory.She has\nthe habit of throwing back her small, well-posed head, while under their\ndelicately penciled lids her gray eyes take in the room at a glance.She is not of the Quarter, but the Taverne du Pantheon is a refuge for\nher at times, when she grows tired of Paillard\'s and Maxim\'s and her\nquarreling retinue."Let them howl on the other bank of the Seine," says this empress of\nthe half-world to herself, "I dine with Raoul where I please."And now one glittering, red arm with its small, heavily-jeweled hand\nglides toward Raoul\'s open cigarette case, and in withdrawing a\ncigarette she presses for a moment his big, strong hand as he holds near\nher polished nails the flaming match.[Illustration: ALONG THE SEINE]\n\nHer companion watches her as she smokes and talks--now and then he leans\ncloser to her, squaring his broad shoulders and bending lower his\nstrong, determined face, as he listens to her,--half-amused, replying to\nher questions leisurely, in short, crisp sentences.Suddenly she stamps\none little foot savagely under the table, and, clenching her jeweled\nhands, breathes heavily.She is trembling with rage; the man at her side\nhunches his great shoulders, flicks the ashes from his cigarette, looks\nat her keenly for a moment, and then smiles.In a moment she is herself\nagain, almost penitent; this little savage, half Roumanian, half\nRussian, has never known what it was to be ruled!She has seen men grow\nwhite when she has stamped her little foot, but this big Raoul, whom she\nloves--who once held a garrison with a handful of men--he does not\ntremble!she loves him for his devil-me-care indifference--and he enjoys\nher temper.But the salamander remembers there are some whom she dominated, until\nthey groveled like slaves at her feet; even the great Russian nobleman\nturned pale when she dictated to him archly and with the voice of an\nangel the price of his freedom.he shot himself the next day," mused the salamander.Yes, and even the adamant old banker in Paris, crabbed, stern,\nunrelenting to his debtors--shivered in his boots and ended in signing\naway half his fortune to her, and moved his family into a permanent\nchateau in the country, where he keeps himself busy with his shooting\nand his books.*     *     *     *     *\n\nAs it grows late, the taverne becomes more and more animated.Every one is talking and having a good time.The room is bewildering in\ngay color, the hum of conversation is everywhere, and as there is a\ncorresponding row of tables across the low, narrow room, friendly\ngreetings and often conversations are kept up from one side to the\nother.The dinner, as it progresses, assumes the air of a big family\nparty of good bohemians.The French do not bring their misery with them\nto the table.To dine is to enjoy oneself to the utmost; in fact the\nFrench people cover their disappointment, sadness, annoyances, great or\npetty troubles, under a masque of "blague," and have such an innate\ndislike of sympathy or ridicule that they avoid it by turning\neverything into "blague."This veneer is misleading, for at heart the French are sad.Not to speak\nof their inmost feelings does not, on the other hand, prevent them at\ntimes from being most confidential.Often, the merest exchange of\ncourtesies between those sharing the same compartment in a train, or a\nseat on a "bus," seems to be a sufficient introduction for your neighbor\nto tell you where he comes from, where he is going, whether he is\nmarried or single, whom his daughter married, and what regiment his son\nis in.These little confidences often end in his offering you half his\nbottle of wine and extending to you his cigarettes.[Illustration: LES BEAUX MAQUEREAUX]\n\nIf you have finished dinner, you go out on the terrace for your coffee.The fakirs are passing up and down in front, selling their wares--little\nrabbits, wonderfully lifelike, that can jump along your table and sit on\ntheir hind legs, and wag their ears; toy snakes; small leaden pigs for\ngood luck; and novelties of every description.Here one sees women with\nbaskets of ecrivisse boiled scarlet; an acrobat tumbles on the\npavement, and two men and a girl, as a marine, a soldier, and a\nvivandiere, in silvered faces and suits, pose in melodramatic attitudes.The vivandiere is rescued alternately from a speedy death by the marine\nand the soldier.Presently a little old woman approaches, shriveled and smiling, in her\nfaded furbelows now in rags.She sings in a piping voice and executes\nbetween the verses a tottering pas seul, her eyes ever smiling, as if\nshe still saw over the glare of the footlights, in the haze beyond, the\nvast audience of by-gone days; smiling as if she still heard the big\norchestra and saw the leader with his vibrant baton, watching her every\nmovement.She is over seventy now, and was once a premier danseuse at\nthe opera.But you have not seen all of the Taverne du Pantheon yet.There is an\n"American Bar" downstairs; at least, so the sign reads at the top of a\nnarrow stairway leading to a small, tavern-like room, with a sawdust\nfloor, heavy deal tables, and wooden stools.In front of the bar are\nhigh stools that one climbs up on and has a lukewarm whisky soda, next\nto Yvonne and Marcelle, who are both singing the latest catch of the day\nat the top of their lungs, until they are howled at to keep still or are\nlifted bodily off their high stools by the big fellow in the "type" hat,\nwho has just come in.[Illustration: MOTHER AND DAUGHTER]\n\nBefore a long table at one end of the room is the crowd of American\nstudents singing in a chorus.The table is full now, for many have come\nfrom dinners at other cafes to join them.At one end, and acting as\ninterlocutor for this impromptu minstrel show, presides one of the\nbest fellows in the world.He rises solemnly, his genial round face\nwreathed in a subtle smile, and announces that he will sing, by earnest\nrequest, that popular ballad, "\'Twas Summer and the Little Birds were\nSinging in the Trees."There are some especially fine "barber chords" in this popular ditty,\nand the words are so touching that it is repeated over and over again.Then it is sung softly like the farmhand quartettes do in the rural\nmelodrama outside the old homestead in harvest time.I tell you it\'s\na truly rural octette.Listen to that exhibition bass voice of Jimmy\nSands and that wandering tenor of Tommy Whiteing, and as the last chord\ndies away (over the fields presumably) a shout goes up:\n\n"How\'s that?""Out of sight," comes the general verdict from the crowd, and bang go a\ndozen beer glasses in unison on the heavy table."Oh, que c\'est beau!"cries Mimi, leading the successful chorus in a new\nvocal number with Edmond\'s walking-stick; but this time it is a French\nsong and the whole room is singing it, including our old friend,\nMonsieur Frank, the barkeeper, who is mixing one of his famous\nconcoctions which are never twice quite alike, but are better than if\nthey were.The harmonic beauties of "\'Twas Summer and the Little Birds were Singing\nin the Trees" are still inexhausted, but it sadly needs a piano\naccompaniment--with this it would be perfect; and so the whole crowd,\nincluding Yvonne, and Celeste, and Marcelle, and the two Frenchmen, and\nthe girl in the bicycle clothes, start for Jack Thompson\'s studio in the\nrue des Fourneaux, where there is a piano that, even if the candles in\nthe little Louis XVI brackets do burn low and spill down the keys, and\nthe punch rusts the strings, it will still retain that beautiful, rich\ntone that every French upright, at seven francs a month, possesses.[Illustration: (Bullier)]\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE "BAL BULLIER"\n\n\nThere are all types of "bals" in Paris.Over in Montmartre, on the Place\nBlanche, is the well-known "Moulin Rouge," a place suggestive, to those\nwho have never seen it, of the quintessence of Parisian devil-me-care\ngaiety.You expect it to be like those clever pen-and-ink drawings of\nGrevin\'s, of the old Jardin Mabille in its palmiest days, brilliant with\nlights and beautiful women extravagantly gowned and bejeweled.You\nexpect to see Frenchmen, too, in pot-hats, crowding in a circle about\nFifine, who is dancing some mad can-can, half hidden in a swirl of point\nlace, her small, polished boots alternately poised above her dainty\nhead.And when she has finished, you expect her to be carried off to\nsupper at the Maison Doree by the big, fierce-looking Russian who has\nbeen watching her, and whose victoria, with its spanking team--black and\nglossy as satin--champing their silver bits outside, awaiting her\npleasure.But in all these anticipations you will be disappointed, for the famous\nJardin Mabille is no more, and the ground where it once stood in the\nChamps Elysees is now built up with private residences.Fifine is gone,\ntoo--years ago--and most of the old gentlemen in pot-hats who used to\nwatch her are buried or about to be.Few Frenchmen ever go to the\n"Moulin Rouge," but every American does on his first night in Paris, and\nemerges with enough cab fare to return him to his hotel, where he\narrives with the positive conviction that the red mill, with its slowly\nrevolving sails, lurid in crimson lights, was constructed especially for\nhim.He remembers, too, his first impressions of Paris that very morning\nas his train rolled into the Gare St.His aunt could wait until\nto-morrow to see the tomb of Napoleon, but he would see the "Moulin\nRouge" first, and to be in ample time ordered dinner early in his\nexpensive, morgue-like hotel.I remember once, a few hours after my arrival in Paris, walking up the\nlong hill to the Place Blanche at 2 P.M., under a blazing July sun, to\nsee if they did not give a matinee at the "Moulin Rouge."The place was\nclosed, it is needless to say, and the policeman I found pacing his beat\noutside, when I asked him what day they gave a matinee, put his thumbs\nin his sword belt, looked at me quizzically for a moment, and then\nroared.The "Moulin Rouge" is in full blast every night; in the day-time\nit is being aired.Farther up in Montmartre, up a steep, cobbly hill, past quaint little\nshops and cafes, the hill becoming so steep that your cab horse\nfinally refuses to climb further, and you get out and walk up to the\n"Moulin de la Galette."You find it a far different type of ball from\nthe "Moulin Rouge," for it is not made for the stranger, and its\nclientele is composed of the rougher element of that quarter.[Illustration: (street scene)]\n\nA few years ago the "Galette" was not the safest of places for a\nstranger to go to alone.Since then, however, this ancient granary and\nmill, that has served as a ball-room for so many years, has undergone a\nradical change in management; but it is still a cliquey place, full of a\nlot of habitues who regard a stranger as an intruder.Should you by\naccident step on Marcelle\'s dress or jostle her villainous-looking\nescort, you will be apt to get into a row, beginning with a mode of\nattack you are possibly ignorant of, for these "maquereaux" fight with\ntheir feet, having developed this "manly art" of self-defense to a point\nof dexterity more to be evaded than admired.And while Marcelle\'s\nescort, with a swinging kick, smashes your nose with his heel, his pals\nwill take the opportunity to kick you in the back.So, if you go to the "Galette," go with a Parisian or some of the\nstudents of the Quarter; but if you must go alone--keep your eyes on the\nband.It is a good band, too, and its chef d\'orchestre, besides being a\nclever musical director, is a popular composer as well.Go out from the ball-room into the tiny garden and up the ladder-like\nstairs to the rock above, crowned with the old windmill, and look over\nthe iron railing.Far below you, swimming in a faint mist under the\nsummer stars, all Paris lies glittering at your feet.*     *     *     *     *\n\nYou will find the "Bal Bullier" of the Latin Quarter far different from\nthe "bals" of Montmartre.It forms, with its "grand fete" on Thursday\nnights, a sort of social event of the week in this Quarter of Bohemians,\njust as the Friday afternoon promenade does in the Luxembourg garden.If you dine at the Taverne du Pantheon on a Thursday night you will find\nthat the taverne is half deserted by 10 o\'clock, and that every one is\nleaving and walking up the "Boul\' Miche" toward the "Bullier."Follow\nthem, and as you reach the place l\'Observatoire, and turn a sharp corner\nto the left, you will see the facade of this famous ball, illumined by a\nsizzling blue electric light over the entrance.The facade, with its colored bas-reliefs of students and grisettes,\nreminds one of the proscenium of a toy theater.Back of this shallow\nwall bristle the tops of the trees in the garden adjoining the big\nball-room, both of which are below the level of the street and are\nreached by a broad wooden stairway.The "Bal Bullier" was founded in 1847; previous to this there existed\nthe "Closerie des Lilas" on the Boulevard Montparnasse.You pass along\nwith the line of waiting poets and artists, buy a green ticket for two\nfrancs at the little cubby-hole of a box-office, are divested of your\nstick by one of half a dozen white-capped matrons at the vestiaire, hand\nyour ticket to an elderly gentleman in a silk hat and funereal clothes,\nat the top of the stairway sentineled by a guard of two soldiers, and\nthe next instant you see the ball in full swing below you.[Illustration: (portrait of man)]\n\nThere is nothing disappointing about the "Bal Bullier."It is all you\nexpected it to be, and more, too.Below you is a veritable whirlpool of\ngirls and students--a vast sea of heads, and a dazzling display of\ncolors and lights and animation.Little shrieks and screams fill your\nears, as the orchestra crashes into the last page of a galop, quickening\nthe pace until Yvonne\'s little feet slip and her cheeks glow, and her\neyes grow bright, and half her pretty golden hair gets smashed over her\nimpudent little nose.Then the galop is brought up with a quick finish.comes from every quarter of the big room, and\nthe conductor, with his traditional good-nature, begins again.He knows\nit is wiser to humor them, and off they go again, still faster, until\nall are out of breath and rush into the garden for a breath of cool air\nand a "citron glace."And what a pretty garden it is!--full of beautiful trees and dotted with\nround iron tables, and laid out in white gravel walks, the garden\nsloping gently back to a fountain, and a grotto and an artificial\ncascade all in one, with a figure of Venus in the center, over which the\nwater splashes and trickles.There is a green lattice proscenium, too,\nsurrounding the fountain, illuminated with colored lights and outlined\nin tiny flames of gas, and grotto-like alcoves circling the garden, each\nwith a table and room for two.The ball-room from the garden presents a\nbrilliant contrast, as one looks down upon it from under the trees.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\nBut the orchestra has given its signal--a short bugle call announcing a\nquadrille; and those in the garden are running down into the ball-room\nto hunt up their partners.The "Bullier" orchestra will interest you; they play with a snap and\nfire and a tempo that is irresistible.They have played together so long\nthat they have become known as the best of all the bal orchestras.The leader, too, is interesting--tall and gaunt, with wild, deep-sunken\neyes resembling those of an old eagle.Now and then he turns his head\nslowly as he leads, and rests these keen, penetrating orbs on the sea of\ndancers below him.Then, with baton raised above his head, he brings his\norchestra into the wild finale of the quadrille--piccolos and clarinets,\ncymbals, bass viols, and violins--all in one mad race to the end, but so\nwell trained that not a note is lost in the scramble--and they finish\nunder the wire to a man, amid cheers from Mimi and Celeste and "encores"\nand "bis\'s" from every one else who has breath enough left to shout\nwith.[Illustration: A TYPE OF THE QUARTER\nBy Helleu.--Estampe Moderne]\n\nOften after an annual dinner of one of the ateliers, the entire body of\nstudents will march into the "Bullier," three hundred strong, and take a\ngood-natured possession of the place.There have been some serious\ndemonstrations in the Quarter by the students, who can form a small army\nwhen combined.But as a rule you will find them a good-natured lot of\nfellows, who are out for all the humor and fun they can create at the\nleast expense.But in June, 1893, a serious demonstration by the students occurred, for\nthese students can fight as well as dance.Senator Beranger, having\nread one morning in the "Courrier Francais" an account of the revelry\nand nudity of several of the best-known models of the Quarter at the\n"Quat\'z\' Arts" ball, brought a charge against the organizers of the\nball, and several of the models, whose beauty unadorned had made them\nconspicuous on this most festive occasion.At the ensuing trial, several\ncelebrated beauties and idols of the Latin Quarter were convicted and\nsentenced to a short term of imprisonment, and fined a hundred francs\neach.These sentences were, however, remitted, but the majority of the\nstudents would not have it thus, and wanted further satisfaction.A mass\nmeeting was held by them in the Place de la Sorbonne.The police were in\nforce there to stop any disturbance, and up to 10 o\'clock at night the\ncrowd was held in control.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\nIt was a warm June night, and every student in the Quarter was keyed to\na high state of excitement.Finally a great crowd of students formed in\nfront of the Cafe d\'Harcourt, opposite the Sorbonne; things were at\nfever heat; the police became rough; and in the row that ensued,\nsomebody hurled one of the heavy stone match-safes from a cafe table at\none of the policemen, who in his excitement picked it up and hurled it\nback into the crowd.It struck and injured fatally an innocent outsider,\nwho was taken to the Charity Hospital, in the rue Jacob, and died there.On the following Monday another mass meeting of students was held in the\nPlace de la Sorbonne, who, after the meeting, formed in a body and\nmarched to the Chamber of Deputies, crying: "Conspuez Dupuy," who was\nthen president of the Chamber.A number of deputies came out on the\nportico and the terrace, and smilingly reviewed the demonstration, while\nthe students hurled their anathemas at them, the leaders and men in the\nfront rank of this howling mob trying to climb over the high railing in\nfront of the terrace, and shouting that the police were responsible for\nthe death of one of their comrades.The Government, fearing further trouble and wishing to avoid any\ndisturbance on the day of the funeral of the victim of the riot in the\nPlace Sorbonne, deceived the public as to the hour when it would occur.This exasperated the students so that they began one of those\ndemonstrations for which Paris is famous.the next day the\nQuartier Latin was in a state of siege--these poets and painters and\nsculptors and musicians tore up the rue Jacob and constructed barricades\nnear the hospital where their comrade had died.They tore up the rue\nBonaparte, too, at the Place St.Germain des Pres, and built barricades,\ncomposed of overturned omnibuses and tramcars and newspaper booths.They\nsmashed windows and everything else in sight, to get even with the\nGovernment and the smiling deputies and the murderous police--and then\nthe troops came, and the affair took a different turn.In three days\nthirty thousand troops were in Paris--principally cavalry, many of the\nregiments coming from as far away as the center of France.[Illustration: ECOLE DES BEAUX ARTS]\n\nWith these and the police and the Garde Republicaine against them, the\nstudents melted away like a handful of snow in the sun; but the\ndemonstrations continued spasmodically for two or three days longer, and\nthe little crooked streets, like the rue du Four, were kept clear by the\ncavalry trotting abreast--in and out and dodging around corners--their\nblack horse-tail plumes waving and helmets shining.It is sufficient to\nsay that the vast army of artists and poets were routed to a man and\ndriven back into the more peaceful atmosphere of their studios.But the "Bullier" is closing and the crowd is pouring out into the cool\nair.I catch a glimpse of Yvonne with six students all in one fiacre,\nbut Yvonne has been given the most comfortable place.They have put her\nin the hood, and the next instant they are rattling away to the Pantheon\nfor supper.If you walk down with the rest, you will pass dozens of jolly groups\nsinging and romping and dancing along down the "Boul\' Miche" to the\ntaverne, for a bock and some ecrivisse.With youth, good humor, and a\n"louis," all the world seems gay!CHAPTER IV\n\nBAL DES QUAT\'Z\' ARTS\n\n\nOf all the balls in Paris, the annual "Bal des Quat\'z\' Arts" stands\nunique.This costume ball is given every year, in the spring, by the\nstudents of the different ateliers, each atelier vying with the others\nin creation of the various floats and corteges, and in the artistic\neffect and historical correctness of the costumes.The first "Quat\'z\' Arts" ball was given in 1892.It was a primitive\naffair, compared with the later ones, but it was a success, and\nimmediately the "Quat\'z\' Arts" Ball was put into the hands of clever\norganizers, and became a studied event in all its artistic sense.Months\nare spent in the creation of spectacles and in the costuming of students\nand models.Prizes are given for the most successful organizations, and\na jury composed of painters and sculptors passes upon your costume as\nyou enter the ball, and if you do not come up to their artistic\nstandard you are unceremoniously turned away.Daniel went to the bathroom.Students who have been\nsuccessful in getting into the "Quat\'z\' Arts" for years often fail to\npass into this bewildering display of beauty and brains, owing to their\ncostume not possessing enough artistic originality or merit to pass the\njury.[Illustration: (coiffeur sign)]\n\nIt is, of course, a difficult matter for one who is not an enrolled\nmember of one of the great ateliers of painting, architecture, or\nsculpture to get into the "Quat\'z\' Arts," and even after one\'s ticket is\nassured, you may fail to pass the jury.Imagine this ball, with its procession of moving tableaux.A huge float\ncomes along, depicting the stone age and the primitive man, every detail\ncarefully studied from the museums.Another represents the last day of\nBabylon.One sees a nude captive, her golden hair and white flesh in\ncontrast with the black velvet litter on which she is bound, being\ncarried by a dozen stalwart blackamoors, followed by camels bearing nude\nslaves and the spoils of a captured city.[Illustration: (photograph of woman)]\n\nAs the ball continues until daylight, it resembles a bacchanalian fete\nin the days of the Romans.But all through it, one is impressed by its\nartistic completeness, its studied splendor, and permissible license, so\nlong as a costume (or the lack of it) produces an artistic result.One\nsees the mise en scene of a barbaric court produced by the architects of\nan atelier, all the various details constructed from carefully studied\nsketches, with maybe a triumphal throne of some barbaric king, with his\nslaves, the whole costumed and done in a studied magnificence that\ntakes one\'s breath away.Again an atelier of painters may reproduce the\nfrieze of the Parthenon in color; another a float or a decoration,\nsuggesting the works of their master.The room becomes a thing of splendor, for it is as gorgeous a spectacle\nas the cleverest of the painters, sculptors, and architects can make it,\nand is the result of careful study--and all for the love of it!--for the\ngreat "Quat\'z\' Arts" ball is an event looked forward to for months.Special instructions are issued to the different ateliers while the ball\nis in preparation, and the following one is a translation in part from\nthe notice issued before the great ball of \'99.As this is a special and\nprivate notice to the atelier, its contents may be interesting:\n\n\n                                      BAL DES QUAT\'Z\' ARTS,\n                                    Moulin Rouge, 21 April, 1899.The card of admission is absolutely personal, to be taken by the\n     committee before the opening of the ball.[Illustration: (admission card)]\n\n     The committee will be masked, and comrades without their personal\n     card will be refused at the door.The cards must carry the name and\n     quality of the artist, and bear the stamp of his atelier.The soldier--the dress suit,\n     black or in color--the monk--the blouse--the domino--kitchen\n     boy--loafer--bicyclist, and other nauseous types, are absolutely\n     prohibited.Should the weather be bad, comrades are asked to wait in their\n     carriages, as the committee in control cannot, under any pretext,\n     neglect guarding the artistic effect of the ball during any\n     confusion that might ensue.A great "feed" will take place in the grand hall; the buffet will\n     serve as usual individual suppers and baskets for two persons.The committee wish especially to bring the attention of their\n     comrades to the question of women, whose cards of admission\n     must be delivered as soon as possible, so as to enlarge their\n     attendance--always insufficient.Prizes (champagne) will be distributed to the ateliers who may\n     distinguish themselves by the artistic merit and beauty of their\n     female display.[Illustration: (photograph of woman)]\n\n     All the women who compete for these prizes will be assembled on\n     the grand staircase before the orchestra.The nude, as always, is\n     PROHIBITED!?!The question of music at the head of the procession is of the\n     greatest importance, and those comrades who are musical will please\n     give their names to the delegates of the ateliers.Your good-will\n     in this line is asked for--any great worthless capacity in this\n     line will do, as they always play the same tune, "Les Pompiers!"For days before the "Quat\'z\' Arts" ball, all is excitement among the\nstudents, who do as little work as possible and rest themselves for the\ngreat event.The favorite wit of the different ateliers is given the\ntask of painting the banner of the atelier, which is carried at the head\nof the several corteges.One of these, in Bouguereau\'s atelier, depicted\ntheir master caricatured as a cupid.The boys once constructed an elephant with oriental trappings--an\nelephant that could wag his ears and lift his trunk and snort--and after\nthe two fellows who formed respectfully the front and hind legs of this\nknowing beast had practised sufficiently to proceed with him safely, at\nthe head of a cortege of slave girls, nautch dancers, and manacled\ncaptives, the big beast created a success in the procession at the\n"Quat\'z\' Arts" ball.[Illustration: (portrait of man)]\n\nAfter the ball, in the gray morning light, they marched it back to the\natelier, where it remained for some weeks, finally becoming such a\nnuisance, kicking around the atelier and getting in everybody\'s way,\nthat the boys agreed to give it to the first junk-man that came around.But as no junk-man came, and as no one could be found to care for its\nnow sadly battered hulk, its good riddance became a problem.At last the two, who had sweltered in its dusty frame that eventful\nnight of the "Quat\'z\' Arts," hit upon an idea.They marched it one day\nup the Boulevard St.Germain to the Cafe des deux Magots, followed by a\ncrowd of people, who, when it reached the cafe, assembled around it,\nevery one asking what it was for--or rather what it was?--for the beast\nhad by now lost much of the resemblance of its former self.When half\nthe street became blocked with the crowd, the two wise gentlemen crawled\nout of its fore and aft, and quickly mingled, unnoticed, with the\nbystanders.Then they disappeared in the crowd, leaving the elephant\nstanding in the middle of the street.Those who had been expecting\nsomething to happen--a circus or the rest of the parade to come\nalong--stood around for a while, and then the police, realizing that\nthey had an elephant on their hands, carted the thing away, swearing\nmeanwhile at the atelier and every one connected with it.The cafes near the Odeon, just before the beginning of the ball, are\nfilled with students in costume; gladiators hobnob at the tables with\nsavages in scanty attire--Roman soldiers and students, in the garb of\nthe ancients, strut about or chat in groups, while the uninvited\ngrisettes and models, who have not received invitations from the\ncommittee, implore them for tickets.Tickets are not transferable, and should one present himself at the\nentrance of the ball with another fellow\'s ticket, he would run small\nchance of entering.The student answers, while the jury glance at his makeup.cries the jury, and you pass in to the ball.But if you are unknown they will say simply, "Connais-pas!and you pass down a long covered alley--confident, if you are a\n"nouveau," that it leads into the ball-room--until you suddenly find\nyourself in the street, where your ticket is torn up and all hope of\nentering is gone.It is hopeless to attempt to describe the hours until morning of this\nannual artistic orgy.As the morning light comes in through the\nwindows, it is strange to see the effect of diffused daylight,\nelectricity, and gas--the bluish light of early morning reflected on the\nflesh tones--upon nearly three thousand girls and students in costumes\none might expect to see in a bacchanalian feast, just before the fall of\nRome.Now they form a huge circle, the front row sitting on the floor,\nthe second row squatting, the third seated in chairs, the fourth\nstanding, so that all can see the dancing that begins in the morning\nhours--the wild impromptu dancing of the moment.A famous beauty, her\nblack hair bound in a golden fillet with a circle wrought in silver and\nstudded with Oriental turquoises clasping her superb torso, throws her\nsandals to the crowd and begins an Oriental dance--a thing of grace and\nbeauty--fired with the intensity of the innate nature of this\nbeautifully modeled daughter of Bohemia.As the dance ends, there is a cry of delight from the great circle of\nbarbarians."Long live the Quat\'z\' Arts!"they cry, amid cheers for the\ndancer.The ball closes about seven in the morning, when the long procession\nforms to return to the Latin Quarter, some marching, other students and\ngirls in cabs and on top of them, many of the girls riding the horses.Down they come from the "Moulin Rouge," shouting, singing, and yelling.Heads are thrust out of windows, and a volley of badinage passes between\nthe fantastic procession and those who have heard them coming.Finally the great open court of the Louvre is reached--here a halt is\nmade and a general romp occurs.A girl and a type climb one of the\ntall lamp-posts and prepare to do a mid-air balancing act, when\nrescued by the others.At last, at the end of all this horse-play, the\nmarch is resumed over the Pont du Carrousel and so on, cheered now by\nthose going to work, until the Odeon is reached.Here the odd\nprocession disbands; some go to their favorite cafes where the\nfestivities are continued--some to sleep in their costumes or what\nremains of them, wherever fortune lands them--others to studios, where\nthe gaiety is often kept up for days.but life is not all "couleur de rose" in this true Bohemia."One day," says little Marguerite (she who lives in the rue Monge), "one\neats and the next day one doesn\'t.It is always like that, is it not,\nmonsieur?--and it costs so much to live, and so you see, monsieur, life\nis always a fight."And Marguerite\'s brown eyes swim a little and her pretty mouth closes\nfirmly."I do not know, monsieur," she replies quietly; "I have not seen him in\nten days--the atelier is closed--I have been there every day, expecting\nto find him--he left no word with his concierge.I have been to his cafe\ntoo, but no one has seen him--you see, monsieur, Paul does not love me!"Mary journeyed to the bedroom.I recall an incident that I chanced to see in passing the little shop\nwhere Marguerite works, that only confirms the truth of her realization.Paul had taken Marguerite back to the little shop, after their dejeuner\ntogether, and, as I passed, he stopped at the door with her, kissed her\non both cheeks, and left her; but before they had gone a dozen paces,\nthey ran back to embrace again.This occurred four times, until Paul and\nMarguerite finally parted.And, as he watched her little heels disappear\nup the wooden stairs to her work-room above, Paul blew a kiss to the\npretty milliner at the window next door, and, taking a long whiff of his\ncigarette, sauntered off in the direction of his atelier whistling.[Illustration: A MORNING\'S WORK]\n\nIt is ideal, this student life with its student loves of four years, but\nis it right to many an honest little comrade, who seldom knows an hour\nwhen she is away from her ami?who has suffered and starved and slaved\nwith him through years of days of good and bad luck--who has encouraged\nhim in his work, nursed him when ill, and made a thousand golden hours\nin this poet\'s or painter\'s life so completely happy, that he looks back\non them in later life as never-to-be-forgotten?He remembers the good\ndinners at the little restaurant near his studio, where they dined among\nthe old crowd.There were Lavaud the sculptor and Francine, with the\nfigure of a goddess; Moreau, who played the cello at the opera; little\nLouise Dumont, who posed at Julian\'s, and old Jacquemart, the very soul\nof good fellowship, who would set them roaring with his inimitable\nhumor.What good dinners they were!--and how long they sat over their coffee\nand cigarettes under the trees in front of this little restaurant--often\nten and twelve at a time, until more tables had to be pushed together\nfor others of their good friends, who in passing would be hailed to join\nthem.And how Marguerite used to sing all through dinner and how they\nwould all sing, until it grew so late and so dark that they had to puff\ntheir cigarettes aglow over their plates, and yell to Madame Giraud for\na light!And how the old lady would bustle out with the little oil lamp,\nplacing it in the center of the long table amid the forest of vin\nordinaires, with a "Voila, mes enfants!"and a cheery word for all these\ngood boys and girls, whom she regarded quite as her own children.It seemed to them then that there would never be anything else but\ndinners at Madame Giraud\'s for as many years as they pleased, for no one\never thought of living out one\'s days, except in this good Bohemia of\nParis.They could not imagine that old Jacquemart would ever die, or\nthat La Belle Louise would grow old, and go back to Marseilles, to live\nwith her dried-up old aunt, who sold garlic and bad cheese in a little\nbox of a shop, up a crooked street!Or that Francine would marry Martin,\nthe painter, and that the two would bury themselves in an adorable\nlittle spot in Brittany, where they now live in a thatched farm-house,\nfull of Martin\'s pictures, and have a vegetable garden of their own--and\na cow--and some children![Illustration: A STUDIO DEJEUNER]\n\nAnd those memorable dinners in the old studio back of the Gare\nMontparnasse!when paints and easels were pushed aside, and the table\nspread, and the piano rolled up beside it.There was the buying of the\nchicken, and the salad that Francine would smother in a dressing into\nwhich she would put a dozen different things--herbs and spices and tiny\nwhite onions!And what a jolly crowd came to these impromptu feasts!How they danced and sang until the gray\nmorning light would creep in through the big skylight, when all these\ngood bohemians would tiptoe down the waxed stairs, and slip past the\ndifferent ateliers for fear of waking those painters who might be\nasleep--a thought that never occurred to them until broad daylight, and\nthe door had been opened, after hours of pandemonium and music and\nnoise!In a little hotel near the Odeon, there lived a family of just such\nbohemians--six struggling poets, each with an imagination and a love of\ngood wine and good dinners and good times that left them continually in\na state of bankruptcy!As they really never had any money--none that\never lasted for more than two days and two nights at the utmost, their\ngood landlord seldom saw a sou in return for his hospitable roof, which\nhad sheltered these six great minds who wrote of the moon, and of fate,\nand fortune, and love.For days they would dream and starve and write.Then followed an auction\nsale of the total collection of verses, hawked about anywhere and\neverywhere among the editeurs, like a crop of patiently grown fruit.Having sold it, literally by the yard, they would all saunter up the\n"Boul\' Miche," and forget their past misery, in feasting, to their\nhearts\' content, on the good things of life.On days like these, you\nwould see them passing, their black-brimmed hats adjusted jauntily over\ntheir poetic locks--their eyes beaming with that exquisite sense of\nfeeling suddenly rich, that those who live for art\'s sake know!The\nkeenest of pleasures lie in sudden contrasts, and to these six poetic,\nimpractical Bohemians, thus suddenly raised from the slough of despond\nto a state where they no longer trod with mortals--their cup of\nhappiness was full and spilling over.They must not only have a good\ntime, but so must every one around them.With their great riches, they\nwould make the world gay as long as it lasted, for when it was over they\nknew how sad life would be.For a while--then they would scratch\naway--and have another auction![Illustration: DAYLIGHT]\n\nUnlike another good fellow, a painter whom I once knew, who periodically\nfound himself without a sou, and who would take himself, in despair, to\nhis lodgings, make his will, leaving most of his immortal works to his\nEnglish aunt, go to bed, and calmly await death!In a fortunate space of\ntime his friends, who had been hunting for him all over the Quarter,\nwould find him at last and rescue him from his chosen tomb; or his good\naunt, fearing he was ill, would send a draft!Then life would, to this\nimpractical philosopher, again become worth living.He would dispatch a\n"petit bleu" to Marcelle; and the two would meet at the Cafe Cluny, and\ndine at La Perruse on filet de sole au vin blanc, and a bottle of Haut\nBarsac--the bottle all cobwebs and cradled in its basket--the garcon, as\nhe poured its golden contents, holding his breath meanwhile lest he\ndisturb its long slumber.There are wines that stir the soul, and this was one of them--clear as a\ntopaz and warming as the noonday sun--the same warmth that had given it\nbirth on its hillside in Bordeaux, as far back as \'82.It warmed the\nheart of Marcelle, too, and made her cheeks glow and her eyes\nsparkle--and added a rosier color to her lips.It made her talk--clearly\nand frankly, with a full and a happy heart, so that she confessed her\nlove for this "bon garcon" of a painter, and her supreme admiration for\nhis work and the financial success he had made with his art.All of\nwhich this genial son of Bohemia drank in with a feeling of pride, and\nhe would swell out his chest and curl the ends of his long mustache\nupwards, and sigh like a man burdened with money, and secure in his\nability and success, and with a peaceful outlook into the future--and\nthe fact that Marcelle loved him of all men!They would linger long over\ntheir coffee and cigarettes, and then the two would stroll out under the\nstars and along the quai, and watch the little Seine boats crossing and\nrecrossing, like fireflies, and the lights along the Pont Neuf reflected\ndeep down like parti-colored ribbons in the black water.[Illustration: (pair of high heeled shoes)]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n"A DEJEUNER AT LAVENUE\'S"\n\n\nIf you should chance to breakfast at "Lavenue\'s," or, as it is called,\nthe "Hotel de France et Bretagne," for years famous as a rendezvous of\nmen celebrated in art and letters, you will be impressed first with the\nsimplicity of the three little rooms forming the popular side of this\nrestaurant, and secondly with the distinguished appearance of its\nclientele.[Illustration: MADEMOISELLE FANNY AND HER STAFF]\n\nAs you enter the front room, you pass good Mademoiselle Fanny at the\ndesk, a cheery, white-capped, genial old lady, who has sat behind that\ndesk for forty years, and has seen many a "bon garcon" struggle up the\nladder of fame--from the days when he was a student at the Beaux-Arts,\nuntil his name became known the world over.It has long been a\nfavorite restaurant with men like Rodin, the sculptor--and Colin, the\npainter--and the late Falguiere--and Jean Paul Laurens and Bonnat,\nand dozens of others equally celebrated--and with our own men, like\nWhistler and Sargent and Harrison, and St.These three plain little rooms are totally different from the "other\nside," as it is called, of the Maison Lavenue.Here one finds quite a\ngorgeous cafe, with a pretty garden in the rear, and another\nroom--opening into the garden--done in delicate green lattice and\nmirrors.This side is far more expensive to dine in than the side with\nthe three plain little rooms, and the gentlemen with little red\nribbons in their buttonholes; but as the same good cook dispenses from\nthe single big kitchen, which serves for the dear and the cheap side\nthe same good things to eat at just half the price, the reason for the\npopularity of the "cheap side" among the crowd who come here daily is\nevident.[Illustration: RODIN]\n\nIt is a quiet, restful place, this Maison Lavenue, and the best place I\nknow in which to dine or breakfast from day to day.There is an air of\nintime and cosiness about Lavenue\'s that makes one always wish to\nreturn.[Illustration: (group of men dining)]\n\nYou will see a family of rich bourgeois enter, just in from the country,\nfor the Montparnasse station is opposite.The fat, sunburned mama, and\nthe equally rotund and genial farmer-papa, and the pretty daughter, and\nthe newly married son and his demure wife, and the two younger\nchildren--and all talking and laughing over a good dinner with\nchampagne, and many toasts to the young couple--and to mama and papa,\nand little Josephine--with ices, and fruit, and coffee, and liqueur to\nfollow.All these you will see at Lavenue\'s on the "cheap side"--and the\nbeautiful model, too, who poses for Courbel, who is breakfasting with\none of the jeunesse of Paris.dine in the front\nroom with the rest, and jump up now and then to wait on madame and\nmonsieur.It is a very democratic little place, this popular side of the house of\nM. Lavenue, founded in 1854.And there is a jolly old painter who dines there, who is also an\nexcellent musician, with an ear for rhythm so sensitive that he could\nnever go to sleep unless the clock in his studio ticked in regular time,\nand at last was obliged to give up his favorite atelier, with its\npicturesque garden----\n\n"For two reasons, monsieur," he explained to me excitedly; "a little\ngirl on the floor below me played a polka--the same polka half the\nday--always forgetting to put in the top note; and the fellow over me\nwhistled it the rest of the day and put in the top note false; and so I\nmoved to the rue St.Peres, where one only hears, within the cool\ncourt-yard, the distant hum of the busy city.The roar of Paris, so full\nof chords and melody!Listen to it sometimes, monsieur, and you will\nhear a symphony!"[Illustration: "LA FILLE DE LA BLANCHISSEUSE"\nBy Bellanger.--Estampe Moderne]\n\nAnd Mademoiselle Fanny will tell you of the famous men she has known for\nyears, and how she has found the most celebrated of them simple in their\ntastes, and free from ostentation--"in fact it is always so, is it not,\nwith les hommes celebres?C\'est toujours comme ca, monsieur, toujours!"and mentions one who has grown gray in the service of art and can count\nhis decorations from half a dozen governments.Madame will wax\nenthusiastic--her face wreathed in smiles.he is a bon garcon; he\nalways eats with the rest, for three or four francs, never more!He is\nso amiable, and, you know, he is very celebrated and very rich"; and\nmadame will not only tell you his entire history, but about his\nwork--the beauty of his wife and how "aimables" his children are.Mademoiselle Fanny knows them all.But the men who come here to lunch are not idlers; they come in, many of\nthem, fresh from a hard morning\'s work in the studio.The tall sculptor\nopposite you has been at work, since his morning coffee, on a group for\nthe government; another, bare-armed and in his flannel shirt, has been\nbuilding up masses of clay, punching and modeling, and scraping away,\nall the morning, until he produces, in the rough, the body of a\ngiantess, a huge caryatide that is destined, for the rest of her\nexistence, to hold upon her broad shoulders part of the facade of an\nAmerican building.The "giantess" in the flesh is lunching with him--a\nJuno-like woman of perhaps twenty-five, with a superb head well poised,\nher figure firm and erect.You will find her exceedingly interesting,\nquiet, and refined, and with a knowledge of things in general that will\nsurprise you, until you discover she has, in her life as a model, been\nthrown daily in conversation with men of genius, and has acquired a\nsmattering of the knowledge of many things--of art and literature--of\nthe theater and its playwrights--plunging now and then into medicine and\nlaw and poetry--all these things she has picked up in the studios, in\nthe cafes, in the course of her Bohemian life.This "vernis," as the\nFrench call it, one finds constantly among the women here, for their\ndays are passed among men of intelligence and ability, whose lives and\nenergy are surrounded and encouraged by an atmosphere of art.In an hour, the sculptor and his Juno-like model will stroll back to the\nstudio, where work will be resumed as long as the light lasts.[Illustration: A TRUE TYPE]\n\nThe painter breakfasting at the next table is hard at work on a\ndecorative panel for a ceiling.It is already laid out and squared up,\nfrom careful pencil drawings.Two young architects are working for him,\nlaying out the architectural balustrade, through which one, a month\nlater, looks up at the allegorical figures painted against the dome of\nthe blue heavens, as a background.And so the painter swallows his eggs,\nmayonnaise, and demi of beer, at a gulp, for he has a model coming at\ntwo, and he must finish this ceiling on time, and ship it, by a fast\nliner, to a millionaire, who has built a vault-like structure on the\nHudson, with iron dogs on the lawn.Here this beautiful panel will be\nunrolled and installed in the dome of the hard-wood billiard-room, where\nits rich, mellow scheme of color will count as naught; and the cupids\nand the flesh-tones of the chic little model, who came at two, will\nappear jaundiced; and Aunt Maria and Uncle John, and the twins from\nIthaca, will come in after the family Sunday dinner of roast beef and\npotatoes and rice pudding and ice-water, and look up into the dome and\nagree "it\'s grand."But the painter does not care, for he has locked up\nhis studio, and taken his twenty thousand francs and the model--who came\nat two--with him to Trouville.At night you will find a typical crowd of Bohemians at the Closerie des\nLilas, where they sit under a little clump of trees on the sloping dirt\nterrace in front.Here you will see the true type of the Quarter.It is\nthe farthest up the Boulevard St.Michel of any of the cafes, and just\nopposite the "Bal Bullier," on the Place de l\'Observatoire.The terrace\nis crowded with its habitues, for it is out of the way of the stream of\npeople along the "Boul\' Miche."The terrace is quite dark, its only\nlight coming from the cafe, back of a green hedge, and it is cool there,\ntoo, in summer, with the fresh night air coming from the Luxembourg\nGardens.Below it is the cafe and restaurant de la Rotonde, a very\nwell-built looking place, with its rounding facade on the corner.[Illustration: (studio)]\n\nAt the entrance of every studio court and apartment, there lives the\nconcierge in a box of a room generally, containing a huge feather-bed\nand furnished with a variety of things left by departing tenants to this\nfaithful guardian of the gate.Many of these small rooms resemble the\nden of an antiquary with their odds and ends from the studios--old\nswords, plaster casts, sketches and discarded furniture--until the place\nis quite full.Yet it is kept neat and clean by madame, who sews all day\nand talks to her cat and to every one who passes into the court-yard.Here your letters are kept, too, in one of a row of boxes, with the\nnumber of your atelier marked thereon.At night, after ten, your concierge opens the heavy iron gate of your\ncourt by pulling a cord within reach of the family bed.He or she is\nwaked up at intervals through the night to let into and out of a court\nfull of studios those to whom the night is ever young.Or perhaps your\nconcierge will be like old Pere Valois, who has three pretty daughters\nwho do the housework of the studios, as well as assist in the\nguardianship of the gate.They are very busy, these three daughters of\nPere Valois--all the morning you will see these little "femmes de\nmenage" as busy as bees; the artists and poets must be waked up, and\nbeds made and studios cleaned.There are many that are never cleaned at\nall, but then there are many, too, who are not so fortunate as to be\ntaken care of by the three daughters of Pere Valois.[Illustration: VOILA LA BELLE ROSE, MADAME!]There is no gossip within the quarter that your "femme de menage" does\nnot know, and over your morning coffee, which she brings you, she will\nregale you with the latest news about most of your best friends,\nincluding your favorite model, and madame from whom you buy your wine,\nalways concluding with: "That is what I heard, monsieur,--I think it is\nquite true, because the little Marie, who is the femme de menage of\nMonsieur Valentin, got it from Celeste Dauphine yesterday in the cafe in\nthe rue du Cherche Midi."In the morning, this demure maid-of-all-work will be in her calico dress\nwith her sleeves rolled up over her strong white arms, but in the\nevening you may see her in a chic little dress, at the "Bal Bullier," or\ndining at the Pantheon, with the fellow whose studio is opposite yours.[Illustration: A BUSY MORNING]\n\nAlice Lemaitre, however, was a far different type of femme de menage\nthan any of the gossiping daughters of old Pere Valois, and her lot was\nharder, for one night she left her home in one of the provincial towns,\nwhen barely sixteen, and found herself in Paris with three francs to her\nname and not a friend in this big pleasure-loving city to turn to.After\nmany days of privation, she became bonne to a woman known as Yvette de\nMarcie, a lady with a bad temper and many jewels, to whom little Alice,\nwith her rosy cheeks and bright eyes and willing disposition to work in\norder to live, became a person upon whom this fashionable virago of a\ndemi-mondaine vented the worst that was in her--and there was much of\nthis--until Alice went out into the world again.She next found\nemployment at a baker\'s, where she was obliged to get up at four in the\nmorning, winter and summer, and deliver the long loaves of bread at the\ndifferent houses; but the work was too hard and she left.The baker paid\nher a trifle a week for her labor, while the attractive Yvette de Marcie\nturned her into the street without her wages.It was while delivering\nbread one morning to an atelier in the rue des Dames, that she chanced\nto meet a young painter who was looking for a good femme de menage to\nrelieve his artistic mind from the worries of housekeeping.Little Alice\nfairly cried when the good painter told her she might come at twenty\nfrancs a month, which was more money than this very grateful and brave\nlittle Brittany girl had ever known before.[Illustration: (brocanteur shop front)]\n\n"You see, monsieur, one must do one\'s best whatever one undertakes,"\nsaid Alice to me; "I have tried every profession, and now I am a good\nfemme de menage, and I am \'bien contente.\'No," she continued, "I shall\nnever marry, for one\'s independence is worth more than anything else.When one marries," she said earnestly, her little brow in a frown,\n"one\'s life is lost; I am young and strong, and I have courage, and so I\ncan work hard.One should be content when one is not cold and hungry,\nand I have been many times that, monsieur.Once I worked in a fabrique,\nwhere, all day, we painted the combs of china roosters a bright red for\nbon-bon boxes--hundreds and hundreds of them until I used to see them in\nmy dreams; but the fabrique failed, for the patron ran away with the\nwife of a Russian.He was a very stupid man to have done that, monsieur,\nfor he had a very nice wife of his own--a pretty brunette, with a\ncharming figure; but you see, monsieur, in Paris it is always that way.C\'est toujours comme ca."CHAPTER VI\n\n"AT MARCEL LEGAY\'S"\n\n\nJust off the Boulevard St.Michel and up the narrow little rue Cujas,\nyou will see at night the name "Marcel Legay" illumined in tiny\ngas-jets.This is a cabaret of chansonniers known as "Le Grillon," where\na dozen celebrated singing satirists entertain an appreciative audience\nin the stuffy little hall serving as an auditorium.Here, nightly, as\nthe piece de resistance--and late on the programme (there is no printed\none)--you will hear the Bard of Montmartre, Marcel Legay, raconteur,\npoet, musician, and singer; the author of many of the most popular songs\nof Montmartre, and a veteran singer in the cabarets.[Illustration: MARCEL LEGAY]\n\nFrom these cabarets of the student quarters come many of the cleverest\nand most beautiful songs.Here men sing their own creations, and they\nhave absolute license to sing or say what they please; there is no\nmincing of words, and many times these rare bohemians do not take the\ntrouble to hide their clever songs and satires under a double entente.No celebrated man or woman, known in art or letters, or connected with\nthe Government--from the soldier to the good President of the Republique\nFrancaise--is spared.The eccentricity of each celebrity is caught by\nthem, and used in song or recitation.Besides these personal caricatures, the latest political questions of\nthe day--religion and the haut monde--come in for a large share of\ngood-natured satire.To be cleverly caricatured is an honor, and should\nevince no ill-feeling, especially from these clever singing comedians,\nwho are the best of fellows at heart; whose songs are clever but never\nvulgar; who sing because they love to sing; and whose versatility\nenables them to create the broadest of satires, and, again, a little\nsong with words so pure, so human, and so pathetic, that the applause\nthat follows from the silent room of listeners comes spontaneously from\nthe heart.It is not to be wondered at that "The Grillon" of Marcel Legay\'s is a\npopular haunt of the habitues of the Quarter, who crowd the dingy little\nroom nightly.You enter the "Grillon" by way of the bar, and at the\nfurther end of the bar-room is a small anteroom, its walls hung in\nclever posters and original drawings.This anteroom serves as a sort of\ngreen-room for the singers and their friends; here they chat at the\nlittle tables between their songs--since there is no stage--and through\nthis anteroom both audience and singers pass into the little hall.There\nis the informality of one of our own "smokers" about the whole affair.Furthermore, no women sing in "Le Grillon"--a cabaret in this respect is\ndifferent from a cafe concert, which resembles very much our smaller\nvariety shows.A small upright piano, and in front of it a low platform,\nscarcely its length, complete the necessary stage paraphernalia of the\ncabaret, and the admission is generally a franc and a half, which\nincludes your drink.In the anteroom, four of the singers are smoking and chatting at the\nlittle tables.One of them is a tall, serious-looking fellow, in a black\nfrock coat.He peers out through his black-rimmed eyeglasses with the\nsolemnity of an owl--but you should hear his songs!--they treat of the\nlighter side of life, I assure you.Another singer has just finished his\nturn, and comes out of the smoky hall, wiping the perspiration from his\nshort, fat neck.The audience is still applauding his last song, and he\nrushes back through the faded green velvet portieres to bow his thanks.[Illustration: A POET-SINGER]\n\nA broad-shouldered, jolly-looking fellow, in white duck trousers, is\ntalking earnestly with the owl-like looking bard in eyeglasses.Suddenly\nhis turn is called, and you follow him in, where, as soon as he is seen,\nhe is welcomed by cheers from the students and girls, and an elaborate\nfanfare of chords on the piano.When this popular poet-singer has\nfinished, there follows a round of applause and a pounding of canes,\nand then the ruddy-faced, gray-haired manager starts a three-times-three\nhandclapping in unison to a pounding of chords on the piano.This is the\nproper ending to every demand for an encore in "Le Grillon," and it\nnever fails to bring one.It is nearly eleven when the curtain parts and Marcel Legay rushes\nhurriedly up the aisle and greets the audience, slamming his straw hat\nupon the lid of the piano.He passes his hand over his bald pate--gives\nan extra polish to his eyeglasses--beams with an irresistibly funny\nexpression upon his audience--coughs--whistles--passes a few remarks,\nand then, adjusting his glasses on his stubby red nose, looks\nserio-comically over his roll of music.He is dressed in a long, black\nfrock-coat reaching nearly to his heels.This coat, with its velvet\ncollar, discloses a frilled white shirt and a white flowing bow scarf;\nthese, with a pair of black-and-white check trousers, complete this\nevery-day attire.But the man inside these voluminous clothes is even still more\neccentric.Short, indefinitely past fifty years of age, with a round\nface and merry eyes, and a bald head whose lower portion is framed\nin a fringe of long hair, reminding one of the coiffure of some\npre-Raphaelite saint--indeed, so striking is this resemblance that the\ngood bard is often caricatured with a halo surrounding this medieval\nfringe.In the meantime, while this famous singer is selecting a song, he is\noverwhelmed with demands for his most popular ones.A dozen students and\ngirls at one end of the little hall, now swimming in a haze of pipe and\ncigarette smoke, are hammering with sticks and parasols for "Le matador\navec les pieds du vent"; another crowd is yelling for "La Goularde."Marcel Legay smiles at them all through his eyeglasses, then roars at\nthem to keep quiet--and finally the clamor in the room gradually\nsubsides--here and there a word--a giggle--and finally silence."Now, my children, I will sing to you the story of Clarette," says the\nbard; "it is a very sad histoire.I have read it," and he smiles and\ncocks one eye.His baritone voice still possesses considerable fire, and in his heroic\nsongs he is dramatic.In "The Miller who grinds for Love," the feeling\nand intensity and dramatic quality he puts into its rendition are\nstirring.As he finishes his last encore, amidst a round of applause, he\ngrasps his hat from the piano, jams it over his bald pate with its\ncelestial fringe, and rushes for the door.Here he stops, and, turning\nfor a second, cheers back at the crowd, waving the straw hat above his\nhead.The next moment he is having a cooling drink among his confreres\nin the anteroom.Such "poet-singers" as Paul Delmet and Dominique Bonnaud have made the\n"Grillon" a success; and others like Numa Bles, Gabriel Montoya,\nD\'Herval, Fargy, Tourtal, and Edmond Teulet--all of them well-known over\nin Montmartre, where they are welcomed with the same popularity that\nthey meet with at "Le Grillon."Genius, alas, is but poorly paid in this Bohemia!There are so many who\ncan draw, so many who can sing, so many poets and writers and sculptors.To many of the cleverest, half a loaf is too often better than no\nbread.You will find often in these cabarets and in the cafes and along the\nboulevard, a man who, for a few sous, will render a portrait or a\ncaricature on the spot.You learn that this journeyman artist once was a\nwell-known painter of the Quarter, who had drawn for years in the\nacademies.The man at present is a wreck, as he sits in a cafe with\nportfolio on his knees, his black slouch hat drawn over his scraggly\ngray hair.But his hand, thin and drawn from too much stimulant and too\nlittle food, has lost none of its knowledge of form and line; the sketch\nis strong, true, and with a chic about it and a simplicity of expression\nthat delight you.[Illustration: THE SATIRIST]\n\n"Ah!"he replies, "it is a long story, monsieur."So long and so much of\nit that he can not remember it all!Perhaps it was the woman with the\nvelvety black eyes--tall and straight--the best dancer in all Paris.Yes, he remembers some of it--long, miserable years--years of struggles\nand jealousy, and finally lies and fights and drunkenness; after it was\nall over, he was too gray and old and tired to care!One sees many such derelicts in Paris among these people who have worn\nthemselves out with amusement, for here the world lives for pleasure,\nfor "la grande vie!"To the man, every serious effort he is obliged to\nmake trends toward one idea--that of the bon vivant--to gain success and\nfame, but to gain it with the idea of how much personal daily pleasure\nit will bring him.Ennui is a word one hears constantly; if it rains\ntoute le monde est triste.To have one\'s gaiety interrupted is regarded\nas a calamity, and "tout le monde" will sympathize with you.To live a\nday without the pleasures of life in proportion to one\'s purse is\nconsidered a day lost.If you speak of anything that has pleased you one will, with a gay\nrising inflection of the voice and a smile, say: "Ah!c\'est gai\nla-bas--and monsieur was well amused while in that beautiful\ncountry?"they will exclaim, as you\nenthusiastically continue to explain.They never dull your enthusiasm\nby short phlegmatic or pessimistic replies.And when you are sad\nthey will condone so genuinely with you that you forget your\ndisappointments in the charming pleasantry of their sympathy.But all\nthis continual race for pleasure is destined in the course of time to\nend in ennui!The Parisian goes into the latest sport because it affords him a\nnew sensation.Being blase of all else in life, he plunges into\nautomobiling, buys a white and red racer--a ponderous flying juggernaut\nthat growls and snorts and smells of the lower regions whenever it\nstands still, trembling in its anger and impatience to be off, while its\nowner, with some automobiling Marie, sits chatting on the cafe terrace\nover a cooling drink.The two are covered with dust and very thirsty;\nMarie wears a long dust-colored ulster, and he a wind-proof coat and\nhigh boots.Meanwhile, the locomotive-like affair at the curbstone is\nworking itself into a boiling rage, until finally the brave chauffeur\nand his chic companion prepare to depart.Marie adjusts her white lace\nveil, with its goggles, and the chauffeur puts on his own mask as he\nclimbs in; a roar--a snort, a cloud of blue gas, and they are gone!There are other enthusiasts--those who go up in balloons!one cries enthusiastically, "to be \'en\nballon\'--so poetic--so fin de siecle!It is a fantaisie charmante!"In a balloon one forgets the world--one is no longer a part of it--no\nlonger mortal.What romance there is in going up above everything with\nthe woman one loves--comrades in danger--the ropes--the wicker cage--the\nceiling of stars above one and Paris below no bigger than a gridiron!How chic to shoot straight\nup among the drifting clouds and forget the sordid little world, even\nthe memory of one\'s intrigues!"Enfin seuls," they say to each other, as the big Frenchman and the chic\nParisienne countess peer down over the edge of the basket, sipping a\nlittle chartreuse from the same traveling cup; she, with the black hair\nand white skin, and gowned "en ballon" in a costume by Paillard; he in\nhis peajacket buttoned close under his heavy beard.They seem to brush\nthrough and against the clouds!A gentle breath from heaven makes the\nbasket decline a little and the ropes creak against the hardwood clinch\nblocks.It grows colder, and he wraps her closer in his own coat."Courage, my child," he says; "see, we have gone a great distance;\nto-morrow before sundown we shall descend in Belgium."cries the Countess; "I do not like those Belgians."but you shall see, Therese, one shall go where one pleases soon; we\nare patient, we aeronauts; we shall bring credit to La Belle France; we\nhave courage and perseverance; we shall give many dinners and weep over\nthe failures of our brave comrades, to make the dirigible balloon\n\'pratique.\'our dejeuner in Paris and our\ndinner where we will."Therese taps her polished nails against the edge of the wicker cage and\nhums a little chansonette."Je t\'aime"--she murmurs.*     *     *     *     *\n\nI did not see this myself, and I do not know the fair Therese or the\ngentleman who buttons his coat under his whiskers; but you should have\nheard one of these ballooning enthusiasts tell it to me in the Taverne\ndu Pantheon the other night.His only regret seemed to be that he, too,\ncould not have a dirigible balloon and a countess--on ten francs a\nweek![Illustration: (woman)]\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n"POCHARD"\n\n\nDrunkards are not frequent sights in the Quarter; and yet when these\npeople do get drunk, they become as irresponsible as maniacs.Excitable\nto a degree even when sober, these most wretched among the poor when\ndrunk often appear in front of a cafe--gaunt, wild-eyed, haggard, and\nfilthy--singing in boisterous tones or reciting to you with tense voices\na jumble of meaningless thoughts.The man with the matted hair, and toes out of his boots, will fold his\narms melodramatically, and regard you for some moments as you sit in\nfront of him on the terrace.Then he will vent upon you a torrent\nof abuse, ending in some jumble of socialistic ideas of his own\nconcoction.When he has finished, he will fold his arms again and move\non to the next table.He is crazy with absinthe, and no one pays any\nattention to him.On he strides up the "Boul\' Miche," past the cafes,\ncontinuing his ravings.As long as he is moderately peaceful and\nconfines his wandering brain to gesticulations and speech, he is let\nalone by the police.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\nYou will see sometimes a man and a woman--a teamster out of work or with\nhis wages for the day, and with him a creature--a blear-eyed, slatternly\nlooking woman, in a filthy calico gown.The man clutches her arm, as\nthey sing and stagger up past the cafes.The woman holds in her\nclaw-like hand a half-empty bottle of cheap red wine.Now and then they\nstop and share it; the man staggers on; the woman leers and dances and\nsings; a crowd forms about them.Some years ago this poor girl sat on\nFriday afternoons in the Luxembourg Gardens--her white parasol on her\nknees, her dainty, white kid-slippered feet resting on the little stool\nwhich the old lady, who rents the chairs, used to bring her.She was\nregarded as a bonne camarade in those days among the students--one of\nthe idols of the Quarter!But she became impossible, and then an\noutcast!That women should become outcasts through the hopelessness of\ntheir position or the breaking down of their brains can be understood,\nbut that men of ability should sink into the dregs and stay there seems\nincredible.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\nNear the rue Monge there is a small cafe and restaurant, a place\ncelebrated for its onion soup and its chicken.From the tables outside,\none can see into the small kitchen, with its polished copper sauce-pans\nhanging about the grill.Lachaume, the painter, and I were chatting at one of its little tables,\nhe over an absinthe and I over a coffee and cognac.I had dined early\nthis fresh October evening, enjoying to the full the bracing coolness of\nthe air, pungent with the odor of dry leaves and the faint smell of\nburning brush.The world was hurrying by--in twos and threes--hurrying\nto warm cafes, to friends, to lovers.The breeze at twilight set the dry\nleaves shivering.The yellow glow from the\nshop windows--the blue-white sparkle of electricity like pendant\ndiamonds--made the Quarter seem fuller of life than ever.These fall\ndays make the little ouvrieres trip along from their work with rosy\ncheeks, and put happiness and ambition into one\'s very soul.[Illustration: A GROUP OF NEW STUDIOS]\n\nSoon the winter will come, with all the boys back from their country\nhaunts, and Celeste and Mimi from Ostende.How gay it will be--this\nQuartier Latin then!How gay it always is in winter--and then the rainy\nseason.Thus it was that Lachaume\nand I sat talking, when suddenly a spectre passed--a spectre of a man,\nhis face silent, white, and pinched--drawn like a mummy\'s.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR\'S MODEL]\n\nHe stopped and supported his shrunken frame wearily on his crutches, and\nleaned against a neighboring wall.He made no sound--simply gazed\nvacantly, with the timidity of some animal, at the door of the small\nkitchen aglow with the light from the grill.He made no effort to\napproach the door; only leaned against the gray wall and peered at it\npatiently."A beggar," I said to Lachaume; "poor devil!"old Pochard--yes, poor devil, and once one of the handsomest men in\nParis.""What I\'m drinking now, mon ami."He looks older than I do, does he not?"continued\nLachaume, lighting a fresh cigarette, "and yet I\'m twenty years his\nsenior.You see, I sip mine--he drank his by the goblet," and my friend\nleaned forward and poured the contents of the carafe in a tiny\ntrickling stream over the sugar lying in its perforated spoon.[Illustration: BOY MODEL]\n\n"Ah!those were great days when Pochard was the life of the Bullier," he\nwent on; "I remember the night he won ten thousand francs from the\nRussian.It didn\'t last long; Camille Leroux had her share of\nit--nothing ever lasted long with Camille.He was once courrier to an\nAustrian Baron, I remember.The old fellow used to frequent the Quarter\nin summer, years ago--it was his hobby.Pochard was a great favorite in\nthose days, and the Baron liked to go about in the Quarter with him, and\nof course Pochard was in his glory.He would persuade the old nobleman\nto prolong his vacation here.Once the Baron stayed through the winter\nand fell ill, and a little couturiere in the rue de Rennes, whom the old\nfellow fell in love with, nursed him.He died the summer following, at\nVienna, and left her quite a little property near Amiens.He was a good\nold Baron, a charitable old fellow among the needy, and a good bohemian\nbesides; and he did much for Pochard, but he could not keep him sober!"[Illustration: BOUGUEREAU AT WORK]\n\n"After the old man\'s death," my friend continued, "Pochard drifted from\nbad to worse, and finally out of the Quarter, somewhere into misery on\nthe other side of the Seine.No one heard of him for a few years, until\nhe was again recognized as being the same Pochard returned again to the\nQuarter.He was hobbling about on crutches just as you see him there.And now, do you know what he does?Get up from where you are sitting,"\nsaid Lachaume, "and look into the back kitchen.Is he not standing there\nby the door--they are handing him a small bundle?""Yes," said I, "something wrapped in newspaper.""Do you know what is in it?--the carcass of the chicken you have just\nfinished, and which the garcon carried away.Pochard saw you eating it\nhalf an hour ago as he passed."No, to sell," Lachaume replied, "together with the other bones he is\nable to collect--for soup in some poorest resort down by the river,\nwhere the boatmen and the gamins go.The few sous he gets will buy\nPochard a big glass, a lump of sugar, and a spoon; into the goblet, in\nsome equally dirty \'boite,\' they will pour him out his green treasure of\nabsinthe.Then Pochard will forget the day--perhaps he will dream of the\nAustrian Baron--and try and forget Camille Leroux.[Illustration: GEROME]\n\nMarguerite Girardet, the model, also told me between poses in the studio\nthe other day of just such a "pauvre homme" she once knew."When he was\nyoung," she said, "he won a second prize at the Conservatoire, and\nafterward played first violin at the Comique.Now he plays in front of\nthe cafes, like the rest, and sometimes poses for the head of an old\nman![Illustration: A. MICHELENA]\n\n"Many grow old so young," she continued; "I knew a little model once\nwith a beautiful figure, absolutely comme un bijou--pretty, too, and\nhad she been a sensible girl, as I often told her, she could still have\nearned her ten francs a day posing; but she wanted to dine all the time\nwith this and that one, and pose too, and in three months all her fine\n\'svelte\' lines that made her a valuable model among the sculptors were\ngone.You see, I have posed all my life in the studios, and I am over\nthirty now, and you know I work hard, but I have kept my fine\nlines--because I go to bed early and eat and drink little.Then I have\nmuch to do at home; my husband and I for years have had a comfortable\nhome; we take a great deal of pride in it, and it keeps me very busy to\nkeep everything in order, for I pose very early some mornings and then\ngo back and get dejeuner, and then back to pose again.[Illustration: A SCULPTOR\'S STUDIO]\n\n"In the summer," she went on, "we take a little place outside of Paris\nfor a month, down the Seine, where my husband brings his work with him;\nhe is a repairer of fans and objets d\'art.You should come in and see us\nsome time; it is quite near where you painted last summer.Ah yes," she\nexclaimed, as she drew her pink toes under her, "I love the country!Last year I posed nearly two months for Monsieur Z., the painter--en\nplein air; my skin was not as white as it is now, I can tell you--I was\nabsolutely like an Indian![Illustration: FREMIET]\n\n"Once"--and Marguerite smiled at the memory of it--"I went to England to\npose for a painter well known there.It was an important tableau, and I\nstayed there six months.It was a horrible place to me--I was always\ncold--the fog was so thick one could hardly see in winter mornings going\nto the studio.Besides, I could get nothing good to eat!He was a\ncelebrated painter, a \'Sir,\' and lived with his family in a big stone\nhouse with a garden.We had tea and cakes at five in the studio--always\ntea, tea, tea!--I can tell you I used to long for a good bottle of\nMadame Giraud\'s vin ordinaire, and a poulet.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.So I left and came back to\nParis.J\'etais toujours, toujours\ntriste la!In Paris I make a good living; ten francs a day--that\'s not\nbad, is it?and my time is taken often a year ahead.I like to pose for\nthe painters--the studios are cleaner than those of the sculptor\'s.Some\nof the sculptors\' studios are so dirty--clay and dust over everything!Did you see Fabien\'s studio the other day when I posed for him?Tiens!--you should have seen it last year when he was\nworking on the big group for the Exposition!It is clean now compared\nwith what it was.You see, I go to my work in the plainest of clothes--a\ncheap print dress and everything of the simplest I can make, for in half\nan hour, left in those studios, they would be fit only for the\nblanchisseuse--the wax and dust are in and over everything!There is\nno time to change when one has not the time to go home at mid-day."[Illustration: JEAN PAUL LAURENS]\n\nAnd so I learned much of the good sense and many of the economies in the\nlife of this most celebrated model.You can see her superb figure\nwrought in marble and bronze by some of the most famous of modern French\nsculptors all over Paris.There is another type of model you will see, too--one who rang my bell\none sunny morning in response to a note written by my good friend, the\nsculptor, for whom this little Parisienne posed.She came without her hat--this "vrai type"--about seventeen years of\nage--with exquisite features, her blue eyes shining under a wealth of\ndelicate blonde hair arranged in the prettiest of fashions--a little\nwhite bow tied jauntily at her throat, and her exquisitely delicate,\nstrong young figure clothed in a simple black dress.She had about her\nsuch a frank, childlike air!Yes, she posed for so and so, and so and\nso, but not many; she liked it better than being in a shop; and it\nwas far more independent, for one could go about and see one\'s\nfriends--and there were many of her girl friends living on the same\nstreet where this chic demoiselle lived.As she sat buttoning her boots, she\nlooked up at me innocently, slipped her five francs for the morning\'s\nwork in her reticule, and said:\n\n"I live with mama, and mama never gives me any money to spend on myself.This is Sunday and a holiday, so I shall go with Henriette and her\nbrother to Vincennes.[Illustration: OLD MAN MODEL]\n\nIt would have been quite impossible for me to have gone with them--I was\nnot even invited; but this very serious and good little Parisienne, who\nposed for the figure with quite the same unconsciousness as she would\nhave handed you your change over the counter of some stuffy little shop,\nwent to Vincennes with Henriette and her brother, where they had a\nbeautiful day--scrambling up the paths and listening to the band--all at\nthe enormous expense of the artist; and this was how this good little\nParisienne managed to save five francs in a single day!There are old-men models who knock at your studio too, and who are\ncelebrated for their tangled gray locks, which they immediately\nuncover as you open your door.These unkempt-looking Father Times and\nMethuselahs prowl about the staircases of the different ateliers daily.So do little children--mostly Italians and all filthily dirty; swarthy,\nblack-eyed, gypsy-looking girls and boys of from twelve to fifteen years\nof age, and Italian mothers holding small children--itinerant madonnas.These are the poorer class of models--the riff-raff of the Quarter--who\nget anywhere from a few sous to a few francs for a seance.And there are four-footed models, too, for I know a kindly old horse who\nhas served in many a studio and who has carried a score of the famous\ngenerals of the world and Jeanne d\'Arcs to battle--in many a modern\npublic square.CHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS\n\n\nIn this busy Quarter, where so many people are confined throughout the\nday in work-shops and studios, a breathing-space becomes a necessity.The\ngardens of the Luxembourg, brilliant in flowers and laid out in the\nRenaissance, with shady groves and long avenues of chestnut-trees\nstretching up to the Place de l\'Observatoire, afford the great\nbreathing-ground for the Latin Quarter.If one had but an hour to spend in the Quartier Latin, one could not\nfind a more interesting and representative sight of student life than\nbetween the hours of four and five on Friday afternoon, when the\nmilitary band plays in the Luxembourg Gardens.This is the afternoon\nwhen Bohemia is on parade.Then every one flocks here to see one\'s\nfriends--and a sort of weekly reception for the Quarter is held.The\nwalks about the band-stand are thronged with students and girls,\nand hundreds of chairs are filled with an audience of the older\npeople--shopkeepers and their families, old women in white lace caps,\nand gray-haired old men, many in straight-brimmed high hats of a mode of\ntwenty years past.Here they sit and listen to the music under the cool\nshadow of the trees, whose rich foliage forms an arbor overhead--a roof\nof green leaves, through which the sunbeams stream and in which the fat,\ngray pigeons find a paradise.[Illustration: THE CHILDREN\'S SHOP--LUXEMBOURG GARDENS]\n\nThere is a booth near-by where waffles, cooked on a small oven in the\nrear, are sold.In front are a dozen or more tables for ices and\ndrinkables.Every table and chair is taken within hearing distance of\nthe band.When these musicians of the army of France arrive, marching in\ntwos from their barracks to the stand, it is always the signal for that\ngenuine enthusiasm among the waiting crowd which one sees between the\nFrench and their soldiers.If you chance to sit among the groups at the little tables, and watch\nthe passing throng in front of you, you will see some queer "types,"\nmany of them seldom en evidence except on these Friday afternoons in the\nLuxembourg.Buried, no doubt, in some garret hermitage or studio, they\nemerge thus weekly to greet silently the passing world.A tall poet stalks slowly by, reading intently, as he walks, a well-worn\nvolume of verses--his faded straw hat shading the tip of his long nose.Following him, a boy of twenty, delicately featured, with that purity of\nexpression one sees in the faces of the good--the result of a life,\nperhaps, given to his ideal in art.He wears his hair long and curling\nover his ears, with a long stray wisp over one eye, the whole cropped\nevenly at the back as it reaches his black velvet collar.He wears, too,\na dove-gray vest of fine corduroy, buttoned behind like those of the\nclergy, and a velvet tam-o\'-shanter-like cap, and carries between his\nteeth a small pipe with a long goose-quill stem.You can readily see\nthat to this young man with high ideals there is only one corner of the\nworld worth living in, and that lies between the Place de l\'Observatoire\nand the Seine.Three students pass, in wide broadcloth trousers, gathered in tight at\nthe ankles, and wearing wide-brimmed black hats.Hanging on the arm of\none of the trio is a short snub-nosed girl, whose Cleo-Merodic hair,\nflattened in a bandeau over her ears, not only completely conce']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Then the indomitable Sherman disembarked, a lighted candle in his\nhand, and led a stiff march through thicket and swamp and breast-deep\nbackwater, where the little drummer boys carried their drums on their\nheads.At length, when they were come to some Indian mounds, they found\na picket of three, companies of the force which had reached the flat the\nday before, and had been sent down to prevent the enemy from obstructing\nfurther the stream below the fleet."The Admiral\'s in a bad way, sir," said the Colonel who rode up to meet\nthe General.Those clumsy ironclads of his can\'t move\nbackward or forward, and the Rebs have been peppering him for two days."Just then a fusillade broke from the thickets, nipping the branches from\nthe cottonwoods about them.The force swept forward, with the three picket companies in the swamp on\nthe right.John travelled to the kitchen.And presently they came in sight of the shapeless ironclads\nwith their funnels belching smoke, a most remarkable spectacle.How\nPorter had pushed them there was one of the miracles of the war.Then followed one of a thousand memorable incidents in the life of a\nmemorable man.General Sherman, jumping on the bare back of a scrawny\nhorse, cantered through the fields.And the bluejackets, at sight of\nthat familiar figure, roared out a cheer that might have shaken the\ndrops from the wet boughs.The Admiral and the General stood together on\nthe deck, their hands clasped.And the Colonel astutely remarked, as he\nrode up in answer to a summons, that if Porter was the only man whose\ndaring could have pushed a fleet to that position, Sherman was certainly\nthe only man who could have got him out of it."Colonel," said the General, "that move was well executed, sir.Admiral,\ndid the Rebs put a bullet through your rum casks?And now," he added, wheeling on the Colonel when each had a glass\nin his hand, "who was in command of that company on the right, in the\nswamp?"He\'s a second lieutenant, General, in the Sixth Missouri.Captain\nwounded at Hindman, and first lieutenant fell out down below.His name\nis Brice, I believe."Some few days afterward, when the troops were slopping around again at\nYoung\'s Point, opposite Vicksburg, a gentleman arrived on a boat\nfrom St.He paused on the levee to survey with concern and\nastonishment the flood of waters behind it, and then asked an officer\nthe way to General Sherman\'s headquarters.The officer, who was greatly\nimpressed by the gentleman\'s looks, led him at once to a trestle bridge\nwhich spanned the distance from the levee bank over the flood to a house\nup to its first floor in the backwaters.The officer looked inquiringly at the gentleman, who gave his name.The officer could not repress a smile at the next thing that happened.Out hurried the General himself, with both hands outstretched.he cried, "if it isn\'t Brinsmade.Come right in, come\nright in and take dinner.I\'ll send\nand tell Grant you\'re here.Brinsmade, if it wasn\'t for you and your\nfriends on the Western Sanitary Commission, we\'d all have been dead of\nfever and bad food long ago.""I guess a\ngood many of the boys are laid up now," he added."I\'ve come down to do what I can, General," responded Mr."I want to go through all the hospitals to see that our nurses\nare doing their duty and that the stores are properly distributed.""You shall, sir, this minute," said the General.He dropped instantly\nthe affairs which he had on hand, and without waiting for dinner the\ntwo gentlemen went together through the wards where the fever raged.The\nGeneral surprised his visitor by recognizing private after private in\nthe cots, and he always had a brief word of cheer to brighten their\nfaces, to make them follow him with wistful eyes as he passed beyond\nthem."That\'s poor Craig," he would say, "corporal, Third Michigan.They\ntell me he can\'t live," and "That\'s Olcott, Eleventh Indiana.cried the General, when they were out in the air again, "how I wish\nsome of these cotton traders could get a taste of this fever.They keep\nwell--the vultures--And by the way, Brinsmade, the man who gave me no\npeace at all at Memphis was from your city.Mary journeyed to the bathroom.Why, I had to keep a whole\ncorps on duty to watch him."As long as\nI live I shall never forget it."He has always seemed\ninoffensive, and I believe he is a prominent member of one of our\nchurches.""I guess that\'s so," answered the General, dryly."I ever I set eyes on\nhim again, he\'s clapped into the guardhouse.Brinsmade, presently, "have\nyou ever heard of Stephen Brice?You may\nremember talking to him one evening at my house."He\npaused on the very brink of relating again the incident at Camp Jackson,\nwhen Stephen had saved the life of Mr."Brinsmade,\nfor three days I\'ve had it on my mind to send for that boy.I like him," cried General Sherman, with tone\nand gesture there was no mistaking.Brinsmade, who liked\nStephen, too, rejoiced at the story he would have to tell the widow."He\nhas spirit, Brinsmade.I told him to let me know when he was ready to go\nto war.The first thing I hear of\nhim is that he\'s digging holes in the clay of Chickasaw Bluff, and his\ncap is fanned off by the blast of a Parrott six feet above his head.Next thing he turns up on that little expedition we took to get Porter\nto sea again.When we got to the gunboats, there was Brice\'s company\non the flank.He handled those men surprisingly, sir--surprisingly.I\nshouldn\'t have blamed the boy if one or two Rebs got by him.But no, he\nswept the place clean."By this time they had come back to the bridge\nleading to headquarters, and the General beckoned quickly to an orderly."My compliments to Lieutenant Stephen Brice, Sixth Missouri, and ask him\nto report here at once.Brice\'s company were swinging axes when the\norderly arrived, and Mr.Brice had an axe himself, and was up to his\nboot tops in yellow mud.The orderly, who had once been an Iowa farmer, was near grinning when he\ngave the General\'s message and saw the lieutenant gazing ruefully at his\nclothes.Entering headquarters, Stephen paused at the doorway of the big room\nwhere the officers of the different staffs were scattered about,\nsmoking, while the <DW64> servants were removing the dishes from the\ntable.The sunlight, reflected from the rippling water outside, danced\non the ceiling.At the end of the room sat General Sherman, his uniform,\nas always, a trifle awry.His soft felt hat with the gold braid was\ntilted forward, and his feet, booted and spurred, were crossed.Small\nwonder that the Englishman who sought the typical American found him in\nSherman.The sound that had caught Stephen\'s attention was the General\'s voice,\nsomewhat high-pitched, in the key that he used in telling a story."Sin gives you a pretty square deal, boys, after all.Generally a man\nsays, \'Well, I can resist, but I\'ll have my fun just this once.\'Stephen made his way to the General, whose bright eyes wandered rapidly\nover him as he added:\n\n"This is the condition my officers report in, Brinsmade,--mud from head\nto heel."Stephen had sense enough to say nothing, but the staff officers laughed,\nand Mr.Brinsmade smiled as he rose and took Stephen\'s hand."I am delighted to see that you are well, sir," said he, with that\nformal kindliness which endeared him to all."Your mother will be\nrejoiced at my news of you.You will be glad to hear that I left her\nwell, Stephen.""They are well, sir, and took pleasure in adding to a little box which\nyour mother sent.Judge Whipple put in a box of fine cigars, although he\ndeplores the use of tobacco.""He is ailing, sir, it grieves me to say.Your mother desired to have him moved to her house,\nbut he is difficult to stir from his ways, and he would not leave his\nlittle room.We have got old Nancy, Hester\'s mother,\nto stay with him at night, and Mrs.Brice divides the day with Miss\nJinny Carvel, who comes in from Bellegarde every afternoon."exclaimed Stephen, wondering if he heard aright.And at\nthe mention of her name he tingled."She has been much honored\nfor it.You may remember that the Judge was a close friend of her\nfather\'s before the war.And--well, they quarrelled, sir."When--when was the Judge taken ill, Mr.The\nthought of Virginia and his mother caring for him together was strangely\nsweet."Two days before I left, sir, Dr.Polk had warned him not to do so much.But the Doctor tells me that he can see no dangerous symptoms."Brinsmade how long he was to be with them."I am going on to the other camps this afternoon," said he."But I\nshould like a glimpse of your quarters, Stephen, if you will invite\nme.Your mother would like a careful account of you, and Mr.Whipple,\nand--your many friends in St."You will find my tent a little wet, air," replied Stephen, touched.Here the General, who had been sitting by watching them with a very\ncurious expression, spoke up."That\'s hospitality for you, Brinsmade!"Brinsmade made their way across plank and bridge to\nStephen\'s tent, and his mess servant arrived in due time with the\npackage from home.But presently, while they sat talking of many things,\nthe canvas of the fly was thrust back with a quick movement, and who\nshould come stooping in but General Sherman himself.He sat down on a\ncracker box."Well, well, Brice," said the General, winking at Mr.Brinsmade, "I\nthink you might have invited me to the feast.The General chose one and lighted\nit."Why, yes, sir, when I can.""Then light up, sir," said the General, "and sit down, I\'ve been\nthinking lately of court-martialing you, but I decided to come \'round\nand talk it over with you first.That isn\'t strictly according to\nthe rules of the service."They began to draft, sir, and I couldn\'t stand it any longer."You were in the Home Guards, if I\nremember right.Brinsmade tells me you were useful in many ways\nWhat was your rank in the Home Guards?""A second lieutenant in temporary command, General.""Couldn\'t they do better for you than a second-lieutenancy?"Brinsmade spoke up, "They offered him\na lieutenant-colonelcy."The General was silent a moment: Then he said "Do you remember meeting\nme on the boat when I was leaving St.Louis, after the capture of Fort\nHenry?""Very well, General," he replied, General Sherman leaned\nforward."And do you remember I said to you, \'Brice, when you get ready to come\ninto this war, let me know.\'Then he said gravely, but with just a\nsuspicion of humor about his mouth:-- "General, if I had done that, you\nwouldn\'t be here in my tent to-day."Like lightning the General was on his feet, his hand on Stephen\'s\nshoulder."By gad, sir," he cried, delighted, "so I wouldn\'t."A STRANGE MEETING\n\nThe story of the capture of Vicksburg is the old, old story of failure\nturned into success, by which man is made immortal.It involves the\nhistory of a general who never retraced his steps, who cared neither\nfor mugwump murmurs nor political cabals, who took both blame and praise\nwith equanimity.Through month after month of discouragement, and work\ngone for naught, and fever and death, his eyes never left his goal.And\nby grace of the wisdom of that President who himself knew sorrow and\nsuffering and defeat and unjust censure, General Grant won.The canal abandoned, one red night fleet and transports\nswept around the bend and passed the city\'s heights, on a red river.The Parrotts and the Dahlgrens roared, and the high bluffs flung out the\nsound over the empty swamp land.Then there came the landing below, and the cutting loose from a\nbase--unheard of.Corps behind cursed corps ahead for sweeping the\ncountry clear of forage.Confederate generals in\nMississippi were bewildered.One night, while crossing with his regiment a pontoon bridge, Stephen\nBrice heard a shout raised on the farther shore.Sitting together on\na log under a torch, two men in slouch hats were silhouetted.That one\ntalking with rapid gestures was General Sherman.The impassive profile\nof the other, the close-cropped beard and the firmly held cigar that\nseemed to go with it,--Stephen recognized as that of the strange Captain\nGrant who had stood beside him in the street by the Arsenal He had not\nchanged a whit.Motionless, he watched corps after corps splash by,\nartillery, cavalry, and infantry, nor gave any sign that he heard their\nplaudits.At length the army came up behind the city to a place primeval, where\nthe face of the earth was sore and tortured, worn into deep gorges by\nthe rains, and flung up in great mounds.Stripped of the green magnolias\nand the cane, the banks of clay stood forth in hideous yellow nakedness,\nsave for a lonely stunted growth, or a bare trunk that still stood\ntottering on the edge of a banks its pitiful withered roots reaching out\nbelow.First of all there was a murderous assault, and a still more murderous\nrepulse.Three times the besiegers charged, sank their color staffs\ninto the redoubts, and three times were driven back.Then the blue army\nsettled into the earth and folded into the ravines.Three days in that\nnarrow space between the lines lay the dead and wounded suffering untold\nagonies in the moist heat.Then came a truce to bury the dead, to bring\nback what was left of the living.Like clockwork from the Mississippi\'s banks\nbeyond came the boom and shriek of the coehorns on the barges.The big\nshells hung for an instant in the air like birds of prey, and then could\nbe seen swooping down here and there, while now and anon a shaft of\nsmoke rose straight to the sky, the black monument of a home.Here was work in the trenches, digging the flying sap by night and\ndeepening it by day, for officers and men alike.From heaven a host of\nblue ants could be seen toiling in zigzags forward, ever forward, along\nthe rude water-cuts and through the hills.A waiting carrion from her\nvantage point on high marked one spot then another where the blue ants\ndisappeared, and again one by one came out of the burrow to hurry down\nthe trench,--each with his ball of clay.In due time the ring of metal and sepulchred voices rumbled in the\nground beneath the besieged.Counter mines were started, and through the\nnarrow walls of earth commands and curses came.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.Above ground the saps\nwere so near that a strange converse became the rule.Both sides were starving, the one for tobacco and\nthe other for hardtack and bacon.These necessities were tossed across,\nsometimes wrapped in the Vicksburg news-sheet printed on the white\nside of a homely green wall paper.At other times other amenities were\nindulged in.Hand-grenades were thrown and shells with lighted fuses\nrolled down on the heads of acquaintances of the night before, who\nreplied from wooden coehorns hooped with iron.The Union generals learned (common item in a siege) that the citizens\nof Vicksburg were eating mule meat.Not an officer or private in the\nVicksburg armies who does not remember the 25th of June, and the hour\nof three in an afternoon of pitiless heat.Silently the long blue files\nwound into position behind the earth barriers which hid them from the\nenemy, coiled and ready to strike when the towering redoubt on the\nJackson road should rise heavenwards.By common consent the rifle\ncrack of day and night was hushed, and even the Parrotts were silent.Stillness closed around the white house of Shirley once more, but not\nthe stillness it had known in its peaceful homestead days.This was\nthe stillness of the death prayer.Eyes staring at the big redoubt were\ndimmed.At last, to those near, a little wisp of blue smoke crept out.The sun was darkened, and a hot\nblast fanned the upturned faces.In the sky, through the film of\nshattered clay, little black dots scurried, poised, and fell again as\narms and legs and head less trunks and shapeless bits of wood and iron.Scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty\nthousand bayonets, and a hundred shells were shrieking across the\ncrater\'s edge.Earth to earth, alas, and dust to dust!Men who ran\nacross that rim of a summer\'s after-noon died in torture under tier upon\ntier of their comrades,--and so the hole was filled.An upright cannon marks the spot where a scrawny oak once stood on\na scarred and baked hillside, outside of the Confederate lines at\nVicksburg.Under the scanty shade of that tree, on the eve of the\nNation\'s birthday, stood two men who typified the future and the past.As at Donelson, a trick of Fortune\'s had delivered one comrade of old\ninto the hands of another.Now she chose to kiss the one upon whom she\nhad heaped obscurity and poverty and contumely.He had ceased to think\nor care about Fortune.And hence, being born a woman, she favored him.They noted the friendly greeting\nof old comrades, and after that they saw the self-contained Northerner\nbiting his cigar, as one to whom the pleasantries of life were past and\ngone.The South saw her General turn on his heel.Both sides honored him for the fight he had made.But war\ndoes not reward a man according to his deserts.The next day--the day our sundered nation was born Vicksburg\nsurrendered: the obstinate man with the mighty force had conquered.See\nthe gray regiments marching silently in the tropic heat into the folds\nof that blue army whose grip has choked them at last.Silently, too, the\nblue coats stand, pity and admiration on the brick-red faces.The arms\nare stacked and surrendered, officers and men are to be parolled when\nthe counting is finished.The formations melt away, and those who for\nmonths have sought each other\'s lives are grouped in friendly talk.The\ncoarse army bread is drawn eagerly from the knapsacks of the blue, smoke\nquivers above a hundred fires, and the smell of frying bacon brings a\nwistful look into the gaunt faces.Tears stand in the eyes of many a man\nas he eats the food his Yankee brothers have given him on the birthday\nof their country.Stephen Brice, now a captain in General\nLauman\'s brigade, sees with thanksgiving the stars and stripes flutter\nfrom the dome of that court-house which he had so long watched from\nafar.Later on, down a side street, he pauses before a house with its\nface blown away.On the verge of one of its jagged floors is an old\nfour-posted bed, and beside it a child\'s cot is standing pitifully,--the\ntiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the\nfoot.So much for one of the navy\'s shells.While he was thinking of the sadness of it all, a little scene was\nacted: the side door of the house opened, a weeping woman came out, and\nwith her was a tall Confederate Colonel of cavalry.Gallantly giving her\nhis arm, he escorted her as far as the little gate, where she bade him\ngood by with much feeling.With an impulsive movement he drew some money\nfrom his pocket, thrust it upon her, and started hurriedly away that\nhe might not listen to her thanks.Such was his preoccupation that\nhe actually brushed into Stephen, who was standing beside a tree."Excuse me, seh," he said contritely."Certainly," said Stephen, smiling; "it was my fault for getting in your\nway.""Not at all, seh," said the cavalry Colonel; "my clumsiness, seh."He did not pass on, but stood pulling with some violence a very long\nmustache."Damn you Yankees," he continued, in the same amiable tone,\n"you\'ve brought us a heap of misfortune.Why, seh, in another week we\'d\nbeen fo\'ced to eat <DW65>s."The Colonel made such a wry face that Stephen laughed in spite of\nhimself.He had marked the man\'s charitable action, and admired his\nattempt to cover it.The Colonel seemed to be all breadth, like a card.The face was scant, perchance from lack\nof food, the nose large, with a curved rim, and the eyes blue gray.He\nwore clay-flecked cavalry boots, and was six feet five if an inch, so\nthat Stephen\'s six seemed insignificant beside him."Captain," he said, taking in Stephen\'s rank, "so we won\'t qua\'l as to\nwho\'s host heah.One thing\'s suah," he added, with a twinkle, "I\'ve been\nheah longest.Seems like ten yeahs since I saw the wife and children\ndown in the Palmetto State.I can\'t offer you a dinner, seh.We\'ve\neaten all the mules and rats and sugar cane in town."(His eye seemed to\ninterpolate that Stephen wouldn\'t be there otherwise.)"But I can offer\nyou something choicer than you have in the No\'th."Whereupon he drew from his hip a dented silver flask.The Colonel\nremarked that Stephen\'s eyes fell on the coat of arms."Prope\'ty of my grandfather, seh, of Washington\'s Army.My name is\nJennison,--Catesby Jennison, at your service, seh," he said."You have\nthe advantage of me, Captain.""My name is Brice," said Stephen.The big Colonel bowed decorously, held out a great, wide hand, and\nthereupon unscrewed the flask.Now Stephen had never learned to like\nstraight whiskey, but he took down his share without a face.The exploit\nseemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor\njustice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with\nstill greater ceremony, and they walked off down the street together.Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple\'s cigars, to which\nhis new friend gave unqualified praise.On every hand Vicksburg showed signs of hard usage.Houses with gaping\nchasms in their sides, others mere heaps of black ruins; great trees\nfelled, cabins demolished, and here and there the sidewalk ploughed\nacross from curb to fence."Lordy I how my ears ache since your\ndamned coehorns have stopped.The noise got to be silence with us, seh,\nand yesterday I reckoned a hundred volcanoes had bust.Tell me," said he\n"when the redoubt over the Jackson road was blown up, they said a <DW65>\ncame down in your lines alive."Yes," said Stephen, smiling; "he struck near the place where my company\nwas stationed."I reckon he fell on it," said Colonel Catesby Jennison, as if it were a\nmatter of no special note."And now tell me something," said Stephen."How did you burn our\nsap-rollers?"This time the Colonel stopped, and gave himself up to hearty laughter."Why, that was a Yankee trick, sure enough," he cried."Some ingenious\ncuss soaked port fire in turpentine, and shot the wad in a large-bore\nmusket."The Colonel laughed again, still more heartily."Explosive\nbullets!--Good Lord, it was all we could do to get percussion caps.Do you know how we got percussion caps, seh?Three of our\nofficers--dare-devils, seh--floated down the Mississippi on logs.One\nfellow made his way back with two hundred thousand.He\'s the pride of\nour Vicksburg army.A chivalrous man, a forlorn-hope\nman.The night you ran the batteries he and some others went across to\nyour side in skiffs--in skiffs, seh, I say--and set fire to the houses\nin De Soto, that we might see to shoot.And then he came back in the\nface of our own batteries and your guns.That man was wounded by a trick\nof fate, by a cussed bit of shell from your coehorns while eating his\ndinner in Vicksburg.He\'s pretty low, now, poor fellow," added the\nColonel, sadly.demanded Stephen, fired with a desire to see the man."Well, he ain\'t a great ways from here," said the Colonel."Perhaps you\nmight be able to do something for him," he continued thoughtfully."I\'d\nhate to see him die.The doctor says he\'ll pull through if he can get\ncare and good air and good food."He seized Stephen\'s arm in a fierce\ngrip."No," said the Colonel, thoughtfully, as to himself, "you don\'t look\nlike the man to fool."Whereupon he set out with great strides, in marked contrast to his\nformer languorous gait, and after a while they came to a sort of gorge,\nwhere the street ran between high banks of clay.There Stephen saw the\nmagazines which the Confederates had dug out, and of which he had heard.But he saw something, too, of which he had not heard, Colonel Catesby\nJennison stopped before an open doorway in the yellow bank and knocked.A woman\'s voice called softly to him to enter.They went into a room hewn out of the solid clay.Carpet was stretched\non the floor, paper was on the walls, and even a picture.There was\na little window cut like a port in a prison cell, and under it a bed,\nbeside which a middle-aged lady was seated.She had a kindly face which\nseemed to Stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture\nof restraint.She pointed to the bed, where a sheet lay limply over the\nangles of a wasted frame.said the lady,--"it is the first time in two days that he has\nslept."But the sleeper stirred wearily, and woke with a start.The face, so yellow and peaked, was of the type that grows even more\nhandsome in sickness, and in the great fever-stricken eyes a high spirit\nburned.For an instant only the man stared at Stephen, and then he\ndragged himself to the wall.The eyes of the other two were both fixed on the young Union Captain.cried Jennison, seizing Stephen\'s rigid arm, "does he look as\nbad as that?"I--I know him," answered Stephen.He stepped quickly to the bedside,\nand bent over it."This is too much, Jennison," came from the bed a voice that was\npitifully weak; "why do you bring Yankees in here?""Captain Brice is a friend of yours, Colfax," said the Colonel, tugging\nat his mustache.I have met Captain Colfax--"\n\n"Colonel, sir.""Colonel Colfax, before the war!And if he would like to go to St.Louis, I think I can have it arranged at once."In silence they waited for Clarence\'s answer Stephen well knew what was\npassing in his mind, and guessed at his repugnance to accept a favor\nfrom a Yankee.He wondered whether there was in this case a special\ndetestation.And so his mind was carried far to the northward to the\nmemory of that day in the summer-house on the Meramee heights.Virginia\nhad not loved her cousin then--of that Stephen was sure.But now,--now\nthat the Vicksburg army was ringing with his praise, now that he was\nunfortunate--Stephen sighed.His comfort was that he would be the\ninstrument.The lady in her uneasiness smoothed the single sheen that covered the\nsick man.From afar came the sound of cheering, and it was this that\nseemed to rouse him.And then, with\nsome vehemence, "What is he doing in Vicksburg?"Stephen looked at Jennison, who winced."The city has surrendered," said that officer."Then you can afford to be generous," he said, with a bitter laugh."But you haven\'t whipped us yet, by a good deal.Jennison," he cried,\n"Jennison, why in hell did you give up?""Colfax," said Stephen, coming forward, "you\'re too sick a man to talk.It may be that I can have you sent North\nto-day.""You can do as you please," said Clarence, coldly, "with a--prisoner."Bowing to the lady, he strode out of\nthe room.Colonel Jennison, running after him, caught him in the street."He\'s sick--and God Almighty,\nhe\'s proud--I reckon," he added with a touch of humility that went\nstraight to Stephen\'s heart."I reckon that some of us are too derned\nproud--But we ain\'t cold."And I hope, Colonel, that we may meet\nagain--as friends."Mary moved to the kitchen."Hold on, seh," said Colonel Catesby Jennison; "we\nmay as well drink to that."Fortunately, as Stephen drew near the Court House, he caught sight of\na group of officers seated on its steps, and among them he was quick to\nrecognize General Sherman."Brice," said the General, returning his salute, "been celebrating this\nglorious Fourth with some of our Rebel friends?""Yes, sir," answered Stephen, "and I came to ask a favor for one of\nthem."Seeing that the General\'s genial, interested expression did not\nchange, he was emboldened to go on."This is one of their colonels, sir.He is the man who floated down the river on a\nlog and brought back two hundred thousand percussion caps--"\n\n"Good Lord," interrupted the General, "I guess we all heard of him after\nthat.What else has he done to endear himself?""Well, General, he rowed across the river in a skiff the night we ran\nthese batteries, and set fire to De Soto to make targets for their\ngunners.""I\'d like to see that man," said the General, in his eager way."What I was going to tell you, sir.After he went through all this, he\nwas hit by a piece of mortar shell, while sitting at his dinner.He\'s\nrather far gone now, General, and they say he can\'t live unless he can\nbe sent North.I--I know who he is in St.And I thought that as\nlong as the officers are to be paroled I might get your permission to\nsend him up to-day.""I know the breed," said he, "I\'ll bet he didn\'t\nthank you.""I like his grit," said the General, emphatically, "These young bloods\nare the backbone of this rebellion, Brice.They\nnever did anything except horse-racing and cock-fighting.They ride like\nthe devil, fight like the devil, but don\'t care a picayune for anything.And, good Lord, how\nthey hate a Yankee!He\'s a cousin of that\nfine-looking girl Brinsmade spoke of.Be a\npity to disappoint her--eh?""Why, Captain, I believe you would like to marry her yourself!Take my\nadvice, sir, and don\'t try to tame any wildcats.""I\'m glad to do a favor for that young man," said the General, when\nStephen had gone off with the slip of paper he had given him."I like to\ndo that kind of a favor for any officer, when I can.Did you notice how\nhe flared up when I mentioned the girl?"John went back to the office.This is why Clarence Colfax found himself that evening on a hospital\nsteamer of the Sanitary Commission, bound north for St.BELLEGARDE ONCE MORE\n\nSupper at Bellegarde was not the simple meal it had been for a year past\nat Colonel Carvel\'s house in town.Colfax was proud of her table,\nproud of her fried chickens and corn fritters and her desserts.How\nVirginia chafed at those suppers, and how she despised the guests whom\nher aunt was in the habit of inviting to some of them!And when none\nwas present, she was forced to listen to Mrs.Colfax\'s prattle about the\nfashions, her tirades against the Yankees."I\'m sure he must be dead," said that lady, one sultry evening in July.Her tone, however, was not one of conviction.A lazy wind from the river\nstirred the lawn of Virginia\'s gown.The girl, with her hand on the\nwicker back of the chair, was watching a storm gather to the eastward,\nacross the Illinois prairie."I don\'t see why you say that, Aunt Lillian," she replied."Bad news\ntravels faster than good."It is cruel of him not to send us a line,\ntelling us where his regiment is."She had long since learned that the wisdom of\nsilence was the best for her aunt\'s unreasonableness.Certainly, if\nClarence\'s letters could not pass the close lines of the Federal troops,\nnews of her father\'s Texas regiment could not come from Red River."How was Judge Whipple to-day?"Brice,--isn\'t that her name?--doesn\'t take him to\nher house.Virginia began to rock slowly, and her foot tapped the porch.Brice has begged the Judge to come to her.But he says he has\nlived in those rooms, and that he will die there,--when the time comes."You have become quite a Yankee\nyourself, I believe, spending whole days with her, nursing that old\nman.""The Judge is an old friend of my father\'s; I think he would wish it,"\nreplied the girl, in a lifeless voice.Her speech did not reveal all the pain and resentment she felt.She\nthought of the old man racked with pain and suffering in the heat, lying\npatient on his narrow bed, the only light of life remaining the presence\nof the two women.They came day by day, and often Margaret Brice had\ntaken the place of the old negress who sat with him at night.Yes, it was worship; it had been worship since the\nday she and her father had gone to the little whitewashed hospital.Providence had brought them together at the Judge\'s bedside.The\nmarvellous quiet power of the older woman had laid hold of the girl in\nspite of all barriers.Often when the Judge\'s pain was eased sufficiently for him to talk, he\nwould speak of Stephen.The mother never spoke of her son, but a light\nwould come into her eyes at this praise of him which thrilled Virginia\nto see.And when the good lady was gone, and the Judge had fallen into\nslumber, it would still haunt her.Was it out of consideration for her that Mrs.Brice would turn the Judge\nfrom this topic which he seemed to love best?Virginia could not admit\nto herself that she resented this.She had heard Stephen\'s letters to\nthe Judge.Strong and manly they were, with plenty\nof praises for the Southern defenders of Vicksburg.Only yesterday\nVirginia had read one of these to Mr.Well\nthat his face was turned to the window, and that Stephen\'s mother was\nnot there!"He says very little about himself," Mr."Had it\nnot been for Brinsmade, we should never know that Sherman had his eye on\nhim, and had promoted him.We should never have known of that exploit\nat Chickasaw Bluff.But what a glorious victory was Grant\'s capture of\nVicksburg, on the Fourth of July!I guess we\'ll make short work of the\nRebels now."No, the Judge had not changed much, even in illness.Virginia laid the letter down, and tears started to her eyes as\nshe repressed a retort.It was not the first time this had happened.How strange\nthat, with all his thought of others, he should fall short here!One day, after unusual forbearance, Mrs.Brice had overtaken Virginia\non the stairway.Well she knew the girl\'s nature, and how difficult she\nmust have found repression."My dear," she had said, "you are a wonderful woman."But\nVirginia had driven back to Bellegarde with a strange elation in her\nheart.Some things the Judge had forborne to mention, and for this Virginia was\nthankful.But she had overheard Shadrach telling old\nNancy how Mrs.Brice had pleaded with him to move it, that he might have\nmore room and air.And Colonel Carvel\'s name had\nnever once passed his lips.Many a night the girl had lain awake listening to the steamboats as they\ntoiled against the river\'s current, while horror held her.Horror lest\nher father at that moment be in mortal agony amongst the heaps left by\nthe battle\'s surges; heaps in which, like mounds of ashes, the fire was\nnot yet dead.Fearful tales she had heard in the prison hospitals of\nwounded men lying for days in the Southern sun between the trenches at\nVicksburg, or freezing amidst the snow and sleet at Donelson.What a life had been\nColonel Carvel\'s!Another, and he had lost his fortune, his home, his friends, all that\nwas dear to him.And that daughter, whom he loved best in all the world,\nhe was perchance to see no more.Colfax, yawning, had taken a book and gone to bed.Still Virginia\nsat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the lightning\nquivered across the eastern sky.She heard the crunch of wheels in the\ngravel.A bar of light, peopled by moths, slanted out of the doorway and fell\non a closed carriage."Your cousin Clarence has come home, my dear," he said."He was among\nthe captured at Vicksburg, and is paroled by General Grant."Brinsmade, tell me--all--"\n\n"No, he is not dead, but he is very low.Russell has been kind\nenough to come with me."But they were all there in the light,\nin African postures of terror,--Alfred, and <DW71>, and Mammy Easter, and\nNed.They lifted the limp figure in gray, and carried it into the hall\nchamber, his eyes closed, his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy.Heavily, Virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt.There is little need to dwell on the dark days which followed--Clarence\nhanging between life and death.That his life was saved was due to\nVirginia and to Mammy Easter, and in no particle to his mother.Colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing, until Virginia\nwas driven to desperation, and held a council of war with Dr.Then\nher aunt grew jealous, talked of a conspiracy, and threatened to send\nfor Dr.By spells she wept,\nwhen they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door.She\nwould creep in to him in the night during Mammy Easter\'s watches and\ntalk him into a raging fever.But Virginia slept lightly and took the\nalarm.More than one scene these two had in the small hours, while Ned\nwas riding post haste over the black road to town for the Doctor.By the same trusty messenger did Virginia contrive to send a note to\nMrs.Brice, begging her to explain her absence to Judge Whipple.By day\nor night Virginia did not leave Bellegarde.Polk, while\nwalking in the garden, found the girl fast asleep on a bench, her sewing\non her lap.Would that a master had painted his face as he looked down\nat her!\'Twas he who brought Virginia daily news of Judge Whipple.He had become more querulous\nand exacting with patient Mrs.But often, when he got into his buggy the Doctor found\nthe seat filled with roses and fresh fruit.What Virginia\'s feelings were at this time no one will ever know.God\nhad mercifully given her occupation, first with the Judge, and later,\nwhen she needed it more, with Clarence.It was she whom he recognized\nfirst of all, whose name was on his lips in his waking moments.With\nthe petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away.Unless\nVirginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose.He put his\nhot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours.Then, and only then, did he seem contented.The wonder was that her health did not fail.People who saw her during\nthat fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled.Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came frequently to inquire, was quieted\nbefore her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that\npresence.Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered.Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the\neffects which people saw.And this is why\nwe cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature.It is God who\nchanges,--who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial.Happy,\nthrice happy, those whom He chasteneth.And yet how many are there who\ncould not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.Little by little Clarence mended, until he came to sit out on the porch\nin the cool of the afternoon.Then he would watch for hours the tassels\nstirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond,\nwhile the two women sat by.Colfax\'s headaches came\non, and Virginia was alone with him, he would talk of the war; sometimes\nof their childhood, of the mad pranks they played here at Bellegarde,\nof their friends.Only when Virginia read to him the Northern account of\nthe battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement; and\nhe clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of\nJackson and the fall of Port Hudson.Of love he spoke not a word, and\nnow that he was better he ceased to hold her hand.But often when she\nlooked up from her book, she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon\nher, and a look in them of but one interpretation.The Doctor came but every other day now, in the afternoon.It was his\ncustom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with Virginia,\nhis stout frame filling the rocking-chair.Polk\'s indulgence was\ngossip--though always of a harmless nature: how Mr.Cluyme always\nmanaged to squirm over to the side which was in favor, and how Maude\nCatherwood\'s love-letter to a certain dashing officer of the Confederate\narmy had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful Democrat.It was the Doctor who gave Virginia news of the Judge, and sometimes he\nwould mention Mrs.Then Clarence would raise his head; and once\n(she saw with trepidation) he had opened his lips to speak.One day the Doctor came, and Virginia looked into his face and divined\nthat he had something to tell her.He sat but a few moments, and when he\narose to go he took her hand."I have a favor to beg of you, Jinny," he said, "Judge has lost his\nnurse.Do you think Clarence could spare you for a little while every\nday?Polk continued, somewhat hurriedly for\nhim, "but the Judge cannot bear a stranger near him, and I am afraid to\nhave him excited while in this condition."And Clarence, watching, saw her color\ngo.Polk, "but her son Stephen has come home from the\narmy.He was transferred to Lauman\'s brigade, and then he was wounded."He jangled the keys in his pocket and continued "It seems that he had no\nbusiness in the battle.Johnston in his retreat had driven animals into\nall the ponds and shot them, and in the hot weather the water was soon\npoisoned.Brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made\nthe charge, and he is now in a dreadful condition He is a fine fellow,"\nadded the Doctor, with a sigh, "General Sherman sent a special physician\nto the boat with him.He is--" Subconsciously the Doctor\'s arm sought\nVirginia\'s back, as though he felt her swaying.But he was looking at\nClarence, who had jerked himself forward in his chair, his thin hands\nconvulsively clutching at the arms of it.In his astonishment the Doctor passed his palm across his brow, and for\na moment he did not answer.Virginia had taken a step from him, and was\nstanding motionless, almost rigid, her eyes on his face.he said, repeating the word mechanically; "my God, I hope not.The danger is over, and he is resting easily.If he were not," he said\nquickly and forcibly, "I should not be here."The Doctor\'s mare passed more than one fleet--footed trotter on the\nroad to town that day.And the Doctor\'s black servant heard his master\nutter the word "fool" twice, and with great emphasis.For a long time Virginia stood on the end of the porch, until the\nheaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence\ngaze upon her before she turned to face him."Virginia, sit here a moment; I have something to tell you."She came and took the chair beside him, her heart beating, her breast\nrising and falling.She looked into his eyes, and her own lashes fell\nbefore the hopelessness there But he put out his fingers wasted by\nillness, and she took them in her own.He began slowly, as if every word cost him pain.I cannot remember the time\nwhen I did not love you, when I did not think of you as my wife.All I\ndid when we played together was to try to win your applause.That was my\nnature I could not help it.John moved to the bathroom.Do you remember the day I climbed out on the\nrotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pear--when\nI fell on the roof of Alfred\'s cabin?It was\nbecause you kissed it and cried over me.You are crying now," he said\ntenderly.It isn\'t to make you sad that I am saying this."I have had a great deal of time to think lately, Jinny, I was not\nbrought up seriously,--to be a man.I have been thinking of that day\njust before you were eighteen, when you rode out here.The grapes were purple, and a purple\nhaze was over there across the river.You were\ngrown a woman then, and I was still nothing but a boy.Do you remember\nthe doe coming out of the forest, and how she ran screaming when I tried\nto kiss you?It was true what you said, that I was wild and utterly useless,\nI had never served or pleased any but myself,--and you.I had never\nstudied or worked, You were right when you told me I must learn\nsomething,--do something,--become of some account in the world."Clarence, after what you have done for the South?""Crossed the river and burned\nhouses.Floated down the river on a log\nafter a few percussion caps."And how many had the courage to do that?""Pooh," he said, "courage!If I did not\nhave that, I would send <DW71> to my father\'s room for his ebony box and\nblow my brains out.No, Jinny, I am nothing but a soldier of fortune.I never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure, to\nshirk work.I wanted to go with Walker, you remember.I wanted to distinguish myself," he added with a gesture."But\nthat is all gone now, Jinny.Now\nI see how an earnest life might have won you.She raised her head, frightened, and looked at him searchingly."One day," he said, "one day a good many years ago you and I and Uncle\nComyn were walking along Market Street in front of Judge Whipple\'s\noffice, and a slave auction was going on.A girl was being sold on whom\nyou had set your heart.There was some one in the crowd, a Yankee, who\nbid her in and set her free.He saw her profile, her lips parted, her look far away, She inclined her\nhead."Yes," said her cousin, "so do I remember him.He has crossed my path\nmany times since, Virginia.And mark what I say--it was he whom you\nhad in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of\nmyself, It was Stephen Brice.""I dare anything, Virginia," he answered quietly.And I am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you\nhad in mind.""The impression of him has never left it.Again, that\nnight at the Brinsmades\', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had\nlost you when I got back.He had been there when I was away, and gone\nagain."It was a horrible mistake, Max," she faltered."I was waiting for you\ndown the road, and stopped his horse instead.It--it was nothing--"\n\n"It was fate, Jinny.How I hated that\nman," he cried, "how I hated him?""Yes," he said, "hated!But now--"\n\n"But now?"I have not--I could not tell you before: He\ncame into the place where I was lying in Vicksburg, and they told\nhim that my only chance was to come North, I turned my back upon him,\ninsulted him.Yet he went to Sherman and had me brought home--to you,\nVirginia.If he loves you,--and I have long suspected that he does--"\n\n"Oh, no," she cried, hiding her face "No.""I know he loves you, Jinny," her cousin continued calmly, inexorably.It was a brave\nthing to do, and a generous.He\nthought that he was saving me for you.He was giving up the hope of\nmarrying you himself."Unless you had seen her then, you had never\nknown the woman in her glory."Clarence Colfax, have you known and loved\nme all my life that you might accuse me of this?"Jinny, do you mean it?"In answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that\nwas hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead.Long after she had\ndisappeared in the door he sat staring after her.But later, when Mammy Easter went to call her mistress for supper, she\nfound her with her face buried in the pillows.CHAPTER X. IN JUDGE WHIPPLE\'S OFFICE\n\nAfter this Virginia went to the Judge\'s bedside every day, in the\nmorning, when Clarence took his sleep.She read his newspapers to him\nwhen he was well enough.She read the detested Missouri Democrat, which\nI think was the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with.To have\nher beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than\nshe could bear.Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung\nthe paper out of the window, and left the room."My dear," he said, smiling admiration, "forgive an old bear.A selfish\nold bear, Jinny; my only excuse is my love for the Union.When you are\nnot here, I lie in agony, lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown\nto me, Jinny.And if God sees fit to spare our great country, the day\nwill come when you will go down on your knees and thank Him for the\ninheritance which He saved for your children.You are a good woman, my\ndear, and a strong one.I have hoped that you will see the right.That you will marry a great citizen, one unwavering in his service and\ndevotion to our Republic."The Judge\'s voice trembled with earnestness\nas he spoke.And the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with\nthe sacred fire of his life\'s purpose.Undaunted as her spirit was, she\ncould not answer him then.Once, only once, he said to her: "Virginia, I loved your father better\nthan any man I ever knew.Please God I may see him again before I die."But sometimes at twilight his eyes would\nrest on the black cloth that hid it.Virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud\nupon a life of happiness that was dead and gone.Virginia had not been with Judge Whipple during the critical week after\nStephen was brought home.But Anne had told her that his anxiety was\na pitiful thing to see, and that it had left him perceptibly weaker.So fast that on some days\nVirginia, watching him, would send Ned or Shadrach in hot haste for Dr.At noon Anne would relieve Virginia,--Anne or her mother,--and\nfrequently Mr.For it is those who have\nthe most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds.As the hour\nfor their coming drew near, the Judge would be seeking the clock, and\nscarce did Anne\'s figure appear in the doorway before the question had\narisen to his lips--"And how is my young Captain to-day?"That is what he called him,--"My young Captain."Virginia\'s choice of\nher cousin, and her devotion to him, while seemingly natural enough,\nhad drawn many a sigh from Anne.She thought it strange that Virginia\nherself had never once asked her about Stephen\'s condition and she spoke\nof this one day to the Judge with as much warmth as she was capable of."Jinny\'s heart is like steel where a Yankee is concerned.If her best\nfriend were a Yankee--"\n\nJudge Whipple checked her, smiling."She has been very good to one Yankee I know of," he said.Brice, I believe she worships her.""But when I said that Stephen was much better to-day, she swept out of\nthe room as if she did not care whether he lived or died.""Well, Anne," the Judge had answered, "you women are a puzzle to me.I\nguess you don\'t understand yourselves," he added.That was a strange month in the life of Clarence Colfax,--the last\nof his recovery, while he was waiting for the news of his exchange.Bellegarde was never more beautiful, for Mrs.Colfax had no whim of\nletting the place run down because a great war was in progress.Though\ndevoted to the South, she did not consecrate her fortune to it.Clarence\ngave as much as he could.Whole afternoons Virginia and he would sit in the shaded arbor seat;\nor at the cool of the day descend to the bench on the lower tier of\nthe summer garden, to steep, as it were, in the blended perfumes of the\nroses and the mignonettes and the pinks.Often through the night he pondered on the change in her.But he was troubled to analyze her gravity, her dignity.Was this\nmerely strength of character, the natural result of the trials through\nwhich she had passed, the habit acquired of being the Helper and\ncomforter instead of the helped and comforted?Long years afterward the\nbrightly  portrait of her remained in his eye,--the simple linen\ngown of pink or white, the brown hair shining in the sunlight, the\ngraceful poise of the head.And the background of flowers--flowers\neverywhere, far from the field of war.Sometimes, when she brought his breakfast on a tray in the morning,\nthere was laughter in her eyes.In the days gone by they had been all\nlaughter.He said it over to himself\nmany, many times in the day.He would sit for a space, feasting his eyes\nupon her until she lifted her look to his, and the rich color flooded\nher face.He was not a lover to sit quietly by, was Clarence.And yet,\nas the winged days flew on, that is what he did, It was not that she\ndid not respond to his advances, he did not make them.Was it the chivalry inherited from a long life of Colfaxes who\nwere gentlemen?Something of awe had crept into his feeling\nfor her.As the month wore on, and the time drew near for him to go back to the\nwar, a state that was not quite estrangement, and yet something very\nlike it, set in.Doubts bothered him, and he dared not\ngive them voice.By night he would plan his speeches,--impassioned,\nimploring.To see her in her marvellous severity was to strike him dumb.Whether she loved him, whether she did not love\nhim, she would not give him up.Through the long years of their lives\ntogether, he would never know.He was not a weak man now, was Clarence\nColfax.He was merely a man possessed of a devil, enchained by the power\nof self-repression come upon her whom he loved.And day by day that power seemed to grow more intense,--invulnerable.Among her friends and in the little household it had raised Virginia to\nheights which she herself did not seem to realize.She was become the\nmistress of Bellegarde.Colfax was under its sway, and doubly\nmiserable because Clarence would listen to her tirades no more.Nor had\nshe taken pains to hide the sarcasm in her voice.His answer, bringing with it her remembrance of her husband at certain\ntimes when it was not safe to question him, had silenced her.Addison\nColfax had not been a quiet man."Whenever Virginia is ready, mother," he had replied.He knew in his heart that if he were to ask her permission\nto send for Dr.Posthelwaite to-morrow that she would say yes.Tomorrow\ncame,--and with it a great envelope, an official, answer to Clarence\'s\nreport that he was fit for duty once more.He\nwas to proceed to Cairo, there to await the arrival of the transport\nIndianapolis, which was to carry five hundred officers and men from\nSandusky Prison, who were going back to fight once more for the\nConfederacy.O that they might have seen the North, all those brave men\nwho made that sacrifice.That they might have realized the numbers and\nthe resources and the wealth arrayed against them!It was a cool day for September, a perfect day, an auspicious day, and\nyet it went the way of the others before it.This was the very fulness\nof the year, the earth giving out the sweetness of her maturity, the\ncorn in martial ranks, with golden plumes nodding.The forest still\nin its glory of green.They walked in silence the familiar paths, and\nAlfred, clipping the late roses for the supper table, shook his\nwhite head as they passed him.The sun, who had begun to hurry on his\nsouthward journey, went to bed at six.The few clothes Clarence was to\ntake with him had been packed by Virginia in his bag, and the two were\nstanding in the twilight on the steps of the house, when Ned came around\nthe corner.He called his young mistress by name, but she did not hear\nhim.She started as from a sleep, and paused.He wore that air of mystery so\ndear to darkeys."Gemmen to see you, Miss Jinny."The <DW64> pointed to the lilac shrubbery.said Clarence, sharply: "If a man is\nthere, bring him here at once.""Reckon he won\'t come, Marse Clarence."said Ned, "He fearful skeered ob\nde light ob day.He got suthin very pertickler fo\' Miss Jinny.""No sah--yessah--leastwise I\'be seed \'um.The word was hardly out of his mouth before Virginia had leaped down the\nfour feet from the porch to the flower-bed and was running across the\nlawn toward the shrubbery.Parting the bushes after her, Clarence found\nhis cousin confronting a large man, whom he recognized as the carrier\nwho brought messages from the South."Pa has got through the lines," she said breathlessly."He--he came up\nto see me."He went to Judge Whipple\'s rooms, ma\'am.I\nreckoned you knew it, Miss Jinny," Robinson added contritely."Clarence," she said, "I must go at once.""I will go with you," he said; "you cannot go alone."In a twinkling Ned\nand <DW71> had the swift pair of horses harnessed, and the light carriage\nwas flying over the soft clay road toward the city.Brinsmade\'s place, the moon hung like a great round lantern under\nthe spreading trees about the house.Clarence caught a glimpse of his\ncousin\'s face in the light.She was leaning forward, her gaze fixed\nintently on the stone posts which stood like monuments between the\nbushes at the entrance.Then she drew back again into the dark corner\nof the barouche.She was startled by a sharp challenge, and the carriage\nstopped.Looking out, she saw the provost\'s guard like black card\nfigures on the road, and Ned fumbling for his pass.On they drove into the city streets until the dark bulk of the Court\nHouse loomed in front of them, and Ned drew rein at the little stairway\nwhich led to the Judge\'s rooms.Virginia, leaping out of the carriage,\nflew up the steps and into the outer office, and landed in the Colonel\'s\narms."Why do you risk your life in this way?If the\nYankees catch you--"\n\n"They won\'t catch me, honey," he answered, kissing her.Then he held her\nout at arm\'s length and gazed earnestly into her face.Trembling, she\nsearched his own."I\'m not precisely young, my dear," he said, smiling.His hair was\nnearly white, and his face scared.But he was a fine erect figure of a\nman, despite the shabby clothes he wore, and the mud-bespattered boots."Pa," she whispered, "it was foolhardy to come here."I came to see you, Jinny, I reckon.And when I got home to-night and\nheard Silas was dying, I just couldn\'t resist.He\'s the oldest friend\nI\'ve got in St.Louis, honey and now--now--"\n\n"Pa, you\'ve been in battle?""And you weren\'t hurt; I thank God for that," she whispered.After a\nwhile: "Is Uncle Silas dying?"Polk is in there now, and says that he can\'t last\nthrough the night.Silas has been asking for you, honey, over and over.He says you were very good to him,--that you and Mrs.Brice gave up\neverything to nurse him.""She was here night and day until her son\ncame home.She is a noble woman--"\n\n"Her son?"Silas has done nothing\nthe last half-hour but call his name.He says he must see the boy before\nhe dies.Polk says he is not strong enough to come.""Oh, no, he is not strong enough," cried Virginia.The Colonel looked\ndown at her queerly.She turned hurriedly, glanced around\nthe room, and then peered down the dark stairway.I wonder why he did not follow me up?"Then after a long pause, seeing her father said nothing, she added,\n"Perhaps he was waiting for you to see me alone.I will go down to see\nif he is in the carriage."The Colonel started with her, but she pulled him back in alarm."You will be seen, Pa," she cried.He stayed at the top of the passage, holding open the door that she\nmight have light.When she reached the sidewalk, there was Ned standing\nbeside the horses, and the carriage empty.Fust I seed was a man plump out\'n Willums\'s, Miss Jinny.He was\na-gwine shufflin\' up de street when Marse Clarence put out after him,\npos\' has\'e.She stood for a moment on the pavement in thought, and paused on the\nstairs again, wondering whether it were best to tell her father.Perhaps\nClarence had seen--she caught her breath at the thought and pushed open\nthe door."Oh, Pa, do you think you are safe here?""Why, yes, honey, I\nreckon so," he answered."Ned says he ran after a man who was hiding in an entrance.Pa, I am\nafraid they are watching the place.""I don\'t think so, Jinny.I came here with Polk, in his buggy, after\ndark."Virginia, listening, heard footsteps on the stairs, and seized her\nfather\'s sleeve."Think of the risk you are running, Pa," she whispered.She would have\ndragged him to the closet.Brinsmade entered, and with him a lady veiled.How long\nhe stared at his old friend Virginia could not say.It seemed to her an\neternity.Brice has often told since how straight the Colonel\nstood, his fine head thrown back, as he returned the glance.Brinsmade came forward, with his hand outstretched."Comyn," said he, his voice breaking a little, "I have known you these\nmany years as a man of unstained honor.God will judge whether I have done my duty.""I give\nyou my word of honor as a gentleman that I came into this city for no\nother reason than to see my daughter.And hearing that my old friend was\ndying, I could not resist the temptation, sir--"\n\nMr.How many men do you think would risk their\nlives so, Mrs."Thank God he will now\ndie happy.I know it has been much on his mind.""And in his name, madam,--in the name of my oldest and best friend,--I\nthank you for what you have done for him.I trust that you will allow me\nto add that I have learned from my daughter to respect and admire you.I\nhope that your son is doing well.""He is, thank you, Colonel Carvel.If he but knew that the Judge were\ndying, I could not have kept him at home.Polk says that he must not\nleave the house, or undergo any excitement."Just then the door of the inner room opened, and Dr.Brinsmade, and he patted Virginia."The Judge is still asleep," he said gently."And--he may not wake up in\nthis world."Silently, sadly, they went together into that little room where so\nmuch of Judge Whipple\'s life had been spent.And\nhow completely they filled it,--these five people and the big Rothfield\ncovered with the black cloth.Virginia pressed her father\'s arm as they\nleaned against it, and brushed her eyes.The Doctor turned the wick of\nthe night-lamp.What was that upon the sleeper\'s face from which they drew back?The divine light which is shed upon those\nwho have lived for others, who have denied themselves the lusts of the\nflesh, For a long space, perhaps an hour, they stayed, silent save for\na low word now and again from the Doctor as he felt the Judge\'s heart.Tableaux from the past floated before Virginia\'s eyes.Of the old days,\nof the happy days in Locust Street, of the Judge quarrelling with her\nfather, and she and Captain Lige smiling nearby.And she remembered how\nsometimes when the controversy was finished the Judge would rub his nose\nand say:\n\n"It\'s my turn now, Lige."Whereupon the Captain would open the piano, and she would play the hymn\nthat he liked best.What was it in Silas Whipple\'s nature that courted the pain of memories?What pleasure could it have been all through his illness to look upon\nthis silent and cruel reminder of days gone by forever?She had heard\nthat Stephen Brice had been with the Judge when he had bid it in.She\nwondered that he had allowed it, for they said that he was the only\none who had ever been known to break the Judge\'s will.Virginia\'s\neyes rested on Margaret Brice, who was seated at the head of the bed,\nsmoothing the pillows The strength of Stephen\'s features were in hers,\nbut not the ruggedness.Her features were large, indeed, yet stanch and\nsoftened.The widow, as if feeling Virginia\'s look upon her, glanced up\nfrom the Judge\'s face and smiled at her.The girl  with pleasure,\nand again at the thought which she had had of the likeness between\nmother and son.Still the Judge slept on, while they watched.And at length the thought\nof Clarence crossed Virginia\'s mind.Whispering to her father, she stole out on tiptoe.Descending to the street, she was unable to gain any news of Clarence\nfrom Ned, who was becoming alarmed likewise.Perplexed and troubled, she climbed the stairs again.No sound came from\nthe Judge\'s room Perhaps Clarence would be back at any moment.She sat down to think,--her elbows on the desk\nin front of her, her chin in her hand, her eyes at the level of a line\nof books which stood on end.--Chitty\'s Pleadings, Blackstone, Greenleaf\non Evidence.Absently; as a person whose mind is in trouble, she reached\nout and took one of them down and opened it.Across the flyleaf, in a\nhigh and bold hand, was written the name, Stephen Atterbury Brice.She dropped the book, and, rising abruptly, crossed quickly to the other\nside of the room.Then she turned, hesitatingly, and went back.This was\nhis desk--his chair, in which he had worked so faithfully for the man\nwho lay dying beyond the door.For him whom they all loved--whose last\nhours they were were to soothe.Wars and schisms may part our bodies,\nbut stronger ties unite our souls.Through Silas Whipple, through his\nmother, Virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with Stephen\nBrice.In a thousand ways she was reminded, lest she drive it from her\nbelief.She might marry another, and that would not matter.She sank again into his chair, and gave herself over to the thoughts\ncrowding in her heart.How the threads of his life ran next to hers, and\ncrossed and recrossed them.The slave auction, her dance with him, the\nFair, the meeting at Mr.Brinsmade\'s gate,--she knew them all.Her dreams of him--for she did dream\nof him.And now he had saved Clarence\'s life that she might marry her\ncousin.Again she glanced at the\nsignature in the book, as if fascinated by the very strength of it.She\nturned over a few pages of the book, "Supposing the defendant\'s counsel\nessays to prove by means of--" that was his writing again, a marginal,\nnote.There were marginal notes on every page--even the last was covered\nwith them, And then at the end, "First reading, February, 1858.Bought with some of money obtained by first article\nfor M.That capacity for work, incomparable gift, was what she had\nalways coveted the most.Again she rested her elbows on the desk and her\nchin on her hands, and sighed unconsciously.She had not heard the step on the stair.She did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his\nvoice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.Slowly she raised her face to his, unbelief and wonder in her\neyes,--unbelief and wonder and fright.But\nwhen she met the quality of his look, the grave tenderness of it, she\ntrembled, and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting\nquivered and became a blur.He never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him.She\nherself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person\nexhaled.He needed not to have\nspoken for her to have felt that.She\nknew alone that it was nigh irresistible, and she grasped the back of\nthe chair as though material support might sustain her."Not--not yet, They are waiting for the end."he asked in grave surprise, glancing at the door of the\nJudge\'s room."I am waiting for my cousin," she said.Even as she spoke she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate.Intuition told her that he, too, was\nthinking of that time.Now he had found her at his desk, and, as if that\nwere not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid\nopen at his signature.Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.He was here, and is gone\nsomewhere."He did not seem to take account of the speech.And his silence--goad\nto indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- "You saved him, Mr.I--we\nall--thank you so much.And that is not all I want to say.It is a poor\nenough acknowledgment of what you did,--for we have not always treated\nyou well."Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand\nin pained protest.But she continued: "I shall regard it as a debt I can\nnever repay.It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help\nyou, but I shall pray for that opportunity.""I did nothing, Miss Carvel, nothing that the most unfeeling man in our\narmy would not do.Nothing that I would not have done for the merest\nstranger.""You saved him for me," she said.She turned away from him for\nvery shame, and yet she heard him saying:-- "Yes, I saved him for you."His voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength\nto suffer, to put aside the thought of self.A note to which her soul\nresponded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of\nwoman."Oh, you ought not to have come here to-night."It does not matter much," he answered."I guessed it,--because my mother had left me.""Oh, you ought not to have come!""The Judge has been my benefactor," he answered quietly."I could walk,\nand it was my duty to come."He smiled, "I had no carriage," he said.With the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under\nhim."You must sit down at once," she cried."But I am not tired," he replied."Oh, you must sit down, you must, Captain Brice."He started at the\ntitle, which came so prettily from her lips, "Won\'t you please!"And, as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky, she smiled.He glanced at the book, and the bit of sky was crimson."It is your book," she stammered."I did not know that it was yours\nwhen I took it down.I--I was looking at it while I was waiting for\nClarence.""It is dry reading," he remarked, which was not what he wished to say."And yet--"\n\n"Yes?"The confession had slipped to her\nlips.She was sitting on the edge of his desk, looking down at him.All the will that was left him averted his head.And the seal of honor was upon his speech.And he wondered if man were\never more tempted.Then the evil spread its wings, and soared away into the night.Peace seemed to come upon them both, quieting the\ntumult in their hearts, and giving them back their reason.Respect like\nwise came to the girl,--respect that was akin to awe."My mother has me how faithfully you nursed the Judge, Miss Carvel.It\nwas a very noble thing to do.""Not noble at all," she replied hastily, "your mother did the most of\nit, And he is an old friend of my father--"\n\n"It was none the less noble," said Stephen, warmly, "And he quarrelled\nwith Colonel Carvel.""My father quarrelled with him," she corrected."It was well that I\nshould make some atonement.And yet mine was no atonement, I love Judge\nWhipple.It was a--a privilege to see your mother every day--oh, how\nhe would talk of you!I think he loves you better than any one on this\nearth.""Tell me about him," said Stephen, gently.Virginia told him, and into the narrative she threw the whole of her\npent-up self.How patient the Judge had been, and the joy he had derived\nfrom Stephen\'s letters."You were very good to write to him so often,"\nshe said.It seemed like a dream to Stephen, like one of the many dreams\nof her, the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken.He\ncould not recall a time when she had not been rebellious, antagonistic.And now--as he listened to her voice, with its exquisite low tones and\nmodulations, as he sat there in this sacred intimacy, perchance to be\nthe last in his life, he became dazed.His eyes, softened, with supreme\neloquence cried out that she, was his, forever and forever.The magnetic\nforce which God uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her.Then the door swung open, and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, ran into\nthe room.He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides,\nand his words died on his lips.It was Stephen who rose to meet him, and with her eyes the girl followed\nhis motions.The broad and loosely built frame of the Northerner, his\nshoulders slightly stooping, contrasted with Clarence\'s slighter figure,\nerect, compact, springy.The Southerner\'s eye, for that moment, was\nflint struck with the spark from the steel.Stephen\'s face, thinned by\nillness, was grave.For an instant\nthey stood thus regarding each other, neither offering a hand.It was\nStephen who spoke first, and if there was a trace of emotion in his\nvoice, one who was listening intently failed to mark it."I am glad to see that you have recovered, Colonel Colfax," he said."I should indeed be without gratitude if I did not thank Captain Brice\nfor my life," answered Clarence.She had detected the\nundue accent on her cousin\'s last words, and she glanced apprehensively\nat Stephen."Miss Carvel has already thanked me sufficiently, sir," he said."I am\nhappy to have been able to have done you a good turn, and at the same\ntime to have served her so well.It is\nto her your thanks are chiefly due.I believe that I am not going too\nfar, Colonel Colfax," he added, "when I congratulate you both."Before her cousin could recover, Virginia slid down from the desk and\nhad come between them.How her eyes shone and her lip trembled as she\ngazed at him, Stephen has never forgotten.What a woman she was as she\ntook her cousin\'s arm and made him a curtsey."What you have done may seem a light thing to you, Captain Brice," she\nsaid."That is apt to be the way with those who have big hearts.You\nhave put upon Colonel Colfax, and upon me, a life\'s obligation."When she began to speak, Clarence raised his head.As he glanced,\nincredulous, from her to Stephen, his look gradually softened, and\nwhen she had finished, his manner had become again frank, boyish,\nimpetuous--nay, penitent."Forgive me, Brice," he cried.I--I did you an injustice, and you, Virginia.I was a fool--a\nscoundrel.""No, you were neither," he said.Then upon his face came the smile of\none who has the strength to renounce, all that is dearest to him--that\nsmile of the unselfish, sweetest of all.She was to see it once again, upon the features of one who bore a\ncross,--Abraham Lincoln.Clarence looked, and then he turned away toward\nthe door to the stairway, as one who walks blindly, in a sorrow.His hand was on the knob when Virginia seemed to awake.She flew after\nhim:\n\n"Wait!"Then she raised her eyes, slowly, to Stephen, who was standing\nmotionless beside his chair."My father is in the Judge\'s room," she said."I thought--"\n\n"That he was an officer in the Confederate Army.She took\na step toward him, appealingly."Oh, he is not a spy," she cried."He has given Mr Brinsmade his word\nthat he came here for no other purpose than to see me.Then he heard\nthat the Judge was dying--"\n\n"He has given his word to Mr."Then," said Stephen, "what Mr.Brinsmade sanctions is not for me to\nquestion."She gave him yet another look, a fleeting one which he did not see.Then\nshe softly opened the door and passed into the room of the dying man.As for Clarence, he stood for a space staring\nafter them.Then he went noiselessly down the stairs into the street.LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT\n\nWhen the Judge opened his eyes for the last time in this world, they\nfell first upon the face of his old friend, Colonel Carvel.Twice he\ntried to speak his name, and twice he failed.The third time he said it\nfaintly."Comyn, what are you doing here?"I reckon I came to see you, Silas," answered the Colonel."To see me die," said the Judge, grimly.Colonel Carvel\'s face twitched, and the silence in that little room\nseemed to throb."Comyn," said the Judge again, "I heard that you had gone South to fight\nagainst your country.Can it be that you have at last\nreturned in your allegiances to the flag for which your forefathers\ndied?"Poor Colonel Carvel\n\n"I am still of the same mind, Silas," he said.The Judge turned his face away, his thin lips moving as in prayer.But\nthey knew that he was not praying, "Silas," said Mr.Carvel, "we were\nfriends for twenty years.Let us be friends again, before--"\n\n"Before I die," the Judge interrupted, "I am ready to die.I have had a hard life, Comyn, and few friends.I--I did not know how to make them.Yet no man ever valued those few\nmore than!But," he cried, the stern fire unquenched to the last, "I\nwould that God had spared me to see this Rebellion stamped out.To those watching, his eyes seemed fixed on a\ndistant point, and the light of prophecy was in them."I would that\nGod had spared me to see this Union supreme once more.A high destiny is reserved for this nation--!I think the\nhighest of all on this earth."Amid profound silence he leaned back on\nthe pillows from which he had risen, his breath coming fast.None dared\nlook at the neighbor beside them."Would you not like to see a\nclergyman, Judge?"The look on his face softened as he turned to her."No, madam," he answered; "you are clergyman enough for me.You are near\nenough to God--there is no one in this room who is not worthy to stand\nin the presence of death.Yet I wish that a clergyman were here, that\nhe might listen to one thing I have to say.When I was a boy I worked my\nway down the river to New York, to see the city.He said to me, \'Sit down, my son, I want to talk to you.I said to him, \'No,\nsir, I am not Senator Whipple\'s son.If the\nbishop had wished to talk to me after that, Mrs.Brice, he might have\nmade my life a little easier--a little sweeter.I know that they are not\nall like that.But it was by just such things that I was embittered when\nI was a boy."He stopped, and when he spoke again, it was more slowly,\nmore gently, than any of them had heard him speak in all his life\nbefore."I wish that some of the blessings which I am leaving now had\ncome to me then--when I was a boy.I might have done my little share in\nmaking the world a brighter place to live in, as all of you have done.Yes, as all of you are now doing for me.I am leaving the world with a\nbetter opinion of it than I ever held in life.God hid the sun from me\nwhen I was a little child.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.Margaret Brice," he said, "if I had had such\na mother as you, I would have been softened then.I thank God that He\nsent you when He did."The widow bowed her head, and a tear fell upon his pillow."I have done nothing," she murmured, "nothing.""So shall they answer at the last whom He has chosen," said the Judge."I was sick, and ye visited me.He has promised to remember those who do\nthat.He has\ngiven you a son whom all men may look in the face, of whom you need\nnever be ashamed.Stephen," said the Judge, "come here."Stephen made his way to the bedside, but because of the moisture in his\neyes he saw but dimly the gaunt face.And yet he shrank back in awe at\nthe change in it.So must all of the martyrs have looked when the\nfire of the <DW19>s licked their feet.So must John Bunyan have stared\nthrough his prison bars at the sky.Sandra went back to the garden."Stephen," he said, "you have been faithful in a few things.So shall\nyou be made ruler over many things.The little I have I leave to you,\nand the chief of this is an untarnished name.I know that you will be\ntrue to it because I have tried your strength.Listen carefully to what\nI have to say, for I have thought over it long.In the days gone by our\nfathers worked for the good of the people, and they had no thought of\ngain.A time is coming when we shall need that blood and that bone in\nthis Republic.Wealth not yet dreamed of will flow out of this land, and\nthe waters of it will rot all save the pure, and corrupt all save the\nincorruptible.Half-tried men wilt go down before that flood.You and\nthose like you will remember how your fathers governed,--strongly,\nsternly, justly.Serve your city, serve your state, but above all serve\nyour country."He paused to catch his breath, which was coming painfully now, and\nreached out his bony hand to seek Stephen\'s."I was harsh with you at\nfirst, my son," he went on.And when I had tried\nyou I wished your mind to open, to keep pace with the growth of this\nnation.I sent you to see Abraham Lincoln that you might be born\nagain--in the West.I saw it when you came back--I\nsaw it in your face.O God," he cried, with sudden eloquence."I would\nthat his hands--Abraham Lincoln\'s hands--might be laid upon all who\ncomplain and cavil and criticise, and think of the little things in\nlife: I would that his spirit might possess their spirit!"They marvelled and were awed, for never in all his\ndays had such speech broken from this man."Good-by, Stephen," he said,\nwhen they thought he was not to speak again."Hold the image of Abraham\nLincoln in front of you.You--you are a man after his\nown heart--and--and mine."They started for ward, for his eyes\nwere closed.But presently he stirred again, and opened them."Brinsmade," he said, "Brinsmade, take care of my orphan girls.The <DW64> came forth, shuffling and sobbing, from the doorway."You ain\'t gwine away, Marse Judge?""Yes, Shadrach, good-by.You have served me well, I have left you\nprovided for."Shadrach kissed the hand of whose secret charity he knew so much.Then\nthe Judge withdrew it, and motioned to him to rise.And Colonel Carvel came from the corner where he had\nbeen listening, with his face drawn.You were my friend when there was none other.You were\ntrue to me when the hand of every man was against me.You--you have\nrisked your life to come to me here, May God spare it for Virginia."At the sound of her name, the girl started.And when she kissed him on the forehead, he trembled.Weakly he reached up and put his hands on her shoulders.The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the\nbutton at his throat.There, on a piece of cotton twine, hung a little key, She took it off,\nbut still his hands held her."I have saved it for you, my dear," he said."God bless you--" why did\nhis eyes seek Stephen\'s?--"and make your life happy.Virginia--will you\nplay my hymn--once more--once more?"They lifted the night lamp from the piano, and the medicine.It was\nStephen who stripped it of the black cloth it had worn, who stood by\nVirginia ready to lift the lid when she had turned the lock.The girl\'s\nexaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the well-remembered chords,\nand those who heard were lifted, lifted far above and beyond the power\nof earthly spell."Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom\n        Lead Thou me on\n        The night is dark, and I am far from home;\n        Lead Thou me on.I do not ask to see\n        The distant scene; one step enough for me."A sigh shook Silas Whipple\'s wasted frame, and he died.Brinsmade and the Doctor were the first to leave the little room\nwhere Silas Whipple had lived and worked and died, Mr.Brinsmade bent\nupon one of those errands which claimed him at all times.Virginia sat on, a vague fear haunting her,--a fear\nfor her father\'s safety.These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow,\nremained to torture her.Softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano,\nand opened the door of the outer office.A clock in a steeple near by\nwas striking twelve.Only Stephen\nsaw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out\nlifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the\ndoor.First of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning\ndimly, and the discovery gave her a shock.Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze\nwas held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the\nroom.A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined\nin the semi-darkness, she knew it.She took a step nearer, and a cry\nescaped her.The man was Eliphalet Hopper.He got down from the sill with a motion\nat once sheepish and stealthy.Her breath caught, and instinctively she\ngave back toward the door, as if to open it again."I\'ve got something I want to say to you, Miss\nVirginia."But she\nshivered and paused, horrified at the thought of what she was about to\ndo.Her father was in that room--and Stephen.She must keep them there,\nand get this man away.She must not show fright before him, and yet she\ncould not trust her voice to speak just then.She must not let him know\nthat she was afraid of him--this she kept repeating to herself.Virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him, even\nswiftly, and turn up the gas.He started back, blinking as the\njet flared.For a moment she stood beside it, with her head high;\nconfronting him and striving to steady herself for speech."Judge Whipple--died--to-night."The dominating note in his answer was a whine, as if, in spite of\nhimself, he were awed."I ain\'t here to see the Judge."She felt her\nlips moving, but knew not whether the words had come.The look in his little eyes was the filmy look of\nthose of an animal feasting."I came here to see you," he said, "--you."She was staring at him now,\nin horror."And if you don\'t give me what I want, I cal\'late to see some\none else--in there," said Mr.He smiled, for she was swaying, her lids half closed.By a supreme\neffort she conquered her terror and looked at him.The look was in his\neyes still, intensified now."How dare you speak to me after what has happened!If Colonel\nCarvel were here, he would--kill you."He flinched at the name and the word, involuntarily.He wiped his\nforehead, hot at the very thought.Then,\nremembering his advantage, he stepped close to her."He is here," he said, intense now."He is here, in that there room."Virginia struggled, and yet she refrained from crying\nout."He never leaves this city without I choose.I can have him hung if\nI choose," he whispered, next to her.she cried; "oh, if you choose!"Still his body crept closer, and his face closer."There\'s but one price to pay," he said hoarsely, "there\'s but one price\nto pay, and that\'s you--you.I cal\'late you\'ll marry me now."Delirious at the touch of her, he did not hear the door open.Her senses\nwere strained for that very sound.She heard it close again, and a\nfootstep across the room.She knew the step--she knew the voice, and her\nheart leaped at the sound of it in anger.An arm in a blue sleeve came\nbetween them, and Eliphalet Hopper staggered and fell across the books\non the table, his hand to his face.Towered was the impression that came to Virginia then, and so she\nthought of the scene ever afterward.Small bits, like points of tempered\nsteel, glittered in Stephen\'s eyes, and his hands following up the\nmastery he had given them clutched Mr.Twice Stephen\nshook him so that his head beat upon the table.he cried, but he kept his voice low.And then, as if\nhe expected Hopper to reply: "Shall I kill you?"He turned slowly, and his hands fell from\nMr.Hopper\'s cowering form as his eyes met hers.Even he could not\nfathom the appeal, the yearning, in their dark blue depths.And yet what\nhe saw there made him tremble."He--he won\'t touch me again while you\nare here."Eliphalet Hopper raised himself from the desk, and one of the big books\nfell with a crash to the floor.Then they saw him shrink, his eyes fixed\nupon some one behind them.Before the Judge\'s door stood Colonel Carvel,\nin calm, familiar posture, his feet apart, and his head bent forward as\nhe pulled at his goatee."What is this man doing here, Virginia?"She did not answer\nhim, nor did speech seem to come easily to Mr.Perhaps the sight of Colonel Carvel had brought before him too, vividly\nthe memory of that afternoon at Glencoe.All at once Virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this man\'s\nhands.At a word from him her father would be shot as a spy--and Stephen\nBrice, perhaps, as a traitor.But if Colonel Carvel should learn that he\nhad seized her,--here was the terrible danger of the situation.Well she\nknew what the Colonel would do.She trusted in\nhis coolness that he would not.Before a word of reply came from any of the three, a noise was heard\non the stairway.There followed four seconds\nof suspense, and then Clarence came in.She saw that his face wore a\nworried, dejected look.It changed instantly when he glanced about\nhim, and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out Eliphalet Hopper\nstanding in sullen aggressiveness, beside the table."So you\'re the spy, are you?"Then he turned his\nback and faced his uncle."I saw, him in Williams\'s entry as we drove\nup.He strode to the open window at the back\nof the office, and looked out, There was a roof under it."The sneak got in here," he said."He knew I was waiting for him in the\nstreet.Hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where Stephen had struck\nhim."No, I ain\'t the spy," he said, with a meaning glance at the Colonel."I cal\'late that he knows," Eliphalet replied, jerking his head toward\nColonel Carvel.What\'s to prevent my\ncalling up the provost\'s guard below?"he continued, with a smile that\nwas hideous on his swelling face.It was the Colonel who answered him, very quickly and very clearly.Stephen, who was watching him, could not tell\nwhether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the Colonel\'s\nmouth as he added.Hopper did not move, but his eyes shifted to Virginia\'s form.Stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see\nher.said the Colonel, in the mild voice that\nshould have been an ominous warning.It\nwas clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this; that he had waited\nin the window to deal with Virginia alone.But now the very force of a\ndesire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless.His\nvoice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain."Let\'s be calm about this business, Colonel," he said."We won\'t say\nanything about the past.But I ain\'t set on having you shot.There\'s a\nconsideration that would stop me, and I cal\'late you know what it is."But before he had taken a step Virginia\nhad crossed the room swiftly, and flung herself upon him.The last word came falteringly,\nfaintly."Let me go,--honey," whispered the Colonel, gently.His eyes did not\nleave Eliphalet.[Illustration]\n\n    The Brownies need no ladders long,\n    No hoists, nor elevators strong,\n    To lift them to an upper flight,\n    A window-sill, or transom light.The weather-vane upon the spire,\n    That overlooks the town entire,\n    Is not too high above the base\n    If fancy leads them to the place.\'Tis said the very fleecy clouds\n    They can bestride in eager crowds,\n    Around the world their way to find,\n    And leave the lagging winds behind.Said one: "We\'ve scaled the dizzy heights\n    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,\n    And crossed the stream from shore to shore\n    Where but the string-piece stretched before;\n    And cunning Brownies, never fear,\n    Will find some way to enter here."[Illustration]\n\n    When once the Brownies\' plans were laid,\n    No formal, tiresome speech was made.In mystic ways, to Brownies known,\n    They clambered up the walls of stone.They clung to this and that, like briers,\n    They climbed the smooth electric wires;\n    Some members lending ready aid\n    To those who weaker nerves displayed.And in five minutes at the most,\n    By vine, by bracket, and by post,\n    By every scroll, and carving bold,\n    That toes could touch or fingers hold\n    They made their way, and gained a chance\n    To view, unnoticed, every dance.Said one: "How pleasant is the sight\n    To see those children young and bright\n    While skipping blithely to and fro,\n    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,\n    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,\n    And lightly moving at command--\n\n[Illustration]\n\n        Like butterflies through balmy air\n        When summer spreads attractions fair,\n    And blends with every whispering breeze\n    The drowsy hum of working bees."[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    Another said: "When this is o\'er\n    The Brownie Band will take the floor.We\'ll bide our time and not be slow\n            To take possession when they go.Then up and down the spacious hall\n              We\'ll imitate the steps of all.We\'ll show that not in Frenchmen\'s bones\n              Lies all the grace that nature owns;\n              That others at the waltz can shine\n              As well as Germans from the Rhine;\n            That we some capers can enjoy\n            As well as natives of Savoy."[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n            While thus they talked, the moments flew,\n            And soon the master\'s task was through.When children\'s cloaks were wrapped around,\n    And heavier shoes their feet had found\n    They hastened home; but while they slept\n    The Brownies in that building crept\n    To take their turn at lively reel,\n            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,\n            Till all the dances people know,\n              From Cuba\'s palms to Russia\'s snow\n              Were tried, and soon in every case\n              Were mastered with surprising grace.Imagine how they skipped about,\n              And how they danced, with laugh and shout![Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    No sooner had the Brownies run\n    Into the hall than \'twas begun.Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,\n    The music in the strings awoke.The violins to others fell,\n    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,\n    Until the sweet and stirring air\n    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.Like people in the spring of life,\n    Of joys and countless blessings rife,\n    Who yield themselves to Pleasure\'s hand--\n    So danced that night the Brownie Band.First one would take his place to show\n    The special step for heel or toe,\n    Just how to edge about with care,\n    And help around the partner fair,\n    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--\n    To cause confusion and distress.Then more would play the master\'s part,\n    And give some lessons in the art:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n        Would show the rest some figures new\n        From Turkey, China, or Peru.Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,\n    Then bob around, as if on springs,\n    Until the sprightly steps would call\n    Loud acclamations from them all.They danced in twos with skip and bound,\n    They danced in circles, round and round;\n    They danced in lines that coiled about\n    As runs the serpent in and out,\n    Some moving slow, some standing still--\n    More cutting capers with a will.At length, by joining hand in hand,\n    The set included all the band.A happier crowd was never seen\n    On ball-room floor or village green.By turns they danced, by turns would go\n    And try their skill at string and bow--\n    They almost sawed the fiddle through,\n    So fast the bow across it flew.And louder still the harp would ring,\n    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.Alike they seemed a skillful band\n    Upon the floor or music-stand.The night wore on, from hour to hour,\n    And still they danced with vim and power;\n    For supple-kneed and light of toe\n    The Brownies are, as well you know,\n    And such a thing as tiring out\n    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.As long as darkness hung her pall\n    In heavy folds around the hall,\n    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,\n    Until the very break of day.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    To dance the figures o\'er and o\'er,\n    They lingered on the polished floor;\n    No sooner was one party done\n    Than others the position won.They chose their partners for the set,\n    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    As night advanced, and morning gray\n    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,\n    The lively Brownies faster flew,\n    Across and back, around and through;\n    Now down the center, up the side,\n    Then back to place with graceful glide--\n                  Until it seemed that even day\n                  Would hardly drive the band away.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                  At length some, more upon their guard\n                  Against surprises, labored hard\n    To urge their comrades from the place\n    Before the sun would show his face.They pulled and hauled with all their might\n    At those half crazy with delight,\n                  Who still would struggle for a chance\n                  To have, at least, another dance--\n                  Some figure that was quite forgot,\n                          Although "the finest of the lot."Another wished to linger still--\n                          In spite of warning words--until\n                          Each member present on the floor\n                          Had been his partner twice or more.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes\n                Of morn began to paint the skies,\n                And, one by one, the stars of night\n                Grew pale before the morning\'s light.Alone, bright Venus, in the west,\n                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;\n                While from the hedge the piping note\n                Of waking birds began to float;\n    And crows upon the wooded hills\n    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,\n    When Brownies scampered from the place,\n    And undertook the homeward race.Nor made a halt in street or square,\n    Or verdant park, however fair;\n    But farther from the sight of man\n    And light of day, they quickly ran.They traveled at their highest speed,\n    And swiftly must they go, indeed;\n    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,\n    The rays of light began to steal\n    Still higher up the eastern sky,\n    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES\' CANDY-PULL.[Illustration]\n\n    One evening, while the Brownies sat\n    Enjoying free and friendly chat,\n    Some on the trees, some on the ground,\n    And others perched on fences round--\n    One Brownie, rising in his place,\n    Addressed the band with beaming face.The listeners gathered with delight\n    Around the member, bold and bright,\n    To hear him tell of scenes he\'d spied\n    While roaming through the country wide."Last eve," said he, "to shun the blast,\n    Behind a cottage fence I passed.While there, I heard a merry rout,\n    And as the yard was dark without,\n    I crawled along through weeds and grass,\n    Through melon-vines and broken glass,\n    Until I might, unnoticed, win\n    A glimpse of all the sport within.At length, below the window-pane,\n                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;\n                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind\n                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find\n    The facts I can relate in full\n    About that lively candy-pull.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    "An hour or more, I well believe,\n    I stood, their actions to perceive,\n    With elbows resting on the sill,\n    And nose against the window still.I watched them closely at their fun,\n    And learned how everything was done.The younger members took the lead,\n    And carried on the work with speed.With nimble feet they ran about\n    From place to place, with laugh and shout;\n    But older heads looked on the while,\n    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,\n    And gave advice in manner kind\n    To guide the inexperienced mind.They placed the sugar in a pot,\n    And stirred it round till boiling hot;\n    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,\n    And stretched it out in shining bands,\n    Until it reached across the floor,\n    From mantel-piece to kitchen door."These eyes of mine for many a night\n    Have not beheld a finer sight.To pull the candy was the part\n    Of some who seemed to know the art.The moon had slipped behind the hill,\n    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;\n    But still, with nose against the pane,\n    I kept my place through wind and rain.There, perched upon the shaky pile,\n    With bated breath I gazed the while.I watched them with the sharpest sight\n    That I might tell the tale aright;\n    For all the active youngsters there\n    Appeared to have of work their share.Some put fresh sugar in the pot,\n    Some kept the fire blazing hot,\n    And worked away as best they could\n    To keep the stove well filled with wood.Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,\n    At moving here and there at will,\n    Would have to \'lively\' be and \'tear\n    Around\' to beat those children there!Some cut it up, more passed it round,\n    While others ate it by the pound!"[Illustration]\n\n    At this, a murmur of surprise\n    On every side began to rise;\n    Then smiles o\'er every visage flitted,\n    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,\n    That told what train of thought had sped\n    At once through every Brownie\'s head--\n    A thought of pleasure near at hand\n    That well would suit the cunning band.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n            The Brownies act without delay\n            When new ideas cross their way,\n            And soon one raised a finger small\n            And close attention gained from all.They crowded near with anxious glance\n            To learn what scheme he could advance--\n    What methods mention or employ\n    To bring about the promised joy.Said he: "A vacant house is near.The owner leaves it every year\n    For several months, and pleasure seeks\n    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.The range is there against the wall,\n            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,\n            While cans of syrup may be found\n            In every grocer\'s store around.The Brownie must be dull and tame,\n            And scarce deserves to bear the name,\n            Who will not join with heart and hand\n            To carry out a scheme so grand."[Illustration]\n\n    Another cried: "When to his bed\n    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,\n    Again we\'ll muster in full force\n    And to that building turn our course."[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n            Next eve they gained the street at last\n            That through the silent city passed;\n            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised\n            And on the vacant mansion gazed.In vain the miser hides his store,\n    In vain the merchant bars his door,\n    In vain the locksmith changes keys--\n    The Brownies enter where they please.Through iron doors, through gates of brass,\n    And walls of stone they safely pass,\n    And smile to think how soon they can\n    Upset the studied schemes of man.Within that house, without delay,\n    Behind the guide they worked their way,\n    More happy far and full of glee\n    Than was the owner, out at sea.The whale, the shark, or fish that flies\n    Had less attraction for his eyes\n    Than had the shining candy-balls\n    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.Soon coal was from the cellar brought\n    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;\n    Then pots and pans came rattling in\n    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.Just where the syrup had been found\n    It matters not.The cunning band was soon possessed\n    Of full supplies and of the best;\n    Next tablespoons of silver fine\n    In every hand appeared to shine,\n    And ladles long, of costly ware,\n    That had been laid away with care.No sooner was the syrup hot\n    Than some around the kettle got,\n    And dabbed away in eager haste\n    To be the first to get a taste.Then some were scalded when the spoon\n    Let fall its contents all too soon,\n            And gave the tongue too warm a mess\n            To carry without some distress.Then steps were into service brought\n            That dancing-masters never taught,\n            And smothered cries and swinging hand\n            Would wake the wonder of the band.And when the candy boiled until\n            It could be pulled and hauled at will,\n    Take every shape or twist, and seem\n    As free as fancy in a dream,\n    The busy, happy-hearted crew\n    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.Mary went to the hallway.The Brownies in the building stayed\n    And candy ate as fast as made.But when at length the brightening sky\n    Gave warning they must homeward fly,\n    They quickly sought the open air\n    And had but little time to spare.The shortest way, as often found,\n    Was o\'er the roughest piece of ground,\n    Where rocks as large as houses lay\n    All scattered round in wild array.Some covered o\'er with clinging vines,\n    Some bearing up gigantic pines,\n    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,\n    For centuries had stood the blast.But over all the rugged ground\n    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,\n    Now jumping clear from block to block,\n    Now sliding down the shelving rock,\n    Or cheering on the lagging kind\n    Who here and there would fall behind.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTHE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                One night the Brownies found their way\n                To where some tracks and switches lay,\n                And buildings stood, such as are found\n    In every town on railroad ground.They moved about from place to place,\n    With prying eyes and cautious pace\n    They peeped in shops and gained a view,\n    Where cars were standing bright and new;\n    While others, that had service known,\n    And in some crash were overthrown,\n    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,\n    Were undergoing full repairs.The table that turns end for end\n            Its heavy load, without a bend,\n            Was next inspected through and through\n            And tested by the wondering crew.They scanned the signal-lights with care\n            That told the state of switches there,--\n            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,\n            Or simply to some siding led.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                Then round a locomotive strong\n                They gathered in an earnest throng,\n                Commenting on the style it showed,\n                Its strength and speed upon the road.Said one: "That \'pilot\' placed before\n                Will toss a cow a block or more;\n            You\'d hardly find a bone intact\n            When such a thing her frame has racked--\n            Above the fence, and, if you please,\n            Above the smoke-stack and the trees\n            Will go the horns and heels in air,\n            When hoisted by that same affair.""Sometimes it saves," another cried,\n            "And throws an object far aside\n            That would to powder have been ground,\n            If rushing wheels a chance had found.I saw a goat tossed from the track\n            And landed on a farmer\'s stack,\n            And though surprised at fate so strange,\n            He seemed delighted at the change;\n            And lived content, on best of fare,\n            Until the farmer found him there."Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.Another said: "We\'ll have some fun\n    And down the road this engine run.The steam is up, as gauges show;\n    She\'s puffing, ready now to go;\n    The fireman and the engineer\n    Are at their supper, in the rear\n    Of yonder shed.I took a peep,\n    And found the watchman fast asleep.So now\'s our time, if we but haste,\n    The joys of railway life to taste.I know the engine-driver\'s art,\n    Just how to stop, reverse, and start;\n    I\'ve watched them when they little knew\n    From every move I knowledge drew;\n    We\'ll not be seen till under way,\n    And then, my friends, here let me say,\n    The man or beast will something lack\n    Who strives to stop us on the track."Then some upon the engine stepped,\n    And some upon the pilot crept,\n    And more upon the tender found\n    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled\n    At speed \'twas fearful to behold;\n    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,\n    At least at mile-a-minute rate;\n    And even where the curves were short\n    The engine turned them with a snort\n    That made the Brownies\' hearts the while\n    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run\n    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out\n    To choke with dust that whirled about,\n    And so could neither growl nor bark\n    Till they had vanished in the dark;\n    Some pigs that wandered late at night,\n    And neither turned to left nor right,\n        But on the crossing held debate\n        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,\n        Were helped above the fence to rise\n        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,\n        And never after cared to stray\n        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n        But when a town was just in sight,\n        And speed was at its greatest height,--\n        Alas!that such a thing should be,--\n        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go\n                        Into the weeds and ditch below;\n                        But many on the engine stayed\n                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall\n                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,\n                        And brakes to every wheel applied;\n                        The locomotive forward flew,\n                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place\n                Where trouble met them face to face,\n    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,\n    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,\n    The automatic switch was closed,\n    A safety signal-light exposed,\n    And they were free to roll ahead,\n    And wait for those who\'d leaped in dread;\n    Although the end seemed near at hand\n    Of every Brownie in the band,\n    And darkest heads through horrid fright\n    Were in a moment changed to white,\n    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,\n    And some were sprained about the toes,\n    While more were scraped upon the nose;\n    But all were able to succeed\n    In climbing to a place with speed,\n    And there they stayed until once more\n    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side\n    The Brownies scampered off to hide;\n    And as they crossed the trestle high\n    The sun was creeping up the sky,\n    And urged them onward in their race\n    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTHE BROWNIES\' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]\n\n    It was the season of the year\n    When people, dressed in fancy gear,\n    From every quarter hurried down\n    And filled the largest halls in town;\n    And there to flute and fiddle sweet\n    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note\n    That fun indeed was now afloat;\n    And ere the season passed away,\n    Of longest night and shortest day,\n    They looked about to find a hall\n    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found\n    Where all the band can troop around;\n    But want of costumes, much I fear,\n    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--\n    Don\'t show a weak and hopeless mind\n    Because your knowledge is confined,--\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    For I\'m prepared to take the band\n    To costumes, ready to the hand,\n    Of every pattern, new or old:\n    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,\n    The cloak and plume of belted knight,\n    The pilgrim\'s hat and stockings white,\n    The dresses for the ladies fair,\n    The gems and artificial hair,\n    The soldier-suits in blue and red,\n    The turban for the Tartar\'s head,\n    All can be found where I will lead,\n    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]\n\n    Those knowing best the Brownie way\n    Will know there was no long delay,\n    Ere to the town he made a break\n    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,\n    That hills were high or winds were strong;\n    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,\n    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    The costumes, though a world too wide,\n    And long enough a pair to hide,\n    Were gathered in with skill and care,\n    That showed the tailor\'s art was there.Then out they started for the hall,\n    In fancy trappings one and all;\n    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;\n    And some like kings; and more like clowns;\n    And Highlanders, with naked knees;\n    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;\n    While many members in the line\n    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,\n    And swept along the polished floor\n    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]\n\n    By happy chance some laid their hand\n    Upon the outfit of a band;\n    The horns and trumpets took the lead,\n    Supported well by string and reed;\n    And violins, that would have made\n    A mansion for the rogues that played,\n    With flute and clarionet combined\n    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see\n    They passed the hours in greatest glee;\n    Familiar figures all were lost\n    In flowing robes that round them tossed;\n    And well-known faces hid behind\n    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,\n    Enjoyed a light fandango there;\n    While solemn monks of gentle heart,\n    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,\n                The bobbing up and down, like birds,\n                The lively skip, the stately glide,\n                The double turn, and twist aside\n                Were introduced in proper place\n                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,\n    Too long they tarried in the hall,\n    And morning caught them on the fly,\n    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,\n            By walls and stumps they made their way;\n            And not until the evening\'s shade\n            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTHE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]\n\n    While Brownies strayed along a pier\n    To view the shipping lying near,\n    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;\n    \'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red\n    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,\n    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she\'s on the go;\n    Now with a laden scow in tow,\n    And next with barges two or three,\n    Then taking out a ship to sea,\n    Or through the Narrows steaming round\n    In search of vessels homeward bound;\n    She\'s stanch and true from stack to keel,\n    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,\n    The men went up to see a show,\n    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,\n    We\'ll crowd on board without delay\n    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,\n    Because she bears the \'Brownie\' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east\n    We\'ll know about her speed at least,\n    And prove how such a craft behaves\n    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I\'ll take my stand\n    And steer her round with skillful hand,\n    Now down the river, now around\n    The bay, or up the broader sound;\n    Throughout the trip I\'ll keep her clear\n    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,\n    Or starboard make a sudden swing,\n    The Band can rest as free from dread\n    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,\n    I\'ve boxed a compass, if you please,\n    And so can steer her east or west,\n    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars\n    Or light-house lamps, I\'ll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,\n    Or sou\'-sou\'-west the \'pig-wind\' blows,\n    As hardy sailors call the gale\n    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you\'re smart\n    And understand the pilot\'s art,\n    But more than one a hand should take,\n    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,\n    And all the skill a crew commands,\n    How oft collisions crush the keel\n    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay\n    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,\n    At anchor in the channel ride\n    For us to show ourselves unwise\n    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear\n    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,\n    While many Brownies, young and old,\n    From upper deck to lower hold\n    Were crowding round in happy vein\n    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;\n    Some stayed below to shovel coal,\n    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,\n    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,\n    More to the pilot-house would race\n    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,\n    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,\n    However well we watch and ward,\n    And vessels often go to wreck\n    With careful captains on the deck;\n    They had mishaps that night, for still,\n    In spite of all their care and skill,\n    While running straight or turning round\n    In river, bay, or broader sound,\n    At times they ran upon a rock,\n    And startled by the sudden shock\n    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,\n    Would spring at once across the rail;\n    And then, repenting, find all hope\n    Of life depended on a rope,\n    That willing hands were quick to throw\n    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran\n    For peace of mind; again, their plan\n    Would come to naught through lengthy tow\n    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay\n    At times occasioned some dismay--\n    They took them for torpedoes dread\n    That might the boat in fragments spread,\n    Awake the city\'s slumbering crowds,\n    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared\n    Now here, now there, the boat was steered\n    With many joys and many fears,\n    That some will bear in mind for years;\n    But at her pier once more she lay\n    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES\' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    As shades of evening closed around,\n        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,\n        Looked out to view with staring eye\n        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,\n    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,\n    Now rumbling o\'er an arching bridge,\n    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,\n    Now wheeling out again in view\n    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout\n    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,\n    The prancing horses, and the crowd\n                    Of people perched so high in air\n                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see\n    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I\'m the one, here let me say,']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['He at once said it was\nan act of kindness which he had never expected, and for which he was\ntruly grateful; and he unhesitatingly pronounced his belief that Allah\nand his Prophet would requite my kindness by bringing me safely through\nthe remainder of the war.I thanked my prisoner for his good wishes and\nhis prayers, and made him the only return in my power, viz., to cause\nhis hands to be unfastened to allow him to perform his evening\'s\ndevotions, and permitted him as much freedom as I possibly could,\nconsistent with safe custody.His fellow-prisoner merely received my\nkindness with a scowl of sullen hatred, and when reproved by his master,\nI understood him to say that he wished for no favour from infidel dogs;\nbut he admitted that the sergeant _sahib_, deserved a Mussulman\'s\ngratitude for saving him from an application of pig\'s fat.After allowing my prisoners to perform their evening devotions, and\ngiving them such freedom as I could, I made up my mind to go without\nsleep that night, for it would have been a serious matter for me if\neither of these men had escaped.I also knew that by remaining on watch\nmyself I could allow them more freedom, and I determined they should\nenjoy every privilege in my power for what would certainly be their last\nnight on earth, since it was doubtful if they would be spared to see\nthe sun rise.With this view, I sent for one of the Mahommedan\nshopkeepers from the regimental bazaar, and told him to prepare at my\nexpense whatever food the prisoners would eat.To this the man replied\nthat since I, a Christian, had shown so much kindness to a Mussulman in\ndistress, the Mahommedan shopkeepers in the bazaar would certainly be\nuntrue to their faith if they should allow me to spend a single _pie_,\nfrom my own pocket.After being supplied with a savoury meal from the bazaar, followed by a\nfragrant hookah, to both of which he did ample justice, Jamie Green\nsettled himself on a rug which had been lent to him, and said "_Shook\'r\nKhooda!_, (Thanks be to God)," for having placed him under the charge of\nsuch a merciful _sahib_, for this the last night of his life!"Such," he\ncontinued, "has been my _kismut_, and doubtless Allah will reward you,\nSergeant _sahib_, in his own good time for your kindness to his\noppressed and afflicted servant.You have asked me to give you some\naccount of my life, and if it is really true that I am a spy.With\nregard to being a spy in the ordinary meaning of the term, I most\nemphatically deny the accusation.I am no spy; but I am an officer of\nthe Begum\'s army, come out from Lucknow to gain reliable information of\nthe strength of the army and siege-train being brought against us.I am\nthe chief engineer of the army of Lucknow, and came out on a\nreconnoitring expedition, but Allah has not blessed my enterprise.I\nintended to have left on my return to Lucknow this evening, and if fate\nhad been propitious, I would have reached it before sunrise to-morrow,\nfor I had got all the information which was wanted; but I was tempted to\nvisit Oonao once more, being on the direct road to Lucknow, because I\nwas anxious to see whether the siege-train and ammunition-park had\ncommenced to move, and it was my misfortune to encounter that son of a\ndefiled mother who denounced me as a spy.A contemptible wretch who, to\nsave his own neck from the gallows (for he first sold the English), now\nwishes to divert attention from his former rascality by selling the\nlives of his own countrymen and co-religionists; but Allah is just, he\nwill yet reap the reward of his treachery in the fires of Jehunnum.John went back to the office.[41]\n\n"You ask me," continued the man, "what my name is, and state that you\nintend to write an account of my misfortune to your friends in Scotland.The people of England,--and by England I mean\nScotland as well--are just, and some of them may pity the fate of this\nservant of Allah.I have friends both in London and in Edinburgh, for I\nhave twice visited both places.I belong to\none of the best families of Rohilcund, and was educated in the Bareilly\nCollege, and took the senior place in all English subjects.From\nBareilly College I passed to the Government Engineering College at\nRoorkee, and studied engineering for the Company\'s service, and passed\nout the senior student of my year, having gained many marks in excess of\nall the European pupils, both civil and military.I was nominated to the rank of _jemadar_, of the Company\'s\nengineers, and sent to serve with a company on detached duty on the hill\nroads as a native commissioned officer, but actually subordinate to a\nEuropean sergeant, a man who was my inferior in every way, except,\nperhaps, in mere brute strength, a man of little or no education, who\nwould never have risen above the grade of a working-joiner in England.Like most ignorant men in authority, he exhibited all the faults of the\nEuropeans which most irritate and disgust us, arrogance, insolence, and\nselfishness.Unless you learn the language of my countrymen, and mix\nwith the better-educated people of this country, you will never\nunderstand nor estimate at its full extent the mischief which one such\nman does to your national reputation.One such example is enough to\nconfirm all that your worst enemies can say about your national\nselfishness and arrogance, and makes the people treat your pretensions\nto liberality and sympathy as mere hypocrisy.I had not joined the\nCompany\'s service from any desire for wealth, but from the hope of\ngaining honourable service; yet on the very threshold of that service I\nmet with nothing but disgrace and dishonour, having to serve under a man\nwhom I hated, yea, worse than hated, whom I despised.I wrote to my\nfather, and requested his permission to resign, and he agreed with me\nthat I the descendant of princes, could not serve the Company under\nconditions such as I have described.I resigned the service and returned\nhome, intending to offer my services to his late Majesty\nNussir-ood-Deen, King of Oude; but just when I reached Lucknow I was\ninformed that his Highness Jung Bahadoor of Nepal, who is now at\nGoruckpore with an army of Goorkhas coming to assist in the loot of\nLucknow, was about to visit England, and required a secretary well\nacquainted with the English language.I at once applied for the post,\nand being well backed by recommendations both from native princes and\nEnglish officials, I secured the appointment, and in the suite of the\nMaharaja I landed in England for the first time, and, among other\nplaces, we visited Edinburgh, where your regiment, the Ninety-Third\nHighlanders, formed the guard of honour for the reception of his\nHighness.Little did I think when I saw a kilted regiment for the first\ntime, that I should ever be a prisoner in their tents in the plains of\nHindustan; but who can predict or avoid his fate?"Well, I returned to India, and filled several posts at different native\ncourts till 1854, when I was again asked to visit England in the suite\nof Azeemoolla Khan, whose name you must have often heard in connection\nwith this mutiny and rebellion.On the death of the Peishwa, the Nana\nhad appointed Azeemoolla Khan to be his agent.He, like myself, had\nreceived a good education in English, under Gunga Deen, head-master of\nthe Government school at Cawnpore.Azeemoolla was confident that, if he\ncould visit England, he would be able to have the decrees of Lord\nDalhousie against his master reversed, and when I joined him he was\nabout to start for England, well supplied with money to engage the best\nlawyers, and also to bribe high officials, if necessary.But I need not\ngive you any account of our mission.You already know that, so far as\nLondon drawing-rooms went, it proved a social success, but as far as\ngaining our end a political failure; and we left England after spending\nover L50,000, to return to India _via_ Constantinople in 1855.From\nConstantinople we visited the Crimea, where we witnessed the assault and\ndefeat of the English on the 18th of June, and were much struck by the\nwretched state of both armies in front of Sebastopol.Thence we returned\nto Constantinople, and there met certain real or pretended Russian\nagents, who made large promises of material support if Azeemoolla could\nstir up a rebellion in India.It was then that I and Azeemoolla formed\nthe resolution of attempting to overthrow the Company\'s Government, and,\n_Shook\'r Khooda!_ we have succeeded in doing that; for from the\nnewspapers which you lent me, I see that the Company\'s _raj_ has gone,\nand that their charter for robbery and confiscation will not be renewed.Although we have failed to wrest the country from the English, I hope we\nhave done some good, and that our lives will not be sacrificed in vain;\nfor I believe direct government under the English parliament will be\nmore just than was that of the Company, and that there is yet a future\nbefore my oppressed and downtrodden countrymen, although I shall not\nlive to see it."I do not speak, _sahib_, to flatter you or to gain your favour.I have\nalready gained that, and I know that you cannot help me any farther than\nyou are doing, and that if you could, your sense of duty would not let\nyou.I know I must die; but the unexpected kindness which you have shown\nto me has caused me to speak my mind.I came to this tent with hatred in\nmy heart, and curses on my lips; but your kindness to me, unfortunate,\nhas made me, for the second time since I left Lucknow, ashamed of the\natrocities committed during this rebellion.The first time was at\nCawnpore a few days ago, when Colonel Napier of the Engineers was\ndirecting the blowing up of the Hindoo temples on the Cawnpore _ghat_,\nand a deputation of Hindoo priests came to him to beg that the temples\nmight not be destroyed.\'Now, listen to me,\' said Colonel Napier in\nreply to them; \'you were all here when our women and children were\nmurdered, and you also well know that we are not destroying these\ntemples for vengeance, but for military considerations connected with\nthe safety of the bridge of boats.But if any man among you can prove to\nme that he did a single act of kindness to any Christian man, woman, or\nchild, nay, if he can even prove that he uttered one word of\nintercession for the life of any one of them, I pledge myself to spare\nthe temple where he worships.\'I was standing in the crowd close to\nColonel Napier at the time, and I thought it was bravely spoken.There\nwas no reply, and the cowardly Brahmins slunk away.Napier gave the\nsignal and the temples leaped into the air; and I was so impressed with\nthe justness of Napier\'s remarks that I too turned away, ashamed."On this I asked him, "Were you in Cawnpore when the Mutiny broke out?"To which he replied: "No, thank God!I was in my home in Rohilcund; and\nmy hands are unstained by the blood of any one, excepting those who have\nfallen in the field of battle.I knew that the storm was about to burst,\nand had gone to place my wife and children in safety, and I was in my\nvillage when I heard the news of the mutinies at Meerut and Bareilly.I\nimmediately hastened to join the Bareilly brigade, and marched with them\nfor Delhi.There I was appointed engineer-in-chief, and set about\nstrengthening the defences by the aid of a party of the Company\'s\nengineers which had mutinied on the march from Roorkee to Meerut.I\nremained in Delhi till it was taken by the English in September.I then\nmade my way to Lucknow with as many men as I could collect of the\nscattered forces.We first marched to Muttra, where we were obliged to\nhalt till I threw a bridge of boats across the Jumna for the retreat of\nthe army.We had still a force of over thirty thousand men under the\ncommand of Prince Feroz Shah and General Bukht Khan.As soon as I\nreached Lucknow I was honoured with the post of chief-engineer.I was in\nLucknow in November when your regiment assisted to relieve the\nResidency.Mary moved to the bathroom.I saw the horrible slaughter in the Secundrabagh.I had\ndirected the defences of that place the night before, and was looking\non from the Shah Nujeef when you assaulted it.I had posted over three\nthousand of the best troops in Lucknow in the Secundrabagh, as it was\nthe key to the position, and not a man escaped.I nearly fainted; my\nliver turned to water when I saw the green flag pulled down, and a\nHighland bonnet set up on the flag-staff which I had erected the night\nbefore.I knew then that all was over, and directed the guns of the Shah\nNujeef to open fire on the Secundrabagh.Since then I have planned and\nsuperintended the construction of all the defensive works in and around\nLucknow.You will see them when you return, and if the sepoys and\nartillerymen stand firmly behind them, many of the English army will\nlose the number of their mess, as you call it, before you again become\nmasters of Lucknow."I then asked him if it was true that the man he had called Micky on our\nfirst acquaintance had been one of the men employed by the Nana to\nbutcher the women and children at Cawnpore in July?To this he replied:\n"I believe it is true, but I did not know this when I employed him; he\nwas merely recommended to me as a man on whom I could depend.If I had\nknown then that he was a murderer of women and children, I should have\nhad nothing to do with him, for it is he who has brought bad luck on me;\nit is my _kismut_, and I must suffer.John journeyed to the hallway.Your English proverb says, \'You\ncannot touch pitch and escape defilement,\' and I must suffer; Allah is\njust.It is the conduct of wretches such as these that has brought the\nanger of Allah on our cause."On this I asked him if he knew whether\nthere was any truth in the report of the European women having been\ndishonoured before being murdered."_Sahib_," he replied, "you are a\nstranger to this country or you would not ask such a question.Any one\nwho knows anything of the customs of this country and the strict rules\nof caste, knows that all such stories are lies, invented to stir up\nrace-hatred, as if we had not enough of that on both sides already.That\nthe women and children were cruelly murdered I admit, but not one of\nthem was dishonoured; and all the sentences written on the walls of the\nhouses in Cawnpore, such as, \'We are at the mercy of savages, who have\nravished young and old,\' and such like, which have appeared in the\nIndian papers and been copied from them into the English ones, are\nmalicious forgeries, and were written on the walls after the\nre-occupation of Cawnpore by General Outram\'s and Havelock\'s forces.Although I was not there myself, I have spoken with many who were there,\nand I know that what I tell you is true."I then asked him if he could give me any idea of the reason that had led\nthe Nana to order the commission of such a cold-blooded, cowardly crime."Asiatics," he said, "are weak, and their promises are not to be relied\non, but that springs more from indifference to obligations than from\nprearranged treachery.When they make promises, they intend to keep\nthem; but when they find them inconvenient, they choose to forget them.And so it was, I believe, with the Nana Sahib.He intended to have\nspared the women and children, but they had an enemy in his _zenana_ in\nthe person of a female fiend who had formerly been a slave-girl, and\nthere were many about the Nana (Azeemoolla Khan for one) who wished to\nsee him so irretrievably implicated in rebellion that there would be no\npossibility for him to draw back.So this woman was powerfully supported\nin her evil counsel, and obtained permission to have the English ladies\nkilled; and after the sepoys of the Sixth Native Infantry and the Nana\'s\nown guard had refused to do the horrible work, this woman went and\nprocured the wretches who did it.This information I have from General\nTantia Topee, who quarrelled with the Nana on this same matter.What I\ntell you is true: the murder of the European women and children at\nCawnpore was a woman\'s crime, for there is no fiend equal to a female\nfiend; but what cause she had for enmity against the unfortunate ladies\nI don\'t know--I never inquired."Those of my readers who were in India at the time may remember that\nsomething about this slave-girl was said in all the native evidence\ncollected at the time on the subject of the Cawnpore massacre.I next asked Mahomed Ali Khan if he knew whether there was any truth in\nthe stories about General Wheeler\'s daughter having shot four or five\nmen with a revolver, and then leaped into the well at Cawnpore."All\nthese stories," was his answer, "are pure inventions with no foundation\nof truth.General Wheeler\'s daughter is still alive, and is now in\nLucknow; she has become a Mussulmanee, and has married according to\nMahommedan law the man who protected her; whether she may ever return to\nher own people I know not."In such conversation I passed the night with my prisoner, and towards\ndaybreak I permitted him to perform his ablutions and morning devotions,\nafter which he once more thanked me, and prayed that Allah might reward\nme for my kindness to His oppressed servant.Once, and only once, did he\nshow any weakness, in alluding to his wife and two boys in their faraway\nhome in Rohilcund, when he remarked that they would never know the fate\nof their unfortunate father.But he at once checked himself, saying, "I\nhave read French history as well as English; I must remember Danton, and\nshow no weakness."He then produced a gold ring which was concealed\namong his hair, and asked me if I would accept it and keep it in\nremembrance of him, in token of his gratitude.It was, he said, the only\nthing he could give me, as everything of value had been taken from him\nwhen he was arrested.He went on to say that the ring in question was\nonly a common one, not worth more than ten rupees, but that it had been\ngiven to him by a holy man in Constantinople as a talisman, though the\ncharm had been broken when he had joined the unlucky man who was his\nfellow-prisoner.I accepted the ring, which he placed on my finger with\na blessing and a prayer for my preservation, and he told me to look on\nit and remember Mahomed Khan when I was in front of the fortifications\nof Lucknow, and no evil would befall me.He had hardly finished speaking\nwhen a guard from the provost-marshal came with an order to take over\nthe prisoners, and I handed this man over with a sincere feeling of pity\nfor his fate.Immediately after, I received orders that the division would march at\nsunrise for Lucknow, and that my party was to join the rear-guard, after\nthe ammunition-park and siege-train had moved on.The sun was high in\nthe heavens before we left the encamping-ground, and in passing under a\ntree on the side of the Cawnpore and Lucknow road, I looked up, and was\nhorrified to see my late prisoner and his companion hanging stark and\nstiffened corpses!I could hardly repress a tear as I passed.But on the\n11th of March, in the assault on the Begum\'s Kothee, I remembered\nMahomed Ali Khan and looked on the ring.I am thankful to say that I\nwent through the rest of the campaign without a scratch, and the\nthoughts of my kindness to this unfortunate man certainly did not\ninspire me with any desire to shirk danger.I still have the ring, the\nonly piece of Mutiny plunder I ever possessed, and shall hand it down to\nmy children together with the history of Mahomed Ali Khan.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[37] Butler.[38] It must also be remembered that these officials knew much more of\nthe terrible facts attending the Mutiny--of the wholesale murder (and\neven worse) of English women and the slaughter of English children--than\nthe rank and file were permitted to hear; and that they were also, both\nfrom their station and their experience, far better able to decide the\nmeasures best calculated to crush the imminent danger threatening our\ndominion in India.Among the sepoys the word usually signified an Afghan or\nCaubuli.[41] This very man who denounced Jamie Green as a spy was actually\nhanged in Bareilly in the following May for having murdered his master\nin that station when the Mutiny first broke out.CHAPTER XI\n\nTHE SIEGE OF LUCKNOW--SIR COLIN APPOINTED COLONEL OF THE NINETY-THIRD\n--ASSAULT ON THE MARTINIERE--A "RANK" JOKE.After leaving Oonao our division under Sir Edward Lugard reached\nBuntera, six miles from the Alumbagh, on the 27th of February, and\nhalted there till the 2nd of March, when we marched to the Dilkoosha,\nencamping a short distance from the palace barely beyond reach of the\nenemy\'s guns, for they were able at times to throw round-shot into our\ncamp.We then settled down for the siege and capture of Lucknow; but the\nwork before us was considered tame and unimportant when compared with\nthat of the relief of the previous November.Every soldier in the camp\nclearly recognised that the capture of the doomed city was simply a\nmatter of time,--a few days more or less--and the task before us a mere\nmatter of routine, nothing to be compared to the exciting exertions\nwhich we had to put forth for the relief of our countrywomen and their\nchildren.At the time of the annexation of Oude Lucknow was estimated to contain\nfrom eight to nine hundred thousand inhabitants, or as many as Delhi and\nBenares put together.John went to the bathroom.The camp and bazaars of our force were full of\nreports of the great strength and determination of the enemy, and\ncertainly all the chiefs of Oude, Mahommedan and Hindoo, had joined the\nstandard of the Begum and had sworn to fight for their young king Brijis\nKuddur.All Oude was therefore still against us, and we held only the\nground covered by the British guns.Bazaar reports estimated the enemy\'s\nstrength at from two hundred and fifty to three hundred thousand\nfighting men, with five hundred guns in position; but in the\nCommander-in-Chief\'s camp the strength of the enemy was computed at\nsixty thousand regulars, mutineers who had lately served the Company,\nand about seventy thousand irregulars, matchlock-men, armed police,\ndacoits, etc., making a total of one hundred and thirty thousand\nfighting men.To fight this large army, sheltered behind entrenchments\nand loophooled walls, the British force, even after being joined by Jung\nBahadoor\'s Goorkhas, mustered only about thirty-one thousand men of all\narms, and one hundred and sixty-four guns.From the heights of the Dilkoosha in the cool of the early morning,\nLucknow, with its numerous domed mosques, minarets, and palaces, looked\nvery picturesque.I don\'t think I ever saw a prettier scene than that\npresented on the morning of the 3rd of March, 1858, when the sun rose,\nand Captain Peel and his Blue-jackets were getting their heavy guns,\n68-pounders, into position.From the Dilkoosha, even without the aid of\ntelescopes, we could see that the defences had been greatly\nstrengthened since we retired from Lucknow in November, and I called to\nmind the warning of Jamie Green, that if the enemy stood to their guns\nlike men behind those extensive earthworks, many of the British force\nwould lose the number of their mess before we could take the city; and\nalthough the Indian papers which reached our camp affected to sneer at\nthe Begum, Huzrut Mahal, and the legitimacy of her son Brijis Kuddur,\nwhom the mutineers had proclaimed King of Oude, they had evidently the\nsupport of the whole country, for every chief and _zemindar_ of any\nimportance had joined them.On the morning after we had pitched our camp in the Dilkoosha park, I\nwent out with Sergeant Peter Gillespie, our deputy provost-marshal, to\ntake a look round the bazaars, and just as we turned a corner on our way\nback to camp, we met some gentlemen in civilian dress, one of whom\nturned out to be Mr.Russell, the _Times\'_ correspondent, whom we never\nexpected to have seen in India.I never did think of meeting you here,\nbut I am right glad to see you, and so will all our boys be!"After a\nshort chat and a few inquiries about the regiment, Mr.Russell asked\nwhen we expected to be in Lucknow, to which Peter Gillespie replied:\n"Well, I dinna ken, sir, but when Sir Colin likes to give the order,\nwe\'ll just advance and take it."I may here mention that Sergeant\nGillespie lived to go through the Mutiny, and the cholera epidemic in\nPeshawar in 1862, only to die of hydrophobia from the bite of a pet dog\nin Sialkote years after, when he was about to retire on his sergeant\'s\npension.I mention this because Peter Gillespie was a well-known\ncharacter in the old regiment; he had served on the staff of the\nprovost-marshal throughout the Crimean war, and, so far as I now\nremember, Colonel Ewart and Sergeant Gillespie were the only two men in\nthe regiment who gained the Crimean medal with the four clasps, for\nAlma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and Sebastopol.On the 4th of March the Ninety-Third, a squadron of the Ninth Lancers,\nand a battery of artillery, were marched to the banks of the Goomtee\nopposite Beebeepore House, to form a guard for the engineers engaged in\nthrowing a pontoon bridge across the Goomtee.The weather was now very\nhot in the day-time, and as we were well beyond the range of the enemy\'s\nguns, we were allowed to undress by companies and bathe in the river.As\nfar as I can remember, we were two days on this duty.During the\nforenoon of the second day the Commander-in-Chief visited us, and the\nregiment fell in to receive him, because, he said, he had something of\nimportance to communicate.When formed up, Sir Colin told us that he had\njust received despatches from home, and among them a letter from the\nQueen in which the Ninety-Third was specially mentioned.He then pulled\nthe letter out of his pocket, and read the paragraph alluded to, which\nran as follows, as nearly as I remembered to note it down after it was\nread: "The Queen wishes Sir Colin to convey the expression of her great\nadmiration and gratitude to all European as well as native troops who\nhave fought so nobly and so gallantly for the relief of Lucknow, amongst\nwhom the Queen is rejoiced to see the Ninety-Third Highlanders."Colonel\nLeith-Hay at once called for three cheers for her Majesty the Queen,\nwhich were given with hearty good-will, followed by three more for the\nCommander-in-Chief.The colonel then requested Sir Colin to return the\nthanks of the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the\nregiment to her Majesty the Queen for her most gracious message, and for\nher special mention of the Ninety-Third, an honour which no one serving\nin the regiment would ever forget.To this Sir Colin replied that\nnothing would give him greater pleasure than to comply with this\nrequest; but he had still more news to communicate.He had also a letter\nfrom his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge to read to us, which he\nproceeded to do as follows: "One line in addition to my letter addressed\nto you this morning, to say that, in consequence of the Colonelcy of the\nNinety-Third Highlanders having become vacant by the death of General\nParkinson, I have recommended the Queen to remove you to the command of\nthat distinguished and gallant corps, with which you have been so much\nassociated, not alone at the present moment in India, but also during\nthe whole of the campaign in the Crimea.I thought such an arrangement\nwould be agreeable to yourself, and I know that it is the highest\ncompliment that her Majesty could pay to the Ninety-Third Highlanders to\nsee their dear old chief at their head."As soon as Sir Colin had read\nthis letter, the whole regiment cheered till we were hoarse; and when\nSir Colin\'s voice could again be heard, he called for the master-tailor\nto go to the headquarters camp to take his measure to send home for a\nuniform of the regiment for him, feather bonnet and all complete; and\nabout eighteen months afterwards Sir Colin visited us in Subathoo,\ndressed in the regimental uniform then ordered.Early on the 7th of March General Outram\'s division crossed the Goomtee\nby the bridge of boats, and we returned to our tents at the Dilkoosha.About mid-day we could see Outram\'s division, of which the Seventy-Ninth\nCameron Highlanders formed one of the infantry corps, driving the enemy\nbefore them in beautiful style.We saw also the Queen\'s Bays, in their\nbright scarlet uniform and brass helmets, make a splendid charge,\nscattering the enemy like sheep, somewhere about the place where the\nbuildings of the Upper India Paper Mills now stand.In this charge Major\nPercy Smith and several men galloped right through the enemy\'s lines,\nand were surrounded and killed.Spies reported that Major Smith\'s head\nwas cut off, and, with his helmet, plume, and uniform, paraded through\nthe streets of Lucknow as the head of the Commander-in-Chief.But the\ntriumph of the enemy was short.On the 8th General Outram was firmly\nestablished on the north bank of the Goomtee, with a siege-train of\ntwenty-two heavy guns, with which he completely turned and enfiladed the\nenemy\'s strong position.On the 9th of March we were ordered to take our dinners at twelve\no\'clock, and shortly after that hour our division, consisting of the\nThirty-Eighth, Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, Ninetieth, Ninety-Third, and\nFourth Punjab Infantry, was under arms, screened by the Dilkoosha palace\nand the garden walls round it, and Peel\'s Blue-jackets were pouring shot\nand shell, with now and again a rocket, into the Martiniere as fast as\never they could load.About two o\'clock the order was given for the\nadvance--the Forty-Second to lead and the Ninety-Third to support; but\nwe no sooner emerged from the shelter of the palace and garden-walls\nthan the orderly advance became a rushing torrent.Both regiments dashed\ndown the <DW72> abreast, and the earthworks, trenches, and rifle-pits in\nfront of the Martiniere were cleared, the enemy flying before us as fast\nas their legs could carry them.We pursued them right through the\ngardens, capturing their first line of works along the canal in front of\nBanks\'s bungalow and the Begum\'s palace.There we halted for the night,\nour heavy guns and mortar-batteries being advanced from the Dilkoosha;\nand I, with some men from my company, was sent on piquet to a line of\nunroofed huts in front of one of our mortar-batteries, for fear the\nenemy from the Begum\'s palace might make a rush on the mortars.This\npiquet was not relieved till the morning of the 11th, when I learned\nthat my company had been sent back as camp-guards, the captains of\ncompanies having drawn lots for this service, as all were equally\nanxious to take part in the assault on the Begum\'s palace, and it was\nknown the Ninety-Third were to form the storming-party.As soon as the\nworks should be breached, I and the men who were with me on the\nadvance-piquet were to be sent to join Captain M\'Donald\'s company,\ninstead of going back to our own in camp.After being relieved from\npiquet, our little party set about preparing some food.Our own company\nhaving gone back to camp, no rations had been drawn for us, and our\nhaversacks were almost empty; so I will here relate a mild case of\ncannibalism.Of the men of my own company who were with me on this\npiquet one was Andrew M\'Onvill,--Handy Andy, as he was called in the\nregiment--a good-hearted, jolly fellow, and as full of fun and practical\njokes as his namesake, Lever\'s hero,--a thorough Paddy from Armagh, a\nsoldier as true as the steel of a Damascus blade or a Scotch Andrea\nFerrara.When last I heard of him, I may add, he was sergeant-major of a\nNew Zealand militia regiment.Others were Sandy Proctor, soldier-servant\nto Dr.Munro, and George Patterson, the son of the carrier of Ballater\nin Aberdeenshire.I forget who the rest were, but we were joined by John\nM\'Leod, the pipe-major, and one or two more.We got into an empty hut,\nwell sheltered from the bullets of the enemy, and Handy Andy sallied out\non a foraging expedition for something in the way of food.He had a\nfriend in the Fifty-Third who was connected in some way with the\nquarter-master\'s department, and always well supplied with extra\nprovender.The Fifty-Third were on our right, and there Handy Andy found\nhis friend, and returned with a good big steak, cut from an artillery\ngun-bullock which had been killed by a round-shot; also some sheep\'s\nliver and a haversack full of biscuits, with plenty of pumpkin to make\na good stew.There was no lack of cooking-pots in the huts around, and\nplenty of wood for fuel, so we kindled a fire, and very soon had an\nexcellent stew in preparation.But the enemy pitched some shells into\nour position, and one burst close to a man named Tim Drury, a big stout\nfellow, killing him on the spot.I forget now which company he belonged\nto, but his body lay where he fell, just outside our hut, with one thigh\nnearly torn away.My readers must not for a moment think that such a\npicture in the foreground took away our appetites in the least.There is\nnothing like a campaign for making one callous and selfish, and\ndeveloping the qualities of the wild beast in one\'s nature; and the\nthought which rises uppermost is--Well, it is his turn now, and it may\nbe mine next, and there is no use in being down-hearted!Our steak had\nbeen broiled to a turn, and our stew almost cooked, when we noticed\ntiffin and breakfast combined arrive for the European officers of the\nFourth Punjab Regiment, and some others who were waiting sheltered by\nthe walls of a roofless hut near where we were.Among them was a young\nfellow, Lieutenant Fitzgerald Cologan, attached to some native regiment,\na great favourite with the Ninety-Third for his pluck.John M\'Leod at\nonce proposed that Handy Andy should go and offer him half of our\nbroiled steak, and ask him for a couple of bottles of beer for our\ndinner, as it might be the last time we should have the chance of\ndrinking his health.He and the other officers with him accepted the\nsteak with thanks, and Andy returned, to our no small joy, with two\nquart bottles of Bass\'s beer.But, unfortunately he had attracted the\nattention of Charley F., the greatest glutton in the Ninety-Third, who\nwas so well known for his greediness that no one would chum with him.Charley was a long-legged, humpbacked, cadaverous-faced, bald-headed\nfellow, who had joined the regiment as a volunteer from the\nSeventy-Second before we left Dover in the spring of 1857, and on\naccount of his long legs and humpback, combined with the inordinate\ncapacity of his stomach and an incurable habit of grumbling, he had been\nre-christened the "Camel," before we had proceeded many marches with\nthat useful animal in India.Our mutual congratulations were barely over\non the acquisition of the two bottles of beer, when, to our\nconsternation, we saw the Camel dodging from cover to cover, as the\nenemy were keeping up a heavy fire on our position, and if any one\nexposed himself in the least, a shower of bullets was sent whistling\nround him.However, the Camel, with a due regard to the wholeness of his\nskin, steadily made way towards our hut.We all knew that if he were\nadmitted to a share of our stew, very little would be left for\nourselves.John M\'Leod and I suggested that we should, at the risk of\nquarrelling with him, refuse to allow him any share, but Handy Andy\nsaid, "Leave him to me, and if a bullet doesn\'t knock him over as he\ncomes round the next corner, I\'ll put him off asking for a share of the\nstew."Well, the Camel took good\ncare to dodge the bullets of Jack Pandy, and he no sooner reached a\nsheltered place in front of the hut, than Andy called out: "Come along,\nCharley, you are just in time; we got a slice of a nice steak from an\nartillery-bullock this morning, and because it was too small alone for a\ndinner for the four of us, we have just stewed it with a slice from Tim\nDrury, and bedad it\'s first-rate!Tim tastes for all the world like\nfresh pork"; and with that Andy picked out a piece of the sheep\'s liver\non the prongs of his fork, and offered it to Charley as part of Tim\nDrury, at the same time requesting him not to mention the circumstance\nto any one.This was too much for the Camel\'s stomach.He plainly\nbelieved Andy, and turned away, as if he would be sick.However, he\nrecovered himself, and replied: "No, thank you; hungry as I am, it shall\nnever be in the power of any one to tell my auld mither in the Grass\nMarket o\' Edinboro\' that her Charley had become a cannibal!But if you\ncan spare me a drop of the beer I\'ll be thankful for it, for the sight\nof your stew has made me feel unco\' queer."We expressed our sorrow that\nthe beer was all drunk before we had seen Charley performing his oblique\nadvance, and Andy again pressed him to partake of a little of the stew;\nbut Charley refused to join, and sitting down in a sheltered spot in the\ncorner of our roofless mud-hut, made wry faces at the relish evinced by\nthe rest of us over our savoury stew.The Camel eventually discovered\nthat he had been made a fool of, and he never forgave us for cheating\nhim out of a share of the savoury mess.CHAPTER XII\n\nASSAULT ON THE BEGUM\'S KOTHEE--DEATH OF CAPTAIN M\'DONALD--MAJOR HODSON\nWOUNDED--HIS DEATH\n\n\nWe had barely finished our meal when we noticed a stir among the\nstaff-officers, and a consultation taking place between General Sir\nEdward Lugard, Brigadier Adrian Hope, and Colonel Napier.Suddenly the\norder was given to the Ninety-Third to fall in.This was quietly done,\nthe officers taking their places, the men tightening their belts and\npressing their bonnets firmly on their heads, loosening the ammunition\nin their pouches, and seeing that the springs of their bayonets held\ntight.Thus we stood for a few seconds, when Brigadier Hope passed the\nsignal for the assault on the Begum\'s Kothee.Just before the signal was\ngiven two men from the Fifty-Third rushed up to us with a soda-water\nbottle full of grog.One of them was Lance-Corporal Robert Clary, who is\nat present, I believe, police-sergeant in the Municipal Market,\nCalcutta; the other was the friend of Andrew M\'Onvill, who had supplied\nus with the steaks for our "cannibal feast."I may mention that\nLance-Corporal Clary was the same man who led the party of the\nFifty-Third to capture the guns at the Kalee Nuddee bridge, and who\ncalled out: "Three cheers for the Commander-in-Chief, boys," when Sir\nColin Campbell was threatening to send the regiment to the rear for\nbreach of orders.Clary was a County Limerick boy of the right sort,\nsuch as filled the ranks of our Irish regiments of the old days.No\nFenian nor Home Ruler; but ever ready to uphold the honour of the\nBritish Army by land or by sea, and to share the contents of his\nhaversack or his glass of grog with a comrade; one of those whom Scott\nimmortalises in _The Vision of Don Roderick_.from yon stately ranks what laughter rings,\n      Mingling wild mirth with war\'s stern minstrelsy,\n    His jest while each blithe comrade round him flings,\n      And moves to death with military glee!tameless, frank, and free,\n      In kindness warm, and fierce in danger known,\n    Rough Nature\'s children, humorous as she.When Captain M\'Donald, whose company we had joined, saw the two\nFifty-Third boys, he told them that they had better rejoin their own\nregiment.Clary replied, "Sure, Captain, you don\'t mean it;" and seeing\nDr.Munro, our surgeon, busy giving directions to his assistants and\narranging bandages, etc., in a _dooly_, Clary went on:--"We have been\nsent by Lieutenant Munro of our company to take care of his namesake\nyour doctor, who never thinks of himself, but is sure to be in the thick\nof the fight, looking out for wounded men.You of the Ninety-Third don\'t\nappreciate his worth.There\'s not another doctor in the army to equal\nhim or to replace him should he get knocked over in this scrimmage, and\nwe of the Fifty-Third have come to take care of him.""If that is the\ncase," said Captain M\'Donald, "I\'ll allow you to remain; but you must\ntake care that no harm befalls our doctor, for he is a great friend of\nmine."And with that Captain M\'Donald stepped aside and plucked a rose\nfrom a bush close by, (we were then formed up in what had been a\nbeautiful garden), and going up to Munro he gave him the flower saying,\n"Good-bye, old friend, keep this for my sake."I have often recalled\nthis incident and wondered if poor Captain M\'Donald had any presentiment\nthat he would be killed!Although he had been a captain for some years,\nhe was still almost a boy.He was a son of General Sir John M\'Donald,\nK.C.B., of Dalchosnie, Perthshire, and was wounded in his right arm\nearly in the day by a splinter from a shell, but he refused to go to the\nrear, and remained at the head of his company, led it through the\nbreach, and was shot down just inside, two bullets striking him almost\nat once, one right in his throat just over the breast-bone, as he was\nwaving his claymore and cheering on his company.After the fight was\nover I made my way to where the dead were collected and cut off a lock\nof his hair and sent it to a young lady, Miss M. E. Ainsworth, of\nInverighty House, Forfar, who, I knew, was acquainted with Captain\nM\'Donald\'s family.I intended the lock of hair for his mother, and I did\nnot know if his brother officers would think of sending any memento of\nhim.I don\'t know if ever the lock of hair reached his mother or not.When I went to do this I found Captain M\'Donald\'s soldier-servant\ncrying beside the lifeless body of his late master, wringing his hands\nand saying, "Oh!I never\nsaw a more girlish-looking face than his was in death; his features were\nso regular, and looked strangely like those of a wax doll, which was, I\nthink, partly the effect of the wound in the throat.When Captain McDonald fell the company was led by the senior lieutenant,\nand about twenty yards inside the breach in the outer rampart we were\nstopped by a ditch nearly eighteen feet wide and at least twelve to\nfourteen feet deep.It was easy enough to slide down to the bottom; the\ndifficulty was to get up on the other side!However, there was no\nhesitation; the stormers dashed into the ditch, and running along to the\nright in search of some place where we could get up on the inside, we\nmet part of the grenadier company headed by Lieutenant E. S. Wood, an\nactive and daring young officer.I may here mention that there were two\nlieutenants of the name of Wood at this time in the Ninety-Third.One\nbelonged to my company; his name was S. E. Wood and he was severely\nwounded at the relief of Lucknow and was, at the time of which I am\nwriting, absent from the regiment.Sandra went to the garden.The one to whom I now refer was\nLieutenant E. S. Wood of the grenadier company.When the two parties in\nthe ditch met, both in search of a place to get out, Mr.Wood got on the\nshoulders of another grenadier and somehow scrambled up claymore in\nhand.He was certainly the first man inside the inner works of the\nBegum\'s palace, and when the enemy saw him emerge from the ditch they\nfled to barricade doors and windows to prevent us getting into the\nbuildings.His action saved us, for the whole of us might have been shot\nlike rats in the ditch if they had attacked Mr.Wood, instead of flying\nwhen they saw the tall grenadier claymore in hand.As soon as he saw the\ncoast clear the lieutenant lay down on the top of the ditch, and was\nthus able to reach down and catch hold of the men\'s rifles by the bends\nof the bayonets; and with the aid of the men below pushing up behind, we\nwere all soon pulled out of the ditch.When all were up, one of the men\nturned to Mr.Wood and said: "If any officer in the regiment deserves to\nget the Victoria Cross, sir, you do; for besides the risk you have run\nfrom the bullets of the enemy, it\'s more than a miracle that you\'re not\nshot by our own rifles; they\'re all on full-cock."Sandra went back to the office.Seizing loaded rifles on full-cock by the muzzles, and pulling more than\na score of men out of a deep ditch, was a dangerous thing to do; but no\none thought of the danger, nor did anyone think of even easing the\nspring to half-cock, much less of firing his rifle off before being\npulled up.Wood escaped, and after getting his captaincy he\nleft the regiment and became Conservator of Forests in Oude.H. W. I. Wood, for\nmany years the well-known secretary to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.He has just lately retired on his pension; I wonder if he ever recalls\nthe danger he incurred from pulling his men out of the ditch of the\nBegum\'s palace by the muzzles of their loaded rifles on full-cock!By the time we got out of the ditch we found every door and window of\nthe palace buildings barricaded, and every loophole defended by an\ninvisible enemy.But one barrier after another was forced, and men in\nsmall parties, headed by the officers, got possession of the inner\nsquare, where the enemy in large numbers stood ready for the struggle.But no thought of unequal numbers held us back.The command was given:\n"Keep well together, men, and use the bayonet; give them the\nSecundrabagh and the sixteenth of November over again."It raged for about two hours from court to court,\nand from room to room; the pipe-major, John M\'Leod, playing the pipes\ninside as calmly as if he had been walking round the officers\' mess-tent\nat a regimental festival.When all was over, General Sir Edward Lugard,\nwho commanded the division, complimented the pipe-major on his coolness\nand bravery: "Ah, sir," said John, "I knew our boys would fight all the\nbetter when cheered by the bagpipes.""Within about two hours from the time the signal for the assault was\ngiven, over eight hundred and sixty of the enemy lay dead within the\ninner court, and no quarter was sought or given.By this time we were\nbroken up in small parties in a series of separate fights, all over the\ndifferent detached buildings of the palace.Captain M\'Donald being dead,\nthe men who had been on piquet with me joined a party under Lieutenant\nSergison, and while breaking in the door of a room, Mr.Sergison was\nshot dead at my side with several men.When we had partly broken in the\ndoor, I saw that there was a large number of the enemy inside the room,\nwell armed with swords and spears, in addition to fire-arms of all\nsorts, and, not wishing to be either killed myself or have more of the\nmen who were with me killed, I divided my party, placing some at each\nside of the door to shoot every man who showed himself, or attempted to\nrush out.I then sent two men back to the breach, where I knew Colonel\nNapier with his engineers were to be found, to get a few bags of\ngunpowder with slow-matches fixed, to light and pitch into the room.Instead of finding Napier, the two men sent by me found the redoubtable\nMajor Hodson who had accompanied Napier as a volunteer in the storming\nof the palace.Hodson did not wait for the powder-bags, but, after\nshowing the men where to go for them, came running up himself, sabre in\nhand.I pointed to the door of the\nroom, and Hodson, shouting \'Come on!\'I implored\nhim not to do so, saying, \'It\'s certain death; wait for the powder; I\'ve\nsent men for powder-bags,\' Hodson made a step forward, and I put out my\nhand to seize him by the shoulder to pull him out of the line of the\ndoorway, when he fell back shot through the chest.He gasped out a few\nwords, either \'Oh, my wife!\'--I cannot now rightly\nremember--but was immediately choked by blood.At the time I thought the\nbullet had passed through his lungs, but since then I have seen the\nmemoir written by his brother, the Rev.George H. Hodson, Vicar of\nEnfield, in which it is stated that the bullet passed through his liver.However, I assisted to get him lifted into a _dooly_ (by that time the\nbearers had got in and were collecting the wounded who were unable to\nwalk), and I sent him back to where the surgeons were, fully expecting\nthat he would be dead before anything could be done for him.It will\nthus be seen that the assertion that Major Hodson was looting when he\nwas killed is untrue.No looting had been commenced, not even by Jung\nBahadoor\'s Goorkhas.That Major Hodson was killed through his own\nrashness cannot be denied; but for any one to say that he was looting is\na cruel slander on one of the bravest of Englishmen."Shortly after I had lifted poor Hodson into the _dooly_ and sent him\naway in charge of his orderly, the two men who had gone for the powder\ncame up with several bags, with slow-matches fixed in them.These we\nignited, and then pitched the bags in through the door.Two or three\nbags very soon brought the enemy out, and they were bayoneted down\nwithout mercy.One of the men who were with me was, I think, Mr.Rule,\nwho is now _sans_ a leg, and employed by the G.I.P.Railway in Bombay,\nbut was then a powerful young man of the light company.Rule rushed in\namong the rebels, using both bayonet and butt of his rifle, shouting,\n"Revenge for the death of Hodson!"and he killed more than half the men\nsingle-handed.By this time we had been over two hours inside the\nbreach, and almost all opposition had ceased.Lieutenant and Adjutant\n"Willie" MacBean, as he was known to the officers, and "Paddy" MacBean\nto the men, encountered a _havildar_, a _naik_, and nine sepoys at one\ngate, and killed the whole eleven, one after the other.The _havildar_\nwas the last; and by the time he got out through the narrow gate,\nseveral men came to the assistance of MacBean, but he called to them not\nto interfere, and the _havildar_ and he went at it with their swords.At\nlength MacBean made a feint cut, but instead gave the point, and put his\nsword through the chest of his opponent.For this MacBean got the\nVictoria Cross, mainly, I believe, because Sir Edward Lugard, the\ngeneral in command of the division, was looking down from the ramparts\nabove and saw the whole affair.I don\'t think that MacBean himself\nthought he had done anything extraordinary.He was an Inverness-shire\nploughman before he enlisted, and rose from the ranks to command the\nregiment, and died a major-general.There were still a number of old\nsoldiers in the regiment who had been privates with MacBean when I\nenlisted, and many anecdotes were related about him.One of these was\nthat when MacBean first joined, he walked with a rolling gait, and the\ndrill-corporal was rather abusive with him when learning his drill.At\nlast he became so offensive that another recruit proposed to MacBean,\nwho was a very powerful man, that they should call the corporal behind\nthe canteen in the barrack-yard and give him a good thrashing, to which\nproposal MacBean replied: "Toots, toots, man, that would never do.I am\ngoing to command this regiment before I leave it, and it would be an ill\nbeginning to be brought before the colonel for thrashing the\ndrill-corporal!"MacBean kept to his purpose, and _did_ live to command\nthe regiment, going through every rank from private to major-general.I\nhave seen it stated that he was a drummer-boy in the regiment, but that\nis not correct.He was kept seven years lance-corporal, partly because\npromotion went slow in the Ninety-Third, but several were promoted over\nhim because, at the time of the disruption in the Church of Scotland,\nMacBean joined the Free Kirk party.This fact may appear strange to\nmilitary readers of the present day with our short service and\nterritorial regiments; but in the times of which I am writing, as I have\nbefore mentioned, the Ninety-Third was constituted as much after the\narrangements of a Highland parish as those of a regiment in the army;\nand, to use the words of old Colonel Sparks who commanded, MacBean was\npassed over four promotions because "He was a d--d Free Kirker."But I must hark back to my story and to the Begum\'s palace on the\nevening of the 11th of March, 1858.By the time darkness set in all\nopposition had ceased, but there were still numbers of the mutineers\nhiding in the rooms.Our loss was small compared with that inflicted on\nthe enemy.Our regiment had one captain, one lieutenant, and thirteen\nrank and file killed; Lieutenant Grimston, Ensign Hastie, and\nforty-five men wounded.Many of the wounded died afterwards; but eight\nhundred and sixty of the enemy lay dead in the centre court alone, and\nmany hundreds more were killed in the different enclosures and\nbuildings.That night we bivouacked in the courts of the palace, placing\nstrong guards all round.When daylight broke on the morning of the 12th\nof March, the sights around were horrible.I have already mentioned that\nmany sepoys had to be dislodged from the close rooms around the palace\nby exploding bags of gunpowder among them, and this set fire to their\nclothing and to whatever furniture there was in the rooms; and when day\nbroke on the 12th, there were hundreds of bodies all round, some still\nburning and others half-burnt, and the stench was sickening.However,\nthe Begum\'s palace was the key to the enemy\'s position.During the day\nlarge parties of camp-followers were brought in to drag out the dead of\nthe enemy, and throw them into the ditch which had given us so much\ntrouble to cross, and our batteries were advanced to bombard the\nImambara and Kaiserbagh.During the forenoon of the 12th, I remember seeing Mr.Russell of _The\nTimes_ going round making notes, and General Lugard telling him to take\ncare and not to attempt to go into any dark room for fear of being\n"potted" by concealed Pandies.Many such were hunted out during the day,\nand as there was no quarter for them they fought desperately.We had\none sergeant killed at this work and several men wounded.During the\nafternoon a divisional order by General Sir Edward Lugard was read to\nus, as follows:--\n\n"Major-General Sir Edward Lugard begs to thank Brigadier the Honourable\nAdrian Hope, Colonel Leith-Hay, and the officers and men of the\nNinety-Third who exclusively carried the position known as the Begum\'s\nKothee.No words are sufficient to express the gallantry, devotion, and\nfearless intrepidity displayed by every officer and man in the regiment.The Major-General will not fail to bring their conduct prominently to\nthe notice of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief."During the day Sir Colin himself visited the position, and told us that\narrangements would be made for our relief the following day, and on\nSaturday, the 13th, we returned to camp and rested all the following\nSunday.So far as I remember, the two men of the Fifty-Third,\nLance-Corporal Clary and his comrade, remained with us till after the\nplace was taken, and then returned to their own regiment when the\nfighting was over, reporting to Lieutenant Munro that they had gone to\ntake care of his brother, Doctor Munro of the Ninety-Third.There were many individual acts of bravery performed during the assault,\nand it is difficult to single them out.But before closing this chapter\nI may relate a rather laughable incident that happened to a man of my\ncompany named Johnny Ross.He was a little fellow, and there were two\nof the same name in the company, one tall and the other short, so they\nwere named respectively John and Johnny.Before falling in for the\nassault on the Begum\'s palace, Johnny Ross and George Puller, with some\nothers, had been playing cards in a sheltered corner, and in some way\nquarrelled over the game.When the signal was given for the "fall in,"\nPuller and Ross were still arguing the point in dispute, and Puller told\nRoss to "shut up."Just at that very moment a spent bullet struck Ross\nin the mouth, knocking in four of his front teeth.Johnny thought it was\nPuller who had struck him, and at once returned the blow; when Puller\nquietly replied, "You d--d fool, it was not I who struck you; you\'ve got\na bullet in your mouth."And so it was: Johnny Ross put up his hand to\nhis mouth, and spat out four front teeth and a leaden bullet.He at once\napologised to Puller for having struck him, and added, "How will I\nmanage to bite my cartridges the noo?"Those were the days of\nmuzzle-loading cartridges, which had to be torn open with the teeth when\nloading.We returned to our tents at the Dilkoosha on Saturday, the 13th, and the\nwhole regiment formed a funeral party for our killed near the palace;\nbut I could not find the place on my late visit to Lucknow, nor do I\nthink any monument marks it.When going round the Dilkoosha heights I\nfound no trace of the graves of the Ninety-Third, nor was there any one\nwho could point them out to me.The guide took me to see the grave of\nMajor Hodson.I found it in excellent preservation, with a wall round\nit, and an iron gate to it near the entrance to the Martiniere College.This care had been taken of Hodson\'s last resting-place by his friend,\nLord Napier of Magdala, and I cut a branch from the cypress-tree planted\nat his head, and posted half of it to the address of his brother in\nEngland.NOTE\n\nHODSON OF HODSON\'S HORSE\n\n      Sir Colin Campbell wrote thus at the time of Major Hodson\'s\n      death: "The whole army, which admired his talents, his\n      bravery, and his military skill, deplores his loss.... I\n      attended his funeral yesterday evening, in order to show\n      what respect I could to the memory of one of the most\n      brilliant officers under my command.--(Signed) C.\n      CAMPBELL, Commander-in-Chief in East Indies."The following tributes were also paid to Hodson\'s memory at\n      the time.From a leading article in _The Times_: "The\n      country will receive with lively regret the news that the\n      gallant Major Hodson, who has given his name to an\n      invincible and almost ubiquitous body of cavalry, was killed\n      in the attack on Lucknow.Major Hodson has been from the\n      very beginning of this war fighting everywhere and against\n      any odds with all the spirit of a Paladin of old.His most\n      remarkable exploit, the capture of the King of Delhi and his\n      two sons, astonished the world by its courage and coolness.Hodson was indeed a man who, from his romantic daring and\n      his knowledge of the Asiatic character, was able to beat the\n      natives at their own weapons."From _Blackwood\'s Magazine_: "Then fell one of the bravest\n      in the Indian Army, an officer whose name has been brought\n      too often before the public by those in high command to need\n      my humble word of praise.There was not a man before Delhi\n      who did not know Hodson; always active, always cheery, it\n      did one\'s heart good to look at his face when all felt how\n      critical was our position."CHAPTER XIII\n\nJUNG BAHADOOR--GUNPOWDER--THE MOHURRUM AT LUCKNOW--LOOT\n\n\nOn the return of the regiment to camp at the Dilkoosha on the 13th of\nMarch I was glad to get back to my own company.The men were mortified\nbecause they had not shared in the honour of the assault on the Begum\'s\npalace; but as some compensation the company had formed the\nguard-of-honour for the reception of the Maharaja Jung Bahadoor,\nCommander-in-Chief of the Nepaulese Army, who had just reached Lucknow\nand been received in state by Sir Colin Campbell on the afternoon of the\n11th, at the moment when the regiment was engaged in the assault on the\npalace.The _durbar_ had at first proved a rather stiff ceremonial\naffair, but Jung Bahadoor and his officers had hardly been presented and\ntaken their seats, when a commotion was heard outside, and Captain Hope\nJohnstone, aide-de-camp to General Sir William Mansfield, covered with\npowder-smoke and the dust of battle, strode up the centre of the\nguard-of-honour with a message to the Commander-in-Chief from Mansfield,\ninforming him that the Ninety-Third had taken the Begum\'s palace, the\nkey of the enemy\'s position, with slight loss to themselves, but that\nthey had killed over a thousand of the enemy.This announcement put an\nend to all ceremony on the part of Sir Colin, who jumped to his feet,\nrubbing his hands, and calling out, "I knew they would do it!I knew my\nboys of the Ninety-Third would do it!"Then telling Captain Metcalfe to\ninterpret the news to the Maharaja, and pointing to the guard-of-honour,\nSir Colin said: "Tell him that these men are part of the regiment that\nhas done this daring feat.Tell him also that they are _my_ regiment;\nI\'m their colonel!"The Maharaja looked pleased, and replied that he\nremembered having seen the regiment when he visited England in 1852.As\nI have already said, the Ninety-Third had formed a guard-of-honour for\nhim when in Edinburgh, and there were still many men in the regiment who\nremembered seeing Jung Bahadoor.There was an oft-repeated story among\nthe old soldiers that the Maharaja was so pleased at the sight of them\nthat he had proposed to buy the whole regiment, and was somewhat\nsurprised to learn that British soldiers were volunteers and could not\nbe sold, even to gratify the Maharaja of Nepaul.After returning to camp on the 13th of March, the regiment was allowed\nto rest till the 17th, but returned to the city on the morning of the\n18th, taking up a position near the Imambara and the Kaiserbagh, both of\nwhich had been captured when we were in camp.We relieved the\nForty-Second, and the sights that then met our eyes in the streets of\nLucknow defy description.The city was in the hands of plunderers;\nEuropeans and Sikhs, Goorkhas, and camp-followers of every class, aided\nby the scum of the native population.Every man in fact was doing what\nwas right in his own eyes, and "Hell broke loose" is the only phrase in\nthe English language that can give one who has never seen such a sight\nany idea of the scenes in and around the Imambara, the Kaiserbagh, and\nadjacent streets.The Sikhs and Goorkhas were by far the most proficient\nplunderers, because they instinctively knew where to look for the most\nvaluable loot.The European soldiers did not understand the business,\nand articles that might have proved a fortune to many were readily\nparted with for a few rupees in cash and a bottle of grog.But the\ngratuitous destruction of valuable property that could not be carried\noff was appalling.Colour-Sergeant Graham, of Captain Burroughs\'\ncompany, rescued from the fire a bundle of Government-of-India\npromissory notes to the value of over a _lakh_ of rupees,[42] and Mr.Kavanagh, afterwards discovering the rightful owner, secured for\nSergeant Graham a reward of five per cent on the amount.But with few\nexceptions the men of the Ninety-Third got very little.I could fill a\nvolume on the plunder of Lucknow, and the sights which are still vividly\nimpressed on my memory; but others have written at length on this theme,\nso I will leave it.Before I proceed to other subjects, and to make my recollections as\ninstructive as possible for young soldiers, I may mention some serious\naccidents that happened through the explosions of gunpowder left behind\nby the enemy.One most appalling accident occurred in the house of a\nnobleman named Ushruf-ood-dowlah, in which a large quantity of gunpowder\nhad been left; this was accidentally exploded, killing two officers and\nforty men of the Engineers, and a great number of camp-followers, of\nwhom no account was taken.The poor men who were not killed outright\nwere so horribly scorched that they all died in the greatest agony\nwithin a few hours of the accident, and for days explosions with more or\nless loss of life occurred all over the city.From the deplorable\naccidents that happened, which reasonable care might have prevented, I\ncould enumerate the loss of over a hundred men, and I cannot too\nstrongly impress on young soldiers the caution required in entering\nplaces where there is the least chance of coming across concealed\ngunpowder.By the accident in the house of Ushruf-ood-dowlah, two of our\nmost distinguished and promising Engineer officers,--Captains Brownlow\nand Clarke--lost their lives, with forty of the most valuable branch of\nthe service.All through the Mutiny I never forgot my own experience in\nthe Shah Nujeef (as related in the fifth chapter of these\nreminiscences); and wherever I could prevent it, I never allowed men to\ngo into unexplored rooms with lighted pipes, or to force open locked\ndoors by the usual method of firing a loaded rifle into the lock.I\nthink there ought to be a chapter of instructions on this head in every\ndrill-book and soldiers\' pocket-book.After the assault on a city like\nLucknow some license and plundering is inevitable, and where discipline\nis relaxed accidents are sure to happen; but a judicious use of the\nprovost-marshal\'s cat would soon restore discipline and order.Whatever\nopponents of the lash may say, my own firm opinion is that the\nprovost-marshal\'s cat is the only general to restore order in times like\nthose I am describing.I would have no courts-martial, drum-head or\notherwise; but simply give the provost-marshal a strong guard of picked\nmen and several sets of triangles, with full power to tie up every man,\nno matter what his rank, caught plundering, and give him from one to\nfour dozen, not across the shoulders, but across the breech, as judicial\nfloggings are administered in our jails; and if these were combined with\nroll-calls at short intervals, plundering, which is a most dangerous\npastime, would soon be put down.In time of war soldiers ought to be\ntaught to treat every house or room of an assaulted position as a\npowder-magazine until explored.I am surprised that cautions on this\nhead have been so long overlooked.As before stated, the Ninety-Third did not get much plunder, but in\nexpelling the enemy from some mosques and other strong buildings near\nthe Imambara on the 21st of March, one company came across the\ntomb-model or royal _tazia_, and the Mohurrum paraphernalia which had\nbeen made at enormous expense for the celebration of the last Mohurrum\nin Lucknow in 1857.The royal family and court of Lucknow were\n_Sheeahs_: and to enable European readers to understand the value of\nthe plunder to which I allude, before entering on the actual details, I\nwill quote from the chapter on the celebration of the Mohurrum in\nLucknow in _The Private Life of an Eastern King_, by William Knighton, a\nmember of the household of his late Majesty Nussir-ood-Deen King of\nOude, a book which, I believe, is now out of print.Few people seem to\nknow the meaning of those symbols, the star and crescent or half-moon,\non Mahommedan standards or banners and on the domes of mosques or tombs\nof deceased persons of importance, as also on the tomb-models, or\n_tazias_ used in the celebration of the Mohurrum.For the explanation of\nthese symbols we must turn to the science of heraldry, which was well\nknown in the sixth century A.D., when Mahommed established his\nreligion.The star is meant to represent Mahommed himself, as the\nprophet of God, and the crescent represents the Mahommedan religion,\nwhich every sincere follower of the Prophet believes will eventually\nbecome a full moon and cover the whole earth.The fanatical rites of the Mohurrum are celebrated on the\n      anniversary of the death of two leaders of the faithful,\n      near relatives of Mahommed himself, Hussun and Hoosein, and\n      are observed by more than one-half the population of India\n      as a period of deep humiliation and sorrow.The Mussulman\n      faithful are divided into two sects, Sheeahs and the\n      Soonies, who feel towards each other much as fanatical\n      Protestants and Roman Catholics mutually do.The Sheeahs\n      regard the deaths of Hussun and Hoosein as barbarous\n      murders; the Soonies look on them as lawful executions of\n      pretenders to supreme power by the reigning Caliph, the true\n      head of the faithful.On the first day of the Mohurrum the\n      vast population of Lucknow appears to be suddenly snatched\n      away from all interests and employments in the affairs of\n      this world; the streets are deserted; every one is shut up\n      in his house, mourning with his family.On the second day\n      the streets are crowded, but with people in mourning attire,\n      parading the thoroughfares in funeral procession to the\n      tomb-models set up here and there as tributes of respect to\n      the memory of Hussun and Hoosein.These models, called\n      _tazias_, are representations of the mausoleum at Kerbela\n      where the two chiefs are buried.The _tazias_ are placed in\n      an _imambara_ belonging to a chief, or in the house of some\n      wealthy Mussulman.The _tazia_ belonging to the king of Oude\n      was made for his Majesty\'s father, and was composed of\n      panels of green glass fixed in gold mouldings, and was\n      regarded as peculiarly holy.[I only take extracts from the\n      chapter on the Mohurrum from the work I have named.The\n      _tazia_ belonging to the king accompanied him from Lucknow\n      on the annexation of Oude.]It is on record at Lucknow that\n      the celebration of the Mohurrum often cost a reigning Nawab\n      upwards of L300,000 or Rs.In Lucknow, before the\n      Mutiny, it was believed that they had the true metal crest\n      of the banner of Hoosein, a relic regarded as peculiarly\n      sacred, and enshrined in a building called the Doorgah.The\n      name of the charger which Hoosein rode when he was killed\n      was Dhulldhull, represented in the procession of the\n      Mohurrum by a spotless white Arab of elegant proportions.The trappings of Dhulldhull are all of solid gold, and a\n      golden bow and quiver of arrows are fixed on the saddle.These extracts from a history of Lucknow before the Mutiny will enable\nmy readers to form some idea of the splendour of the Mohurrum of 1857,\nand the value of the _tazia_ and paraphernalia found, as I said, by a\ncompany of the Ninety-Third.I learned from native troopers that the\ngolden _tazia_ belonging to the crown jewels of Lucknow having\naccompanied the king to Calcutta, a new one was made, for which the\nMahommedan population of Lucknow subscribed _lakhs_ of rupees.In the\neleventh chapter of his _Defence of the Residency_, Mr.L. E. R. Rees\nstates that the Mohurrum was celebrated with unusual splendour and\nfanaticism, commencing that year on the 25th of August, and that on the\n_kutal-ka-rath_, or night of slaughter, a certain Mr.Jones, with ten\nother Christians, deserted to the enemy by undoing a barricaded door\nwhen one of their own number was on sentry over it.But, instead of a\nfavourable reception as they anticipated, the deserters received the\nfitting reward of their treachery from the insurgents; for they were all\nimmediately killed as a sacrifice, and their blood sprinkled on the\ndifferent _tazias_ throughout the city.To return to my own story; I was\ntold by a native jeweller, who was in Lucknow in 1857, that the crescent\nand star alone of the new _tazia_ made for the young king, Brijis\nKuddur, cost five _lakhs_ of rupees.Be that as it may, it fell to a\ncompany of the Ninety-Third to assault the Doorgah, where all this\nconsecrated paraphernalia was stored, and there they found this golden\n_tazia_, with all the gold-embroidered standards, saddle, and\nsaddle-cloth, the gold quiver and arrows of Dhulldhull.There was at the\ntime I write, a certain lieutenant in the company whom I shall call\nJamie Blank.He was known to be very poor, and it was reported in the\nregiment that he used to regularly remit half of his lieutenant\'s pay to\nsupport a widowed mother and a sister, and this fact made the men of the\ncompany consider Jamie Blank entitled to a share in the loot.So when\nthe _tazia_ was discovered, not being very sure whether the diamonds in\nthe crescent and star on the dome were real or imitation, they settled\nto cut off the whole dome, and give it to Jamie; which they did.I don\'t\nknow where Jamie Blank disposed of this particular piece of loot, but I\nwas informed that it eventually found its way to London, and was sold\nfor L80,000.The best part of the story is, however, to come.There was\na certain newspaper correspondent in the camp (not Mr.Russell), who\ndepended on his native servant to translate Hindoostanee names into\nEnglish.When he heard that a company of the Ninety-Third had found a\ngold _tazia_ of great value, and that they had presented the senior\nlieutenant with the lid of it to enable him to deposit money to purchase\nhis captaincy, the correspondent asked his Madrassi servant the English\nequivalent for _tazia_.Samuel, perhaps not knowing the English word\n_tomb_, but knowing that the _tazia_ referred to a funeral, told his\nmaster that the English for _tazia_ was _coffin_; so it went the round\nof the English papers that among the plunder of Lucknow a certain\ncompany of the Ninety-Third had found a gold coffin, and that they had\ngenerously presented the senior lieutenant with the lid of it, which was\nstudded with diamonds and other precious stones.So far as I am aware,\nthis is the first time that the true explanation of Jamie Blank\'s golden\ncoffin-lid has been given to the world.As already mentioned, with the exception of the company which captured\nthe golden _tazia_ and the Mohurrum paraphernalia, the Ninety-Third got\nvery little loot; and by the time we returned to the city order was in\nsome measure restored, prize-agents appointed, and guards placed at the\ndifferent thoroughfares to intercept camp-followers and other plunderers\non their way back to camp, who were thus made to disgorge their\nplunder, nominally for the public good or the benefit of the army.But\nit was shrewdly suspected by the troops that certain small caskets in\nbattered cases, which contained the redemption of mortgaged estates in\nScotland, England, and Ireland, and snug fishing and shooting-boxes in\nevery game-haunted and salmon-frequented angle of the world, found their\nway inside the uniform-cases of even the prize-agents.I could myself\nname one deeply-encumbered estate which was cleared of mortgage to the\ntune of L180,000 within two years of the plunder of Lucknow.I only wish I had to go through a similar campaign with the\nexperience I have now.But that is all very fine thirty-five years\nafter!"There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the\nflood"--my readers know the rest.I missed the flood, and the tide is\nnot likely to turn my way again.Before we left Lucknow the plunder\naccumulated by the prize-agents was estimated at over L600,000\n(according to _The Times_ of 31st of May, 1858), and within a week it\nhad reached a million and a quarter sterling.Each private soldier who served throughout the relief and capture of\nLucknow got prize-money to the value of Rs.17.8; but the thirty _lakhs_\nof treasure which were found in the well at Bithoor, leaving the plunder\nof the Nana Sahib\'s palace out of the calculation, much more than\ncovered that amount.Yet I could myself name over a dozen men who served\nthroughout every engagement, two of whom gained the Victoria Cross, who\nhave died in the almshouse of their native parishes, and several in the\nalmshouse of the Calcutta District Charitable Society!But enough of\nmoralising; I must get back to 1858.Many camp-followers and others managed to evade the guards, and\ncavalry-patrols were put on duty along the different routes on both\nbanks of the Goomtee and in the wider thoroughfares of Lucknow.In my last chapter I gave it as my opinion that the provost-marshal\'s\ncat is the only general which can put a stop to plundering and restore\norder in times like those I describe, or rather I should say, _which I\ncannot_ describe, because it is impossible to find words to depict the\nscenes which met one\'s eyes at every turn in the streets of Lucknow.In\nand around Huzrutgunge, the Imambara, and Kaiserbagh mad riot and chaos\nreigned,--sights fit only for the Inferno.I had heard the phrase "drunk\nwith plunder"; I then saw it illustrated in real earnest.Soldiers mad\nwith pillage and wild with excitement, followed by crowds of\ncamp-followers too cowardly to go to the front, but as ravenous as the\nvultures which followed the army and preyed on the carcases of the\nslain.I have already said that many of the enemy had to be dislodged\nfrom close rooms by throwing in bags of gunpowder with slow matches\nfixed to them."When these exploded they set fire to clothing,\ncotton-padded quilts, and other furniture in the rooms; and the\nconsequence was that in the inner apartments of the palaces there were\nhundreds of dead bodies half burnt; many wounded were burnt alive with\nthe dead, and the stench from such rooms was horrible!Historians tell\nus that Charles the Ninth of France asserted that the smell of a dead\nenemy was always sweet.If he had experienced the streets of Lucknow in\nMarch, 1858, he might have had cause to modify his opinion."FOOTNOTES:\n\n[42] L10,000.CHAPTER XIV\n\nAN UNGRATEFUL DUTY--CAPTAIN BURROUGHS--THE DILKOOSHA AGAIN--GENERAL\nWALPOLE AT ROOYAH--THE RAMGUNGA.After the Mutiny some meddling philanthropists in England tried to get\nup an agitation about such stories as wounded sepoys being burnt alive;\nbut owing to the nature of the war it was morally impossible to have\nprevented such accidents.As to cases of real wanton cruelty or outrage\ncommitted by European soldiers, none came under my own notice, and I may\nbe permitted to relate here a story which goes far to disprove any\naccusations of the sort.My company had been posted in a large building and garden near the Mint.Shortly after our arrival an order came for a non-commissioned officer\nand a guard of selected men to take charge of a house with a harem, or\n_zenana_, of about eighty women who had been rescued from different\nharems about the Kaiserbagh,--begums of rank and of no rank, dancing\ngirls and household female slaves, some young and others of very\ndoubtful age.MacBean, our adjutant, selected me for the duty, first\nbecause he said he knew I would not get drunk and thus overlook my\nsense of responsibility; and, secondly, because by that time I had\npicked up a considerable knowledge of colloquial Hindoostanee, and was\nthus able to understand natives who could not speak English, and to make\nmyself understood by them.I got about a dozen old soldiers with me,\nseveral of whom had been named for the duty by Sir Colin Campbell\nhimself, mostly married men of about twenty years\' service.Owing to the\nvicissitudes of my chequered life I have lost my pocket roll-book, and\ndo not now recollect the whole of the names of the men who formed this\nguard.However, John Ellis, whose wife had acted as laundress for Sir\nColin in the Crimea, was one of them, and James Strachan, who was\nnicknamed "the Bishop," was another; John M\'Donald, the fourth of the\nname in my company, was a third; I cannot now name more of them.If any\nof that guard are alive now, they must be from threescore and ten to\nfourscore years of age, because they were then all old men, tried and\ntrue, and, as our adjutant said, Sir Colin had told him that no other\ncorps except the Ninety-Third could be trusted to supply a guard for\nsuch a duty.MacBean, along with a staff or civil officer, accompanied\nthe guard to the house, and was very particular in impressing on my\nattention the fact that the guard was on no pretence whatever to attempt\nto hold any communication with the begums, except through a shrivelled,\nparchment-faced, wicked-looking old woman (as I supposed), who, the\nstaff-officer told me, could speak English, and who had been directed\nto report any shortcomings of the guard, should we not behave ourselves\ncircumspectly.But I must say I had little to fear on that head, for I\nknew every one of my men could be trusted to be proof against the\ntemptation of begums, gold, or grog, and as for myself, I was then a\nyoung non-commissioned officer with a very keen sense of my\nresponsibility.Shortly after we were installed in our position of trust, and the\nofficers had left us, we discovered several pairs of bright eyes peeping\nout at us through the partly shattered venetians forming the doors and\nwindows of the house; and the person whom I had taken for a shrivelled\nold woman came out and entered into conversation with me, at first in\nHindoostanee, but afterwards in very good and grammatical English.I\nthen discovered that what I had mistaken for a crack-voiced old woman, a\nsecond edition of "the mother of the maids," was no other than a\nconfidential eunuch of the palace, who told me he had been over thirty\nyears about the court of Lucknow, employed as a sort of private\nsecretary under successive kings, as he was able to read and write\nEnglish, and could translate the English newspapers, etc., and could\nalso, judging from his villainous appearance, be trusted to strangle a\nrefractory begum or cut the throat of any one prying too closely into\ncourt secrets.He was almost European in complexion, and appeared to me\nto be more than seventy years of age, but he may have been much younger.He also told me that most of his early life had been spent at the court\nof Constantinople, and that he had there learned English, and had found\nthis of great use to him at the court of Lucknow, where he had not only\nkept up the knowledge, but had improved it by reading.By this time one of the younger begums, or nautch girls (I don\'t know\nwhich), came out to see the guard, and did not appear by any means too\nbashful.She evidently wished for a closer acquaintance, and I asked my\nfriend to request her to go back to her companions; but this she\ndeclined to do, and wanted particularly to know why we were dressed in\npetticoats, and if we were not part of the Queen of England\'s regiment\nof eunuchs, and chaffed me a good deal about my fair hair and youthful\nappearance.I was twenty-four hours on that guard before the begums were\nremoved by Major Bruce to a house somewhere near the Martiniere, and\nduring that twenty-four hours I learned more, through the assistance of\nthe English-speaking eunuch, about the virtues of polygamy and the\ndomestic slavery, intrigues, and crimes of the harem than I have learned\nin all my other thirty-five years in India.If I dared, I could write a\nfew pages that would give the Government of India and the public of\nEngland ten times more light on those cherished institutions than they\nnow possess.The authorities professed to take charge of those caged\nbegums for their own safety, but I don\'t think many of them were\nover-thankful for the protection.Major Bruce, with an escort, removed\nthe ladies the next day, and I took leave of my communicative friend and\nthe begums without reluctance, and rejoined my company, glad to be rid\nof such a dangerous charge.Except the company which stormed the Doorgah, the rest of the\nNinety-Third were employed more as guards on our return to the city; but\nabout the 23rd of the month Captain Burroughs and his company were\ndetailed, with some of Brazier\'s Sikhs, to drive a lot of rebels from\nsome mosques and large buildings which were the last positions held by\nthe enemy.If I remember rightly, Burroughs was then fourth on the list\nof captains, and he got command of the regiment five years after,\nthrough deaths by cholera, in Peshawar in 1862.The Ninety-Third had\nthree commanding officers in one day!Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald and\nMajor Middleton both died within a few hours of each other, and\nBurroughs at once became senior major and succeeded to the command, the\nsenior colonel, Sir H. Stisted, being in command of a brigade in Bengal.Burroughs was born in India and was sent to France early for his\neducation, at least for the military part of it, and was a cadet of the\n_Ecole Polytechnique_ of Paris.This accounted for his excellent\nswordsmanship, his thorough knowledge of French, and his foreign accent.Burroughs was an accomplished _maitre d\'armes_.When he joined the\nNinety-Third as an ensign in 1850 he was known as "Wee Frenchie."I\ndon\'t exactly remember his height, I think it was under five feet; but\nwhat he wanted in size he made up in pluck and endurance.He served\nthroughout the Crimean war, and was never a day absent.It was he who\nvolunteered to lead the forlorn hope when it was thought the Highland\nBrigade were to storm the Redan, before it was known that the Russians\nhad evacuated the position.At the relief of Lucknow he was not the\nfirst man through the hole in the Secundrabagh; that was Lance-Corporal\nDunley of Burroughs\' company; Sergeant-Major Murray was the second, and\nwas killed inside; the third was a Sikh _sirdar_, Gokul Sing, of the\nFourth Punjab Infantry, and Burroughs was either the fourth or fifth.He\nwas certainly the first _officer_ of the regiment inside, and was\nimmediately attacked by an Oude Irregular _sowar_ armed with _tulwar_\nand shield, who nearly slashed Burroughs\' right ear off before he got\nproperly on his feet.It was the wire frame of his feather bonnet that\nsaved him; the _sowar_ got a straight cut at his head, but the sword\nglanced off the feather bonnet and nearly cut off his right ear.However, Burroughs soon gathered himself together (there was so little\nof him!)and showed his tall opponent that he had for once met his match\nin the art of fencing; before many seconds Burroughs\' sword had passed\nthrough his opponent\'s throat and out at the back of his neck.Notwithstanding his severe wound, Burroughs fought throughout the\ncapture of the Secundrabagh, with his right ear nearly severed from his\nhead, and the blood running down over his shoulder to his gaiters; nor\ndid he go to have his wound dressed till after he had mustered his\ncompany, and reported to the colonel how many of No.Although his men disliked many of his ways, they were proud of\ntheir little captain for his pluck and good heart.I will relate two\ninstances of this:--When promoted, Captain Burroughs had the misfortune\nto succeed the most popular officer in the regiment in the command of\nhis company, namely, Captain Ewart (now Lieutenant-General Sir John\nAlexander Ewart, K.C.B., etc.), and, among other innovations, Burroughs\ntried to introduce certain _Polytechnique_ ideas new to the\nNinety-Third.At the first morning parade after assuming command of the\ncompany, he wished to satisfy himself that the ears of the men were\nclean inside, but being so short, he could not, even on tiptoe, raise\nhimself high enough to see; he therefore made them come to the kneeling\nposition, and went along the front rank from left to right, minutely\ninspecting the inside of every man\'s ears!The Ninety-Third were all\ntall men in those days, none being under five feet six inches even in\nthe centre of the rear rank of the battalion companies; and the right\nhand man of Burroughs\' company was a stalwart Highlander named Donald\nMacLean, who could scarcely speak English and stood about six feet three\ninches.When Burroughs examined Donald\'s ears he considered them dirty,\nand told the colour-sergeant to put Donald down for three days\' extra\ndrill.Donald, hearing this, at once sprang to his feet from the\nkneeling position and, looking down on the little captain with a look of\nwithering scorn, deliberately said, "She will take three days\' drill\nfrom a man, but not from a monkey!"Of course Donald was at once marched\nto the rear-guard a prisoner, and a charge lodged against him for\n"insubordination and insolence to Captain Burroughs at the time of\ninspection on morning parade."When the prisoner was brought before the\ncolonel he read over the charge, and, turning to Captain Burroughs,\nsaid: "This is a most serious charge, Captain Burroughs, and against an\nold soldier like Donald MacLean who has never been brought up for\npunishment before.Burroughs was ashamed to state\nthe exact words, but beat about the bush, saying that he had ordered\nMacLean three days\' drill, and that he refused to submit to the\nsentence, making use of most insolent and insubordinate language; but\nthe colonel could not get him to state the exact words used, and the\ncolour-sergeant was called as second witness.The colour-sergeant gave a\nplain, straightforward account of the ear-inspection; and when he stated\nhow MacLean had sprung to his feet on hearing the sentence of three\ndays\' drill, and had told the captain, "She will take three days\' drill\nfrom a man, but not from a monkey," the whole of the officers present\nburst into fits of laughter, and even the colonel had to hold his hand\nto his mouth.As soon as he could speak he turned on MacLean, and told\nhim that he deserved to be tried by a court-martial and so forth, but\nended by sentencing him to "three days\' grog stopped."The orderly-room\nhut was then cleared of all except the colonel, Captain Burroughs, and\nthe adjutant, and no one ever knew exactly what passed; but there was no\nrepetition of the kneeling position for ear-inspection on morning\nparade.I have already said that Burroughs had a most kindly heart, and\nfor the next three days after this incident, when the grog bugle\nsounded, Donald MacLean was as regularly called to the captain\'s tent,\nand always returned smacking his lips, and emphatically stating that\n"The captain was a Highland gentleman after all, and not a French\nmonkey."From that day forward, the little captain and the tall\ngrenadier became the best of friends, and years after, on the evening of\nthe 11th of March, 1858, when the killed and wounded were collected\nafter the capture of the Begum\'s Kothee in Lucknow, I saw Captain\nBurroughs crying like a tender-hearted woman by the side of a _dooly_ in\nwhich was stretched the dead body of Donald MacLean, who, it was said,\nreceived his death-wound defending his captain.I have the authority of\nthe late colour-sergeant of No.6 company for the statement that from\nthe date of the death of MacLean, Captain Burroughs regularly remitted\nthirty shillings a month, through the minister of her parish, to\nDonald\'s widowed mother, till the day of her death seven years after.When an action of this kind became generally known in the regiment, it\ncaused many to look with kindly feelings on most of the peculiarities of\nBurroughs.The other anecdote goes back to Camp Kamara and the spring of 1856, when\nthe Highland Brigade were lying there half-way between Balaclava and\nSebastopol.As before noticed, Burroughs was more like a Frenchman than\na Highlander; there were many of his old _Polytechnique_ chums in the\nFrench army in the Crimea, and almost every day he had some visitors\nfrom the French camp, especially after the armistice was proclaimed.Some time in the spring of 1856 Burroughs had picked up a Tartar pony\nand had got a saddle, etc., for it, but he could get no regular groom.Not being a field-officer he was not entitled to a regulation groom, and\nnot being well liked, none of his company would volunteer for the\nbillet, especially as it formed no excuse for getting off other duties.One of the company had accordingly to be detailed on fatigue duty every\nday to groom the captain\'s pony.On a particular day this duty had\nfallen to a young recruit who had lately joined by draft, a man named\nPatrick Doolan, a real Paddy of the true Handy Andy type, who had made\nhis way somehow to Glasgow and had there enlisted into the Ninety-Third.This day, as usual, Burroughs had visitors from the French camp, and it\nwas proposed that all should go for a ride, so Patrick Doolan was called\nto saddle the captain\'s pony.Doolan had never saddled a pony in his\nlife before, and he put the saddle on with the pommel to the tail and\nthe crupper to the front, and brought the pony thus accoutred to the\ncaptain\'s hut.Every one commenced to laugh, and Burroughs, getting into\na white heat, turned on Patrick, saying, "You fool, you have put the\nsaddle on with the back to the front!"Patrick at once saluted, and,\nwithout the least hesitation, replied, "Shure, sir, you never told me\nwhether you were to ride to Balaclava or the front."Burroughs was so\ntickled with the ready wit of the reply that from that day he took\nDoolan into his service as soldier-servant, taught him his work, and\nretained him till March, 1858, when Burroughs had to go on sick leave\non account of wounds.Burroughs was one of the last men wounded in the\ntaking of Lucknow.Some days after the Begum\'s Kothee was stormed, he\nand his company were sent to drive a lot of rebels out of a house near\nthe Kaiserbagh, and, as usual, Burroughs was well in advance of his men.Just as they were entering the place the enemy fired a mine, and the\ncaptain was sent about a hundred feet in the air; but being like a cat\n(in the matter of being difficult to kill, I mean), he fell on his feet\non the roof of a thatched hut, and escaped, with his life indeed, but\nwith one of his legs broken in two places below the knee.It was only\nthe skill of our good doctor Munro that saved his leg; but he was sent\nto England on sick leave, and before he returned I had left the regiment\nand joined the Commissariat Department.This ends my reminiscences of\nCaptain Burroughs.May he long enjoy the rank he has attained in the\npeace of his island home in Orkney!Notwithstanding his peculiarities,\nhe was a brave and plucky soldier and a most kind-hearted gentleman.By the end of March the Ninety-Third returned to camp at the Dilkoosha,\nglad to get out of the city, where we were suffocated by the stench of\nrotting corpses, and almost devoured with flies by day and mosquitoes by\nnight.The weather was now very hot and altogether uncomfortable, more\nespecially since we were without any means of bathing and could obtain\nno regular changes of clothing.By this time numbers of the townspeople had returned to the city and\nwere putting their houses in order, while thousands of _coolies_ and\nlow-caste natives were employed clearing dead bodies out of houses and\nhidden corners, and generally cleaning up the city.When we repassed the scene of our hard-contested struggle, the Begum\'s\npalace,--which, I may here remark, was actually a much stronger position\nthan the famous Redan at Sebastopol,--we found the inner ditch, that had\ngiven us so much trouble to get across, converted into a vast grave, in\nwhich the dead had been collected in thousands and then covered by the\nearth which the enemy had piled up as ramparts.All round Lucknow for\nmiles the country was covered with dead carcases of every kind,--human\nbeings, horses, camels, bullocks, and donkeys,--and for miles the\natmosphere was tainted and the swarms of flies were horrible, a positive\ntorment and a nuisance.The only comfort was that they roosted at night;\nbut at meal-times they were indescribable, and it was impossible to keep\nthem out of our food; our plates of rice would be perfectly black with\nflies, and it was surprising how we kept such good health, for we had\nlittle or no sickness during the siege of Lucknow.During the few days we remained in camp at the Dilkoosha the army was\nbroken up into movable columns, to take the field after the different\nparties of rebels and to restore order throughout Oude; for although\nLucknow had fallen, the rebellion was not by any means over; the whole\nof Oude was still against us, and had to be reconquered.The\nForty-Second, Seventy-Ninth, and Ninety-Third (the regiments which\ncomposed the famous old Highland Brigade of the Crimea) were once more\nformed into one brigade, and with a regiment of Punjab Infantry and a\nstrong force of engineers, the Ninth Lancers, a regiment of native\ncavalry, a strong force of artillery, both light and heavy,--in brief,\nas fine a little army as ever took the field, under the command of\nGeneral Walpole, with Adrian Hope as brigadier,--was detailed for the\nadvance into Rohilcund for the recapture of Bareilly, where a large army\nstill held together under Khan Bahadoor Khan.Every one in the camp\nexpressed surprise that Sir Colin should entrust his favourite\nHighlanders to Walpole.On the morning of the 7th of April, 1858, the time had at last arrived\nwhen we were to leave Lucknow, and the change was hailed by us with\ndelight.We were glad to get away from the captured city, with its\nhorrible smells and still more horrible sights, and looked forward with\npositive pleasure to a hot-weather campaign in Rohilcund.We were to\nadvance on Bareilly by a route parallel with the course of the Ganges,\nso striking our tents at 2 A.M.we marched through the city\nalong the right bank of the Goomtee, past the Moosabagh, where our first\nhalt was made, about five miles out of Lucknow, in the midst of fresh\nfields, away from all the offensive odours and the myriads of flies.One\ninstance will suffice to give my readers some idea of the torment we\nsuffered from these pests.When we struck tents all the flies were\nroosting in the roofs; when the tents were rolled up the flies got\ncrushed and killed by bushels, and no one who has not seen such a sight\nwould credit the state of the inside of our tents when opened out to be\nrepitched on the new ground.After the tents were pitched and the roofs\nswept down, the sweepers of each company were called to collect the dead\nflies and carry them out of the camp.I noted down the quantity of flies\ncarried out of my own tent.The ordinary kitchen-baskets served out to\nthe regimental cooks by the commissariat for carrying bread, rice, etc.,\nwill hold about an imperial bushel, and from one tent there were carried\nout five basketfuls of dead flies.The sight gave one a practical idea\nof one of the ten plagues of Egypt!Being now rid of the flies we could\nlie down during the heat of the day, and have a sleep without being\ntormented.The defeated army of Lucknow had flocked into Rohilcund, and a large\nforce was reported to be collected in Bareilly under Khan Bahadoor Khan\nand Prince Feroze Shah.The following is a copy of one of Khan Bahadoor\nKhan\'s proclamations for the harassment of our advance: "Do not attempt\nto meet the regular columns of the infidels, because they are superior\nto you in discipline and have more guns; but watch their movements;\nguard all the _ghats_ on the rivers, intercept their communications;\nstop their supplies; cut up their piquets and _daks_; keep constantly\nhanging about their camps; give them no rest!"These were, no doubt,\nthe correct tactics; it was the old Mahratta policy revived.However,\nnothing came of it, and our advance was unopposed till we reached the\njungle fort of Nirput Singh, the Rajpoot chief of Rooyah, near the\nvillage of Rhodamow.I was in the\nadvance-guard under command of a young officer who had just come out\nfrom home as a cadet in the H.E.I.Company\'s service, and there being no\nCompany\'s regiments for him, he was attached to the Ninety-Third before\nwe left Lucknow.His name was Wace, a tall young lad of, I suppose,\nsixteen or seventeen years of age.I don\'t remember him before that\nmorning, but he was most anxious for a fight, and I recollect that\nbefore we marched off our camping-ground, Brigadier Hope called up young\nMr.Wace, and gave him instructions about moving along with great\ncaution with about a dozen picked men for the leading section of the\nadvance-guard.We advanced without opposition till sunrise, and then we came in sight\nof an outpost of the enemy about three miles from the fort; but as soon\nas they saw us they retired, and word was passed back to the column.Shortly afterwards instructions came for the advance-guard to wait for\nthe main column, and I remember young Mr.Wace going up to the\nbrigadier, and asking to be permitted to lead the assault on the fort,\nshould it come to a fight.At this time a summons to surrender had been\nsent to the Raja, but he vouchsafed no reply, and, as we advanced, a\n9-pounder shot was fired at the head of the column, killing a drummer\nof the Forty-Second.The attack on the fort then commenced, without any\nattempt being made to reconnoitre the position, and ended in a most\nsevere loss, Brigadier Hope being among the killed.Lieutenant\nWilloughby, who commanded the Sikhs,--a brother of the officer who blew\nup the powder-magazine at Delhi, rather than let it fall into the hands\nof the enemy,--was also killed; as were Lieutenants Douglas and Bramley\nof the Forty-Second, with nearly one hundred men, Highlanders and Sikhs.Hope was shot from a high tree inside the fort, and, at the time, it was\nbelieved that the man who shot him was a European.[43] After we retired\nfrom the fort the excitement was so great among the men of the\nForty-Second and Ninety-Third, owing to the sacrifice of so many\nofficers and men through sheer mismanagement, that if the officers had\ngiven the men the least encouragement, I am convinced they would have\nturned out in a body and hanged General Walpole.The officers who were\nkilled were all most popular men; but the great loss sustained by the\ndeath of Adrian Hope positively excited the men to fury.So heated was\nthe feeling on the night the dead were buried, that if any\nnon-commissioned officer had dared to take the lead, the life of General\nWalpole would not have been worth half an hour\'s purchase.After the force retired,--for we actually retired!--from Rooyah on the\nevening of the 15th of April, we encamped about two miles from the\nplace, and a number of our dead were left in the ditch, mostly\nForty-Second and Sikhs; and, so far as I am aware, no attempt was made\nto invest the fort or to keep the enemy in.They took advantage of this\nto retreat during the night; but this they did leisurely, burning their\nown dead, and stripping and mutilating those of our force that were\nabandoned in the ditch.It was reported in the camp that Colonel Haggard\nof the Ninth Lancers, commanding the cavalry brigade, had proposed to\ninvest the place, but was not allowed to do so by General Walpole, who\nwas said to have acted in such a pig-headed manner that the officers\nconsidered him insane.Rumour added that when Colonel Haggard and a\nsquadron of the Lancers went to reconnoitre the place on the morning of\nthe 16th, it was found empty; and that when Colonel Haggard sent an\naide-de-camp to report this fact to the general, he had replied, "Thank\nGod!"appearing glad that Raja Nirput Singh and his force had slipped\nthrough his fingers after beating back the best-equipped movable column\nin India.These reports gaining currency in the camp made the general\nstill more unpopular, because, in addition to his incapability as an\nofficer, the men put him down as a coward.During the day the mutilated bodies of our men were recovered from the\nditch.The Sikhs burnt theirs, while a large fatigue party of the\nForty-Second and Ninety-Third was employed digging one long grave in a\n_tope_ of trees not far from the camp.About four o\'clock in the\nafternoon the funeral took place, Brigadier Hope and the officers on\nthe right, wrapped in their tartan plaids, the non-commissioned officers\nand the privates on their left, each sewn up in a blanket.Cowie, whom we of the Ninety-Third had nicknamed "the Fighting Padre,"\nafterwards Bishop of Auckland, New Zealand, and the Rev.Ross,\nchaplain of the Forty-Second, conducted the service, Mr.Ross reading\nthe ninetieth Psalm and Mr.The pipers of\nthe Forty-Second and Ninety-Third, with muffled drums, played _The\nFlowers of the Forest_ as a dead march.In all my experience in the army\nor out of it I never witnessed such intense grief, both among officers\nand men, as was expressed at this funeral.Many of all ranks sobbed like\ntender-hearted women.I especially remember our surgeon, "kind-hearted\nBilly Munro" as the men called him; also Lieutenants Archie Butter and\nDick Cunningham, who were aides-de-camp to Adrian Hope.Cunningham had\nrejoined the regiment after recovery from his wounds at Kudjwa in\nOctober, 1857, but they had left him too lame to march, and he was a\nsupernumerary aide-de-camp to Brigadier Hope; he and Butter were both\nalongside the brigadier, I believe, when he was struck down by the\nrenegade ruffian.We halted during the 17th, and strong fatigue-parties were employed with\nthe engineers destroying the fort by blowing up the gateways.The place\nwas ever after known in the Ninety-Third as "Walpole\'s Castle."On the\n18th we marched, and on the 22nd we came upon the retreating rebels at\na place called Sirsa, on the Ramgunga.The Ninth Lancers and\nHorse-Artillery and two companies of the Ninety-Third (I forget their\nnumbers) crossed the Ramgunga by a ford and intercepted the retreat of a\nlarge number of the enemy, who were escaping by a bridge of boats, the\nmaterial for which the country people had collected for them.But their\nretreat was now completely cut off, and about three hundred of them were\nreported either killed or drowned in the Ramgunga.a tremendous sandstorm, with thunder, and rain in\ntorrents, came on.The Ramgunga became so swollen that it was impossible\nfor the detachment of the Ninety-Third to recross, and they bivouacked\nin a deserted village on the opposite side, without tents, the officers\nhailing across that they could make themselves very comfortable for the\nnight if they could only get some tea and sugar, as the men had\nbiscuits, and they had secured a quantity of flour and some goats in the\nvillage.But the boats which the enemy had collected had all broken\nadrift, and there was apparently no possibility of sending anything\nacross to our comrades.This dilemma evoked an act of real cool pluck on\nthe part of our commissariat _gomashta_,[44] _baboo_ Hera Lall\nChatterjee, whom I have before mentioned in my seventh chapter in\nreference to the plunder of a cartload of biscuits at Bunnee bridge on\nthe retreat from Lucknow.By this time Hera Lall had become better\nacquainted with the "wild Highlanders," and was even ready to risk his\nlife to carry a ration of tea and sugar to them.This he made into a\nbundle, which he tied on the crown of his head, and although several of\nthe officers tried to dissuade him from the attempt, he tightened his\n_chudder_[45] round his waist, and declaring that he had often swum the\nHooghly, and that the Ramgunga should not deprive the officers and men\nof a detachment of his regiment of their tea, he plunged into the river,\nand safely reached the other side with his precious freight on his head!This little incident was never forgotten in the regiment so long as Hera\nLall remained the commissariat _gomashta_ of the Ninety-Third.He was\nthen a young man, certainly not more than twenty.Although thirty-five\nmore years of rough-and-tumble life have now considerably grizzled his\nappearance, he must often look back with pride to that stormy April\nevening in 1858, when he risked his life in the Ramgunga to carry a\ntin-pot of tea to the British soldiers.Among the enemy killed that day were several wearing the uniforms\nstripped from the dead of the Forty-Second in the ditch of Rooyah; so,\nof course, we concluded that this was Nirput Singh\'s force, and the\ndefeat and capture of its guns in some measure, I have no doubt,\nre-established General Walpole in the good opinion of the authorities,\nbut not much in that of the force under his command.Nothing else of consequence occurred till about the 27th of April, when\nour force rejoined the Commander-in-Chief\'s column, which had advanced\n_via_ Futtehghur, and we heard that Sir William Peel had died of\nsmallpox at Cawnpore on his way to Calcutta.The news went through the\ncamp from regiment to regiment, and caused almost as much sorrow in the\nNinety-Third as the death of poor Adrian Hope.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[43] See Appendix B.[44] Native assistant in charge of stores.[45] A wrapper worn by Bengalee men and up-country women.CHAPTER XV\n\nBATTLE OF BAREILLY--GHAZIS--A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT--HALT AT BAREILLY\n--ACTIONS OF POSGAON, RUSSOOLPORE, AND NOWRUNGABAD--REST AT LAST!The heat was now very oppressive, and we had many men struck down by the\nsun every day.We reached Shahjehanpore on the 30th of April, and found\nthat every building in the cantonments fit for sheltering European\ntroops had been destroyed by order of the Nana Sahib, who, however, did\nnot himself wait for our arrival.Strange to say, the bridge of boats\nacross the Ramgunga was not destroyed, and some of the buildings in the\njail, and the wall round it, were still standing.Colonel Hale and a\nwing of the Eighty-Second were left here with some guns, to make the\nbest of their position in the jail, which partly dominated the city.The\nShahjehanpore distillery was mostly destroyed, but the native distillers\nhad been working it, and there was a large quantity of rum still in the\nvats, which was found to be good and was consequently annexed by the\ncommissariat.On the 2nd of May we left Shahjehanpore _en route_ for Bareilly, and on\nthe next day reached Futtehgunge Every village was totally deserted,\nbut no plundering was allowed, and any camp-followers found marauding\nwere soon tied up by the provost-marshal\'s staff.Proclamations were\nsent everywhere for the people to remain in their villages, but without\nany effect.Two days later we reached Furreedpore, which we also found\ndeserted, but with evident signs that the enemy were near; and our\nbazaars were full of reports of the great strength of the army of Khan\nBahadoor Khan and Feroze Shah.The usual estimate was thirty thousand\ninfantry, twenty-five thousand cavalry, and about three hundred guns,\namong which was said to be a famous black battery that had beaten the\nEuropean artillery at ball-practice a few months before they mutinied at\nMeerut.The left wing of the Ninety-Third was thrown out, with a\nsquadron of the Lancers and Tombs\' battery, as the advance piquet.As\ndarkness set in we could see the fires of the enemy\'s outposts, their\npatrol advancing quite close to our sentries during the night, but\nmaking no attack.on the 5th of May, according to Sir Colin\'s usual\nplan, three days\' rations were served out, and the whole force was under\narms and slowly advancing before daylight.By sunrise we could see the\nenemy drawn up on the plain some five miles from Bareilly, in front of\nwhat had been the native lines; but as we advanced, they retired.By\nnoon we had crossed the nullah in front of the old cantonments, and,\nexcept by sending round-shot among us at long distances, which did not\ndo much harm, the enemy did not dispute our advance.We were halted in\nthe middle of a bare, sandy plain, and we of the rank and file then got\nto understand why the enemy were apparently in some confusion; we could\nhear the guns of Brigadier Jones ("Jones the Avenger" as he was called)\nhammering at them on the other side.The Ninety-Third formed the extreme\nright of the front line of infantry with a squadron of the Lancers and\nTombs\' battery of horse-artillery.The heat was intense, and when about\ntwo o\'clock a movement in the mango _topes_ in our front caused the\norder to stand to our arms, it attained such a pitch that the barrels of\nour rifles could not be touched by our bare hands!The Sikhs and our light company advanced in skirmishing order, when some\nseven to eight hundred matchlock-men opened fire on them, and all at\nonce a most furious charge was made by a body of about three hundred and\nsixty Rohilla Ghazis, who rushed out, shouting "_Bismillah!Deen!_" Sir Colin was close by, and called out, "Ghazis,\nGhazis!However, they\ninclined to our left, and only a few came on to the Ninety-Third, and\nthese were mostly bayoneted by the light company which was extended in\nfront of the line.The main body rushed on the centre of the\nForty-Second; but as soon as he saw them change their direction Sir\nColin galloped on, shouting out, "Close up, Forty-Second!But that was not so easily done; the Ghazis charged in\nblind fury, with their round shields on their left arms, their bodies\nbent low, waving their _tulwars_ over their heads, throwing themselves\nunder the bayonets, and cutting at the men\'s legs.Colonel Cameron, of\nthe Forty-Second, was pulled from his horse by a Ghazi, who leaped up\nand seized him by the collar while he was engaged with another on the\nopposite side; but his life was saved by Colour-Sergeant Gardener, who\nseized one of the enemy\'s _tulwars_, and rushing to the colonel\'s\nassistance cut off the Ghazi\'s head.General Walpole was also pulled off\nhis horse and received two sword-cuts, but was rescued by the bayonets\nof the Forty-Second.The struggle was short, but every one of the Ghazis\nwas killed.None attempted to escape; they had evidently come on to kill\nor be killed, and a hundred and thirty-three lay in one circle right in\nfront of the colours of the Forty-Second.The Commander-in-Chief himself saw one of the Ghazis, who had broken\nthrough the line, lying down, shamming dead.Sir Colin caught the glance\nof his eye, saw through the ruse, and called to one of the Forty-Second,\n"Bayonet that man!"But the Ghazi was enveloped in a thick quilted tunic\nof green silk, through which the blunt Enfield bayonet would not pass,\nand the Highlander was in danger of being cut down, when a Sikh\n_sirdar_[46] of the Fourth Punjabis rushed to his assistance, and took\nthe Ghazi\'s head clean off with one sweep of his keen _tulwar_.These\nGhazis, with a very few exceptions, were gray-bearded men of the Rohilla\nrace, clad in green, with green turbans and _kummerbunds_,[47] round\nshields on the left arm, and curved _tulwars_ that would split a hair.They only succeeded in wounding about twenty men--they threw themselves\nso wildly on the bayonets of the Forty-Second!One of them, an exception\nto the majority, was quite a youth, and having got separated from the\nrest challenged the whole of the line to come out and fight him.Joiner, the quartermaster of the Ninety-Third, firing his\ncarbine, but missing.Joiner returned the fire with his revolver,\nand the Ghazi then threw away his carbine and rushed at Joiner with his\n_tulwar_.Some of the light company tried to take the youngster\nprisoner, but it was no use; he cut at every one so madly, that they had\nto bayonet him.The commotion caused by this attack was barely over, when word was\npassed that the enemy were concentrating in front for another rush, and\nthe order was given for the spare ammunition to be brought to the front.I was detached with about a dozen men of No.7 company to find the\nammunition-guard, and bring our ammunition in rear of the line.Just as\nI reached the ammunition-camels, a large force of the rebel cavalry, led\nby Feroze Shah in person, swept round the flank and among the baggage,\ncutting down camels, camel-drivers, and camp-followers in all\ndirections.My detachment united with the ammunition-guard and defended\nourselves, shooting down a number of the enemy\'s _sowars_.Ross, chaplain of the Forty-Second, running for his life,\ndodging round camels and bullocks with a rebel _sowar_ after him, till,\nseeing our detachment, he rushed to us for protection, calling out,\n"Ninety-Third, shoot that impertinent fellow!"Bob Johnston, of my\ncompany, shot the _sowar_ down.Ross had no sword nor revolver, and\nnot even a stick with which to defend himself.Moral--When in the field,\n_padres_, carry a good revolver!Ross gained\nour protection, we saw Mr.Russell, of _The Times_, who was ill and\nunable to walk from the kick of a horse, trying to escape on horseback.He had got out of his _dooly_, undressed and bareheaded as he was, and\nleaped into the saddle, as the _syce_ had been leading his horse near\nhim.Several of the enemy\'s _sowars_ were dodging through the camels to\nget at him.We turned our rifles on them, and I shot down the one\nnearest to Mr.Russell, just as he had cut down an intervening\ncamel-driver and was making for "Our Special"; in fact, his _tulwar_ was\nactually lifted to swoop down on Mr.Russell\'s bare head when my bullet\nput a stop to his proceedings.Russell tumble from his saddle\nat the same instant as the _sowar_ fell, and I got a rare fright, for I\nthought my bullet must have struck both.Russell had fallen, and I then saw from the position of the slain\n_sowar_ that my bullet had found its proper billet, and that Mr.Russell\nwas down with sunstroke, the blood flowing freely from his nose.Our Mooltanee Irregulars were after the enemy, and\nI had to hasten to the line with the spare ammunition; but before I left\nMr.Russell to his fate, I called some of the Forty-Second\nbaggage-guards to put him into his _dooly_ and take him to their doctor,\nwhile I hastened back to the line and reported the occurrence to Captain\nDawson.Next morning I was glad to hear that Mr.Russell was still\nalive, and likely to get over his stroke.After this charge of the rebel cavalry we were advanced; but the thunder\nof Jones\' attack on the other side of the city evidently disconcerted\nthe enemy, and they made off to the right of our line, while large\nnumbers of Ghazis concentrated themselves in the main buildings of the\ncity.We suffered more from the sun than from the enemy; and after we\nadvanced into the shelter of a large mango _tope_ we were nearly eaten\nalive by swarms of small green insects, which invaded our bare legs in\nthousands, till we were glad to leave the shelter of the mango trees and\ntake to the open plain again.As night drew on the cantonments were\nsecured, the baggage was collected, and we bivouacked on the plain,\nstrong piquets being thrown out.My company was posted in a small field\nof onions near a _pucca_[48] well with a Persian wheel for lifting the\nwater.We supped off the biscuits in our haversacks, raw onions, and the\ncool water drawn from well, and then went off to sleep.I wish I might\nalways sleep as soundly as I did that night after my supper of raw\nonions and dry biscuits!On the 6th of May the troops were under arms, and advanced on the city\nof Bareilly.But little opposition was offered, except from one large\nhouse on the outskirts of the town, in which a body of about fifty\nRohilla Ghazis had barricaded themselves, and a company (I think it was\nNo.6 of the Ninety-Third) was sent to storm the house, after several\nshells had been pitched into it.This was done without much loss, except\nthat of one man; I now forget his name, but think it was William\nMacDonald.He rushed into a room full of Ghazis, who, before his\ncomrades could get to his assistance, had cut him into sixteen pieces\nwith their sharp _tulwars_!As the natives said, he was cut into\nannas.[49] But the house was taken, and the whole of the Ghazis slain,\nwith only the loss of this one man killed and about half a dozen\nwounded.While this house was being stormed the townspeople sent a deputation of\nsubmission to the Commander-in-Chief, and by ten o\'clock we had pitched\nour camp near the ruins of the church which had been destroyed twelve\nmonths before.Khan Bahadoor Khan and the Nana Sahib were reported to\nhave fled in the direction of the Nepal Terai, while Feroze Shah, with a\nforce of cavalry and guns, had gone back to attack Shahjehanpore.About mid-day on the 6th a frightful accident happened, by which a large\nnumber of camp-followers and cattle belonging to the ordnance-park were\nkilled.Whether for concealment or by design (it was never known which)\nthe enemy had left a very large quantity of gunpowder and loaded shells\nin a dry well under a huge tree in the centre of the old cantonment.The\nwell had been filled to the very mouth with powder and shells, and then\ncovered with a thin layer of dry sand.A large number of ordnance\n_khalasies_,[50] bullock-drivers, and _dooly_-bearers had congregated\nunder the tree to cook their mid-day meal, lighting their fires right on\nthe top of this powder-magazine, when it suddenly exploded with a most\nterrific report, shaking the ground for miles, making the tent-pegs fly\nout of the hard earth, and throwing down tents more than a mile from the\nspot.I was lying down in a tent at the time, and the concussion was so\ngreat that I felt as if lifted clear off the ground.The tent-pegs flew\nout all round, and down came the tents, before the men, many of whom\nwere asleep, had time to get clear of the canvas.By the time we got our\narms free of the tents, bugles were sounding the assembly in all\ndirections, and staff-officers galloping over the plain to ascertain\nwhat had happened.The spot where the accident had occurred was easily\nfound.The powder having been in a deep well, it acted like a huge\nmortar, fired perpendicularly; an immense cloud of black smoke was sent\nup in a vertical column at least a thousand yards high, and thousands of\nshells were bursting in it, the fragments flying all round in a circle\nof several hundred yards.As the place was not far from the\nammunition-park, the first idea was that the enemy had succeeded in\nblowing up the ammunition; but those who had ever witnessed a similar\naccident could see that, whatever had happened, the concussion was too\ngreat to be caused by only one or two waggon-loads of powder.From the\nappearance of the column of smoke and the shells bursting in it, as if\nshot out of a huge mortar, it was evident that the accident was confined\nto one small spot, and the belief became general that the enemy had\nexploded an enormous mine.But after some time the truth became known,\nthe troops were dispersed, and the tents repitched.This explosion was\nfollowed in the afternoon by a most terrific thunderstorm and heavy\nrain, which nearly washed away the camp.The storm came on as the\nnon-commissioned officers of the Ninety-Third and No.2 company were\nfalling in to bury Colour-Sergeant Mackie, who had been knocked down by\nthe sun the day before and had died that forenoon.Just when we were\nlowering the body into the grave, there was a crash of thunder almost as\nloud as the explosion of the powder-mine.The ground becoming soaked\nwith rain, the tent-pegs drew and many tents were again thrown down by\nthe force of the hurricane; and as everything we had became soaked, we\npassed a most uncomfortable night.On the morning of the 7th of May we heard that Colonel Hale and the wing\nof the Eighty-Second left in the jail at Shahjehanpore had been attacked\nby Feroze Shah and the Nana Sahib, and were sore pushed to defend\nthemselves.A brigade, consisting of the Sixtieth Rifles, Seventy-Ninth\nHighlanders, several native regiments, the Ninth Lancers, and some\nbatteries of artillery, under Brigadier John Jones ("the Avenger") was\nat once started back for the relief of Shahjehanpore--rather a gloomy\noutlook for the hot weather of 1858!While this brigade was starting,\nthe remainder of the force which was to hold Bareilly for the hot\nseason, consisting of the Forty-Second, Seventy-Eighth, and\nNinety-Third, shifted camp to the sandy plain near where Bareilly\nrailway station now stands, hard by the little fort in the centre of the\nplain.There we remained in tents during the whole of May, large working\nparties being formed every morning to assist the engineers to get what\nshelter was possible ready for the hottest months.The district jail was\narranged as barracks for the Ninety-Third, and we moved into them on the\n1st of June.The Forty-Second got the old _cutchery_[51] buildings with\na new thatch roof; and the Seventy-Eighth had the Bareilly College.I omitted to mention in its proper place that on the death of Adrian\nHope, Colonel A. S. Leith-Hay, of the Ninety-Third, succeeded to the\ncommand of the brigade, and Major W. G. A. Middleton got command of the\nregiment till we rejoined the Commander-in-Chief, when it was found that\nLieutenant-Colonel Ross, who had exchanged with Lieutenant-Colonel C.\nGordon, had arrived from England and taken command before we retook\nBareilly.We remained in Bareilly from May till October in comparative peace.We\nhad one or two false alarms, and a wing of the Forty-Second, with some\ncavalry and artillery, went out about the beginning of June to disperse\na body of rebels who were threatening an attack on Moradabad.These reminiscences do not, as I have before remarked, profess to be a\nhistory of the Mutiny except in so far as I saw it from the ranks of the\nNinety-Third.But I may correct historical mistakes when I find them,\nand in vol.500, of _The Indian Empire_, by R. Montgomery\nMartin, the following statement occurs: "Khan Bahadoor Khan, of\nBareilly, held out in the Terai until the close of 1859; and then,\nhemmed in by the Goorkhas on one side and the British forces on the\nother, was captured by Jung Bahadoor.The Khan is described as an old\nman, with a long white beard, bent almost double with rheumatic fever.His life is considered forfeited by his alleged complicity in the\nBareilly murders, but his sentence is not yet pronounced."Khan Bahadoor Khan was captured by the Bareilly\npolice-levy early in July, 1858, and was hanged in my presence in front\nof the _kotwalee_ in Bareilly a few days after his capture.He was an\nold man with a long white beard, but not at all bent with age, and there\nwas certainly no want of proof of his complicity in the Bareilly\nmurders.Next to the Nana Sahib he was one of the most active\ninstigators of murder in the rebel ranks.He was a retired judge of the\nCompany\'s service, claiming descent from the ancient rulers of\nRohilcund, whom the English, in the time of Warren Hastings, had\nassisted the Nawab of Lucknow to put down in the Rohilla war.His\ncapture was effected in the following manner:--Colonel W. C. M\'Donald,\nof the Ninety-Third, was on the staff in the Crimea, and he had in his\nemploy a man named Tahir Beg who was a sort of confidential interpreter.Whether this man was Turkish, Armenian, or Bulgarian I don\'t know, but\nthis much I do know; among Mahommedans Tahir Beg was a strict Mussulman,\namong Bulgarians he was a Roman Catholic, and in the Ninety-Third he had\nno objections to be a Presbyterian.He was a good linguist, speaking\nEnglish, French, and Turkish, as well as most of the vernaculars of Asia\nMinor; and when the Crimean war was over, he accompanied Major M\'Donald\nto England in the capacity of an ordinary servant.In 1857, when the\nexpedition under Lord Elgin was being got ready for China, Colonel\nM\'Donald was appointed quarter-master-general, and started for Canton\ntaking Tahir Beg with him as a servant; but, the expedition to China\nhaving been diverted for the suppression of the Mutiny, M\'Donald\nrejoined the regiment with Tahir Beg still with him in the same\ncapacity.From his knowledge of Turkish and Persian Tahir Beg soon made\nhimself master of Hindoostanee, and he lived in the regimental bazaar\nwith the Mahommedan shopkeepers, among whom he professed himself a\nstrict follower of the Prophet.After he became pretty well conversant\nwith the language, it was reported that he gained much valuable']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"How many times must I give me orders?"barked the little sea-captain."Under cover, under cover, and stay under cover, or I\'ll send ye below,\nye gallivanting--Oh!A\nstubby finger pointed in the obscurity.and don\'t ye fire till\nI say so!"Thus made welcome, Rudolph crawled toward a chink among the bags, ran\nthe muzzle of his gun into place, and lay ready for whatever might come\nout of the quaking lights and darknesses beyond.Nothing came, however, except a swollen continuity of sound, a rolling\ncloud of noises, thick and sullen as the smell of burnt gunpowder.It\nwas strange, thought Rudolph, how nothing happened from moment to\nmoment.No yellow bodies came charging out of the hubbub.He himself lay\nthere unhurt; his fellows joked, grumbled, shifted their legs on the\nplatform.At times the heavier, duller sound, which had been the signal\nfor the whole disorder,--one ponderous beat, as on a huge and very slack\nbass-drum,--told that the Black Dog from Rotterdam was not far off.Yet\neven then there followed no shock of round-shot battering at masonry,\nbut only an access of the stormy whistling and jingling."Copper cash," declared the voice of Heywood, in a lull.By the sound,\nhe was standing on the rungs of the ladder, with his head at the level\nof the platform; also by the sound, he was enjoying himself\ninordinately."What a jolly good piece of luck!Firing money at us--like you, Captain.Some unruly gang among them wouldn\'t wait, and forced matters.The beggars have plenty of powder, and little else.Here, in the thick of the fight, was a\nlight-hearted, busy commander, drawing conclusions and extracting news\nfrom chaos."Look out for arrows," continued the speaker, as he crawled to a\nloophole between Rudolph\'s and the captain\'s.Killed one convert and wounded two, there by the water gate.They can\'t get the elevation for you chaps here, though."And again he\nadded, cheerfully, "So far, at least."The little band behind the loopholes lay watching through the smoke,\nlistening through the noise.The Black Dog barked again, and sent a\nshower of money clinking along the wall."How do you like it, Rudie?""It is terrible," answered Rudolph, honestly.Wait till their\nammunition comes; then you\'ll see fun."I say, Kneebone, what\'s your idea?Sniping all night, will it be?--or shall we get a fair chance at \'em?"The captain, a small, white, recumbent spectre, lifted his head and\nappeared to sniff the smoke judicially."They get a chance at us, more like!""My opinion, the\nblighters have shot and burnt themselves into a state o\' mind; bloomin\'\ndelusion o\' grandeur, that\'s what.Wildest of \'em will rush us to-night,\nonce--maybe twice.We stave \'em off, say: that case, they\'ll settle down\nto starve us, right and proper.""Wish a man\ncould smoke up here."Heywood laughed, and turned his head:--\n\n"How much do you know about sieges, old chap?"Outside of school--_testudine facia,_ that sort of\nthing.However," he went on cheerfully, "we shall before long"--He broke\noff with a start."Gone," said Rudolph, and struggling to explain, found his late\nadventure shrunk into the compass of a few words, far too small and bare\nto suggest the magnitude of his decision."They went," he began, "in\na boat--"\n\nHe was saved the trouble; for suddenly Captain Kneebone cried in a voice\nof keen satisfaction, "Here they come!Through a patch of firelight, down the gentle <DW72> of the field, swept\na ragged cohort of men, some bare-headed, some in their scarlet\nnightcaps, as though they had escaped from bed, and all yelling.One of\nthe foremost, who met the captain\'s bullet, was carried stumbling his\nown length before he sank underfoot; as the Mausers flashed from between\nthe sand-bags, another and another man fell to his knees or toppled\nsidelong, tripping his fellows into a little knot or windrow of kicking\narms and legs; but the main wave poured on, all the faster.Among and\nabove them, like wreckage in that surf, tossed the shapes of\nscaling-ladders and notched bamboos.Two naked men, swinging between\nthem a long cylinder or log, flashed through the bonfire space and on\ninto the dark below the wall."Look out for the pung-dong!"His friends were too busy firing into the crowded gloom below.Rudolph,\nfumbling at side-bolt and pulling trigger, felt the end of a ladder bump\nhis forehead, saw turban and mediaeval halberd heave above him, and\nwithout time to think of firing, dashed the muzzle of his gun at the\nclimber\'s face.The shock was solid, the halberd rang on the platform,\nbut the man vanished like a shade."Very neat," growled Heywood, who in the same instant, with a great\nshove, managed to fling down the ladder.While he spoke, however, something hurtled over their heads and thumped\nthe platform.The queer log, or cylinder, lay there with a red coal\nsputtering at one end, a burning fuse.Heywood snatched at it and\nmissed.Some one else caught up the long bulk, and springing to his\nfeet, swung it aloft.Firelight showed the bristling moustache of\nKempner, his long, thin arms poising a great bamboo case bound with\nrings of leather or metal.He threw it out with his utmost force,\nstaggered as though to follow it; then, leaping back, straightened his\ntall body with a jerk, flung out one arm in a gesture of surprise, no\nsooner rigid than drooping; and even while he seemed inflated for\nanother of his speeches, turned half-round and dove into the garden and\nthe night.By the ending of it, he had redeemed a somewhat rancid life.Before, the angle was alive with swarming heads.As he fell, it was\nempty, and the assault finished; for below, the bamboo tube burst with a\nsound that shook the wall; liquid flame, the Greek fire of stink-pot\nchemicals, squirted in jets that revealed a crowd torn asunder, saffron\nfaces contorted in shouting, and men who leapt away with clothes afire\nand powder-horns bursting at their sides.Dim figures scampered off, up\nthe rising ground."That\'s over," panted Heywood."Thundering good lesson,--Here, count\nnoses.Sturgeon, Teppich, Padre, Captain?but\nlook sharp, while I go inspect.""Come down,\nwon\'t you, and help me with--you know."At the foot of the ladder, they met a man in white, with a white face in\nwhat might be the dawn, or the pallor of the late-risen moon.He hailed them in a dry voice, and cleared his throat,\n"Where is she?It was here, accordingly, while Heywood stooped over a tumbled object on\nthe ground, that Rudolph told her husband what Bertha Forrester had\nchosen.The words came harder than before, but at last he got rid of\nthem.It was like telling the news of\nan absent ghost to another present."This town was never a place," said Gilly, with all his former\nsteadiness,--"never a place to bring a woman.All three men listened to the conflict of gongs and crackers, and to the\nshouting, now muffled and distant behind the knoll.All three, as it\nseemed to Rudolph, had consented to ignore something vile."That\'s all I wanted to know," said the older man, slowly."I must get\nback to my post.You didn\'t say, but--She made no attempt to come here?For some time again they stood as though listening, till Heywood\nspoke:--\n\n"Holding your own, are you, by the water gate?""Oh, yes," replied Forrester, rousing slightly.Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle."And this belt--Kempner\'s.Poor chap, he\'ll never ask you to return\nthem.--Anything else?""No," answered Gilly, taking the dead man\'s weapon, and moving off into\nthe darkness."Except if we come to a pinch,\nand need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance.I could do better, now, than--than you younger men.Oh, and Hackh;\nyour efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel\nimmensely grateful."He disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about\nsuch gratitude."Now, then," called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their\nfeet.Trust old Gilly to take it\nlike a man.And between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome\ntheorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired and limp, would\noffend no more by speaking.When the dawn filled the compound with a deep blue twilight, and this in\nturn grew pale, the night-long menace of noise gradually faded also,\nlike an orgy of evil spirits dispersing before cockcrow.To ears long\ndeafened, the wide stillness had the effect of another sound, never\nheard before.Even when disturbed by the flutter of birds darting from\ntop to dense green top of the orange trees, the air seemed hushed by\nsome unholy constraint.Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from\nsmouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale\ndisk of the moon dissolved in light.The convex field stood bare, except\nfor a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a\njagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog\nthrust his round muzzle.In a truce of empty silence, the defenders\nslept by turns among the sand-bags.The day came, and dragged by without incident.The sun blazed in the\ncompound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon.At\nthe water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn\nChristians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building\na rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that\nnow lay scattered along the path.One of these a workman suddenly caught\nat, and with a grunt, held up before the padre.About the shaft, wound tightly with silk thread, ran\na thin roll of Chinese paper.Earle nodded, took the arrow, and slitting with a pocket-knife,\nfreed and flattened out a painted scroll of complex characters.His keen\nold eyes ran down the columns.His face, always cloudy now, grew darker\nwith perplexity.He sat\ndown on a pile of sacks, and spread the paper on his knee."But the\ncharacters are so elaborate--I can\'t make head or tail."He beckoned Heywood, and together they scowled at the intricate and\nmeaningless symbols."No, see here--lower left hand."The last stroke of the brush, down in the corner, formed a loose "O.For all that, the painted lines remained a stubborn puzzle.The padre pulled out a cigar, and smoking\nat top speed, spaced off each character with his thumb."They are all\nalike, and yet"--He clutched his white hair with big knuckles, and\ntugged; replaced his mushroom helmet; held the paper at a new focus.he said doubtfully; and at last, "Yes."For some time he read to\nhimself, nodding."Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?""Take," the padre ordered, "this one; left half?""The right half--might be\n\'rice-scoop,\' But that\'s nonsense."Subtract this twisted character \'Lightning\' from each, and we\'ve made\nthe crooked straight.Here\'s the\nsense of his message, I take it."And he read off, slowly:--\n\n"A Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted\nat her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come\nquickly, day or night.--O.W.""That won\'t help," he said curtly.With the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured\nout on the highest slab of the landing-steps.Across the river, to be\nsure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the\nnorth--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny\nbasket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a\ngreen rag.Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless,\nyet seeming to watch.Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to\nwhere, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the\nmarsh.On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up\nlike a thin black toadstool.He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry,\nsummoning help from further inland.Other hats presently came bobbing\ntoward him, low down among the marsh.Puffs of white spurted out from\nthe mud.And as Heywood dodged back through the gate, and Nesbit\'s rifle\nanswered from his little fort on the pony-shed, the distant crack of the\nmuskets joined with a spattering of ooze and a chipping of stone on the\nriver-stairs."Covered, you see," said Heywood, replacing the bar."Last resort,\nperhaps, that way.Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood\nready here."The shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a\nsignal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the\nnoise of last night broke out afresh.The sun lowered through a brown,\nburnt haze, the night sped up from the ocean, covering the sky with\nsudden darkness, in which stars appeared, many and cool, above the\ntorrid earth and the insensate turmoil.So, without change but from\npause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in\nthe siege.One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt\narrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust.The\npaper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and\nheel-prints: "Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely."And still\nnothing happened to explain the warning.That night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate\nwith four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close\nunder the wall, and would soon become intolerable.He had returned\nsafely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt,\nand a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the\ndefenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under\nwhat in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was\nKempner\'s grave.He was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and\nmade him stoop."I was coming," he said, "to find you.The first night, I saw coolies\nworking in the clay-pit."They\'re keeping such a racket outside," he muttered; and then, half to\nhimself: "It certainly is.Rudie, it\'s--it\'s as if poor Kempner\nwere--waking up."The two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight.CHAPTER XIX\n\n\nBROTHER MOLES\n\nThis new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph\ninto a state of sullen resignation.What was the use now, he thought\nindignantly, of all their watching and fighting?The ground, at any\nmoment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot.He waited for his\nfriend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words.Instead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary."Now we know what\nthe beasts have up their sleeve.He sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a\nBuddha."That\'s why they\'ve all been lying doggo," he continued."And then their\nbad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don\'t care, you see,\nwhether they pot us or not.They\'d rather make one clean sweep, and\n\'blow us at the moon.\'Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they\'re digging,\nthey\'re not blowing.While he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last\ngiving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices.In this\ndiluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark\nhospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials."If it weren\'t for that," he said quietly, "I shouldn\'t much care.Except for the women, this would really be great larks."Then, as a\nshadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: "Ah\nPat!Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!"The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other\nshadows.They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust."Those noises have stopped, down there," he said to Rudolph; and rising,\ngave his orders briefly.The coolies were to dig, strike into the\nsappers\' tunnel, and report at once: "Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let\'s\ntake a holiday.A solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast\nfaint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with\nwater from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness.Heywood\nstooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely\ninto a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content."Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the\ncompradore reports.For a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep.Through the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken\nshadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the\nstars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling.The flutter of his\nleathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still\ndrenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne,\nbroken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a\nbullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers."Queer," mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch."The beggar puts\none shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he\'s\nthinking about?Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts.Wonder what they\'re all"--He put back his cigar, mumbling."Handful of\npoor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round.And all\nthe rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same\nold way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams\nthey had in Marco Polo\'s day."The end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he\nmight have been asleep.Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking.This\nbrief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there\nand wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge.Some quiet\ninfluence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him.It was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more.He had\nfelt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in\nclearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any\nlater harm.With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were\nbrightly interwoven.For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait,\na single comrade in a happy army.Through a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving\nquietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place.Daniel journeyed to the garden.Her hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady\nfingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass.With dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent\nMedea, intent on some white magic."Aren\'t you coming," called Heywood, "to sit with us awhile?""Can\'t, thanks," she replied, without looking up.She moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled\nback at him as from a crypt, and said:--\n\n"Have _you_ been hurt?""I\'ve no time," she laughed, "for lazy able-bodied persons."And she was\ngone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men.With her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another\nfigure, scuffing slowly toward the light.The compradore, his robes lost\nin their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with\ndownward sweep.The two friends rose, and followed him down the\ncourtyard.In passing out, they discovered the padre\'s wife lying\nexhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all\nthe width.Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to\nwhich Rudolph caught the answer.Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly.I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith."Earle," said the young man, gently, "there ought to be no\nneed.Under the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph\'s arm, and\nhalting, shook with quiet merriment.Loose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised\nmound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night.Kempner\'s grave had not been quieter.The compradore stood whispering:\nthey had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were\ngone out to eat their chow."We\'ll see, anyway," said Heywood, stripping off his coat.He climbed\nover the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared.In the long\nmoment which followed, the earth might have closed on him.Once, as\nRudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint\nmomentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and\nshoulders burrowed up again."Big enough hole down there," he reported, swinging clear, and sitting\nwith his feet in the shaft.Three sacks of powder stowed\nalready, so we\'re none too soon.--One sack was leaky.I struck a match,\nand nearly blew myself to Casabianca.""It\ngives us a plan, though.Rudie: are you game for something rather\nfoolhardy?Be frank, now; for if you wouldn\'t really enjoy it, I\'ll give\nold Gilly Forrester his chance."said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy.This is all ours, this part, so!"Give me half a\nmoment start, so that you won\'t jump on my head."And he went wriggling\ndown into the pit.An unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness,\nenveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping,\ncrawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel.Large enough, perhaps,\nfor two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut,\nthrough earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth\nfloor by many hands and bare knees.In\nthe small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he\nbumped Heywood\'s elbow."Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say."The speaker\npatted the ground with quick palms, groping.This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow.I say, Rudie, feel\nabout.I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it\nwas."How\'s the old forearm I gave you?Equal to hauling a\nsack out?Sweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph\'s, and guided it\nto where a powder-bag lay."Now, then, carry on," he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel,\nflung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load."Carry\nthese out--far as we dare--touch \'em off, you see, and block the\npassage.We can use this hole afterward,\nfor listening in, if they try--"\n\nHe cut the sentence short.Their tunnel had begun to <DW72> gently\ndownward, with niches gouged here and there for the passing of\nburden-bearers.Rudolph, toiling after, suddenly found his head\nentangled between his leader\'s boots.An odd little squeak of\nsurprise followed, a strange gurgling, and a succession of rapid shocks,\nas though some one were pummeling the earthen walls."Got the beggar," panted Heywood.Roll clear, Rudie,\nand let us pass.Collar his legs, if you can, and shove."Squeezing past Rudolph in his niche, there struggled a convulsive bulk,\nlike some monstrous worm, too large for the bore, yet writhing.Bare\nfeet kicked him in violent rebellion, and a muscular knee jarred\nsquarely under his chin.He caught a pair of naked legs, and hugged\nthem dearly."Not too hard," called Heywood, with a breathless laugh."Poor\ndevil--must think he ran foul of a genie."Indeed, their prisoner had already given up the conflict, and lay under\nthem with limbs dissolved and quaking."Pass him along," chuckled his captor.Prodded into action, the man stirred limply, and crawled past them\ntoward the mine, while Heywood, at his heels, growled orders in the\nvernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity.In this order they gained\nthe shaft, and wriggled up like ferrets into the night air.Rudolph,\nstanding as in a well, heard a volley of questions and a few timid\nanswers, before the returning legs of his comrade warned him to dodge\nback into the tunnel.Again the two men crept forward on their expedition; and this time the\nleader talked without lowering his voice."That chap," he declared, "was fairly chattering with fright.Coolie, it\nseems, who came back to find his betel-box.The rest are all outside\neating their rice.They stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at\nfirst easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously\nup a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came\nhard in the stifled burrow."Far enough," said Heywood, puffing.Rudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new\nspirit, a spirit of daring.He would try, down here in the bowels of the\nearth, to emulate his friend."But let us reconnoitre," he objected."It will bring us to the clay-pit\nwhere I saw them digging.Let us go out to the end, and look."By his tone, he was proud of the amendment.I say, I didn\'t really--I didn\'t _want_ poor old\nGilly down here, you know."They crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait\nlittle gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay.Suddenly, as the incline once more became a level, they saw a glimmering\nsquare of dusky red, like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet\ncloth.This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader,\nuntil they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut\nportal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with\nwhat seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers.Between\nshadowy mounds of loose earth flickered the light of a fire, small and\ndistant, round which wavered the inky silhouettes of men, and beyond\nwhich dimly shone a yellow face or two, a yellow fist clutched full of\nboiled rice like a snowball.Beyond these, in turn, gleamed other little\nfires, where other coolies were squatting at their supper.Heywood\'s voice trembled with joyful excitement.Mary moved to the bathroom."Look,\nthese bags; not sand-bags at all!Wait a bit--oh, by Jove, wait a bit!"He scurried back into the hill like a great rat, returned as quickly and\nswiftly, and with eager hands began to uncoil something on the clay\nthreshold."Do you know enough to time a fuse?""Neither do I.\nPowder\'s bad, anyhow.Here, quick, lend me a\nknife."He slashed open one of the lower sacks in the bulkhead by the\ndoor, stuffed in some kind of twisted cord, and, edging away, sat for an\ninstant with his knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight."How long,\nRudie, how long?""Too long, or too short, spoils\neverything."Now lie across," he ordered, "and shield the tandstickor."With a\nsudden fuff, the match blazed up to show his gray eyes bright and\ndancing, his face glossy with sweat; below, on the golden clay, the\ntwisted, lumpy tail of the fuse, like the end of a dusty vine.Darkness\nfollowed, quick and blinding.A rosy, fitful coal sputtered, darting out\nshort capillary lines and needles of fire.If it blows up, and caves the earth on\nus--" Heywood ran on hands and knees, as if that were his natural way of\ngoing.Rudolph scrambled after, now urged by an ecstasy of apprehension,\nnow clogged as by the weight of all the hill above them.If it should\nfall now, he thought, or now; and thus measuring as he crawled, found\nthe tunnel endless.When at last, however, they gained the bottom of the shaft, and were\nhoisted out among their coolies on the shelving mound, the evening\nstillness lay above and about them, undisturbed.The fuse could never\nhave lasted all these minutes."Gone out," said Heywood, gloomily.He climbed the bamboo scaffold, and stood looking over the wall.Rudolph\nperched beside him,--by the same anxious, futile instinct of curiosity,\nfor they could see nothing but the night and the burning stars.Underground again, Rudie, and try our first plan.""The Sword-Pen looks to set off his mine\nto-morrow morning."He clutched the wall in time to save himself, as the bamboo frame leapt\nunderfoot.John went to the hallway.Outside, the crest of the <DW72> ran black against a single\nburst of flame.The detonation came like the blow of a mallet on\nthe ribs.Heywood jumped to the ground, and in a\npelting shower of clods, exulted:--\n\n\n"He looked again, and saw it was\nThe middle of next week!"He ran off, laughing, in the wide hush of astonishment.CHAPTER XX\n\n\nTHE HAKKA BOAT\n\n"Pretty fair," Captain Kneebone said.This grudging praise--in which, moreover, Heywood tamely acquiesced--was\nhis only comment.On Rudolph it had singular effects: at first filling\nhim with resentment, and almost making him suspect the little captain of\njealousy; then amusing him, as chance words of no weight; but in the\nunreal days that followed, recurring to convince him with all the force\nof prompt and subtle fore-knowledge.It helped him to learn the cold,\nsalutary lesson, that one exploit does not make a victory.The springing of their countermine, he found, was no deliverance.It had\ntwo plain results, and no more: the crest of the high field, without,\nhad changed its contour next morning as though a monster had bitten it;\nand when the day had burnt itself out in sullen darkness, there burst on\nall sides an attack of prolonged and furious exasperation.The fusillade\nnow came not only from the landward sides, but from a long flotilla of\nboats in the river; and although these vanished at dawn, the fire never\nslackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly\nspotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down.On the night\nfollowing, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded\nwith the blows of battering-rams.By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet\nthe little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven\nhead was trimmed still closer and redder by a bullet, and for Gilbert\nForrester, who showed--with the grave smile of a man when fates are\nplayful--two shots through his loose jacket.He was the only man to smile; for the others, parched by days and\nsweltered by nights of battle, questioned each other with hollow eyes\nand sleepy voices.One at a time, in patches of hot shade, they lay\ntumbled for a moment of oblivion, their backs studded thickly with\nobstinate flies like the driven heads of nails.As thickly, in the dust,\nempty Mauser cartridges lay glistening."And I bought food," mourned the captain, chafing the untidy stubble on\nhis cheeks, and staring gloomily down at the worthless brass."I bought\nchow, when all Saigong was full o\' cartridges!"The sight of the spent ammunition at their feet gave them more trouble\nthan the swarming flies, or the heat, or the noises tearing and\nsplitting the heat.Even Heywood went about with a hang-dog air,\nspeaking few words, and those more and more surly.Once he laughed, when\nat broad noonday a line of queer heads popped up from the earthwork on\nthe knoll, and stuck there, tilted at odd angles, as though peering\nquizzically.Both his laugh, however, and his one stare of scrutiny were\nfilled with a savage contempt,--contempt not only for the stratagem, but\nfor himself, the situation, all things."Dummies--lay figures, to draw our fire.he added, wearily "we couldn\'t waste a shot at \'em now even if they\nwere real."They knew, without being told,\nthat they should fire no more until at close quarters in some\nfinal rush."Only a few more rounds apiece," he continued."Our friends outside must\nhave run nearly as short, according to the coolie we took prisoner in\nthe tunnel.But they\'ll get more supplies, he says, in a day or two.What\'s worse, his Generalissimo Fang expects big reinforcement, any day,\nfrom up country."Perhaps he\'s lying," said Captain Kneebone, drowsily."Wish he were," snapped Heywood."That case," grumbled the captain, "we\'d better signal your Hakka boat,\nand clear out."Again their hollow eyes questioned each other in discouragement.It was\nplain that he had spoken their general thought; but they were all too\nhot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety.Thus, in stupor or\ndoubt, they watched another afternoon burn low by invisible degrees,\nlike a great fire dying.Another breathless evening settled over all--at\nfirst with a dusty, copper light, widespread, as though sky and land\nwere seen through smoked glass; another dusk, of deep, sad blue; and\nwhen this had given place to night, another mysterious lull.Midnight drew on, and no further change had come.Prowlers, made bold by\nthe long silence in the nunnery, came and went under the very walls of\nthe compound.In the court, beside a candle, Ah Pat the compradore sat\nwith a bundle of halberds and a whetstone, sharpening edge after edge,\nplacidly, against the time when there should be no more cartridges.Heywood and Rudolph stood near the water gate, and argued with Gilbert\nForrester, who would not quit his post for either of them."But I\'m not sleepy," he repeated, with perverse, irritating serenity.And that river full of their boats?--Go away."While they reasoned and wrangled, something scraped the edge of the\nwall.They could barely detect a small, stealthy movement above them, as\nif a man, climbing, had lifted his head over the top.Suddenly, beside\nit, flared a surprising torch, rags burning greasily at the end of a\nlong bamboo.The smoky, dripping flame showed no man there, but only\nanother long bamboo, impaling what might be another ball of rags.The\ntwo poles swayed, inclined toward each other; for one incredible instant\nthe ball, beside its glowing fellow, shone pale and took on human\nfeatures.Black shadows filled the eye-sockets, and gave to the face an\nuncertain, cavernous look, as though it saw and pondered.How long the apparition stayed, the three men could not tell; for even\nafter it vanished, and the torch fell hissing in the river, they stood\nbelow the wall, dumb and sick, knowing only that they had seen the head\nof Wutzler.Heywood was the first to make a sound--a broken, hypnotic sound, without\nemphasis or inflection, as though his lips were frozen, or the words\ntorn from him by ventriloquy."We must get the women--out of here."Afterward, when he was no longer with them, his two friends recalled\nthat he never spoke again that night, but came and went in a kind of\nsilent rage, ordering coolies by dumb-show, and carrying armful after\narmful of supplies to the water gate.The word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must\nhold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile\nboats should leave the river."If," said Gilly to Rudolph, while they\nstood thinking under the stars, "if his boat is still there, now that\nhe--after what we saw."At dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river\non the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the\nfarther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag\nand the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat.Even then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed\nout--that her sailors would keep their agreement.And when he had piled,\non the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty\nrose.One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but\nthe other would never be ferried down any stream known to man.He lay\ndying, and the padre could not leave him.All the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because\ndeath, never punctual, now kept them waiting.The flutter of birds,\namong the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over\nthe eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and\nblurred through the dancing heat.A torrid westerly breeze came\nfitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse."Next we\'ll lose the ebb, too, be\n\'anged."Noon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the\ncourtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet."We may go now," he said gravely, "in a few minutes."No more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their\ncounter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered.Captain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and\nlighted the fire on the steps.But not one of the burial party turned\nhis head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as\nthe padre\'s resonant bass continued.When it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove.The captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to\nsee through the smoke that poured into his face.The Hakka boat had, indeed, vanished from her moorings.On the bronze\ncurrent, nothing moved but three fishing-boats drifting down, with the\nsmoke, toward the marsh and the bend of the river, and a small junk that\ntoiled up against wind and tide, a cluster of naked sailors tugging and\nshoving at her heavy sweep, which chafed its rigging of dry rope, and\ngave out a high, complaining note like the cry of a sea-gull."She\'s gone," repeated Captain Kneebone.But the compradore, dragging his bundle of sharp halberds, poked an\ninquisitive head out past the captain\'s, and peered on all sides through\nthe smoke, with comical thoroughness.He dodged back, grinning and\nducking amiably."Moh bettah look-see," he chuckled; "dat coolie come-back, he too muchee\nwaitee, b\'long one piecee foolo-man."Whoever handled the Hakka boat was no fool, but by working\nupstream on the opposite shore, crossing above, and dropping down with\nthe ebb, had craftily brought her along the shallow, so close beneath\nthe river-wall, that not till now did even the little captain spy her.The high prow, the mast, now bare, and her round midships roof, bright\ngolden-thatched with leaves of the edible bamboo, came moving quiet as\nsome enchanted boat in a calm.The fugitives by the gate still thought\nthemselves abandoned, when her beak, six feet in air, stole past them,\nand her lean boatmen, prodding the river-bed with their poles, stopped\nher as easily as a gondola.The yellow steersman grinned, straining at\nthe pivot of his gigantic paddle."Remember _you_ in my will, too!"And the grinning lowdah nodded, as though he understood.They had now only to pitch their supplies through the smoke, down on the\nloose boards of her deck.Then--Rudolph and the captain kicking the\nbonfire off the stairs--the whole company hurried down and safely over\nher gunwale: first the two women, then the few huddling converts, the\nwhite men next, the compradore still hugging his pole-axes, and last of\nall, Heywood, still in strange apathy, with haggard face and downcast\neyes.He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm,\nand in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling,\nnervous and wide awake.He looked to neither right nor left, met nobody\'s eye.The rest of the\ncompany crowded into the house amidships, and flung themselves down\nwearily in the grateful dusk, where vivid paintings and mysteries of\nrude carving writhed on the fir bulkheads.But Heywood, with his dog and\nthe captain and Rudolph, sat in the hot sun, staring down at the\nramshackle deck, through the gaps in which rose all the stinks of the\nsweating hold.The boatmen climbed the high slant of the bow, planted their stout\nbamboos against their shoulders, and came slowly down, head first, like\nstraining acrobats.As slowly, the boat began to glide past the stairs.Thus far, though the fire lay scattered in the mud, the smoke drifted\nstill before them and obscured their silent, headlong transaction.Now,\nthinning as they dropped below the corner of the wall, it left them\nnaked to their enemies on the knoll.At the same instant, from the marsh\nahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an\ninstantaneous mushroom.He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland.They had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole\nchance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn.Heywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing.The face of his friend, by torchlight above the\nwall, had struck him dumb.Now that he spoke, his companions saw,\nexposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a\nframework as on a bier.Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass.Above, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to\nscramble at the sentinel\'s halloo, there sat on a white pony the\nbright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen.Heywood\'s hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of\ncontrol."Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom--\nPoussin\'s picture in the Vatican.--I can\'t stand this, you chaps!"He snatched blindly at his gun, caught instead one of the compradore\'s\nhalberds, and without pause or warning, jumped out into the shallow\nwater.He ran splashing toward the bank, turned, and seemed to waver,\nstaring with wild eyes at the strange Tudor weapon in his hand.Then\nshaking it savagely,--\n\n"This will do!"He wheeled again, staggered to his feet on dry ground, and ran swiftly\nalong the eastern wall, up the rising field, straight toward his mark.Of the men on the knoll, a few fired and missed, the others, neutrals to\ntheir will, stood fixed in wonder.Four or five, as the runner neared,\nsprang out to intercept, but flew apart like ninepins.The watchers in\nthe boat saw the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun, the\nfrightened pony swerve, and his rider go down with the one sweep of that\nHomeric blow.The last they saw of Heywood, he went leaping from sight over the\ncrest, that swarmed with figures racing and stumbling after.The unheeded sentinel in the marsh fled, losing his great hat, as the\nboat drifted round the point into midstream.CHAPTER XXI\n\n\nTHE DRAGON\'S SHADOW\n\nThe lowdah would have set his dirty sails without delay, for the fair\nwind was already drooping; but at the first motion he found himself\ndeposed, and a usurper in command, at the big steering-paddle.Captain\nKneebone, his cheeks white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble\nof his beard, had taken charge.In momentary danger of being cut off\ndownstream, or overtaken from above, he kept the boat waiting along the\noozy shore.Puckering his eyes, he watched now the land, and now the\nriver, silent, furtive, and keenly perplexed, his head on a swivel, as\nthough he steered by some nightmare chart, or expected some instant and\ntransforming sight.Not until the sun touched the western hills, and long shadows from the\nbank stole out and turned the stream from bright copper to vague\niron-gray, did he give over his watch.He left the tiller, with a\nhopeless fling of the arm."Do as ye please," he growled, and cast himself down on deck by the\nthatched house."Go on.--I\'ll never see _him_ again.--The heat, and\nall--By the head, he was--Go on.He sat looking straight before him, with dull eyes that never moved;\nnor did he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the matting sail, slowly\nhoisted above him.The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly\nastern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the\nwind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:--\n\n\n"Ay-ly-chy-ly\nAh-ha-aah!"To the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long,\nmonotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts.Through the rhythm, presently,\nbroke a sound of small-arms,--a few shots, quick but softened by\ndistance, from far inland.The captain stirred, listened, dropped his head, and sat like stone.To\nRudolph, near him, the brief disturbance called up another evening--his\nfirst on this same river, when from the grassy brink, above, he had\nfirst heard of his friend.Now, at the same place, and by the same\nlight, they had heard the last.It was intolerable: he turned his back\non the captain.Inside, in the gloom of the painted cabin, the padre\'s\nwife began suddenly to cry.After a time, the deep voice of her husband,\nspeaking very low, and to her alone, became dimly audible:--\n\n"\'All this is come upon us; yet have we not--Our heart is not turned\nback, neither have our steps declined--Though thou hast sore broken us\nin the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.\'"The little captain groaned, and rolled aside from the doorway."All very fine," he muttered, his head wrapped in his arms."But that\'s\nno good to me.Whether she heard him, or by chance, Miss Drake came quietly from\nwithin, and found a place between him and the gunwale.Mary went back to the bedroom.He did not rouse;\nshe neither glanced nor spoke, but leaned against the ribs of\nsmooth-worn fir, as though calmly waiting.When at last he looked up, to see her face and posture, he gave an angry\nstart."And I thought," he blurted, "be \'anged if sometimes I didn\'t think you\nliked him!"Her dark eyes met the captain\'s with a great and steadfast clearness."No," she whispered; "it was more than that."The captain sat bolt upright, but no longer in condemnation.For a long\ntime he watched her, marveling; and when finally he spoke, his sharp,\ndomineering voice was lowered, almost gentle.I never\nmeant--Don\'t ye mind a rough old beggar, that don\'t know that hasn\'t one\nthing more between him and the grave.And that,\nnow--I wish\'t was at the bottom o\' this bloomin\' river!"They said no more, but rested side by side, like old friends joined\ncloser by new grief.Flounce, the terrier, snuffing disconsolately about\nthe deck, and scratching the boards in her zeal to explore the shallow\nhold, at last grew weary, and came to snuggle down between the two\nsilent companions.Not till then did the girl turn aside her face, as\nthough studying the shore, which now melted in a soft, half-liquid band\nas black as coal-tar, above the luminous indigo of the river.Suddenly Rudolph got upon his feet, and craning outboard from gunwale\nand thatched eaves, looked steadily forward into the dusk.A chatter of\nangry voices came stealing up, in the pauses of the wind.He watched and\nlistened, then quickly drew in his head.Two or three of the voices hailed together, raucously.The steersman,\nleaning on the loom of his paddle, made neither stir nor answer.They\nhailed again, this time close aboard, and as it seemed, in rage.Glancing contemptuously to starboard, the lowdah made some negligent\nreply, about a cargo of human hair.His indifference appeared so real,\nthat for a moment Rudolph suspected him: perhaps he had been bought\nover, and this meeting arranged.The\nvoices began to drop astern, and to come in louder confusion with\nthe breeze.But at this point Flounce, the terrier, spoiled all by whipping up\nbeside the lowdah, and furiously barking.Hers was no pariah\'s yelp: she\nbarked with spirit, in the King\'s English.For answer, there came a shout, a sharp report, and a bullet that ripped\nthrough the matting sail.The steersman ducked, but clung bravely to his\npaddle.Men tumbled out from the cabin, rifles in hand, to join Rudolph\nand the captain.Astern, dangerously near, they saw the hostile craft, small, but listed\nheavily with crowding ruffians, packed so close that their great wicker\nhats hung along the gunwale to save room, and shone dim in the obscurity\nlike golden shields of vikings.A squat, burly fellow, shouting, jammed\nthe yulow hard to bring her about."Save your fire," called Captain Kneebone.As he spoke, however, an active form bounced up beside the squat man at\nthe sweep,--a plump, muscular little barefoot woman in blue.She tore\nthe fellow\'s hands away, and took command, keeping the boat\'s nose\npointed up-river, and squalling ferocious orders to all on board.This small, nimble, capable creature\ncould be no one but Mrs.Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning,\nlong ago....\n\nThe squat man gave an angry shout, and turned on her to wrest away the\nhandle.With great violence, yet with a\nneat economy of motion, the Pretty Lily took one hand from her tiller,\nlong enough to topple him overboard with a sounding splash.Her passengers, at so prompt and visual a joke, burst into shrill,\ncackling laughter.Yet more shrill, before their mood could alter, the\nPretty Lily scourged them with the tongue of a humorous woman.She held\nher course, moreover; the two boats drifted so quickly apart that when\nshe turned, to fling a comic farewell after the white men, they could no\nmore than descry her face, alert and comely, and the whiteness of her\nteeth.Her laughing cry still rang, the overthrown leader still\nfloundered in the water, when the picture blurred and vanished.Down the\nwind came her words, high, voluble, quelling all further mutiny aboard\nthat craft of hers.The tall padre eyed Rudolph with sudden interest,\nand laid his big hand on the young man\'s shoulder."No," answered Rudolph, and shook his head, sadly."We owe that to--some\none else."Later, while they drifted down to meet the sea and the night, he told\nthe story, to which all listened with profound attention, wondering at\nthe turns of fortune, and at this last service, rendered by a friend\nthey should see no more.They murmured awhile, by twos and threes huddled in corners; then lay\nsilent, exhausted in body and spirit.The river melted with the shore\ninto a common blackness, faintly hovered over by the hot, brown, sullen\nevening.Unchallenged, the Hakka boat flitted past the lights of a\nwar-junk, so close that the curved lantern-ribs flickered thin and sharp\nagainst a smoky gleam, and tawny faces wavered, thick of lip and stolid\nof eye, round the supper fire.A greasy, bitter smell of cooking floated\nafter.Then no change or break in the darkness, except a dim lantern or\ntwo creeping low in a sampan, with a fragment of talk from unseen\npassers; until, as the stars multiplied overhead, the night of the land\nrolled heavily astern and away from another, wider night, the stink of\nthe marshes failed, and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and\nsea-room, the voyagers knew that they had gained the roadstead.Ahead,\nfar off and lustrous, a new field of stars hung scarce higher than\ntheir gunwale, above the rim of the world.The lowdah showed no light; and presently none was needed, for--as the\nshallows gave place to deeps--the ocean boiled with the hoary,\ngreen-gold magic of phosphorus, that heaved alongside in soft explosions\nof witch-fire, and sent uncertain smoky tremors playing through the\ndarkness on deck.Rudolph, watching this tropic miracle, could make out\nthe white figure of the captain, asleep near by, under the faint\nsemicircle of the deck-house; and across from him, Miss Drake, still\nsitting upright, as though waiting, with Flounce at her side.Sandra moved to the bathroom.Landward,\nagainst the last sage-green vapor of daylight, ran the dim range of the\nhills, in long undulations broken by sharper crests, like the finny back\nof leviathan basking.Over there, thought Rudolph, beyond that black shape as beyond its\nguarding dragon, lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire, with\nuncounted lives going on, ending, beginning, as though he, and his sore\nloss, and his heart vacant of all but grief, belonged to some\nunheard-of, alien process, to Nature\'s most unworthy trifling.This\nboatload of men and women--so huge a part of his own experience--was\nlike the tiniest barnacle chafed from the side of that dark,\nserene monster.Rudolph stared long at the hills, and as they faded, hung his head.From that dragon he had learned much; yet now all learning was but loss.Of a sudden the girl spoke, in a clear yet guarded voice, too low to\nreach the sleepers.It will be good for\nboth of us."Rudolph crossed silently, and stood leaning on the gunwale beside her."I thought only," he answered, "how much the hills looked so--as a\ndragon."The trembling phosphorus half-revealed her face, pale and\nstill."I was thinking of that, in a way.It reminded me of what he\nsaid, once--when we were walking together."To their great relief, they found themselves talking of Heywood, sadly,\nbut freely, and as it were in a sudden calm.Their friendship seemed,\nfor the moment, a thing as long established as the dragon hills.Years\nafterward, Rudolph recalled her words, plainer than the fiery wonder\nthat spread and burst round their little vessel, or the long play of\nheat-lightning which now, from time to time, wavered instantly along the\neastern sea-line."To go on with life, even when we\nare alone--You will go on, I know.And again she said: "Yes,\nsuch men as he are--a sort of Happy Warrior."And later, in her slow and\nlevel voice: "You learned something, you say.Isn\'t that--what I\ncall--being invulnerable?When a man\'s greater than anything that\nhappens to him--"\n\nSo they talked, their speech bare and simple, but the pauses and longer\nsilences filled with deep understanding, solemnized by the time and the\nplace, as though their two lonely spirits caught wisdom from the night,\nscope from the silent ocean, light from the flickering East.The flashes, meanwhile, came faster and prolonged their glory, running\nbehind a thin, dead screen of scalloped clouds, piercing the tropic sky\nwith summer blue, and ripping out the lost horizon like a long black\nfibre from pulp.The two friends watched in silence, when Rudolph rose,\nand moved cautiously aft.So long as the boiling witch-fire\nturned their wake to golden vapor, he could not be sure; but whenever\nthe heat-lightning ran, and through the sere, phantasmal sail, the\nlookout in the bow flashed like a sharp silhouette through wire\ngauze,--then it seemed to Rudolph that another small black shape leapt\nout astern, and vanished.He stood by the lowdah, watching anxiously.Time and again the ocean flickered into view, like the floor of a\nmeasureless cavern; and still he could not tell.But at last the lowdah\nalso turned his head, and murmured.Their boat creaked monotonously,\ndrifting to leeward in a riot of golden mist; yet now another creaking\ndisturbed the night, in a different cadence.Another boat followed them,\nrowing fast and gaining.In a brighter flash, her black sail fluttered,\nunmistakable.Rudolph reached for his gun, but waited silently.Some chance fisherman, it might be, or any small craft holding the same\ncourse along the coast.Still, he did not like the hurry of the sweeps,\nwhich presently groaned louder and threw up nebulous fire.The\nstranger\'s bow became an arrowhead of running gold.And here was Flounce, ready to misbehave once more.Before he could\ncatch her, the small white body of the terrier whipped by him, and past\nthe steersman.This time, however, as though cowed, she began to\nwhimper, and then maintained a long, trembling whine.Beside Rudolph, the compradore\'s head bobbed up.And in his native tongue, Ah Pat grumbled\nsomething about ghosts.A harsh voice hailed, from the boat astern; the lowdah answered; and so\nrapidly slid the deceptive glimmer of her bow, that before Rudolph knew\nwhether to wake his friends, or could recover, next, from the shock and\necstasy of unbelief, a tall white figure jumped or swarmed over\nthe side.sounded the voice of Heywood, gravely.With fingers\nthat dripped gold, he tried to pat the bounding terrier.She flew up at\nhim, and tumbled back, in the liveliest danger of falling overboard.In a daze, Rudolph gripped the wet and shining hands,\nand heard the same quiet voice: "Rest all asleep, I suppose?To-morrow will do.--Have you any money on you?Toss that\nfisherman--whatever you think I\'m worth.He really rowed like steam,\nyou know."Rudolph flung his purse into the other boat.When he turned, this man\nrestored from the sea had disappeared.But he had only stolen forward,\ndog in arms, to sit beside Miss Drake.So quietly had all happened, that\nnone of the sleepers, not even the captain, was aware.Rudolph drew near\nthe two murmuring voices.\n\n"--Couldn\'t help it, honestly," said Heywood."Can\'t describe, or\nexplain.Just something--went black inside my head, you know.""No: don\'t recall seeing a thing, really, until I pitched away\nthe--what happened to be in my hands.Losing your\nhead, I suppose they call it.The girl\'s question recalled him from his puzzle."I ran, that\'s all.--Oh,\nyes, but I ran faster.--Not half so many as you\'d suppose.Most of \'em\nwere away, burning your hospital.Hence those stuffed hats, Rudie, in the trench.--Only three\nof the lot could run.I merely scuttled into the next bamboo, and kept\non scuttling.Oh, yes, arrow in the\nshoulder--scratch.Of course, when it came dark, I stopped running, and\nmade for the nearest fisherman."But," protested Rudolph, wondering, "we heard shots.""Yes, I had my Webley in my belt.I _told_ you: three of\nthem could run."The speaker patted the terrier in his lap."My dream,\neh, little dog?You _were_ the only one to know.""No," said the girl: "I knew--all the time, that--"\n\nWhatever she meant, Rudolph could only guess; but it was true, he\nthought, that she had never once spoken as though the present meeting\nwere not possible, here or somewhere.Recalling this, he suddenly but\nquietly stepped away aft, to sit beside the steersman, and smile in\nthe darkness.He did not listen, but watched the phosphorus\nwelling soft and turbulent in the wake, and far off, in glimpses of the\ntropic light, the great Dragon weltering on the face of the waters.The\nshape glimmered forth, died away, like a prodigy."Ich lieg\' und besitze."And yet," thought the young man, "I have one pearl from his hoard."That girl was right: like Siegfried tempered in the grisly flood, the\nraw boy was turning into a man, seasoned and invulnerable.Heywood was calling to him:--\n\n"You must go Home with us.I\'ve made a wonderful plan--with\nthe captain\'s fortune!A small white heap across the deck began to rise."How often," complained a voice blurred with sleep, "how often must I\ntell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart\'s all--Good God!"At the captain\'s cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof\nbegan to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with\nsleepy cries of joy.When in\n     London I had printed a pamphlet in Arabic, with all the papers\n     (official) concerning Zebehr Pasha and his action in pushing his\n     son to rebel.It is not long,\n     and would repay translating and publishing.It has all the\n     history and the authentic letters found in the divan of Zebehr\'s\n     son when Gessi took his stockade.It is in a cover, blue and\n     gold.It was my address to people of Soudan--Apologia.Isaiah\n     XIX.19, 20, 21 has a wonderful prophecy about Egypt and the\n     saviour who will come from the frontier."The note enclosed was published in _The Times_ of 5th January, and\nread as follows:--\n\n     "A correspondent writes that it may seem inexplicable why the\n     Mahdi\'s troops attacked Gezireh, which, as its name signifies, is\n     an isle near Berber, but there is an old tradition that the\n     future ruler of the Soudan will be from that isle.Zebehr Rahama\n     knew this, but he fell on leaving his boat at this isle, and so,\n     though the Soudan people looked on him as a likely saviour, this\n     omen shook their confidence in him.He was then on his way to\n     Cairo after swearing his people to rebel (if he was retained\n     there), under a tree at Shaka.Zebehr will most probably be taken\n     prisoner by the Mahdi, and will then take the command of the\n     Mahdi\'s forces.The peoples of the Soudan are very superstitious,\n     and the fall of the flag by a gust of wind, on the proclamation\n     of Tewfik at Khartoum, was looked on as an omen of the end of\n     Mehemet Ali\'s dynasty.There is an old tree opposite Cook\'s\n     office at Jerusalem in Toppet, belonging to an old family, and\n     protected by Sultan\'s Firman, which the Arabs consider will fall\n     when the Sultan\'s rule ends.It lost a large limb during the\n     Turco-Russian war, and is now in a decayed state.There can be no\n     doubt but that the movement will spread into Palestine, Syria,\n     and Hedjaz.At Damascus already proclamations have been posted\n     up, denouncing Turks and Circassians, and this was before Hicks\n     was defeated.It is the beginning of the end of Turkey.Austria\n     backed by Germany will go to Salonica, quieting Russia by letting\n     her go into Armenia--England and France neutralising one another.Sandra went to the kitchen."If not too late, the return of the ex-Khedive Ismail to Egypt,\n     and the union of England and France to support and control the\n     Arab movement, appears the only chance.Ismail would soon come to\n     terms with the Soudan, the rebellion of which countries was\n     entirely due to the oppression of the Turks and Circassians."These expressions of opinion about Egypt and the Soudan may be said to\nhave culminated in the remarkable pronouncement Gordon made to Mr W.\nT. Stead, the brilliant editor of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, on 8th\nJanuary 1884, which appeared in his paper on the following day.The\nsubstance of that statement is as follows:--\n\n     "So you would abandon the Soudan?But the Eastern Soudan is\n     indispensable to Egypt.It will cost you far more to retain your\n     hold upon Egypt proper if you abandon your hold of the Eastern\n     Soudan to the Mahdi or to the Turk than what it would to retain\n     your hold upon Eastern Soudan by the aid of such material as\n     exists in the provinces.Darfour and Kordofan must be abandoned.That I admit; but the provinces lying to the east of the White\n     Nile should be retained, and north of Sennaar.The danger to be\n     feared is not that the Mahdi will march northward through Wady\n     Halfa; on the contrary, it is very improbable that he will ever\n     go so far north.It arises from the influence which the spectacle of a conquering\n     Mahommedan Power established close to your frontiers will\n     exercise upon the population which you govern.In all the cities\n     in Egypt it will be felt that what the Mahdi has done they may\n     do; and, as he has driven out the intruder and the infidel, they\n     may do the same.Nor is it only England that has to face this\n     danger.John went to the office.The success of the Mahdi has already excited dangerous\n     fermentation in Arabia and Syria.Placards have been posted in\n     Damascus calling upon the population to rise and drive out the\n     Turks.If the whole of the Eastern Soudan is surrendered to the\n     Mahdi, the Arab tribes on both sides of the Red Sea will take\n     fire.In self-defence the Turks are bound to do something to cope\n     with so formidable a danger, for it is quite possible that if\n     nothing is done the whole of the Eastern Question may be reopened\n     by the triumph of the Mahdi.I see it is proposed to fortify Wady\n     Halfa, and prepare there to resist the Mahdi\'s attack.You might\n     as well fortify against a fever.Contagion of that kind cannot be\n     kept out by fortifications and garrisons.But that it is real,\n     and that it does exist, will be denied by no one cognisant with\n     Egypt and the East.In self-defence the policy of evacuation\n     cannot possibly be justified.You have 6000 men in\n     Khartoum.You have garrisons\n     in Darfour, in Bahr el Gazelle, and Gondokoro.Are they to be\n     sacrificed?Their only offence is their loyalty to their\n     Sovereign.For their fidelity you are going to abandon them to\n     their fate.You say they are to retire upon Wady Halfa.But\n     Gondokoro is 1500 miles from Khartoum, and Khartoum is only 350\n     from Wady Halfa.How will you move your 6000 men from\n     Khartoum--to say nothing of other places--and all the Europeans\n     in that city through the desert to Wady Halfa?Where are you\n     going to get the camels to take them away?Will the Mahdi supply\n     them?If they are to escape with their lives, the garrison will\n     not be allowed to leave with a coat on their backs.They will be\n     plundered to the skin, and even then their lives may not be\n     spared.Whatever you may decide about evacuation, you cannot\n     evacuate, because your army cannot be moved.You must either\n     surrender absolutely to the Mahdi or defend Khartoum at all\n     hazards.The latter is the only course which ought to be\n     entertained.The Mahdi\'s\n     forces will fall to pieces of themselves; but if in a moment of\n     panic orders are issued for the abandonment of the whole of the\n     Eastern Soudan, a blow will be struck against the security of\n     Egypt and the peace of the East, which may have fatal\n     consequences."The great evil is not at Khartoum, but at Cairo.It is the\n     weakness of Cairo which produces disaster in the Soudan.It is\n     because Hicks was not adequately supported at the first, but was\n     thrust forward upon an impossible enterprise by the men who had\n     refused him supplies when a decisive blow might have been struck,\n     that the Western Soudan has been sacrificed.The Eastern Soudan\n     may, however, be saved if there is a firm hand placed at the helm\n     in Egypt."What then, you ask, should be done?I reply, Place Nubar in\n     power!Nubar is the one supremely able man among Egyptian\n     Ministers.He is proof against foreign intrigue, and he\n     thoroughly understands the situation.Place him in power; support\n     him through thick and thin; give him a free hand; and let it be\n     distinctly understood that no intrigues, either on the part of\n     Tewfik or any of Nubar\'s rivals, will be allowed for a moment to\n     interfere with the execution of his plans.You are sure to find\n     that the energetic support of Nubar will, sooner or later, bring\n     you into collision with the Khedive; but if that Sovereign really\n     desires, as he says, the welfare of his country, it will be\n     necessary for you to protect Nubar\'s Administration from any\n     direct or indirect interference on his part.Nubar can be\n     depended upon: that I can guarantee.He will not take office\n     without knowing that he is to have his own way; but if he takes\n     office, it is the best security that you can have for the\n     restoration of order to the country.Especially is this the case\n     with the Soudan.Nubar should be left untrammelled by any\n     stipulations concerning the evacuation of Khartoum.There is no\n     hurry.The garrisons can hold their own at present.Let them\n     continue to hold on until disunion and tribal jealousies have\n     worked their natural results in the camp of the Mahdi.Nubar\n     should be free to deal with the Soudan in his own way.How he\n     will deal with the Soudan, of course, I cannot profess to say;\n     but I should imagine that he would appoint a Governor-General at\n     Khartoum, with full powers, and furnish him with two millions\n     sterling--a large sum, no doubt, but a sum which had much better\n     be spent now than wasted in a vain attempt to avert the\n     consequences of an ill-timed surrender.Sir Samuel Baker, who\n     possesses the essential energy and single tongue requisite for\n     the office, might be appointed Governor-General of the Soudan,\n     and he might take his brother as Commander-in-Chief."It should be proclaimed in the hearing of all the Soudanese, and\n     engraved on tablets of brass, that a permanent Constitution was\n     granted to the Soudanese, by which no Turk or Circassian would\n     ever be allowed to enter the province to plunder its inhabitants\n     in order to fill his own pockets, and that no immediate\n     emancipation of slaves would be attempted.Immediate emancipation\n     was denounced in 1833 as confiscation in England, and it is no\n     less confiscation in the Soudan to-day.Whatever is done in that\n     direction should be done gradually, and by a process of\n     registration.Mixed tribunals might be established, if Nubar\n     thought fit, in which European judges would co-operate with the\n     natives in the administration of justice.Police inspectors also\n     might be appointed, and adequate measures taken to root out the\n     abuses which prevail in the prisons."With regard to Darfour, I should think that Nubar would probably\n     send back the family and the heir of the Sultan of Darfour.If\n     subsidized by the Government, and sent back with Sir Samuel\n     Baker, he would not have much difficulty in regaining possession\n     of the kingdom of Darfour, which was formerly one of the best\n     governed of African countries.As regards Abyssinia, the old\n     warning should not be lost sight of--"Put not your trust in\n     princes"; and place no reliance upon the King of Abyssinia, at\n     least outside his own country.Zeylah and Bogos might be ceded to\n     him with advantage, and the free right of entry by the port of\n     Massowah might be added; but it would be a mistake to give him\n     possession of Massowah which he would ruin.A Commission might\n     also be sent down with advantage to examine the state of things\n     in Harrar, opposite Aden, and see what iniquities are going on\n     there, as also at Berbera and Zeylah.By these means, and by the\n     adoption of a steady, consistent policy at headquarters, it would\n     be possible--not to say easy--to re-establish the authority of\n     the Khedive between the Red Sea and Sennaar."As to the cost of the Soudan, it is a mistake to suppose that it\n     will necessarily be a charge on the Egyptian Exchequer.It will\n     cost two millions to relieve the garrisons and to quell the\n     revolt; but that expenditure must be incurred any way; and in all\n     probability, if the garrisons are handed over to be massacred and\n     the country evacuated, the ultimate expenditure would exceed that\n     sum.At first, until the country is pacified, the Soudan will\n     need a subsidy of L200,000 a year from Egypt.That, however,\n     would be temporary.During the last years of my administration\n     the Soudan involved no charge upon the Egyptian Exchequer.The\n     bad provinces were balanced against the good, and an equilibrium\n     was established.The Soudan will never be a source of revenue to\n     Egypt, but it need not be a source of expense.That deficits have\n     arisen, and that the present disaster has occurred, is entirely\n     attributable to a single cause, and that is, the grossest\n     misgovernment."The cause of the rising in the Soudan is the cause of all\n     popular risings against Turkish rule, wherever they have\n     occurred.No one who has been in a Turkish province, and has\n     witnessed the results of the Bashi-Bazouk system, which excited\n     so much indignation some time ago in Bulgaria, will need to be\n     told why the people of the Soudan have risen in revolt against\n     the Khedive.The Turks, the Circassians, and the Bashi-Bazouks\n     have plundered and oppressed the people in the Soudan, as they\n     plundered and oppressed them in the Balkan peninsula.Oppression\n     begat discontent; discontent necessitated an increase of the\n     armed force at the disposal of the authorities; this increase of\n     the army force involved an increase of expenditure, which again\n     was attempted to be met by increasing taxation, and that still\n     further increased the discontent.And so things went on in a\n     dismal circle, until they culminated, after repeated deficits, in\n     a disastrous rebellion.That the people were justified in\n     rebelling, nobody who knows the treatment to which they were\n     subjected will attempt to deny.Their cries were absolutely\n     unheeded at Cairo.In despair, they had recourse to the only\n     method by which they could make their wrongs known; and, on the\n     same principle that Absalom fired the corn of Joab, so they\n     rallied round the Mahdi, who exhorted them to revolt against the\n     Turkish yoke.I am convinced that it is an entire mistake to\n     regard the Mahdi as in any sense a religious leader: he\n     personifies popular discontent.All the Soudanese are potential\n     Mahdis, just as all the Egyptians are potential Arabis.The\n     movement is not religious, but an outbreak of despair.Three\n     times over I warned the late Khedive that it would be impossible\n     to govern the Soudan on the old system, after my appointment to\n     the Governor-Generalship.During the three years that I wielded\n     full powers in the Soudan, I taught the natives that they had a\n     right to exist.I waged war against the Turks and Circassians,\n     who had harried the population.I had taught them something of\n     the meaning of liberty and justice, and accustomed them to a\n     higher ideal of government than that with which they had\n     previously been acquainted.As soon as I had gone, the Turks and\n     Circassians returned in full force; the old Bashi-Bazouk system\n     was re-established; my old _employes_ were persecuted; and a\n     population which had begun to appreciate something like decent\n     government was flung back to suffer the worst excesses of Turkish\n     rule.The inevitable result followed; and thus it may be said\n     that the egg of the present rebellion was laid in the three years\n     during which I was allowed to govern the Soudan on other than\n     Turkish principles."The Soudanese are a very nice people.They deserve the sincere\n     compassion and sympathy of all civilised men.I got on very well\n     with them, and I am sincerely sorry at the prospect of seeing\n     them handed over to be ground down once more by their Turkish and\n     Circassian oppressors.Yet, unless an attempt is made to hold on\n     to the present garrisons, it is inevitable that the Turks, for\n     the sake of self-preservation, must attempt to crush them.They\n     deserve a better fate.It ought not to be impossible to come to\n     terms with them, to grant them a free amnesty for the past, to\n     offer them security for decent government in the future.If this\n     were done, and the government entrusted to a man whose word was\n     truth, all might yet be re-established.So far from believing it\n     impossible to make an arrangement with the Mahdi, I strongly\n     suspect that he is a mere puppet, put forward by Elias, Zebehr\'s\n     father-in-law, and the largest slave-owner in Obeid, and that he\n     had assumed a religious title to give colour to his defence of\n     the popular rights."There is one subject on which I cannot imagine any one can\n     differ about.That is the impolicy of announcing our intention to\n     evacuate Khartoum.Even if we were bound to do so we should have\n     said nothing about it.The moment it is known that we have given\n     up the game, every man will go over to the Mahdi.All men worship\n     the rising sun.The difficulties of evacuation will be enormously\n     increased, if, indeed, the withdrawal of our garrison is not\n     rendered impossible."The late Khedive, who is one of the ablest and worst-used men in\n     Europe, would not have made such a mistake, and under him the\n     condition of Egypt proper was much better than it is to-day.Now,\n     with regard to Egypt, the same principle should be observed that\n     must be acted upon in the Soudan.Let your foundations be broad\n     and firm, and based upon the contentment and welfare of the\n     people.Hitherto, both in the Soudan and in Egypt, instead of\n     constructing the social edifice like a pyramid, upon its base, we\n     have been rearing an obelisk which a single push may overturn.Our safety in Egypt is to do something for the people.That is to\n     say, you must reduce their rent, rescue them from the usurers,\n     and retrench expenditure.Nine-tenths of the European _employes_\n     might probably be weeded out with advantage.The remaining\n     tenth--thoroughly efficient--should be retained; but, whatever\n     you do, do not break up Sir Evelyn Wood\'s army, which is destined\n     to do good work.Stiffen it as much as you please, but with\n     Englishmen, not with Circassians.Circassians are as much\n     foreigners in Egypt as Englishmen are, and certainly not more\n     popular.As for the European population, let them have charters\n     for the formation of municipal councils, for raising volunteer\n     corps, and for organising in their own defence.Anything more\n     shameful than the flight from Egypt in 1882 I never read.Let\n     them take an example from Shanghai, where the European settlement\n     provides for its own defence and its own government.I should\n     like to see a competent special Commissioner of the highest\n     standing--such a man, for instance, as the Right Honourable W. E.\n     Forster, who is free at once from traditions of the elders and of\n     the Foreign Office and of the bondholders, sent out to put Nubar\n     in the saddle, sift out unnecessary _employes_, and warn\n     evil-doers in the highest places that they will not be allowed to\n     play any tricks.If that were done, it would give confidence\n     everywhere, and I see no reason why the last British soldier\n     should not be withdrawn from Egypt in six months\' time."A perusal of these passages will suffice to show the reader what\nthoughts were uppermost in Gordon\'s mind at the very moment when he\nwas negotiating about his new task for the King of the Belgians on the\nCongo, and those thoughts, inspired by the enthusiasm derived from his\nnoble spirit, and the perfect self-sacrifice with which he would have\nthrown himself into what he conceived to be a good and necessary work,\nmade him the ready victim of a Government which absolutely did not\nknow what course to pursue, and which was delighted to find that the\nvery man, whom the public designated as the right man for the\nsituation, was ready--nay, eager--to take all the burden on his\nshoulders whenever his own Government called on him to do so, and to\nproceed straight to the scene of danger without so much as asking for\nprecise instructions, or insisting on guarantees for his own proper\ntreatment.There is no doubt that from his own individual point of\nview, and as affecting any selfish or personal consideration he had at\nheart, this mode of action was very unwise and reprehensible, and a\nworldly censure would be the more severe on Gordon, because he acted\nwith his eyes open, and knew that the gravity of the trouble really\narose from the drifting policy and want of purpose of the very\nMinisters for whom he was about to dare a danger that Gordon himself,\nin a cooler moment, would very likely have deemed it unnecessary to\nface.Into the motives that filled him with a belief that he might inspire a\nGovernment, which had no policy, with one created by his own courage,\nconfidence, and success, it would be impossible to enter, but it can\nbe confidently asserted that, although they were drawn after him _sed\npede claudo_ to expend millions of treasure and thousands of lives,\nthey were never inspired by his exhortations and example to form a\ndefinite policy as to the main point in the situation, viz., the\ndefence of the Egyptian possessions.In the flush of the moment,\ncarried along by an irresistible inclination to do the things which he\nsaw could be done, he overlooked all the other points of the case, and\nespecially that he was dealing with politicians tied by their party\nprinciples, and thinking more of the passage through the House of some\ndomestic measure of fifth-rate importance than of the maintenance of\nan Imperial interest and the arrest of an outbreak of Mahommedan\nfanaticism which, if not checked, might call for a crusade.He never thought but that he was\ndealing with other Englishmen equally mindful with himself of their\ncountry\'s fame.If Gordon, long before he took up the task, had been engrossed in the\ndevelopment of the Soudan difficulty and the Mahdi\'s power, those who\nhad studied the question and knew his special qualifications for the\ntask, had, at a very early stage of the trouble, called upon the\nGovernment to avail themselves of his services, and there is no doubt\nthat if that advice had been promptly taken instead of slowly,\nreluctantly, and only when matters were desperate, there is no doubt,\nI repeat, remembering what he did later on, that Gordon would have\nbeen able, without a single English regiment, to have strangled the\nMahdi\'s power in its infancy, and to have won back the Soudan for the\nKhedive.But it may be said, where was it ever prominently suggested that\nGeneral Gordon should be despatched to the Soudan at a time before the\nMahdi had become supreme in that region, as he undoubtedly did by the\noverthrow of Hicks and his force?I reply by the following quotations from prominent articles written by\nmyself in _The Times_ of January and February 1883.Until the capture\nof El Obeid at that period the movement of the Mahdi was a local\naffair of the importance of which no one, at a distance, could attempt\nto judge, but that signal success made it the immediate concern of\nthose responsible in Egypt.On 9th January 1883, in an article in _The\nTimes_ on "The Soudan," occurs this passage:--\n\n     "It is a misfortune, in the interests of Egypt, of civilisation,\n     and of the mass of the Soudanese, that we cannot send General\n     Gordon back to the region of the Upper Nile to complete there the\n     good work he began eight years ago.With full powers, and with\n     the assurance that the good fruits of his labours shall not be\n     lost by the subsequent acts of corrupt Pashas, there need be\n     little doubt of his attaining rapid success, while the memory of\n     his achievements, when working for a half-hearted Government,\n     and with incapable colleagues, yet lives in the hearts of the\n     black people of the Soudan, and fills one of the most creditable\n     pages in the history of recent administration of alien races by\n     Englishmen."Again, on 17th February, in another article on the same subject:--\n\n     "The authority of the Mahdi could scarcely be preserved save by\n     constant activity and a policy of aggression, which would\n     constitute a standing danger to the tranquillity of Lower Egypt.On the other hand, the preservation of the Khedive\'s sovereign\n     rights through our instrumentality will carry with it the\n     responsibility of providing the unhappy peoples of Darfour,\n     Dongola, Kordofan, and the adjacent provinces with an equitable\n     administration and immunity from heavy taxation.The obligation\n     cannot be avoided under these, or perhaps under any\n     circumstances, but the acceptance of it is not a matter to be\n     entertained with an easy mind.The one thing that would reconcile\n     us to the idea would be the assurance that General Gordon would\n     be sent back with plenary powers to the old scene of his labours,\n     and that he would accept the charge."As Gordon was not resorted to when the fall of El Obeid in the early\npart of the year 1883 showed that the situation demanded some decisive\nstep, it is not surprising that he was left in inglorious inaction in\nPalestine, while, as I and others knew well, his uppermost thought was\nto be grappling with the Mahdi during the long lull of preparing\nHicks\'s expedition, and of its marching to its fate.The catastrophe\nto that force on 4th November was known in London on 22nd November.I urged in every possible way the prompt employment of General Gordon,\nwho could have reached Egypt in a very short time from his place of\nexile at Jaffa.But on this occasion I was snubbed, being told by one\nof the ablest editors I have known, now dead, that "Gordon was\ngenerally considered to be mad."However, at this moment the\nGovernment seem to have come to the conclusion that General Gordon had\nsome qualifications to undertake the task in the Soudan, for at the\nend of November 1883, Sir Charles Dilke, then a member of the Cabinet\nas President of the Local Government Board, but whose special\nknowledge and experience of foreign affairs often led to his assisting\nLord Granville at the Foreign Office, offered the Egyptian Government\nGordon\'s services.They were declined, and when, on 1st December 1883,\nLord Granville proposed the same measure in a more formal manner, and\nasked in an interrogatory form whether General Charles Gordon would be\nof any use, and if so in what capacity, Sir Evelyn Baring, now Lord\nCromer, threw cold water on the project, and stated on 2nd December\nthat "the Egyptian Government were very much averse to employing him."Subsequent events make it desirable to call special attention to the\nfact that when, however tardily, the British Government did propose\nthe employment of General Gordon, the suggestion was rejected, not on\npublic grounds, but on private.Major Baring did not need to be\ninformed as to the work Gordon had done in the Soudan, and as to the\nincomparable manner in which it had been performed.No one knew better\nthan he that, with the single exception of Sir Samuel Baker, who was\nfar too prudent to take up a thankless task, and to remove the\nmountain of blunders others had committed, there was no man living who\nhad the smallest pretension to say that he could cope with the Soudan\ndifficulty, save Charles Gordon.Yet, when his name is suggested, he\ntreats the matter as one that cannot be entertained.There is not a\nword as to the obvious propriety of suggesting Gordon\'s name, but the\nobjection of a puppet-prince like Tewfik is reported as fatal to the\ncourse.Yet six weeks, with the mighty lever of an aroused public\nopinion, sufficed to make him withdraw the opposition he advanced to\nthe appointment, not on public grounds, which was simply impossible,\nbut, I fear, from private feelings, for he had not forgotten the scene\nin Cairo in 1878, when he attempted to control the action of Gordon on\nthe financial question.There would be no necessity to refer to this\nmatter, but for its consequences.Had Sir Evelyn Baring done his duty,\nand given the only honest answer on 2nd December 1883, that if any one\nman could save the situation, that man was Charles Gordon, Gordon\ncould have reached Khartoum early in January instead of late in\nFebruary, and that difference of six weeks might well have sufficed to\ncompletely alter the course of subsequent events, and certainly to\nsave Gordon\'s life, seeing that, after all, the Nile Expedition was\nonly a few days too late.The delay was also attended with fatal\nresults to the civil population of Khartoum.Had Gordon reached there\nearly in January he could have saved them all, for as it was he sent\ndown 2600 refugees, i.e.merchants, old men, women, and children,\nmaking all arrangements for their comfort in the very brief period of\nopen communication after his arrival, when the greater part of\nFebruary had been spent.The conviction that Gordon\'s appointment and departure were retarded\nby personal _animus_ and an old difference is certainly strengthened\nby all that follows.Sir Evelyn Baring and the Egyptian Government\nwould not have Charles Gordon, but they were quite content to entrust\nthe part of Saviour of the Soudan to Zebehr, the king of the\nslave-hunters.On 13th December Lord Granville curtly informed our\nrepresentative at Cairo that the employment of Zebehr was inexpedient,\nand Gordon in his own forcible way summed the matter up thus: "Zebehr\nwill manage to get taken prisoner, and will then head the revolt."But while Sir Evelyn Baring would not have Gordon and the British\nCabinet withheld its approval from Zebehr, it was felt that the\nsituation required that something should be done as soon as possible,\nfor the Mahdi was master of the Soudan, and at any moment tidings\nmight come of his advance on Khartoum, where there was only a small\nand disheartened garrison, and a considerable defenceless population.The responsible Egyptian Ministers made several suggestions for\ndealing with the situation, but they one and all deprecated ceding\nterritory to the Mahdi, as it would further alienate the tribes still\nloyal or wavering and create graver trouble in the future.What they\nchiefly contended for was the opening of the Berber-Souakim route with\n10,000 troops, who should be Turks, as English troops were not\navailable.It is important to note that this suggestion did not shock\nthe Liberal Government, and on 13th December 1883 Lord Granville\nreplied that the Government had no objection to offer to the\nemployment of Turkish troops at Souakim for service in the Soudan.In\nthe following month the Foreign Secretary went one step further, and\n"concurred in the surrender of the Soudan to the Sultan."In fact the\nBritish Government were only anxious about one thing, and that was to\nget rid of the Soudan, and to be saved any further worry in the\nmatter.No doubt, if the Sultan had had the money to pay for the\ndespatch of the expedition, this last suggestion would have been\nadopted, but as he had not, the only way to get rid of the\nresponsibility was to thrust it on Gordon, who was soon discovered to\nbe ready to accept it without delay or conditions.On 22nd December 1883 Sir Evelyn Baring wrote: "It would be necessary\nto send an English officer of high authority to Khartoum with full\npowers to withdraw the garrisons, and to make the best arrangements\npossible for the future government of the country."News from Khartoum\nshowed that everything there was in a state verging on panic, that the\npeople thought they were abandoned by the Government, and that the\nenemy had only to advance for the place to fall without a blow.Lastly\nColonel de Coetlogon, the governor after Hicks\'s death, recommended on\n9th January the immediate withdrawal of the garrison from Khartoum,\nwhich he thought could be accomplished if carried out with the\ngreatest promptitude, but which involved the desertion of the other\ngarrisons.Abd-el-Kader, ex-Governor-General of the Soudan and\nMinister of War, offered to proceed to Khartoum, but when he\ndiscovered that the abandonment of the Soudan was to be proclaimed, he\nabsolutely refused on any consideration to carry out what he termed a\nhopeless errand.All these circumstances gave special point to Sir Evelyn Baring\'s\nrecommendation on 22nd December that "an English officer of high\nauthority should be sent to Khartoum," and the urgency of a decision\nwas again impressed on the Government in his telegram of 1st January,\nbecause Egypt is on the point of losing the Soudan, and moreover\npossesses no force with which to defend the valley of the Nile\ndownwards.But in the many messages that were sent on this subject\nduring the last fortnight of the year 1883, the name of the one\n"English officer of high authority" specially suited for the task\nfinds no mention.As this omission cannot be attributed to ignorance,\nsome different motive must be discovered.At last, on 10th January,\nLord Granville renews his suggestion to send General Gordon, and asks\nwhether he would not be of some assistance under the altered\ncircumstances.The "altered circumstances" must have been inserted for\nthe purpose of letting down Sir Evelyn Baring as lightly as possible,\nfor the only alteration in the circumstances was that six weeks had\nbeen wasted in coming to any decision at all.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.On 11th January Sir\nEvelyn Baring replied that he and Nubar Pasha did not think Gordon\'s\nservices could be utilised, and yet three weeks before he had\nrecommended that "an English officer of high authority" should be\nsent, and he had even complained because prompter measures were not\ntaken to give effect to his recommendation.The only possible\nconclusion is that, in Sir Evelyn Baring\'s opinion, General Gordon was\nnot "an English officer of high authority."As if to make his views\nmore emphatic, Sir Evelyn Baring on 15th January again telegraphed for\nan English officer with the intentional and conspicuous omission of\nGordon\'s name, which had been three times urged upon him by his own\nGovernment.But determined as Sir Evelyn Baring was that by no act or\nword of his should General Gordon be appointed to the Soudan, there\nwere more powerful influences at work than even his strong will.The publication of General Gordon\'s views in the _Pall Mall Gazette_\nof 9th January 1884 had roused public opinion to the importance and\nurgency of the matter.It had also revealed that there was at least\none man who was not in terror of the Mahdi\'s power, and who thought\nthat the situation might still be saved.There is no doubt that that\npublication was the direct and immediate cause of Lord Granville\'s\ntelegram of 10th January; but Sir Evelyn Baring, unmoved by what\npeople thought or said at home, coldly replied on 11th January that\nGordon is not the man he wants.If there had been no other\nconsiderations in the matter, I have no doubt that Sir Evelyn Baring\nwould have beaten public opinion, and carried matters in the high,\ndictatorial spirit he had shown since the first mention of Gordon\'s\nname.But he had not made allowance for an embarrassed and purposeless\nGovernment, asking only to be relieved of the whole trouble, and\nwilling to adopt any suggestion--even to resign its place to "the\nunspeakable Turk"--so long as it was no longer worried in the matter.At that moment Gordon appears on the scene, ready and anxious to\nundertake single-handed a task for which others prescribe armies and\nmillions of money.Public opinion greets him as the man for the\noccasion, and certainly he is the man to suit "that" Government.The\nonly obstruction is Sir Evelyn Baring.Against any other array of\nforces his views would have prevailed, but even for him these are too\nstrong.On 15th January Gordon saw Lord Wolseley, as described in the last\nchapter, and then and there it is discovered and arranged that he will\ngo to the Soudan, but only at the Government\'s request, provided the\nKing of the Belgians will consent to his postponing the fulfilment of\nhis promise, as Gordon knows he cannot help but do, for it was given\non the express stipulation that the claim of his own country should\nalways come first.King Leopold, who has behaved throughout with\ngenerosity, and the most kind consideration towards Gordon, is\nnaturally displeased and upset, but he feels that he cannot restrain\nGordon or insist on the letter of his bond.The Congo Mission is\ntherefore broken off or suspended, as described in the last chapter.In the evening of the 15th Lord Granville despatched a telegram to Sir\nEvelyn Baring, no longer asking his opinion or advice, but stating\nthat the Government have determined to send General Gordon to the\nSoudan, and that he will start without delay.To that telegram the\nBritish representative could make no demur short of resigning his\npost, but at last the grudging admission was wrung from him that\n"Gordon would be the best man."This conclusion, to which anyone\nconversant with the facts, as Sir Evelyn Baring was, would have come\nat once, was therefore only arrived at seven weeks after Sir Charles\nDilke first brought forward Gordon\'s name as the right person to deal\nwith the Soudan difficulty.That loss of time was irreparable, and in\nthe end proved fatal to Gordon himself.In describing the last mission, betrayal, and death of Gordon, the\nheavy responsibility of assigning the just blame to those individuals\nwho were in a special degree the cause of that hero\'s fate cannot be\nshirked by any writer pretending to record history.Lord Cromer has\nfilled a difficult post in Egypt for many years with advantage to his\ncountry, but in the matter of General Gordon\'s last Nile mission he\nallowed his personal feelings to obscure his judgment.He knew that\nGordon was a difficult, let it be granted an impossible, colleague;\nthat he would do things in his own way in defiance of diplomatic\ntimidity and official rigidity; and that, instead of there being in\nthe Egyptian firmament the one planet Baring, there would be only the\nsingle sun of Gordon.All these considerations were human, but they\nnone the less show that he allowed his private feelings, his\nresentment at Gordon\'s treatment of him in 1878, to bias his judgment\nin a matter of public moment.It was his opposition alone that\nretarded Gordon\'s departure by seven weeks, and indeed the delay was\nlonger, as Gordon was then at Jaffa, and that delay, I repeat it\nsolemnly, cost Gordon his life.Whoever else was to blame afterwards,\nthe first against whom a verdict of Guilty must be entered, without\nany hope of reprieve at the bar of history, was Sir Evelyn Baring, now\nLord Cromer.Mr Gladstone and his Government are certainly clear of any reflection\nin this stage of the matter.They did their best to put forward\nGeneral Gordon immediately on the news coming of the Hicks disaster,\nand although they might have shown greater determination in compelling\nthe adoption of their plan, which they were eventually obliged to do,\nthis was a very venial fault, and not in any serious way blameworthy.Nor did they ever seek to repudiate their responsibility for sending\nGordon to the Soudan, although a somewhat craven statement by Lord\nGranville, in a speech at Shrewsbury in September 1885, to the effect\nthat "Gordon went to Khartoum at his own request," might seem to infer\nthat they did.This remark may have been a slip, or an incorrect mode\nof saying that Gordon willingly accepted the task given him by the\nGovernment, but Mr Gladstone placed the matter in its true light when\nhe wrote that "General Gordon went to the Soudan at the request of\nH.M.Gordon, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Stewart, an officer\nwho had visited the Soudan in 1883, and written an able report on it,\nleft London by the Indian mail of 18th January 1884.The decision to\nsend Colonel Stewart with him was arrived at only at the very last\nmoment, and on the platform at Charing Cross Station the acquaintance\nof the two men bound together in such a desperate partnership\npractically began.It is worth recalling that in that hurried and\nstirring scene, when the War Office, with the Duke of Cambridge, had\nassembled to see him off, Gordon found time to say to one of Stewart\'s\nnearest relations, "Be sure that he will not go into any danger which\nI do not share, and I am sure that when I am in danger he will not be\nfar behind."Gordon\'s journey to Egypt was uneventful, but after the exciting\nevents that preceded his departure he found the leisure of his\nsea-trip from Brindisi beneficial and advantageous, for the purpose of\nconsidering his position and taking stock of the situation he had to\nface.By habit and temperament Gordon was a bad emissary to carry out\ncut-and-dried instructions, more especially when they related to a\nsubject upon which he felt very strongly and held pronounced views.The instructions which the Government gave him were as follows, and I\nquote the full text.They were probably not drawn up and in Gordon\'s\nhands more than two hours before he left Charing Cross, and personally\nI do not suppose that he had looked through them, much less studied\nthem.He went to the Soudan to\nrescue the garrisons, and to carry out the evacuation of the province\nafter providing for its administration.The letter given in the\nprevious chapter shows how vague and incomplete was the agreement\nbetween himself and Ministers.It was nothing more than the expression\nof an idea that the Soudan should be evacuated, but how and under what\nconditions was left altogether to the chapter of accidents.At the\nstart the Government\'s view of the matter and his presented no glaring\ndifference.They sent General Gordon to rescue and withdraw the\ngarrisons if he could do so, and they were also not averse to his\nestablishing any administration that he chose.But the main point on\nwhich they laid stress was that they were to be no longer troubled in\nthe affair.Gordon\'s marvellous qualities were to extricate them from\nthe difficult position in which the shortcomings of the Egyptian\nGovernment had placed them, and beyond that they had no definite\nthought or care as to how the remedy was to be discovered and applied.The following instructions should be read by the light of these\nreflections, which show that, while they nominally started from the\nsame point, Gordon and the Government were never really in touch, and\nhad widely different goals in view:--\n\n                              "FOREIGN OFFICE, _January 18th, 1884_."Her Majesty\'s Government are desirous that you should proceed at\n     once to Egypt, to report to them on the military situation in the\n     Soudan, and on the measures which it may be advisable to take for\n     the security of the Egyptian garrisons still holding positions in\n     that country, and for the safety of the European population in\n     Khartoum."You are also desired to consider and report upon the best mode\n     of effecting the evacuation of the interior of the Soudan, and\n     upon the manner in which the safety and the good administration\n     by the Egyptian Government of the ports on the sea-coast can best\n     be secured."In connection with this subject, you should pay especial\n     consideration to the question of the steps that may usefully be\n     taken to counteract the stimulus which it is feared may possibly\n     be given to the Slave Trade by the present insurrectionary\n     movement and by the withdrawal of the Egyptian authority from the\n     interior."You will be under the instructions of Her Majesty\'s Agent and\n     Consul-General at Cairo, through whom your Reports to Her\n     Majesty\'s Government should be sent, under flying seal."You will consider yourself authorized and instructed to perform\n     such other duties as the Egyptian Government may desire to\n     entrust to you, and as may be communicated to you by Sir E.\n     Baring.You will be accompanied by Colonel Stewart, who will\n     assist you in the duties thus confided to you."On your arrival in Egypt you will at once communicate with Sir\n     E. Baring, who will arrange to meet you, and will settle with you\n     whether you should proceed direct to Suakin, or should go\n     yourself or despatch Colonel Stewart to Khartoum _via_ the Nile."General Gordon had not got very far on his journey before he began to\nsee that there were points on which it would be better for him to know\nthe Government\'s mind and to state his own.Neither at this time nor\nthroughout the whole term of his stay at Khartoum did Gordon attempt\nto override the main decision of the Government policy, viz.to\nevacuate the Soudan, although he left plenty of documentary evidence\nto show that this was not his policy or opinion.Moreover, his own\npolicy had been well set forth in the _Pall Mall Gazette_, and might\nbe summed up in the necessity to keep the Eastern Soudan, and the\nimpossibility of fortifying Lower Egypt against the advance of the\nMahdi.But he had none the less consented to give his services to a\nGovernment which had decided on evacuation, and he remained loyal to\nthat purpose, although in a little time it was made clear that there\nwas a wide and impassable gulf between the views of the British\nGovernment and its too brilliant agent.The first doubt that flashed through his mind, strangely enough, was\nabout Zebehr.He knew, of course, that it had been proposed to employ\nhim, and that Mr Gladstone had not altogether unnaturally decided\nagainst it.But Gordon knew the man\'s ability, his influence, and the\nclose connection he still maintained with the Soudan, where his\nfather-in-law Elias was the Mahdi\'s chief supporter, and the paymaster\nof his forces.I believe that Gordon was in his heart of the opinion\nthat the Mahdi was only a lay figure, and that the real author of the\nwhole movement in the Soudan was Zebehr, but that the Mahdi, carried\naway by his exceptional success, had somewhat altered the scope of the\nproject, and given it an exclusively religious or fanatical character.It is somewhat difficult to follow all the workings of Gordon\'s mind\non this point, nor is it necessary to do so, but the fact that should\nnot be overlooked is Gordon\'s conviction in the great power for good\nor evil of Zebehr.Thinking this matter over in the train, he\ntelegraphed from Brindisi to Lord Granville on 30th January, begging\nthat Zebehr might be removed from Cairo to Cyprus.There is no doubt\nas to the wisdom of this suggestion, and had it been adopted the lives\nof Colonel Stewart and his companions would probably have been spared,\nfor, as will be seen, there is good ground to think that they were\nmurdered by men of his tribe.In Cyprus Zebehr would have been\nincapable of mischief, but no regard was paid to Gordon\'s wish, and\nthus commenced what proved to be a long course of indifference.During the voyage from Brindisi to Port-Said Gordon drew up a\nmemorandum on his instructions, correcting some of the errors that had\ncrept into them, and explaining what, more or less, would be the best\ncourse to follow.One part of his instructions had to go by the\nboard--that enjoining him to restore to the ancient families of the\nSoudan their long-lost possessions, for there were no such families in\nexistence.One paragraph in that memorandum was almost pathetic, when\nhe begged the Government to take the most favourable view of his\nshortcomings if he found himself compelled by necessity to deviate\nfrom his instructions.Colonel Stewart supported that view in a very\nsensible letter, when he advised the Government, "as the wisest\ncourse, to rely on the discretion of General Gordon and his knowledge\nof the country."General Gordon\'s original plan was to proceed straight to Souakim, and\nto travel thence by Berber to Khartoum, leaving the Foreign Office to\narrange at Cairo what his status should be, but this mode of\nproceeding would have been both irregular and inconvenient, and it was\nrightly felt that he ought to hold some definite position assigned by\nthe Khedive, as the ruler of Egypt.On arriving at Port-Said he was\nmet by Sir Evelyn Wood, who was the bearer of a private letter from\nhis old Academy and Crimean chum, Sir Gerald Graham, begging him to\n"throw over all personal feelings" and come to Cairo.The appeal could\nnot have come from a quarter that would carry more weight with Gordon,\nwho had a feeling of affection as well as respect for General Graham;\nand, moreover, the course suggested was so unmistakably the right one,\nthat he could not, and did not, feel any hesitation in taking it,\nalthough he was well aware of Sir Evelyn Baring\'s opposition, which\nshowed that the sore of six years before still rankled.Gordon\naccordingly accompanied Sir Evelyn Wood to Cairo, where he arrived on\nthe evening of 24th January.On the following day he was received by\nTewfik, who conferred on him for the second time the high office of\nGovernor-General of the Soudan.It is unnecessary to lay stress on any\nminor point in the recital of the human drama which began with the\ninterview with Lord Wolseley on 15th January, and thence went on\nwithout a pause to the tragedy of 26th January in the following year;\nbut it does seem strange, if the British Government were resolved to\nstand firm to its evacuation policy, that it should have allowed its\nemissary to accept the title of Governor-General of a province which\nit had decided should cease to exist.This was not the only nor even the most important consequence of his\nturning aside to go to Cairo.When there, those who were interested\nfor various reasons in the proposal to send Zebehr to the Soudan, made\na last effort to carry their project by arranging an interview between\nthat person and Gordon, in the hope that all matters in dispute\nbetween them might be discussed, and, if possible, settled.Gordon,\nwhose enmity to his worst foe was never deep, and whose temperament\nwould have made him delight in a discussion with the arch-fiend, said\nat once that he had no objection to meeting Zebehr, and would discuss\nany matter with him or any one else.The penalty of this magnanimity\nwas that he was led to depart from the uncompromising but safe\nattitude of opposition and hostility he had up to this observed\ntowards Zebehr, and to record opinions that were inconsistent with\nthose he had expressed on the same subject only a few weeks and even\ndays before.But even in what follows I believe it is safe to discern\nhis extraordinary perspicuity; for when he saw that the Government\nwould not send Zebehr to Cyprus, he promptly concluded that it would\nbe far safer to take or have him with him in the Soudan, where he\ncould personally watch and control his movements, than to allow him to\nremain at Cairo, guiding hostile plots with his money and influence in\nthe very region whither Gordon was proceeding.This view is supported by the following Memorandum, drawn up by\nGeneral Gordon on 25th January 1884, the day before the interview, and\nentitled by him "Zebehr Pasha _v._ General Gordon":--\n\n     "Zebehr Pasha\'s first connection with me began in 1877, when I\n     was named Governor-General of Soudan.Zebehr was then at Cairo,\n     being in litigation with Ismail Pasha Eyoub, my predecessor in\n     Soudan.Zebehr had left his son Suleiman in charge of his forces\n     in the Bahr Gazelle.Darfour was in complete rebellion, and I\n     called on Suleiman to aid the Egyptian army in May 1877.In June 1877 I went to Darfour, and was engaged with the\n     rebels when Suleiman moved up his men, some 6000, to Dara.It was\n     in August 1877.He and his men assumed an hostile attitude to the\n     Government of Dara.I came down to Dara and went out to\n     Suleiman\'s camp, and asked them to come and see me at Dara.Suleiman and his chiefs did so, and I told them I felt sure that\n     they meditated rebellion, but if they rebelled they would perish.I offered them certain conditions, appointing certain chiefs to\n     be governors of certain districts, but refusing to let Suleiman\n     be Governor of Bahr Gazelle.After some days\' parleying, some of\n     Suleiman\'s chiefs came over to my side, and these chiefs warned\n     me that, if I did not take care, Suleiman would attack me.I\n     therefore ordered Suleiman to go to Shaka, and ordered those\n     chiefs who were inclined to accept my terms in another\n     direction, so as to separate them.On this Suleiman accepted my\n     terms, and he and others were made Beys.He left for Shaka with\n     some 4000 men.He looted the country from Dara to Shaka, and did\n     not show any respect to my orders.The rebellion in Darfour being\n     settled, I went down to Shaka with 200 men.Suleiman was there\n     with 4000.Then he came to me and begged me to let him have the\n     sole command in Bahr Gazelle.I refused, and I put him, Suleiman,\n     under another chief, and sent up to Bahr Gazelle 200 regular\n     troops.Things remained quiet in Bahr Gazelle till I was ordered\n     to Cairo in April 1878, about the finances.I then saw Zebehr\n     Pasha, who wished to go up to Soudan, and I refused.I left for\n     Aden in May, and in June 1878 Suleiman broke out in revolt, and\n     killed the 200 regular troops at Bahr Gazelle.I sent Gessi\n     against him in August 1878, and Gessi crushed him in the course\n     of 1879.Gessi captured a lot of letters in the divan of\n     Suleiman, one of which was from Zebehr Pasha inciting him to\n     revolt.The original of this letter was given by me to H.H.the\n     Khedive, and I also had printed a brochure containing it and a\n     sort of _expose_ to the people of Soudan why the revolt had been\n     put down--viz.that it was not a question of slave-hunting, but\n     one of revolt against the Khedive\'s authority.Copies of this\n     must exist.On the production of this letter of Zebehr to\n     Suleiman, I ordered the confiscation of Zebehr\'s property in\n     Soudan, and a court martial to sit on Zebehr\'s case.This court\n     martial was held under Hassan Pasha Halmi; the court condemned\n     Zebehr to death; its proceedings were printed in the brochure I\n     alluded to.Gessi afterwards caught Suleiman and shot him.With\n     details of that event I am not acquainted, and I never saw the\n     papers, for I went to Abyssinia.Gessi\'s orders were to try him,\n     and if guilty to shoot him.This is all I have to say about\n     Zebehr and myself."Zebehr, without doubt, was the greatest slave-hunter who ever\n     existed.Zebehr is the most able man in the Soudan; he is a\n     capital general, and has been wounded several times.Zebehr has a\n     capacity of government far beyond any statesman in the Soudan.All the followers of the Mahdi would, I believe, leave the Mahdi\n     on Zebehr\'s approach, for they are ex-chiefs of Zebehr.Personally, I have a great admiration for Zebehr, for he is a\n     man, and is infinitely superior to those poor fellows who have\n     been governors of Soudan; but I question in my mind, \'Will Zebehr\n     ever forgive me the death of his son?\'and that question has\n     regulated my action respecting him, for I have been told he bears\n     me the greatest malice, and one cannot wonder at it if one is a\n     father."I would even now risk taking Zebehr, and would willingly bear\n     the responsibility of doing so, convinced, as I am, that Zebehr\'s\n     approach ends the Mahdi, which is a question which has its pulse\n     in Syria, the Hedjaz, and Palestine."It cannot be the wish of H.M.\'s Government, or of the Egyptian\n     Government, to have an intestine war in the Soudan on its\n     evacuation, yet such is sure to ensue, and the only way which\n     could prevent it is the restoration of Zebehr, who would be\n     accepted on all sides, and who would end the Mahdi in a couple of\n     months.My duty is to obey orders of H.M.\'s Government, _i.e._ to\n     evacuate the Soudan as quickly as possible, _vis-a-vis_ the\n     safety of the Egyptian employes."To do this I count on Zebehr; but if the addenda is made that I\n     leave a satisfactory settlement of affairs, then Zebehr becomes a\n     _sine qua non_.\'s\n     Government or Egyptian Government desire a settled state of\n     affairs in Soudan after the evacuation?Do these Governments want\n     to be free of this religious fanatic?If they do, then Zebehr\n     should be sent; and if the two Governments are indifferent, then\n     do not send him, and I have confidence one will (_D.V._) get out\n     the Egyptian employes in three or four months, and will leave a\n     cockpit behind us.It is not my duty to dictate what should be\n     done.I will only say, first, I was justified in my action\n     against Zebehr; second, that if Zebehr has no malice personally\n     against me, I should take him at once as a humanly certain\n     settler of the Mahdi and of those in revolt.I have written this\n     Minute, and Zebehr\'s story may be heard.I only wish that after\n     he has been interrogated, I may be questioned on such subjects as\n     his statements are at variance with mine.I would wish this\n     inquiry to be official, and in such a way that, whatever may be\n     the decision come to, it may be come to in my absence."With respect to the slave-trade, I think nothing of it, for\n     there will always be slave-trade as long as Turkey and Egypt buy\n     the slaves, and it may be Zebehr will or might in his interest\n     stop it in some manner.Daniel moved to the hallway.I will therefore sum up my opinion, viz.that I would willingly take the responsibility of taking Zebehr\n     up with me if, after an interview with Sir E. Baring and Nubar\n     Pasha, they tell \'the mystic feeling\' I could trust him, and\n     which\'mystic feeling\' I felt I had for him to-night when I met\n     him at Cherif Pasha\'s house.Zebehr would have nothing to gain in\n     hunting me, and I would have no fear.In this affair my desire, I\n     own, would be to take Zebehr.I cannot exactly say why I feel\n     towards him thus, and I feel sure that his going would settle the\n     Soudan affair to the benefit of H.M.\'s Government, and I would\n     bear the responsibility of recommending it."C. G. GORDON, Major-General."An interview between Gordon and Zebehr was therefore arranged for 26th\nJanuary, the day after this memorandum was written.On 25th it should\nalso be remembered that the Khedive had again made Gordon\nGovernor-General of the Soudan.Daniel went to the bathroom.Besides the two principals, there were\npresent at this interview Sir Evelyn Baring, Sir Gerald Graham,\nColonel Watson, and Nubar Pasha.Zebehr protested his innocence of the\ncharges made against him; and when Gordon reminded him of his letter,\nsigned with his hand and bearing his seal, found in the divan of his\nson Suleiman, he called upon Gordon to produce this letter, which, of\ncourse, he could not do, because it was sent with the other\nincriminating documents to the Khedive in 1879.The passage in that\nletter establishing the guilt of Zebehr may, however, be cited, it\nbeing first explained that Idris Ebter was Gordon\'s governor of the\nBahr Gazelle province, and that Suleiman did carry out his father\'s\ninstructions to attack him."Now since this same Idris Ebter has not appreciated our kindness\n     towards him, nor shown regard for his duty towards God, therefore\n     do you accomplish his ejection by compulsory force, threats, and\n     menaces, without personal hurt, but with absolute expulsion and\n     deprivation from the Bahr-el-Gazelle, leaving no remnant of him\n     in that region, no son, and no relation.For he is a\n     mischief-maker, and God loveth not them who make mischief."It is highly probable, from the air of confidence with which Zebehr\ncalled for the production of the letter, that, either during the Arabi\nrising or in some other way, he had recovered possession of the\noriginal; but Gordon had had all the documents copied in 1879, and\nbound in the little volume mentioned in the preceding Memorandum, as\nwell as in several of his letters, and the evidence as to Zebehr\'s\ncomplicity and guilt seems quite conclusive.In his Memorandum Gordon makes two conditions: first, "if Zebehr bears\nno malice personally against me, I will take him to the Soudan at\nonce," and this condition is given further force later on in reference\nto "the mystic feeling."The second condition was that Zebehr was only\nto be sent if the Government desired a settled state of affairs after\nthe evacuation.From the beginning of the interview it was clear to\nthose present that no good would come of it, as Zebehr could scarcely\ncontrol his feelings, and showed what they deemed a personal\nresentment towards Gordon that at any moment might have found\nexpression in acts.After a brief discussion it was decided to adjourn\nthe meeting, on the pretence of having search made for the\nincriminating document, but really to avert a worse scene.General\nGraham, in the after-discussion on Gordon\'s renewed desire to take\nZebehr with him, declared that it would be dangerous to acquiesce; and\nColonel Watson plainly stated that it would mean the death of one or\nboth of them.Gordon, indifferent to all considerations of personal\ndanger, did not take the same view of Zebehr\'s attitude towards him\npersonally, and would still have taken him with him, if only on the\nground that he would be less dangerous in the Soudan than at Cairo;\nbut the authorities would not acquiesce in a proposition that they\nconsidered would inevitably entail the murder of Gordon at an early\nstage of the journey.They cannot, from any point of view, be greatly\nblamed in this matter; and when Gordon complains later on, as he\nfrequently did complain, about the matter, the decision must be with\nhis friends at Cairo, for they strictly conformed with the first\ncondition specified in his own Memorandum.At the same time, he was\nperfectly correct in his views as to Zebehr\'s power and capacity for\nmischief, and it was certainly very unfortunate and wrong that his\nearlier suggestion of removing him to Cyprus or some other place of\nsafety was not adopted.The following new correspondence will at least suggest a doubt whether\nGordon was not more correct in his view of Zebehr\'s attitude towards\nhimself than his friends.What they deemed strong resentment and a\nbitter personal feeling towards Gordon on the part of Zebehr, he\nconsidered merely the passing excitement from discussing a matter of\ngreat moment and interest.He would still have taken Zebehr with him,\nand for many weeks after his arrival at Khartoum he expected that, in\nreply to his frequently reiterated messages, "Send me Zebehr," the\nex-Dictator of the Soudan would be sent up from Cairo.In one of the\nlast letters to his sister, dated Khartoum, 5th March 1884, he wrote:\n"I hope _much_ from Zebehr\'s coming up, for he is so well known to all\nup here."Some time after communications were broken off with Khartoum, Miss\nGordon wrote to Zebehr, begging him to use his influence with the\nMahdi to get letters for his family to and from General Gordon.To\nthat Zebehr replied as follows:--\n\n     "TO HER EXCELLENCY MISS GORDON,--I am very grateful to you for\n     having had the honour of receiving your letter of the 13th, and\n     am very sorry to say that I am not able to write to the Mahdi,\n     because he is new, and has appeared lately in the Soudan.I do\n     not know him.He is not of my tribe nor of my relations, nor of\n     the tribes with which I was on friendly terms; and for these\n     reasons I do not see the way in which I could carry out your\n     wish.I am ready to serve you in all that is possible all my life\n     through, but please accept my excuse in this matter.ZEBEHR RAHAMAH, Pasha."CAIRO, _22nd January 1885_."Some time after the fall of Khartoum, Miss Gordon made a further\ncommunication to Zebehr, but, owing to his having been exiled to\nGibraltar, it was not until October 1887 that she received the\nfollowing reply, which is certainly curious; and I believe that this\nletter and personal conversations with Zebehr induced one of the\nofficers present at the interview on 26th January 1884 to change his\noriginal opinion, and to conclude that it would have been safe for\nGeneral Gordon to have taken Zebehr with him:--\n\n                              "CAIRO [_received by Miss Gordon\n                                  about 12th October 1887_]."HONOURABLE LADY,--I most respectfully beg to acknowledge the\n     receipt of your letter, enclosed to that addressed to me by His\n     Excellency Watson Pasha."This letter has caused me a great satisfaction, as it speaks of\n     the friendly relations that existed between me and the late\n     Gordon Pasha, your brother, whom you have replaced in my heart,\n     and this has been ascertained to me by your inquiring about me\n     and your congratulating me for my return to Cairo" [that is,\n     after his banishment to Gibraltar]."I consider that your poor brother is still alive in you, and for\n     the whole run of my life I put myself at your disposal, and beg\n     that you will count upon me as a true and faithful friend to you."You will also kindly pay my respects to the whole family of\n     Gordon Pasha, and may you not deprive me of your good news at any\n     time."My children and all my family join themselves to me, and pay you\n     their best respects."Further, I beg to inform you that the messenger who had been\n     previously sent through me, carrying Government correspondence to\n     your brother, Gordon Pasha, has reached him, and remitted the\n     letter he had in his own hands, and without the interference of\n     any other person.The details of his history are mentioned in the\n     enclosed report, which I hope you will kindly read.--Believe me,\n     honourable Lady, to remain yours most faithfully,\n\n                                             ZEBEHR RAHAMAH.""When I came to Cairo and resided in it as I was before, I kept\n     myself aside of all political questions connected with']

    INTRODUCTION.PART I.\n\n\n                               SECTION I.\n\nLike every other object of human inquiry, Architecture may be studied\nfrom two distinct points of view.Either it may be regarded statically,\nand described scientifically as a thing existing, without any reference\nto the manner in which it was invented; or it may be treated\nhistorically, tracing every form from its origin and noting the\ninfluence one style has had upon another in the progress of time.The first of these methods is more technical, and demands on the part of\nthe student very considerable previous knowledge before it can be\nsuccessfully prosecuted.The other, besides being more popular and\neasily followed, has the advantage of separating the objects of study\ninto natural groups, and tracing more readily their connection and\nrelation to one another.The great superiority, however, of the\nhistorical mode of study arises from the fact that, when so treated,\nArchitecture ceases to be a mere art, interesting only to the artist or\nhis employer, but becomes one of the most important adjuncts of history,\nfilling up many gaps in the written record and giving life and reality\nto much that without its presence could with difficulty be realised.A still more important use of architecture, when followed as a history,\nis found in its ethnographic value.Every different race of men had\ntheir own peculiar forms in using the productions of this art, and their\nown mode of expressing their feelings or aspirations by its means.When\nproperly studied, it consequently affords a means as important as\nlanguage for discriminating between the different races of mankind—often\nmore so, and one always more trustworthy and more easily understood.In consequence of these advantages, the historical mode is that which\nwill be followed in this work.But before entering upon the narrative,\nit will be well if a correct definition of what Architecture really is\ncan be obtained.Without some clear views on the technical position of\nthe art, much that follows will be unintelligible and the meaning of\nwhat is said may be mistaken.A great deal of the confusion of ideas existing on the subject of\nArchitecture arises from the fact that writers have been in the habit of\nspeaking of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture as three similar fine\narts, practised on the same principles.This error arose in the 16th\ncentury, when in a fatal hour painters and sculptors undertook also the\npractice of architecture, and builders ceased to be architects.This\nconfusion of ideas has been perpetuated to the present hour, and much of\nthe degraded position of the art at this day is owing to the mistake\nthen made.It cannot therefore be too strongly insisted upon that there\nis no essential connection between painting and sculpture on the one\nhand and architecture on the other.The two former rank among what are called Phonetic arts.Their business\nis to express by colour or form ideas that could be—generally have\nbeen—expressed by words.With the Egyptians their hieroglyphical\npaintings were their only means of recording their ideas.With us, such\na series of pictures as Hogarth’s ‘Mariage à la Mode’ or ‘The Rake’s\nProgress’ are novels written with the brush; and many of our Mediæval\ncathedrals possess whole Bibles carved in stone.Poetry, Painting, and\nSculpture are three branches of one form of art, refined from Prose,\nColour, and Carving, and form a group apart, interchanging ideas and\nmodes of expression, but always dealing with the same class of images\nand appealing to the same class of feelings.Distinct and separate from these Phonetic arts is another group,\ngenerally known as the Technic arts, comprising all those which minister\nto the primary wants of mankind under such various heads as food,\nclothing, and shelter.Between these two groups is a third called the\nÆsthetic arts, forming, as it were, a flux between the Technic and\nPhonetic arts, fusing the whole into one homogeneous mass.They take\ntheir rise from the fact that to every want which the technic arts are\ndesigned to supply, Nature has attached a gratification which is capable\nof refining all the useful arts into fine arts.Thus the Technic art of\nagriculture is capable of supplying food in its simple form; but by the\nrefinements of cookery and of wine-making, simple meats and drinks are\ncapable of affording endless gratification to the senses.Simple\nclothing to keep out the cold requires little art, but embroidery,\ndyeing, lace-making, and fifty other arts employ the hands of millions,\nand the gratification afforded by their use, the thoughts of as many\nmore.Shelter, too, is easily provided, but ornamental and ornamented\nshelter, or in other words architecture, is one of the most prominent of\nthe fine arts.Music, though hardly known as a useful art, is the most\ntypical of the Æsthetic arts, and, “married to immortal verse,” steps\nupwards into the region of the Phonetic arts, just as building, when\nused for ornament, is raised out of the domain of the Technic arts.Like music, colour and form may be so arranged as to afford infinite\npleasure to the senses without their having any phonetic value; but when\nused, as sculpture and paintings are and have been in all ages, to tell\na tale or to express emotion, they rank high among the Phonetic arts;\nand though able to express certain impressions even more vividly than\ncan be done by words, they cannot rise to the high intellectual position\nthat can be attained either by Poetry or Eloquence when expressed only\nin that verbal language which is the highest gift of God to man.The term Beauty in Art is little else than a synonym for Perfection, but\nperfection in these three classes of arts is far from being the same\nthing, or of anything like the same value, as an intellectual\nexpression.The beauty of a machine, however complicated, arises mainly\nfrom its adaptability to use; while a mosaic of exquisite colours, or an\nelevated piece of instrumental music, raises emotions of a far higher\nclass: and a painting or a poem may appeal to all that is great or noble\nin human nature.If, for instance, we take a dozen arts at random, and divide them into\ntwelve equal component parts, as they belong to each of the three\ndivisions, Technic, Æsthetic, or Phonetic.If we further assign one as\nthe relative intellectual value of the Technic element, two as that due\nto the Æsthetic, and three as the proportionate importance of the\nPhonetic, we obtain the index number in the fourth column of the table\nbelow, which is probably not far from expressing the true relative value\nof each.Of course there are adventitious circumstances which may raise\nthe proportionate value of any art very considerably, and, on the other\nhand, neglect of cultivation may depress others below their true value;\nbut the principles on which the table is formed are probably those by\nwhich a correct estimate may be most easily obtained.11     1             — = 13\n      Turnery, Joinery, &c.9     3             — = 15\n

utterly\nincapable of Phonetic expression, and the first hardly even can be\nraised to the second class, though air combined with warmth does afford\npleasure to the senses.Joinery may convey an idea of perfection from\nthe mode in which it is designed or executed; while gastronomy, as above\nmentioned, does really afford important gratification to the senses,\napproaching nearly in importance to the plain food-supplying art of\ncookery.Jewellery may combine extreme mechanical beauty of execution\nwith the most harmonious arrangement of colour, and may also be made to\nexpress a meaning, though only to a very limited extent.Clothing\ndepends on both colour and form for its perfection more than even beauty\nof material, and may be made to express gaiety or sorrow, though perhaps\nmore from association than from any inherent qualities.The arts of the\npotter can exhibit not only perfection in execution, but practically\ndepend both in colour and form, especially the latter, to raise their\nproducts out of the category of mere Technic arts; while the paintings\non them, which are indispensable to the highest class of ceramique,\nrender them capable of taking their place among those objects which\naffect a Phonetic mode of utterance.As mentioned above, floriculture\nand landscape gardening may, besides their use, afford infinite pleasure\nto the senses and even express gaiety or gloom, and, from mere\nprettiness, may rise towards something like sublimity in expression.Architecture is, however, the central art of the group, which in its\nhighest form combines all the three classes in nearly equal proportions,\nbut not always necessarily so.The Pyramids of Egypt, for instance,\nthough Technically the most wonderful buildings in the world, have very\nlittle Æsthetic, and hardly more than one of Phonetic, value.The great\ntemple at Baalbec,—and in fact all the Roman temples, may be classed as\ncontaining six parts of Technic value for mechanical excellence of size\nand construction, four for beauty of form and detail, but certainly not\nmore than two parts for any expression of religion or intellect they may\nexhibit, making up twenty for the index of their artistic value.Cologne\ncathedral takes very nearly the same position in the scale, but Rheims,\nBourges, and the more perfect Gothic cathedrals may be classed higher,\nas five Technic, three Æsthetic, and four Phonetic, making twenty-three\naltogether as their index; and they are only surpassed by such a\nbuilding as the Parthenon at Athens, which, though not so large and\nimposing as some others, is, so far as we know, the most perfect\nbuilding yet erected by man.It owes this perfection mainly to the equal\nbalance of parts.There is nothing so difficult or startling in its\nconstruction as there is in most Gothic cathedrals; but what there is is\nmechanically perfect, both in design and execution.Its form is nearly\nperfect, combining stability with simplicity and at the same time\navoiding monotony or any appearance of greater strength than is\nabsolutely necessary.Its details are all as exquisite in form as the\nTemple itself, and it was at one time  to an extent we can\nhardly now realise, but which must, when complete, have made it one of\nthe most perfect examples of Æsthetic art.The walls of the cella were\nalmost certainly covered with Phonetic paintings similar to those in the\nLesche at Delphi; and the pediment, the metopes, the friezes, were all\nsculptured to such an extent as to render the Phonetic expression of the\nbuilding at least equal to either its Technic or its Æsthetic\nexcellence.It is easy to conceive a building, such as a trophy or a\nmausoleum, in which painting and sculpture shall be relatively more\nimportant than they are in this instance, and in which consequently the\nindex may be raised above twenty-four; but if this were so, it ought\nprobably to be classed among works of sculpture or painting rather than\nas an object of architecture.In music the Æsthetic element naturally prevails over the other two, but\nTechnic cleverness of execution often affords to some as much pleasure\nas the harmony of the sounds produced; and, on the other hand, in its\npower of expressing joy or sorrow and of exciting varied emotions at\nwill, it rivals frequently the more distinct and permanent power of\nwords themselves, when unaccompanied by Æsthetic forms of art.It is of\ncourse, however, in the outpourings of his imagination or in the logical\nproducts of his reason that man rises highest, and stands most\ndistinctly apart from the rest of created beings; and though all may not\nbe capable of appreciating it, it is when both Technic and Æsthetic\nadjuncts are laid aside, and man listens only to the voice of reason,\nthat he reaches what, as far as we can now see, is the highest form of\nhis artistic development.Of course there are many other forms in which this might be expressed,\nand many will be inclined to dispute the correctness of the figures\nassigned to each art.They are, in fact, only approximations, and as a\nfirst attempt can hardly be expected to meet all the conditions of the\nproblem.The truth of the matter is, it would have been better to use\nalgebraic symbols and to allow every one to translate them into numbers\naccording to his own fancy, but in the present state of matters such an\nattempt would have savoured of affectation.The art of criticism is not\nsufficiently advanced for this, but if two or three would follow up what\nis here indicated it might be placed on a basis from which to proceed\nhigher.Meanwhile, perhaps the annexed diagram may serve to explain the\nrelation of the three classes of art to one another, and the way in\nwhich they overlap and mix together so as to make up a perfect art.Like\nthe preceding table, it will require several editions, the work of\nseveral minds, before it can be perfected, but it probably is not far\nfrom representing the truth as at present known.There is still another relation of these arts to one another which must\nnot be overlooked before proceeding further, as a knowledge of it is\nindispensable in forming a correct judgment of their respective merits.Like the Sciences, the Technic Arts hardly depend, after the first steps\nhave been taken, on individual prowess for their advancement.An\nastronomer, a chemist, or a natural historian, now starts from the\nhighest point reached by any of his predecessors, and he has only to\nobserve and calculate, to analyse and put together again, in order to\nadvance our knowledge.A giant may of course make a rapid stride in\nadvance, but a hundred dwarfs will, if they persevere steadily in the\nright path, not only overtake him, but probably advance far beyond\nanything the most gigantic intellect can accomplish in science.So it is\nalso in the mechanical arts.The immense strides that have of late years\nbeen made in improving all the machines employed in manufactures have\nnot been made by the greatest intellects, but by thousands of men\nsuggesting new contrivances and acquiring skill by steady improvement in\nmanipulation.In ship-building, for instance, one of the most complex of\nthe useful arts, no one can tell who the men were who converted the rude\ngalleys in which our forefathers sailed to Crecy and Agincourt into the\ngigantic commercial steamers and war-ships of the present day.It was\nthe result of thousands of intellects working steadily towards a\nwell-defined aim, and accomplishing a triumph by a process which must\nalways be successful in the Technic arts when persevered in long enough.The case is somewhat different with the Æsthetic arts.Some men are\ninsensible to the harmony of colour and are not offended by the crudest\ncontrasts.Others do not perceive concords in music, and the most\nviolent discords give them no pain; others, on the contrary, are endowed\nwith the utmost sensibility on these points, and are consequently not\nonly able to appreciate the beauty of the arts arising out of colour or\nsound, but of advancing what to those who cannot understand them is an\ninexplicable mystery.When from the Æsthetic Arts we turn to the Sciences and Technic Arts, we\nfind, as just pointed out, that the individual becomes much less\nimportant and the process everything.Every astronomer now knows more\nthan Newton; every chemist than John Dalton.Any ordinary mechanic can\nstart from a higher point than was reached by a Watt or an Arkwright or\na Stephenson, and can surpass them.But no man can mount on the\nshoulders of such men as Handel or Mozart or Beethoven, and surpass\nthem; and the higher we ascend in the scale of arts the more important\ndoes the individual become and the less so the process.A Phidias, a\nRaphael, a Shakespeare, are yet unsurpassed, and possibly never may be.All men may be taught to carve, to colour, and to write mechanically,\nand may even be instructed to practise these processes so as to afford\npleasure to themselves and others; but when from this we rise to\nPhonetic painting, sculpture, or poetry, and the still higher region of\nphilosophy, the individual becomes all in all, and his special genius\nthere stamps the true value on the production.Mary went back to the kitchen.In this respect, again, Architecture is singularly happy as a means of\nstudy.As a Technic art it is practised in the same progressive\nprinciples as all its sister arts, irrespective of individuality.As an\nÆsthetic art it is hardly so individual as music, because its forms and\ncolours are permanent and capable of being repeated with such\nimprovements as each experiment suggests in every subsequent building;\nbut when it attempts Phonetic forms of utterance, these are seldom so\nabsolutely integral that they cannot be separated from the building and\njudged of apart.A Greek Temple or a Mediæval cathedral without painting\nand sculpture may be poor and inanimate, but still so beautiful in its\nform, so grand from its mass, and so imposing from its durability, that\nin its Technic-Æsthetic form alone it may command our admiration, more\nperhaps than any other work of human hands, except of course, as said\nbefore, the highest intellectual forms of Phonetic art.Architecture\nthus combines in itself the steady progressive perfectibility of a\nTechnic art quite independent of the intellectual capabilities of the\narchitect, combined with the Æsthetic appreciation of form and colour\nwhich is mostly universal, and can at all events be generally inculcated\nand learned.But its greatest glory is that it can enlist in its service\nthe higher branches of Phonetic sculpture and painting, which can be\nexercised only by specially gifted individuals.It is difficult to\nconceive all these qualities being equally combined in the person of any\none architect, and in practice it is by no means necessary for success\nthat it should be so, though, if possible, the combination would no\ndoubt be advantageous.In criticising, on the contrary, it is always\nnecessary to separate and distinguish between the mechanical, the\nsensuous, and the intellectual part of a design.Without this an\nintelligent appreciation of its merits or defects can hardly be\nobtained.Notwithstanding all that has been pointed out already, and the\nadvantages of its central position among the sister arts, combined with\nits own intrinsic merits, Architecture would never have attained to the\nhigh position it now occupies had it not been fitted with an aim which\nraised it far above all utilitarian feelings.In all ages, though\ncertainly not among all nations, Architecture has been employed as one\nof the principal forms of worship.The desire to erect a temple to their\nGods worthy to be their dwelling-place has exalted even the rude arts of\nsavages into something worthy of admiration, and when such a nation as\nthe Egyptians were inspired with the same desire, they produced, even in\nthe earliest ages, temples which still excite feelings of admiration and\nof awe.Had the practice of architecture been restricted to supplying\nonly the ordinary wants of mortals, it never would have risen to be the\nnoble art it now is.Neither the palaces of the greatest kings, nor the\nwants of the proudest municipalities, nor the emporia of the richest\ncommerce would have supplied that lofty aim which is indispensable for\nany great intellectual effort.But when, freed from all trammels of use\nor expense, the object is to erect a casket worthy to enshrine the\nsacred image of a god whom men feared but adored, the aspiration\nelevates the work far beyond its useful purpose.It is when men seek to\nerect a hall in which worshippers may meet to render that homage which\nis their greatest privilege and their highest aspiration, when all that\nman can conceive that is great and beautiful is enlisted to create\nsomething worthy of the purpose, that temples have been erected which\nrank among the most successful works man has yet produced.Had any\nexigencies of use or economy controlled the design of the Parthenon, or\nof any of our Mediæval cathedrals, they must have taken a much lower\nplace in the scale than they now occupy.Their architects were, however,\nin fact as free from any utilitarian influences as the poets who\ncomposed the ‘Iliad’ or ‘Paradise Lost.’\n\n\n                    III.—DEFINITION OF ARCHITECTURE.If what has just been said above is understood, it may be sufficient to\nmake it possible to give a more definite answer than has usually been\ndone to two questions to which hitherto no satisfactory reply has been\naccorded in modern times.“_What_,” it is frequently asked, _“is the\ntrue definition of the word Architecture, or of the Art to which it\napplies?” “What are the principles which ought to guide us in designing\nor criticising Architectural objects?”_\n\nFifty years ago the answers to these questions generally were, that\nArchitecture consisted in the closest possible imitation of the forms\nand orders employed by the Romans; that a church was well designed\nexactly in the proportion in which it resembled a heathen temple; and\nthat the merit of a civic building was to be measured by its imitation,\nmore or less perfect, of some palace or amphitheatre of classic times.In the beginning of this century these answers were somewhat modified by\nthe publication of Stuart’s works on Athens; the word Grecian was\nsubstituted for Roman in all criticisms, and the few forms that remain\nto us of Grecian art were repeated _ad nauseam_ in buildings of the most\nheterogeneous class and character.At the present day churches have been entirely removed from the domain\nof classic art, and their merit is made to depend on their being correct\nreproductions of mediæval designs.Museums and town halls still\ngenerally adhere to classic forms, alternating between Greek and Roman.In some of our public buildings an attempt has recently been made to\nreproduce the Middle Ages, while in our palaces and clubhouses that\ncompromise between classicality and common sense which is called Italian\nis generally adhered to.These, it is evident, are the mere changing\nfashions of art.There is nothing real or essential in this Babel of\nstyles, and we must go deeper below the surface to enable us to obtain a\ntrue definition of the art or of its purposes.Before attempting this,\nhowever, it is essential to bear in mind that two wholly different\nsystems of architecture have been followed at different periods in the\nworld’s history.The first is that which prevailed since the art first dawned, in Egypt,\nin Greece, in Rome, in Asia, and in all Europe, during the Middle Ages,\nand generally in all countries of the world down to the time of the\nReformation in the 16th century, and still predominates in remote\ncorners of the globe wherever European civilisation or its influences\nhave not yet penetrated.The other being that which was introduced with\nthe revival of classic literature contemporaneously with the reformation\nof religion, and still pervades all Europe and wherever European\ninfluence has established itself.In the first period the art of architecture consisted in designing a\nbuilding so as to be most suitable and convenient for the purposes\nrequired, in arranging the parts so as to produce the most stately and\nornamental effect consistent with its uses, and in applying to it such\nornament as should express and harmonise with the construction, and be\nappropriate to the purposes of the building; while at the same time the\narchitects took care that the ornament should be the most elegant in\nitself which it was in their power to design.Following this system, not only the Egyptian, the Greek, and the Gothic\narchitects, but even the indolent and half-civilised inhabitants of\nIndia, the stolid Tartars of Thibet and China, and the savage Mexicans,\nsucceeded in erecting great and beautiful buildings.No race, however\nrude or remote, has failed, when working on this system, to produce\nbuildings which are admired by all who behold them, and are well worthy\nof the most attentive consideration.Indeed, it is almost impossible to\nindicate one single building in any part of the world, designed during\nthe prevalence of this true form of art, which was not thought\nbeautiful, not alone by those who erected it, but which does not remain\na permanent object of admiration and of study even for strangers in all\nfuture ages.The result of the other system is widely different from this.It has now\nbeen practised in Europe for more than three centuries, and by people\nwho have more knowledge of architectural forms, more constructive skill,\nand more power of combining science and art in effecting a great object,\nthan any people who ever existed before.Notwithstanding this, from the\nbuilding of St.Peter’s at Rome to that of our own Parliament Houses,\nnot one building has been produced that is admitted to be entirely\nsatisfactory, or which permanently retains a hold on general admiration.Many are large and stately to an extent almost unknown before, and many\nare ornamented with a profuseness of which no previous examples exist;\nbut with all this, though they conform with the passing fashions of the\nday, they soon become antiquated and out of date, and men wonder how\nsuch a style could ever have been thought beautiful, just as we wonder\nhow any one could have admired the female costumes of the last century\nwhich captivated the hearts of our grandfathers.It does not require us to go very deeply into the philosophy of the\nsubject to find out why this should be the case; the fact simply being\nthat no sham was ever permanently successful, either in morals or in\nart, and no falsehood ever remained long without being found out, or\nwhich, when detected, inevitably did not cease to please.It is\nliterally impossible that we should reproduce either the circumstances\nor the feelings which gave rise to classical art and made it a reality;\nand though Gothic art was a thing of our country and of our own race, it\nbelongs to a state of society so totally different from anything that\nnow exists, that any attempt at reproduction now must at best be a\nmasquerade, and never can be a real or earnest form of art.The\ndesigners of the Eglinton Tournament carried the system to a perfectly\nlegitimate conclusion when they sought to reproduce the costumes and\nwarlike exercises of our ancestors; and the pre-Raphaelite painters were\nequally justified in attempting to do in painting that which was done\nevery day in architecture.Both attempts failed signally, because we had\nprogressed in the arts of war and painting, and could easily detect the\nabsurdity of these practices.It is in architecture alone of all the\narts that the false system remains, and we do not yet perceive the\nimpossibility of its leading to any satisfactory result.Bearing all this in mind, let us try if we can come to a clearer\ndefinition of what this art really is, and in what its merits consist.Let us suppose the Diagram (Woodcut No.2) to represent an ordinary\nhouse, such as is found in many of our London streets.The first\ndivision, A, is the most prosaic form of building, no more thought being\nbestowed on it than if it were a garden wall.The second division, B, is\nbetter; the cornices and string-course indicate the levels of the\nseveral floors into which the building is divided; the quoins of the\ndoor and windows are emphasized by the use of a better or different\n brick, and the arched forms given to door and window on ground\nfloor suggest increased strength.In the third division, C, this has\nbeen carried still further; the rustication of the stonework on the\nlower storey gives an appearance of greater solidity, and the importance\ngiven to the cornices, the addition of architrave mouldings round\nwindows, with pediments to those of the first floor, and the decoration\nof the parapet carry the house out of the domain of building into that\nof architecture.The fourth division carries this still farther; the\nwhole design is here divided into three stages—the ground floor being\ntreated as a podium or base to the two floors above, the whole being\ncrowned by an attic storey; greater importance is given to the front by\nthe slight projection of two wings; the entrance doorway is emphasized,\nand by means of cornices, quoins, and pilasters, a play of light and\nshade is given to an elevation which virtually lies in one plane.In\nthis instance not only is a greater amount of ornament applied, but the\nparts are so disposed as in themselves to produce a more agreeable\neffect; and although the height of the floors remains the same, and the\namount of light introduced very nearly so, still the slight grouping of\nthe parts is such as to produce a better class of architecture than\ncould be done by the mere application of any amount of ornament.The\ndiagram deals with one phase of the subject, “a town house,” and with\nthe elevation only, the style being that generally known as Italian; if\nit is admitted that the last division is an object of architecture,\nwhich the first is not, it follows from this analysis that architecture\ncommences when some embellishment is added to the building which was not\nstrictly a structural necessity.The value of the embellishment, from an\narchitectural point of view, depends on—the extent to which, in its\napplication, the structural features have been recognised,—the\nappropriateness of the ornament,—the careful study of proportion and\nbalance of the several parts, and,—in a certain measure, the extent to\nwhich some known precedent has been followed.Recurring, for instance, to the Parthenon, to illustrate this principle\nfarther.The proportions of length to breadth, and of height to both\nthese, are instances of carefully-studied proportion and balance; and\nstill more so is the arrangement of the porticoes and the disposition of\nthe peristyle.If all the pillars were plain square piers, and all the\nmouldings square and flat, still the Parthenon could not fail, from the\nmere disposition of its parts, to be a pleasing and imposing building.The proportion of length to breadth,\nthe projection of the transepts, the different height of the central and\nside aisles, the disposition and proportion of the towers, are all\ninstances of proportion and balance, and beautiful even if without\nornament.Many of the older abbeys, especially those of the Cistercians,\nare as devoid of ornament as a modern barn; but from the mere\ndisposition of their parts they are always pleasing and, if large, are\nimposing objects of architecture.Stonehenge is an instance of\nornamental construction wholly without ornament, yet it is almost as\nimposing an architectural object as any of the same dimensions in any\npart of the world.It is, however, when ornament is added to this, and\nwhen that ornament is elegant itself and appropriate to the construction\nand to the purposes of the building, that the temple or the cathedral\nranks among the highest objects of the art and becomes one of the\nnoblest works of man.Even without structural decoration, a building may, by mere dint of\nornament, become an architectural object, though it is far more\ndifficult to attain good architecture by this means, and in true styles\nit has seldom been attempted.Still, such a building as the town hall at\nLouvain, which if stripped of its ornaments would be little better than\na factory, by richness and appropriateness of ornament alone has become\na very pleasing specimen of the art.In modern times it is too much the\nfashion to attempt to produce architectural effects not only without\nattending to ornamental construction, but often in defiance of, and in\nconcealing that which exists.When this is done, the result must be bad\nart; but nevertheless it is architecture, however execrable it may be.If these premises are correct, the art of the builder consists in merely\nputting materials together so as to attain the desired end in the\nspeediest and simplest fashion.The art of the civil or military\nengineer consists in selecting the best and most appropriate materials\nfor the object he has in view, and using these in the most scientific\nmanner, so as to ensure an economical but satisfactory result.Where the\nengineer leaves off, the art of the architect begins.His object is to\narrange the materials of the engineer, not so much with regard to\neconomical as to artistic effects, and by light and shade, and outline,\nto produce a form that in itself shall be permanently beautiful.He then\nadds ornament, which by its meaning doubles the effect of the\ndisposition he has just made, and by its elegance throws a charm over\nthe whole composition.Viewed in this light, it is evident that there are no objects that are\nusually delegated to the civil engineer which may not be brought within\nthe province of the architect.A bridge, an aqueduct, the embankment of\na lake, or the roof of a station, are all as legitimate subjects for\narchitectural ornament as a temple or a palace.They were all so treated\nby the Romans and in the Middle Ages, and are so treated up to the\npresent day in the remote parts of India, and wherever true art\nprevails.It is not essential that the engineer should know anything of\narchitecture, though it is certainly desirable he should do so; but, on\nthe other hand, it is indispensably necessary that the architect should\nunderstand construction.Without that knowledge he cannot design; and\nalthough it has been conceived by some that it would be better to\ndelegate the mechanical task to the engineer, and so restrict himself\nentirely to the artistic arrangement and ornamentation of his design,\nsuch a course would be fatal to the development of architectural style.It is true that in some of the works above stated, it is generally\nthought desirable to confide them to engineers; but in the few cases in\nwhich architects have been called in to co-operate with them, as in the\nroofs of the Great Western and Midland Railway Stations, the result has\nbeen so satisfactory as to suggest the advantage of such combination.In\nthe Great Exhibition of 1851, the happiest feature, the semicircular\nroof of the transept, was suggested by the late Sir Charles Barry, and\nthe developments of that form in the nave and transepts of the Crystal\nPalace constitute still the most beautiful features of that building.In\nworks of a monumental character, such as town-halls, museums, or public\ngalleries, which are designed to last for centuries, the strict economy\nof material, which is sometimes deemed necessary in engineering works,\nis not advisable, because mass, stability, and durability—three elements\ninto which we enter later on—are of the very essence of their\narchitectural character.In these and other works of a simple character,\nsuch as private houses, the calculations are not of so elaborate a\nnature as to be outside the architect’s knowledge; and although of late\nyears the use of iron girders, stanchions, and columns has introduced a\nnew factor among building materials which occasionally may call for the\nassistance of an expert to substantiate the architect’s calculations, it\nhas hitherto been the custom to conceal these features, so that they\nhave not entered the phase of architectural design.In course of time,\nwhen an increased knowledge of the properties of iron is acquired, we\nmay hope to see a great development in its artistic treatment, so that\nit may eventually rise to the dignity and assume the character, which in\nthe architectural styles of bygone times, all other materials have\nreached.In addition, however, to the convenient arrangement and artistic\ntreatment of a building, and its proper and sound construction, there is\nstill a third element which requires the special endowment of an artist\nfor its exercise.No architectural object can be considered as complete,\nor as having attained the highest excellence till it is endowed with a\nvoice through the aid of phonetic sculpture and painting.In a few words, therefore, a perfect building may be defined as one that\ncombines:—\n\n   1st, as Technic principles:\n     Convenience of general arrangements,\n     Proper distribution of materials and sound construction.2nd, as Æsthetic principles of design:\n     Artistic conception combined with\n     Ornamented construction, and\n\n   3rd, for Phonetic adjuncts:\n     Sculpture, or\n     Painting, employed as voices to tell the story of the building,\n       and explain the purposes for which it was designed, or those\n       to which it is dedicated.Besides these, however, which are the principal theoretic\ncharacteristics of architecture, there are several minor technical\nprinciples which it may be convenient to enumerate before proceeding\nfarther.It may also be well to give such examples as shall make what has just\nbeen indicated theoretically, clearer than can be done by the mere\nenunciation of abstract principles.The first and most obvious element of architectural grandeur is size—a\nlarge edifice being always more imposing than a small one; and when the\nart displayed in two buildings is equal, their effect is almost in the\ndirect ratio of their dimensions.In other words, if one temple or\nchurch is twice or three times as large as another, it is twice or three\ntimes as grand or as effective.The Temple of Theseus differs very\nlittle, except in dimensions, from the Parthenon, and, except in that\nrespect, hardly differed at all from the Temple of Jupiter at Elis; but\nbecause of its smaller size it must rank lower than the greater\nexamples.In our own country many of our smaller abbeys or parish\nchurches display as great beauty of design or detail as our noblest\ncathedrals, but, from their dimensions alone, they are insignificant in\ncomparison, and the traveller passes them by, while he stands awe-struck\nbefore the portals or under the vault of the larger edifices.The pyramids of Egypt, the topes of the Buddhists, the mounds of the\nEtruscans, depend almost wholly for their effect on their dimensions.The Romans understood to perfection the value of this element, and used\nit in its most unsophisticated simplicity to obtain the effect they\ndesired.In the Middle Ages the architects not only aspired to the\nerection of colossal edifices, but they learnt how they might greatly\nincrease the apparent dimensions of a building by a scientific\ndisposition of the parts and a skilful arrangement of ornament, thereby\nmaking it look very much larger than it really was.It is, in fact, the\nmost obvious and most certain, though it must be confessed perhaps the\nmost vulgar, means of obtaining architectural grandeur; but a true and\nperfect example can never be produced by dependence on this alone, and\nit is only when size is combined with beauty of proportion and elegance\nof ornament that perfection in architectural art is attained.Next to size the most important element is stability.By this is meant,\nnot merely the strength required to support the roof or to resist the\nvarious thrusts and pressures, but that excess of strength over mere\nmechanical requirement which is necessary thoroughly to satisfy the\nmind, and to give to the building a monumental character, with an\nappearance that it could resist the shocks of time or the violence of\nman for ages yet to come.No people understood the value of this so well as the Egyptians.The\nform of the Pyramids is designed wholly with reference to stability, and\neven the Hypostyle Hall at Karnac excites admiration far more by its\nmassiveness and strength, and its apparent eternity of duration, than by\nany other element of design.In the Hall all utilitarian exigencies and\nmany other obvious means of effect are sacrificed to these, and with\nsuch success that after more than 3000 years’ duration still enough\nremains to excite the admiration which even the most unpoetical\nspectators cannot withhold from its beauties.In a more refined style much of the beauty of the Parthenon arises from\nthis cause.The area of each of the pillars in the portico of the\nPantheon at Rome is under 20 feet, that of those of the Parthenon is\nover 33 feet, and, considering how much taller the former are than the\nlatter, it may be said that the pillars at Athens are twice as massive\nas those of the Roman temple, yet the latter have sufficed not only for\nthe mechanical, but for many points of artistic stability; but the\nstrength and solidity of the porticos of the Parthenon, without taking\ninto consideration its other points of superiority, must always render\nit more beautiful than the other.The massiveness which the Normans and other early Gothic builders\nimparted to their edifices arose more from clumsiness and want of\nconstructive skill than from design; but, though arising from so ignoble\na cause, its effect is always grand, and the rude Norman nave often\nsurpasses in grandeur the airy and elegant choir which was afterwards\nadded to it.In our own country no building is more entirely\nsatisfactory than the nave at Winchester, where the width of the pillars\nexceeds that of the aisles, and the whole is Norman in outline, though\nGothic in detail.On the other hand no building of its dimensions and\nbeauty of detail can well be so unsatisfactory as the choir at Beauvais.Though it has stood the test of centuries, it looks so frail, requires\nso many props to keep it up, and is so evidently an overstrained\nexercise of mechanical cleverness, that though it may excite wonder as\nan architectural _tour de force_, it never can satisfy the mind of the\ntrue artist, or please to the same extent as less ambitious examples.Even when we descend to the lowest walks of architecture we find this\nprinciple prevailing.It would require an immense amount of design and\ngood taste to make the thin walls and thinner roof of a brick and slated\ncottage look as picturesque or so well as one built of rubble-stone, or\neven with mud walls, and a thatched roof: the thickness and solidity of\nthe one must always be more satisfactory than the apparent flimsiness of\nthe other.Here, as in most cases, necessity controls the architect; but\nwhen fettered by no utilitarian exigencies, there is no safer or readier\nmeans of obtaining an effect than this, and when effect alone is sought\nit is almost impossible for an architect to err in giving too much\nsolidity to his building.Size and stability are alone sufficient to\nproduce grandeur in architectural design, and, where sublimity is aimed\nat, they are the two elements most essential to its production, and are\nindeed the two without which it cannot possibly be attained.As the complement to stability, the length of time during which\narchitectural objects are calculated to endure confers on them an\nimpress of durability which can hardly be attained by any of the sister\narts.Sculpture may endure as long, and some of the Egyptian examples of\nthat art found near the Pyramids are as old as anything in that country,\nbut it is not their age that impresses us so much as the story they have\nto tell.The Pyramids, on the other hand, in the majesty of their simple\nTechnic grandeur, do challenge a quasi-eternity of duration with a\ndistinctness that is most impressive, and which there, as elsewhere, is\none of the most powerful elements of architectural expression.When Horace sang—\n\n                    “Vixêre fortes ante Agamemnona\n                    Multi, sed omnes illacrimabiles\n                        Urgentur ignotique longâ\n                    Nocte, carent quia vate sacro,”\n\nhe overlooked the fact that long before Troy was dreamt of, Egyptian\nkings had raised pyramids which endure to the present day, and the\nPharaohs of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties had filled the\nvalley of the Upper Nile with temples and palaces and tombs which tell\nus not only the names of their founders, but reveal to us their thoughts\nand aspirations with a distinctness that no sacred poet could as well\nconvey.From that time onward the architects have covered the world with\nmonuments that still remain on the spot where they were erected, and\ntell all, who are sufficiently instructed to read their riddles aright,\nwhat nations once occupied these spots, what degree of civilisation they\nhad reached, and how, in erecting these monuments on which we now gaze,\nthey had attained that quasi-immortality after which they hankered.Sculpture and painting, when allied with architecture, may endure as\nlong, but their aim is not to convey to the mind the impression of\ndurability which is so strongly felt in the presence of the more massive\nworks of architectural art.Even when ruined and in decay the buildings\nare almost equally impressive, while ruined sculptures or paintings are\ngenerally far from being pleasing objects, and, whatever their other\nmerits may be, certainly miss that impression obtained from the\ndurability of architectural objects.Another very obvious mode of obtaining architectural effect is by the\nlargeness or costliness of the materials employed.A terrace, or even a\nwall, if composed of large stones, is in itself an object of\nconsiderable grandeur, while one of the same lineal dimensions and of\nthe same design, if composed of brick or rubble, may appear a very\ncontemptible object.Like all the more obvious means of architectural effect, the Egyptians\nseized on this and carried it to its utmost legitimate extent.All their\nbuildings, as well as their colossi and obelisks, owe much of their\ngrandeur to the magnitude of the materials employed in their\nconstruction.The works called Cyclopean found in Italy and Greece have\nno other element of grandeur than the size of the stones or rather\nmasses of rock which the builders of that age were in the habit of\nusing.In Jerusalem nothing was so much insisted upon by the old\nwriters, or is so much admired now, as the largeness of the stones\nemployed in the building of the Temple and its substructions.We can well believe how much value was attached to this when we find\nthat in the neighbouring city of Baalbec stones were used of between 60\nand 70 ft.in length, weighing as much as the tubes of the Britannia\nBridge, for the mere bonding course of a terrace wall.Even in a more\nrefined style of architecture, a pillar, the shaft of which is of a\nsingle stone, or a lintel or architrave of one block, is always a\ngrander and more beautiful object than if composed of a number of\nsmaller parts.Among modern buildings, the poverty-stricken design of\nthe church of St.Petersburg is redeemed by the grandeur of\nits monolithic columns, whilst the beautiful design of the Madeleine at\nParis is destroyed by the smallness of the materials in which it is\nexpressed.It is easy to see that this arises from the same feeling to\nwhich massiveness and stability address themselves.It is the expression\nof giant power and the apparent eternity of duration which they convey;\nand in whatever form that may be presented to the human mind, it always\nproduces a sentiment tending towards sublimity, which is the highest\neffect at which architecture or any other art can aim.The Gothic architects ignored this element of grandeur altogether, and\nsought to replace it by the display of constructive skill in the\nemployment of the smaller materials they used, but it is extremely\nquestionable whether in so doing they did not miss one of the most\nobvious and most important principles of architectural design.Besides these, value in the mere material is a great element in\narchitectural effect.We all, for instance, admire an ornament of pure\ngold more than one that is only silver gilt, though few can detect the\ndifference.Persons will travel hundreds of miles to see a great diamond\nor wonderful pearl, who would not go as many yards to see paste models\nof them, though if the two were laid together on the table very few\nindeed could distinguish the real from the counterfeit.When we come to consider such buildings as the cathedral at Milan or the\nTaje Mehal at Agra, there can be no doubt but that the beauty of the\nmaterial of which they are composed adds very much to the admiration\nthey excite.In the latter case the precious stones with which the\nornamental parts of the design are inlaid, convey an impression of\ngrandeur almost as directly as their beauty of outline.It is, generally speaking, because of its greater preciousness that we\nadmire a marble building more than one of stone, though the colour of\nthe latter may be really as beautiful and the material at least as\ndurable.In the same manner a stone edifice is preferred to one of\nbrick, and brick to wood and plaster; but even these conditions may be\nreversed by the mere question of value.If, for instance, a brick and a\nstone edifice stand close together, the design of both being equally\nappropriate to the material employed, our judgment may be reversed if\nthe bricks are so beautifully moulded, or made of such precious clay, or\nso carefully laid, that the brick edifice costs twice as much as the\nother; in that case we should look with more respect and admiration on\nthe artificial than on the natural material.From the same reason many\nelaborately carved wooden buildings, notwithstanding the smallness of\ntheir parts and their perishable nature, are more to be admired than\nlarger and more monumental structures, and this merely in consequence of\nthe evidence of labour and consequent cost that have been bestowed upon\nthem.Irrespective of these considerations, many building materials are\ninvaluable from their own intrinsic merits.Granite is one of the best\nknown, from its hardness and durability, marble from the exquisite\npolish it takes, and for its colour, which for internal decoration is a\nproperty that can hardly be over-estimated.Stone is valuable on account\nof the largeness of the blocks that can be obtained and because it\neasily receives a polish sufficient for external purposes.Bricks are\nexcellent for their cheapness and the facility with which they can be\nused, and they may also be moulded into forms of great elegance, so that\nbeauty may be easily attained; but sublimity is nearly impossible in\nbrickwork, without at least such dimensions as have rarely been\naccomplished by man.The smallness of the material is such a manifest\nincongruity with largeness of the parts, that even the Romans, though\nthey tried hard, could never quite overcome the difficulty.Except in monumental erections\nit is superior to stone for internal purposes, and always better than\nbrick from the uniformity and smoothness of its surface, the facility\nwith which it is moulded, and its capability of receiving painted or\nother decorations to any extent.Wood should be used externally only on the smallest and least monumental\nclass of buildings, and even internally is generally inferior to\nplaster.It is dark in colour, liable to warp and split, and\ncombustible, which are all serious objections to its use, except for\nflooring, doors, and such purposes as it is now generally applied to.Cast iron is another material rarely brought into use, though more\nprecious than any of those above enumerated, and possessing more\nstrength, though probably less durability.Where lightness combined with\nstrength is required, it is invaluable, but though it can be moulded\ninto any form of beauty that may be designed, it has hardly yet ever\nbeen so used as to allow of its architectural qualities being\nappreciated.All these materials are nearly equally good when used honestly each for\nthe purpose for which it is best adapted; they all become bad either\nwhen employed for a purpose for which they are not appropriate, or when\none material is substituted in the place of or to imitate another.Grandeur and sublimity can only be reached by the more durable and more\nmassive class of materials, but beauty and elegance are attainable in\nall, and the range of architectural design is so extensive that it is\nabsurd to limit it to one class either of natural or of artificial\nmaterials, or to attempt to prescribe the use of some and to insist on\nthat of others, for purposes to which they are manifestly inapplicable.Construction has been shown to be the chief aim and object of the\nengineer; with him it is all in all, and to construct scientifically and\nat the same time economically is the beginning and end of his\nendeavours.Construction ought\nto be his handmaid, useful to assist him in carrying out his design, but\nnever his mistress, controlling him in the execution of that which he\nwould otherwise think expedient.An architect ought always to allow\nhimself such a margin of strength that he may disregard or play with his\nconstruction, and in nine cases out of ten the money spent in obtaining\nthis solidity will be more effective architecturally than twice the\namount expended on ornament, however elegant or appropriate that may be.So convinced were the Egyptians and Greeks of this principle, that they\nnever used any other constructive expedient than a perpendicular wall or\nprop, supporting a horizontal beam; and half the satisfactory effect of\ntheir buildings arises from their adhering to this simple though\nexpensive mode of construction.They were perfectly acquainted with the\nuse of the arch and its properties, but they knew that its employment\nwould introduce complexity and confusion into their designs, and\ntherefore they wisely rejected it.Even to the present day the Hindus\nrefuse to use the arch, though it has long been employed in their\ncountry by the Mahometans.As they quaintly express it, “An arch never\nsleeps;” and it is true that by its thrust and pressure it is always\ntending to tear a building to pieces; in spite of all counterpoises,\nwhenever the smallest damage is done, it hastens the ruin of a building,\nwhich, if more simply constructed, might last for ages.The Romans were the first who introduced a more complicated style.They\nwanted larger and more complex buildings than had been before required,\nand they employed brick and concrete to a great extent even in their\ntemples and most monumental buildings.They obtained both space and\nvariety by these means, with comparatively little trouble or expense;\nbut we miss in all their works that repose and harmony which is the\ngreat charm that pervades the buildings of their predecessors.The Gothic architects went even beyond the Romans in this respect.They\nprided themselves on their constructive skill, and paraded it on all\noccasions, and often to an extent very destructive of true architectural\ndesign.The lower storey of a French cathedral is generally very\nsatisfactory; the walls are thick and solid, and the buttresses, when\nnot choked up with chapels, just sufficient for shadow and relief; but\nthe architects of that country were seized with a mania for clerestories\nof gigantic height, which should appear internally mere walls of painted\nglass divided by mullions.This could only be effected either by\nencumbering the floor of the church with piers of inconvenient thickness\nor by a system of buttressing outside.The latter was the expedient\nadopted; but notwithstanding the ingenuity with which it was carried\nout, and the elegance of many of the forms and ornaments used, it was\nsingularly destructive of true architectural effect.It not only\nproduces confusion of outline and a total want of repose, but it is\neminently suggestive of weakness, and one cannot help feeling that if\none of these props were removed, the whole would tumble down like a\nhouse of cards.This was hardly ever the case in England: the less ambitious dimensions\nemployed in this country enabled the architects to dispense in a great\nmeasure with these adjuncts, and when flying buttresses are used, they\nlook more as if employed to suggest the idea of perfect security than as\nnecessary to stability.Owing to this cause the French have never been\nable to construct a satisfactory vault: in consequence of the weakness\nof their supports they were forced to stilt, twist, and dome them to a\nmost unpleasing extent, and to attend to constructive instead of\nartistic necessities.With the English architects this never was the\ncase; they were always able to design their vaults in such forms as they\nthought would be most beautiful artistically, and, owing to the greater\nsolidity of their supports, to carry them out as at first designed.[12]\n\nIt was left for the Germans to carry this system to its acme of\nabsurdity.Half the merit of the old Round arched Gothic cathedrals on\nthe Rhine consists in their solidity and the repose they display in\nevery part.Their walls and other essential parts are always in\nthemselves sufficient to support the roofs and vaults, and no\nconstructive contrivance is seen anywhere; but when the Germans adopted\nthe pointed style, their builders—they can hardly be called\narchitects—seemed to think that the whole art consisted in supporting\nthe widest possible vaults on the thinnest possible pillars and in\nconstructing the tallest windows with the most attenuated mullions.The\nconsequence is, that though their constructive skill still excites the\nwonder of the mason or the engineer, the artist or the architect turns\nfrom the cold vaults and lean piers of their later cathedrals with a\npainful feeling of unsatisfied expectation, and wonders why such\ndimensions and such details should produce a result so utterly\nunsatisfactory.So many circumstances require to be taken into consideration, that it is\nimpossible to prescribe any general rules in such a subject as this, but\nthe following table will explain to a certain extent the ratio of the\narea to the points of support in sixteen of the principal buildings of\nthe world.[13] As far as it goes, it tends to prove that the\nsatisfactory architectural effect of a building is nearly in the inverse\nratio to the mechanical cleverness displayed in its construction.----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------------------\n

of the list stands the Hypostyle Hall, and next to it\npractically is the Parthenon, which being the only wooden-roofed\nbuilding in the list, its ratio of support in proportion to the work\nrequired is nearly as great as that of the Temple at Karnac.Spires only\nwants better details to be one of the grandest edifices in Europe, and\nBourges, Paris, Chartres, and Salisbury are among the most satisfactory\nGothic cathedrals we possess.Ouen, notwithstanding all its beauty\nof detail and design, fails in this one point, and is certainly\ndeficient in solidity.Cologne and Milan would both be very much\nimproved by greater massiveness: and at York the lightness of the\nsupports is carried so far that it never can be completed with the\nvaulted roof originally designed, for the nave at least.The four great Renaissance cathedrals, at Rome, Florence, London, and\nParis, enumerated in this list, have quite sufficient strength for\narchitectural effect, but the value of this is lost from concealed\nconstruction, and because the supports are generally grouped into a few\ngreat masses, the dimensions of which cannot be estimated by the eye.A\nGothic architect would have divided these masses into twice or three\ntimes the number of the piers used in these churches, and by employing\nornament designed to display and accentuate the construction, would have\nrendered these buildings far more satisfactory than they are.In this respect the great art of the architect consists in obtaining the\ngreatest possible amount of unencumbered space internally, consistent in\nthe first place with the requisite amount of permanent mechanical\nstability, and next with such an appearance of superfluity of strength\nas shall satisfy the mind that the building is perfectly secure and\ncalculated to last for ages.It is extremely difficult to lay down any general rules as to the forms\nbest adapted to architectural purposes, as the value of a form in\narchitecture depends wholly on the position in which it is placed and\nthe use to which it is applied.There is in consequence no prescribed\nform, however ugly it may appear at present, that may not one day be\nfound to be the very best for a given purpose; and, in like manner, none\nof those most admired which may not become absolutely offensive when\nused in a manner for which they are unsuited.Sandra travelled to the office.In itself no simple form\nseems to have any inherent value of its own, and it is only by\ncombination of one with another that they become effective.If, for\ninstance, we take a series of twenty or thirty figures, placing a cube\nat one end as the most solid of angular and a sphere at the other as the\nmost perfect of round shapes, it would be easy to cut off the angles of\nthe cube in successive gradations till it became a polygon of so many\nsides as to be nearly curvilinear.On the other hand by modifying the\nsphere through all the gradations of conic sections, it might meet the\nother series in the centre without there being any abrupt distinction\nbetween them.Such a series might be compared to the notes of a piano.We cannot say that any one of the base or treble notes is in itself more\nbeautiful than the others.It is only by a combination of several notes\nthat harmony is produced, and gentle or brilliant melodies by their\nfading into one another, or by strongly marked contrasts.So it is with\nforms: the square and angular are expressive of strength and power;\ncurves of softness and elegance; and beauty is produced by effective\ncombination of the right-lined with the curvilinear.Rocks and all the harder substances are rough and angular,\nand marked by strong contrasts and deep lines.Among trees, the oak is\nrugged, and its branches are at right angles to its stem, or to one\nanother.The lines of the willow are rounded, and flowing.The forms of\nchildren and women are round and full, and free from violent contrasts;\nthose of men are abrupt, hard, and angular in proportion to the vigour\nand strength of their frame.In consequence of these properties, as a general rule the square or\nangular parts ought always to be placed below, where strength is wanted,\nand the rounded above.If, for instance, a tower is to be built, the\nlower storey should not only be square, but should be marked by\nbuttresses, or other strong lines, and the masonry rusticated, so as to\nconvey even a greater appearance of strength.Above this, if the square\nform is still retained, it may be with more elegance and less\naccentuation.The form may then change to an octagon, that to a polygon\nof sixteen sides, and then be surmounted by a circular form of any sort.These conditions are not absolute, but the reverse arrangement would be\nmanifestly absurd.A tower with a circular base and a square upper\nstorey is what almost no art could render tolerable, while the other\npleases by its innate fitness without any extraordinary effort of\ndesign.On the other hand, round pillars are more pleasing as supports for a\nsquare architrave, not so much from any inherent fitness for the purpose\nas from the effect of contrast, and flat friezes are preferable to\ncurved ones of the late Roman styles from the same cause.The angular\nmouldings introduced among the circular shafts of a Gothic coupled\npillar, add immensely to the brilliancy of effect.Where everything is\nsquare and rugged, as in a Druidical trilithon, the effect may be\nsublime, but it cannot be elegant; where everything is rounded, as in\nthe Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, the perfection of elegance may be\nattained, but never sublimity.Perfection, as usual, lies between these\nextremes.The properties above enumerated may be characterised as the mechanical\nprinciples of design.Size, stability, construction, material, and many\nsuch, are elements at the command of the engineer or mason, as well as\nof the architect, and a building remarkable for these properties only,\ncannot be said to rise above the lowest grade of architectural\nexcellence.They are invaluable adjuncts in the hands of the true\nartist, but ought never to be the principal elements of design.After these, the two most important resources at the command of the\narchitect are Proportion and Ornament; the former enabling him to\nconstruct ornamentally, the latter to ornament his construction; both\nrequire knowledge and thought, and can only be properly applied by one\nthoroughly imbued with the true principles of architectural design.As proportion, to be good, must be modified by every varying exigence of\na design, it is of course impossible to lay down any general rules which\nshall hold good in all cases; but a few of its principles are obvious\nenough, and can be defined so as to enable us to judge how far they have\nbeen successfully carried out in the various buildings enumerated in the\nfollowing pages.To take first the simplest form of the proposition, let us suppose a\nroom built, which shall be an exact cube—of say 20 feet each way—such a\nproportion must be bad and inartistic; and besides, the height is too\ngreat for the other dimensions, apparently because it is impossible to\nget far enough away to embrace the whole wall at one view, or to see the\nspringing of the roof, without throwing the head back and looking\nupwards.If the height were exaggerated to thirty or forty feet, the\ndisproportion would be so striking, that no art could render it\nagreeable.As a general rule, a room square in plan is never pleasing.It is always better that one side should be longer than the other, so as\nto give a little variety to the design.Once and a half the width has\noften been recommended, and with every increase of length an increase of\nheight is not only allowable, but indispensable.Some such rule as the\nfollowing seems to meet most cases:—“The height of a room ought to be\nequal to half its width, plus the square root of its length.” Thus a\nroom 20 feet square ought to be between 14 and 15 feet high; if its\nlength be increased to 40 feet, its height must be at least 16½; if 100,\ncertainly not less than 20.If we proceed further, and make the height\nactually exceed the width, the effect is that of making it look narrow.As a general rule, and especially in all extreme cases, by adding to one\ndimension, we take away in appearance from the others.Thus, if we take\na room 20 feet wide and 30 or 40 feet in height, we make it narrow; if\n40 wide and 20 high, we make a low room.By increasing the length, we\ndiminish the other two dimensions.This, however, is merely speaking of plain rooms with plain walls, and\nan architect may be forced to construct rooms of all sorts of unpleasing\ndimensions, but it is here that his art comes to his aid, and he must be\nvery little of an artist if he cannot conceal, even when unable entirely\nto counteract, the defects of his dimensions.A room, for instance, that\nis a perfect cube of 20 feet may be made to look as low as one only 15\nfeet high, by using a strongly marked horizontal decoration, by breaking\nthe wall into different heights, by marking strongly the horizontal\nproportions, and obliterating as far as possible all vertical lines.The\nreverse process will make a room only 10 feet high look as lofty as one\nof 15.Even the same wall-paper (if of strongly marked lines) if pasted on the\nsides of two rooms exactly similar in dimensions, but with the lines\nvertical in the one case, in the other horizontal, will alter the\napparent dimensions of them by several feet.If a room is too high, it\nis easy to correct this by carrying a bold cornice to the height\nrequired, and stopping there the vertical lines of the wall, and above\nthis coving the roof, or using some device which shall mark a\ndistinction from the walls, and the defect may become a beauty.In like\nmanner, if a room is too long for its other dimensions, this is easily\nremedied either by breaks in the walls where these can be obtained, or\nby screens of columns across its width, or by only breaking the height\nof the roof.Anything which will divide the length into compartments\nwill effect this.The width, if in excess, is easily remedied by\ndividing it, as the Gothic architects did, into aisles.Thus a room 50\nfeet wide and 30 high, may easily be restored to proportion by cutting\noff 10 or 12 feet on each side, and lowering the roofs of the side\ncompartments, to say 20 feet.If great stability is not required, this\ncan be done without encumbering the floor with many points of support.The greater the number used the more easily the effect is obtained, but\nit can be done almost without them.Externally it is easier to remedy defects of proportion than it is\ninternally.It is easier than on the inside to increase the apparent\nheight by strongly marked vertical lines, or to bring it down by the\nemployment of a horizontal decoration.If the length of a building is too great, this is easily remedied by\nprojections, or by breaking up the length into square divisions.Thus, A\nA is a long building, but B B is a square one, or practically (owing to\nthe perspective) less than a square in length, in any direction at right\nangles to the line of vision; or, in other words, to a spectator at A’\nthe building would look as if shorter in the direction of B B than in\nthat of A A, owing to the largeness and importance of the part nearest\nthe eye.If 100 feet in length by 50 feet high is a pleasing dimension\nfor a certain design, and it is required that the building should be 500\nfeet long, it is only necessary to break it into five parts, and throw\nthree back and two forward, or the contrary, and the proportion becomes\nas before.The Egyptians hardly studied the science of proportion at all; they\ngained their effects by simpler and more obvious means.The Greeks were\nmasters in this as in everything else, but they used the resources of\nthe art with extreme sobriety—externally at least—dreading to disturb\nthat simplicity which is so essential to sublimity in architecture.But\ninternally, where sublimity was not attainable with the dimensions they\nemployed, they divided the cells of their temples into three aisles, and\nthe height into two, by placing two ranges of columns one above the\nother.By these means they were enabled to use such a number of small\nparts as to increase the apparent size most considerably, and at the\nsame time to give greater apparent magnitude to the statue, which was\nthe principal object for which the temple was erected.The Romans do not seem to have troubled themselves with the science of\nproportion in the designs of their buildings, though nothing can well be\nmore exquisite than the harmony that exists between the parts in their\norders, and generally in their details.During the Middle Ages, however,\nwe find, from first to last, the most earnest attention paid to it, and\nhalf the beauty of the buildings of that age is owing to the successful\nresults to which the architects carried their experiments in balancing\nthe parts of their structures the one against the other, so as to\nproduce that harmony we so much admire in them.The first great invention of the Gothic architects (though of Greek\norigin) was that of dividing the breadth of the building internally into\nthree aisles, and making the central one higher and wider than those on\neach side.By this means height and length were obtained at the expense\nof width: this latter, however, is never a valuable property\nartistically, though it may be indispensable for the utilitarian\nexigencies of the building.They next sought to increase still further\nthe height of the central aisle by dividing its sides into three equal\nportions which by contrast added very much to the effect: but the\nmonotony of this arrangement was soon apparent: besides, it was\nperceived that the side aisles were so low as not to come into direct\ncomparison with the central nave.To remedy this they gradually\nincreased its dimensions, and at last hit on something very like the\nfollowing proportions.They made the height of the side aisle half that\nof the central (the width being also in the same proportion); the\nremaining portions they divided into three, making the triforium\none-third, the clerestory two-thirds of the whole.Thus the three\ndivisions are in the proportion of 1, 2, and 3, each giving value to the\nother, and the whole adding very considerably to all the apparent\ndimensions of the interior.It would have been easy to have carried the\nsystem further and, by increasing the number of the pillars\nlongitudinally and the number of divisions vertically, to have added\nconsiderably to even this appearance of size; but it would then have\nbeen at the expense of simplicity and grandeur: and though the building\nmight have looked larger, the beauty of the design would have been\ndestroyed.One of the most striking exemplifications of the perfection of the\nGothic architects in this department of their art is shown in their\nemployment of towers and spires.As a general rule, placing a tall\nbuilding in juxtaposition with a low one exaggerates the height of the\none and the lowness of the other; and as it was by no means the object\nof the architects to sacrifice their churches for their towers, it\nrequired all their art to raise noble spires without doing this.In the\nbest designs they effected it by bold buttresses below, and the moment\nthe tower got free of the building, by changing it to an octagon and\ncutting it up by pinnacles, and lastly by changing its form into that of\na spire, using generally smaller parts than are found in the church.By\nthese devices they prevented the spire from competing in any way with\nthe church.On the contrary, a spire or group of spires gave dignity and\nheight to the whole design, without deducting from any of its\ndimensions.The city of Paris contains an instructive exemplification of these\ndoctrines—the façade of the Cathedral of Notre Dame (exclusive of the\nupper storey of the towers), and the Arc de l’Etoile being two buildings\nof exactly the same dimensions; yet any one who is not aware of this\nfact would certainly estimate the dimensions of the cathedral as at\nleast a third, if not a half, in excess of the other.It may be said\nthat the arch gains in sublimity and grandeur what it loses in apparent\ndimensions by the simplicity of its parts.The façade of the cathedral,\nthough far from one of the best in France, is by no means deficient in\ngrandeur; and had it been as free from the trammels of utilitarianism as\nthe arch, might easily have been made as simple and as grand, without\nlosing its apparent size.In the other case, by employing in the arch\nthe principles which the Gothic architects elaborated with such pains,\nthe apparent dimensions might have been increased without detracting\nfrom its solidity, and it might thus have been rendered one of the\nsublimest buildings in the world.Peter’s at Rome is an example of the neglect of\nthese principles.Its great nave is divided into only four bays, and the\nproportions and ornaments of these, borrowed generally from external\narchitecture, are so gigantic, that it is difficult to realise the true\ndimensions of the church, except by the study of the plan; and it is not\ntoo much to assert, that had a cathedral of these dimensions been built\nin the true Gothic style, during the 13th or 14th century, it would have\nappeared as if from one-third to one-half larger, and might have been\nthe most sublime, whereas St.Peter’s is now only the largest temple\never erected.It would be easy to multiply examples to show to what perfection the\nscience of proportion was carried by the experimental processes above\ndescribed during the existence of the true styles of architecture, and\nhow satisfactory the result is, even upon those who are not aware of the\ncause; and, on the other hand, how miserable are the failures that\nresult either from the ignorance or neglect of its rules.Enough, it is\nhoped, has been said to show that not only are the apparent proportions\nof a building very much under the control of an architect independent of\nits lineal dimensions, but also that he has it in his power so to\nproportion every part as to give value to all those around it, thus\nproducing that harmony which in architecture, as well as in music or in\npainting, is the very essence of a true or satisfactory utterance.XI.—CARVED ORNAMENT.Architectural ornament is of two kinds, _constructive_ and _decorative_.By the former is meant all those contrivances, such as capitals,\nbrackets, vaulting shafts, and the like, which serve to explain or give\nexpression to the construction; by the latter, such as mouldings, frets,\nfoliage, &c., which give grace and life either to the actual\nconstructive forms, or to the constructive decoration.In mere building or engineering, the construction being all in all, it\nis left to tell its own tale in its own prosaic nakedness; but in true\narchitecture construction is always subordinate, and as architectural\nbuildings ought always to possess an excess of strength it need not show\nitself unless desired; but even in an artistic point of view it always\nis expedient to express it.The vault, for instance, of a Gothic\ncathedral might just as easily spring from a bracket or a corbel as from\na shaft, and in early experiments this was often tried; but the effect\nwas unsatisfactory, and a vaulting shaft was carried down first to the\ncapital of the pillar, and afterwards to the floor: by this means the\neye was satisfied, the thin reed-like shafts being sufficient to explain\nthat the vault rested on the solid ground, and an apparent propriety and\nstability were given to the whole.These shafts not being necessary\nconstructively, the artist could make them of any form or size he\nthought most proper, and consequently, instead of one he generally used\nthree small shafts tied together at various intervals.Afterwards merely\na group of graceful mouldings was employed, which satisfied not only the\nexigencies of ornamental construction, but became a real and essential\ndecorative feature of the building.In like manner it was good architecture to use flying buttresses, even\nwhere they were not essential to stability.They explained externally\nthat the building was vaulted, and that its thrusts were abutted and\nstability secured.The mistake in their employment was where they became\nso essential to security, that the constructive necessities controlled\nthe artistic propriety of the design, and the architect found himself\ncompelled to employ either a greater number, or buttresses of greater\nstrength than he would have desired had he been able to dispense with\nthem.The architecture of the Greeks was so simple, that they required few\nartifices to explain their construction; but in their triglyphs their\nmutules, the form of their cornices and other devices, they took pains\nto explain, not only that these parts had originally been of wood but\nthat the temple still retained its wooden roof.Had they ever adopted a\nvault, they would have employed a totally different system of\ndecoration.Having no constructive use whatever, these parts were wholly\nunder the control of the architects, and they consequently became the\nbeautiful things we now so much admire.With their more complicated style the Romans introduced many new modes\nof constructive decoration.They were the first to employ vaulting\nshafts.In all the great halls of their Baths, or of their vaulted\nBasilicas, they applied a Corinthian pillar as a vaulting shaft to the\nfront of the pier from which the arch appears to spring, though the\nlatter really supported the vault.All the pillars have now been\nremoved, but without at all interfering with the stability of the\nvaults; they were mere decorative features to explain the construction,\nbut indispensable for that purpose.The Romans also suggested most of\nthe other decorative inventions of the Middle Ages, but their\narchitecture never reached beyond the stage of transition.It was left\nfor the Gothic architects freely to elaborate this mode of architectural\neffect, and they carried it to an extent never dreamt of before; but it\nis to this that their buildings owe at least half the beauty they\npossess.The same system of course applies to dwelling-houses, and to the meanest\nobjects of architectural art.The string-course that marks externally\nthe floor-line of the different storeys is as legitimate and\nindispensable an ornament as a vaulting shaft, and it would also be well\nthat the windows should be grouped so as to indicate the size of the\nrooms, and at least a plain space left where a partition wall abuts, or\nbetter still a pilaster or buttress, or line of some sort, ought to mark\nexternally that feature of internal construction.The cornice is as indispensable a termination of the wall as the capital\nis of a pillar; and suggests not only an appropriate support for the\nroof, but eaves to throw the rain off the wall.The same is true with\nregard to pediments or caps over windows: they suggest a means of\nprotecting an opening from the wet; and porches over doorways are\nequally obvious contrivances.Everything, in short, which is actually\nconstructive, or which suggests what was or may be a constructive\nexpedient, is a legitimate object of decoration, and affords the\narchitect unlimited scope for the display of taste and skill, without\ngoing out of his way to seek it.The difficulty in applying ornaments borrowed from other styles is, that\nalthough they all suggest construction, it is not _the_ construction of\nthe buildings to which they are applied.To use Pugin’s clever\nantithesis, “they are constructed ornament, not ornamented\nconstruction,” and as such can never satisfy the mind.However beautiful\nin themselves, they are out of place, there is no real or apparent use\nfor their being there; and, in an art so essentially founded on\nutilitarian principles and common sense as architecture is, any offence\nagainst constructive propriety is utterly intolerable.The other class, or decorative ornaments, are forms invented for the\npurpose, either mere lithic forms, or copied from the vegetable kingdom,\nand applied so as to give elegance or brilliancy to the constructive\ndecoration just described.The first and most obvious of these are mere mouldings, known to\narchitects as Scotias, Cavettos, Ogees, Toruses, Rolls, &c.—curves\nwhich, used in various proportions either horizontally or vertically,\nproduce when artistically combined, the most pleasing effect.In conjunction with these, it is usual to employ a purely conventional\nclass of ornament, such as frets, scrolls, or those known as the bead\nand reel, or egg and dart mouldings; or in Gothic architecture the\nbillet or dog-tooth or all the thousand and one forms that were invented\nduring the Middle Ages.In certain styles of art, vegetable forms are employed even more\nfrequently than those last described.Among these, perhaps the most\nbeautiful and perfect ever invented was that known as the honeysuckle\nornament, which the Greeks borrowed from the Assyrians, but made so\npeculiarly their own.It has all the conventional character of a purely\nlithic, with all the grace of a vegetable form; and, as used with the\nIonic order, is more nearly perfect than any other known.The Romans made a step further towards a more direct imitation of nature\nin their employment of the acanthus leaf.As applied to a capital, or\nwhere the constructive form of the bell beneath it is still distinctly\nseen, it is not only unobjectionable, but productive of the most\npleasing effect.Indeed it is doubtful if anything of its class has yet\nbeen invented so entirely satisfactory as the Roman Corinthian order, as\nfound, for instance, in the so-called Temple of Jupiter Stator at Rome.The proportions of the order have never yet been excelled, and there is\njust that balance between imitation of nature and conventionality which\nis indispensable.It is not so pure or perfect as a Grecian order, but\nas an example of rich decoration applied to an architectural order it is\nunsurpassed.With their disregard of precedent and untrammelled wildness of\nimagination, the Gothic architects tried every form of vegetable\nornament, from the purest conventionalism, where the vegetable form can\nhardly be recognised, to the most literal imitation of nature.While confining himself to purely lithic forms, an architect can never\nsin against good taste, though he may miss many beauties; with the\nlatter class of ornament he is always in danger of offence, and few have\never employed it without falling into mistakes.In the first place,\nbecause it is impossible to imitate perfectly foliage and flowers in\nstone; and secondly, because if the pliant forms of plants are made to\nsupport, or do the work of, hard stone, the incongruity is immediately\napparent, and the more perfect the imitation the greater the mistake.5), any amount of literal imitation that\nthe sculptor thought proper may be indulged in, because in it the stone\nconstruction is so apparent everywhere, that the vegetable form is the\nmerest supplement conceivable; or in a hollow moulding round a doorway,\na vine may be sculptured with any degree of imitation that can be\nemployed; for as it has no more work to do than the object represented\nwould have in the same situation, it is a mere adjunct, a statue of a\nplant placed in a niche, as we might use the statue of a man: but if in\nthe woodcut (No.6) imitations of real leaves were used to support the\nupper moulding, the effect would not be so satisfactory; indeed it is\nquestionable if in both these last examples a little more\nconventionality would not be desirable.In too many instances, even in the best Gothic architecture, the\nconstruction is so overlaid by imitative vegetable forms as to be\nconcealed, and the work is apparently done by leaves or twigs, but in\nthe earliest and purest style this is almost never the case.As a\ngeneral rule it may be asserted that the best lithic ornaments are those\nwhich approach nearest to the grace and pliancy of plants, and that the\nbest vegetable forms are those which most resemble the regularity and\nsymmetry of such as are purely conventional.Although the Greeks in one or two instances employed human figures to\nsupport entablatures or beams, the good taste of such an arrangement is\nmore than questionable.They borrowed it, with the Ionic order, from the\nAssyrians, with whom the employment of caryatides and animal forms was\nthe rule, not the exception, in contradistinction from the Egyptians,\nwho never adopted this practice.[14] Even the Romans avoided this\nmistake, and the Gothic architects also as a general rule kept quite\nclear of it.Whenever they did employ ornamented figures for\narchitectural purposes, they were either monsters, as in gargoyles or\ngriffons; or sometimes, in a spirit of caricature, they used dwarfs or\ndeformities of various sorts; but their sculpture, properly so called,\nwas always provided with a niche or pedestal, where it might have been\nplaced after the building was complete, or from which it might be\nremoved without interfering with the architecture.Colour is one of the most invaluable elements placed at the command of\nthe architect to enable him to give grace or finish to his designs.From\nits nature it is of course only an accessory, or mere ornament; but\nthere is nothing that enables him to express his meaning so cheaply and\neasily, and at the same time with such brilliancy and effect.For an\ninterior it is absolutely indispensable; and no apartment can be said to\nbe complete till it has received its finishing touches from the hand of\nthe painter.Whether exteriors ought or ought not to be similarly\ntreated admits of more doubt.Internally the architect has complete command of the situation: he can\nsuit his design to his colours, or his colours to his design.Walls,\nroof, floor, furniture, are all at his disposal, and he can shut out any\ndiscordant element that would interfere with the desired effect.Externally this is seldom, if ever the case.A façade that looks\nbrilliant and well in noonday sun may be utterly out of harmony with a\ncold grey sky, or with the warm glow of a setting sun full upon it: and\nunless all other buildings and objects are toned into accordance with\nit, the effect can seldom be harmonious.There can be now no reasonable doubt that the Greeks painted their\ntemples both internally and externally, but as a general rule they\nalways placed them on heights where they could only be seen relieved\nagainst the sky; and they could depend on an atmosphere of almost\nuniform, unvarying brightness.Had their temples been placed in groves\nor valleys, they would probably have given up the attempt, and certainly\nnever would have ventured upon it in such a climate as ours.Except in such countries as Egypt and Greece, it must always be a\nmistake to apply colour by merely painting the surface of the building\nexternally; but there are other modes of effecting this which are\nperfectly legitimate.ornaments may be inlaid in the stone of\nthe wall without interfering with the construction, and so placed may be\nmade more effective and brilliant than the same ornaments would be if\ncarved in relief.Again, string-courses and mouldings of various\n stones or marbles might frequently be employed with better\neffect than can be obtained in some situations by depth of cutting and\nboldness of projection.Such a mode of decoration can, however, only be\npartial; if the whole building is to be, it must be done\nconstructively, by using different  materials, or the effect\nwill never be satisfactory.In the Middle Ages the Italians carried this mode of decoration to a\nconsiderable extent; but in almost all instances it is so evidently a\nveneer overlying the construction that it fails to please; and a\ndecoration which internally, where construction is of less importance,\nwould excite general admiration, is without meaning on the outside of\nthe same wall.At the same time it is easy to conceive how polychromy might be carried\nout successfully, if, for instance, a building were erected, the pillars\nof which were of red granite or porphyry, the cornices or string-courses\nof dark  marbles, and the plain surfaces of lighter kinds, or\neven of stone.A design so carried out would be infinitely more\neffective than a similar one executed in materials of only one colour,\nand depending for relief only on varying shadows of daylight.There is\nin fact just the same difficulty in lighting monochromatic buildings as\nthere is with sculpture.A  painting, on the other hand,\nrequires merely sufficient light, and with that expresses its form and\nmeaning far more clearly and easily than when only one colour is\nemployed.The task, however, is difficult; so much so, indeed, that\nthere is hardly one single instance known of a complete polychromatic\ndesign being successfully carried out anywhere, though often attempted.The other mode of merely inlaying the ornaments in colour instead of\nrelieving them by carving as seldom fails.Notwithstanding this, an architect should never neglect to select the\ncolour of his materials with reference to the situation in which his\nbuilding is to stand.A red brick building may look remarkably well if\nnestling among green trees, while the same building would be hideous if\nsituated on a sandy plain, and relieved only by the warm glow of a\nsetting sun.A building of white stone or white brick is as\ninappropriate among the trees, and may look bright and cheerful in the\nother situation.In towns colours might be used of very great brilliancy, and if done\nconstructively, there could be no greater improvement to our\narchitecture; but its application is so difficult that no satisfactory\nresult has yet been attained, and it may be questioned whether it will\nbe ever successfully accomplished.With regard to interiors there can be no doubt.All architects in all\ncountries of the world resorted to this expedient to harmonise and to\ngive brilliancy to their compositions, and have depended on it for their\nmost important effects.The Gothic architects carried this a step further by the introduction of\npainted glass, which was a mode of colouring more brilliant than had\nbeen ever before attempted.This went beyond all previous efforts,\ninasmuch as it  not only the objects themselves, but also the\nlight in which they were seen.So enamoured were they of its beauties,\nthat they sacrificed much of the constructive propriety of their\nbuildings to admit of its display, and paid more attention to it than to\nany other part of their designs.Perhaps they carried this predilection\na little beyond the limits of good taste; but colour is in itself so\nexquisite a thing, and so admirable a vehicle for the expression of\narchitectural as well as of æsthetic beauty, that it is difficult to\nfind fault even with the abuse of what is in its essence so legitimate\nand so beautiful.XIII.—SCULPTURE AND PAINTING.Carved ornament and decorative colour come within the especial province\nof the architect.In some styles, such as the Saracenic, and in many\nbuildings, they form the Alpha and the Omega of the decoration.But, as\nmentioned above, one of the great merits of architecture as an art is\nthat it affords room for the display of the works of the sculptor and\nthe painter, not only in such a manner as not to interfere with its own\ndecorative construction, but so as to add meaning and value to the\nwhole.No Greek temple and no Gothic cathedral can indeed be said to be\nperfect or complete without these adjuncts; and one of the principal\nobjects of the architects in Greece or in the Middle Ages was to design\nplaces and devise means by which these could be displayed to advantage,\nwithout interfering either with the construction or constructive\ndecoration.This was perhaps effected more successfully in the Parthenon\nthan in any other building we are acquainted with.The pediments at\neither end were noble frames for the exhibition of sculpture, and the\nmetopes were equally appropriate for the purpose; while the plain walls\nof the cella were admirably adapted for paintings below and for a\nsculptured frieze above.The deeply recessed portals of our Gothic cathedrals, their galleries,\ntheir niches and pinnacles, were equally appropriate for the exuberant\ndisplay of this class of sculpture in a less refined or fastidious age;\nwhile the mullion-framed windows were admirably adapted for the\nexhibition of a mode of  decoration, somewhat barbarous, it must\nbe confessed, but wonderfully brilliant.The system was carried further in India than in any other country except\nperhaps Egypt.Probably no Hindu temple was ever erected without being\nat least intended to be adorned with Phonetic sculpture, and many of\nthem are covered with it from the plinth to the eaves, in strong\ncontrast with the Mahomedan buildings that stand side by side with them,\nand which are wholly devoid of any attempt at this kind of decoration.The taste of these Hindu sculptures may be questionable, but such as\nthey are they are so used as never to interfere with the architectural\neffect of the building on which they are employed, but always so as to\naid the design irrespective of the story they have to tell.There is\nprobably no instance in which their removal or their absence would not\nbe felt as an injury from an architectural point of view.It is difficult now to ascertain whether Phonetic painting was used to\nthe same extent as sculpture in ancient times.From its nature it is\ninfinitely more perishable, and a bucket of whitewash will in half an\nhour obliterate the work of years, and, strange to say, there are ages,\nboth in the East and the west, where men’s minds are so attuned that\nthey consider whitewash a more fitting decoration than \npaintings of the most elaborate and artistic character.While this is so\nwe need hardly wonder that our means of forming a distinct opinion on\nthis subject are somewhat limited.Be this as it may, it is still one of the special privileges of\narchitecture that she is able to attract to herself these phonetic arts,\nand one of the greatest merits a building can possess is its affording\nappropriate places for their display without interfering in any way with\nthe special department of the architect.But it is always necessary to\ndistinguish carefully between what belongs to the province of each art\nseparately.The work of the architect ought to be complete and perfect\nwithout either sculpture or painting, and must be judged as if they were\nabsent; but he will not have been entirely successful unless he has\nprovided the means by which the value of his design may be doubled by\ntheir introduction.It is only by the combination of the Phonetic\nutterance with the Technic and Æsthetic elements that a perfect work of\nart has been produced, and that architecture can be said to have reached\nthe highest point of perfection to which it can aspire.Considerable confusion has been introduced into the reasoning on the\nsubject of architectural Uniformity from the assumption that the two\ngreat schools of art—the classical and the mediæval—adopted contrary\nconclusions regarding it, Formality being supposed to be the\ncharacteristic of the former, Irregularity of the latter.The Greeks, of\ncourse, when building a temple or monument, which was only one room or\none object, made it exactly symmetrical in all its parts; but so did the\nGothic architects when building a church or chapel or hall, or any\nsingle object: in ninety-nine instances out of a hundred, a line drawn\ndown the centre divides it into two equal and symmetrical halves; and\nwhen an exception to this occurs, there is some obvious motive for it.But where several buildings of different classes were to be grouped, or\neven two temples placed near one another, the Greeks took the utmost\ncare to prevent their appearing parts of one design or one whole; and\nwhen, as in the instance of the Erechtheium,[15] three temples are\nplaced together, no Gothic architect ever took such pains to secure for\neach its separate individuality as the Grecian architect did.What has\ngiven rise to the error is, that all the smaller objects of Grecian art\nhave perished, leaving us only the great monuments without their\nadjuncts.If we can conceive the task assigned to a Grecian architect of erecting\na building like one of our collegiate institutions, he would without\ndoubt have distinguished the chapel from the refectory, and that from\nthe library, and he would have made them of a totally different design\nfrom the principal’s lodge, or the chambers of the fellows and students;\nbut it is more than probable that, while carefully distinguishing each\npart from the other, he would have arranged them with some regard to\nsymmetry, placing the chapel in the centre, the library and refectory as\npendants to one another, though dissimilar, and the residences so as to\nconnect and fill up the whole design.The truth seems to be that no\ngreat amount of dignity can be obtained without a certain degree of\nregularity; and there can be little doubt that artistically it is better\nthat mere utilitarian convenience should give way to the exigencies of\narchitectural design than that the latter should be constrained to yield\nto the mere prosaic requirements of the building.The chance-medley\nmanner in which many such buildings were grouped together in the Middle\nAges tells the story as clearly, and may be productive of great\npicturesqueness of effect, but not of the same nobility as might have\nbeen obtained by more regularity.The highest class of design will never\nbe reached by these means.It is not difficult to discover, at least to a certain extent, that the\ncause of this is that no number of separate units will suffice to make\none whole.A number of pebbles will not make a great stone, nor a number\nof rose-bushes an oak; nor will any number of dwarfs make up a giant.To\nobtain a great whole there must be unity, to which all the parts must\ncontribute, or they will remain separate particles.The effect of unity\nis materially heightened when to it is added uniformity: the mind then\ninstantly and easily grasps the whole, knows it to be one, and\nrecognises the ruling idea that governed and moulded the whole together.It seems only to be by the introduction of uniformity that sufficient\nsimplicity for greatness can be obtained, and the evidence of design\nmade so manifest that the mind is satisfied that the building is no mere\naccumulation of separate objects, but the production of a master-mind.In a palace irregularity seems unpardonable.The architect has there\npractically unlimited command of funds and of his arrangements, and he\ncan easily design his suites of rooms so as to produce any amount of\nuniformity he may require: the different heights of the different\nstoreys and the amount of ornament on them, with the employment of wings\nfor offices, is sufficient to mark the various purposes of the various\nparts; but where the system is carried so far in great public buildings,\nthat great halls, libraries, committee-rooms, and subordinate residences\nare all squeezed into one perfectly uniform design, the building loses\nall meaning, and fails from the opposite error.The rule seems to be, that every building or every part of one ought\nmost distinctly and clearly to express not only its constructive\nexigencies, but also the uses for which it is destined; on the other\nhand, that mere utility, in all instances where architectural effect is\naimed at, ought to give way to artistic requirements; and that an\narchitect is consequently justified, in so far as his means will admit,\nin producing that amount of uniformity and regularity which seems\nindispensable for anything like grandeur of effect.In villas and small\nbuildings all we look for is picturesqueness and meaning combined with\nelegance; but in larger and more monumental erections we expect\nsomething more; and this can hardly be obtained without the introduction\nof some new element which shall tell, in the first place, that artistic\nexcellence was the ruling idea of the design, and in the next should\ngive it that perfect balance and symmetry which seems to be as inherent\na quality of the higher works of nature as of true art.XV.—IMITATION OF NATURE.The subject of the imitation of Nature is one intimately connected with\nthose mooted in the preceding paragraphs, and regarding which\nconsiderable misunderstanding seems to prevail.It is generally assumed\nthat in architecture we ought to copy natural objects as we see them,\nwhereas the truth seems to be that we ought always to copy the\nprocesses, never the forms of Nature.The error apparently has arisen\nfrom confounding together the imitative arts of painting and sculpture\nwith the constructive art of architecture.The former have no other mode\nof expression than by copying, more or less literally, the forms of\nNature; the latter, as explained above, depends wholly on a different\nclass of elements for its effect; but at the same time no architect can\neither study too intently, or copy too closely, the methods and\nprocesses by which Nature accomplishes her ends; and the most perfect\nbuilding will be that in which these have been most closely and\nliterally followed.To take one prominent instance:—So far as we can judge, the human body\nis the most perfect of Nature’s works; in it the groundwork of skeleton\nis never seen, and though it can hardly be said to be anywhere\nconcealed, it is only displayed at the joints or more prominent points\nof support, where the action of the frame would be otherwise\nunintelligible.The muscles are disposed not only where they are most\nuseful, but so as to form groups gracefully rounded in outline.The\nsoftness and elegance of these are further aided by the deposition of\nadipose matter, and the whole is covered with a skin which with its\nbeautiful texture conceals the more utilitarian construction of the\ninternal parts.In the trunk of the body the viscera are disposed wholly\nwithout symmetry or reference to beauty of any sort—the heart on one\nside, the liver on the other, and the other parts exactly in those\npositions and in those forms by which they may most directly and easily\nperform the essential functions for which they are designed.But the\nwhole is concealed in a perfectly symmetrical sheath of the most\nexquisitely beautiful outline.John went to the hallway.It may be safely asserted that a building\nis beautiful and perfect exactly in the ratio in which the same amount\nof concealment and the same amount of display of construction is\npreserved, where the same symmetry is shown as between the right and\nleft sides of the human body—the same difference as between the legs and\narms, where the parts are applied to different purposes, and where the\nsame amount of ornament is added, to adorn without interfering with what\nis useful.In short, there is no principle involved in the structure of\nman which may not be taken as the most absolute standard of excellence\nin architecture.It is in Nature’s highest works that we find the symmetry of proportion\nmost prominent.John went back to the garden.When we descend to the lower types of animals we lose it\nto a great extent, and among trees and vegetables generally find it only\nin a far less degree, and sometimes miss it altogether.In the mineral\nkingdom among rocks and stones it is altogether absent.So universal is\nthis principle in Nature that we may safely apply it to our criticism on\nart, and say that a building is perfect as a whole in proportion to its\nmotived regularity, and departs from the highest type in the ratio in\nwhich symmetrical arrangement is neglected.It may, however, be\nincorrect to say that an oak-tree is a less perfect work of creation\nthan a human being, but it is certain that it is lower in the scale of\ncreated beings.So it may be said that a picturesque group of Gothic\nbuildings may be as perfect as the stately regularity of an Egyptian or\nclassic temple; but if it is so, it is equally certain that it belongs\nto a lower and inferior class of design.This analogy, however, we may leave for the present.The one point which\nit is indispensable to insist on here is, that man can progress or tend\ntowards success only by following the principles and copying, so far as\nhe can understand them, the processes which Nature employs in her works;\nbut he can never succeed in anything by copying forms without reference\nto principles.If we could find Nature making trees like stones, or\nanimals like trees, or birds like fishes, or fishes like mammalia, or\nusing any parts taken from one kingdom for purposes belonging to\nanother, it would then be perfectly legitimate for us to use man’s\nstature as the modulus for a Doric, or woman’s as that of an Ionic\ncolumn—to build cathedrals like groves, and make windows like leaves, or\nto estimate their beauty by their resemblance to such objects; but all\nsuch comparisons proceed on an entire mistake of what imitation of\nNature really means.It is the merest and most absolute negation of reason to apply to one\npurpose things that were designed for another, or to imitate them when\nthey have no appropriateness; but it is our highest privilege to\nunderstand the processes of Nature.To apply these to our own wants and\npurposes is the noblest use of human intellect and the perfection of\nhuman wisdom.So instinctively, but so literally, has this correct process of\nimitating Nature been followed in all true styles of architecture, that\nwe can always reason regarding them as we do with reference to natural\nobjects.Thus, if an architect finds in any quarter of the globe a Doric\nor Corinthian capital with a few traces of a foundation, he can, at a\nglance, tell the age of the temple or building to which it belonged.He\nknows who the people were who erected it, to what purpose it was\ndedicated, and proceeds at once to restore its porticos, and without\nmuch uncertainty can reproduce the whole fabric.Or if he finds a few\nGothic bases in situ, with a few mouldings or frusta of columns, by the\nsame process he traces the age, the size, and the purposes of the\nbuilding before him.A Cuvier or an Owen can restore the form and\npredicate the habits of an extinct animal from a few fragments of bone,\nor even from a print of a foot.In the same manner an architect may,\nfrom a few fragments of a building, if of a true style of architecture,\nrestore the whole of its pristine forms, and with almost the same amount\nof certainty.This arises wholly because the architects of former days\nhad correct ideas of what was meant by imitation of Nature.They added\nnothing to their buildings which was not essential; there was no detail\nwhich had not its use, and no ornament which was not an elaboration or\nheightening of some essential part, and hence it is that a true building\nis as like to a work of Nature as any production of man’s hands can be\nto the creations of his Maker.There is one property inherent in the productions of architectural art,\nwhich, while it frequently lends to them half their charm, at the same\ntime tends more than anything else to warp and distort our critical\njudgments regarding them.We seldom can look at a building of any age\nwithout associating with it such historical memories as may cling to its\nwalls; and our predilections for any peculiar style of architecture are\nmore often due to educational or devotional associations than to purely\nartistic judgments.A man must be singularly ignorant or strangely\npassionless who can stand among the fallen columns of a Grecian temple,\nor wander through the corridors of a Roman amphitheatre, or the aisles\nof a ruined Gothic abbey, and not feel his heart stirred by emotions of\na totally different class from those suggested by the beauty of the\nmouldings or the artistic arrangement of the building he is\ncontemplating.The enthusiasm which burst forth in the 15th century for the classical\nstyle of art, and then proved fatal to the Gothic, was not so much an\narchitectural as a literary movement.It arose from the re-discovery—if\nit may be so called—of the poems of Homer and Virgil, of the histories\nof Thucydides and Tacitus, of the Philosophy of Aristotle and the\neloquence of Cicero.It was a vast reaction against the darkness and\nliterary degradation of the Middle Ages, and carried the educated\nclasses of Europe with it for the next three centuries.So long as\nclassical literature only was taught in our schools, and classical\nmodels followed in our literature, classical architecture could alone be\ntolerated in our buildings, and this generally without the least\nreference either to its own peculiar beauties, or its appropriateness\nfor the purposes to which it was applied.A second reaction has now taken place against this state of affairs.The\nrevival of the rites and ceremonies of the mediæval Church, our reverent\nlove of our own national antiquities, and our admiration for the rude\nbut vigorous manhood of the Middle Ages,—all have combined to repress\nthe classical element both in our literature and our art, and to exalt\nin their place Gothic feelings and Gothic art, to an extent which cannot\nbe justified on any grounds of reasonable criticism.Unless the art-critic can free himself from the influence of these\nadventitious associations, his judgments lose half their value; but, on\nthe other hand, to the historian of art they are of the utmost\nimportance.It is because architecture so fully and so clearly expresses\nthe feelings of the people who practised it that it becomes frequently a\nbetter vehicle of history than the written page; and it is these very\nassociations that give life and meaning to blocks of stone and mounds of\nbrick, and bring so vividly before our eyes the feelings and the\naspirations of the long-forgotten past.The importance of association in giving value to the objects of\narchitectural art can hardly be overrated either by the student or\nhistorian.What has to be guarded against is that unreasoning enthusiasm\nwhich mistakes the shadow for the reality, and would force us to admire\na rude piece of clumsy barbarism erected yesterday, and to which no\nhistory consequently attaches, because something like it was done in\nsome long past age.Its reality, its antiquity, and its weather stains\nmay render its prototype extremely interesting, even if not beautiful;\nwhile its copy is only an antiquarian toy, as ugly as it is absurd.There is still one other point of view from which it is necessary to\nlook at this question of architectural design before any just conclusion\ncan be arrived at regarding it.It is in fact necessary to answer two\nother questions, nearly as often asked as those proposed at the\nbeginning of Section III.“Can any one invent a new style?”—“Can we ever\nagain have a new and original style of architecture?” Reasoning from\nexperience alone, it is easy to answer these questions.No individual\nhas, so far as we know, ever invented a new style in any part of the\nworld.No one can even be named who during the prevalence of a true\nstyle of art materially advanced its progress, or by his individual\nexertion did much to help it forward; and we may safely answer, that as\nthis has never happened before, it is hardly probable that it will ever\noccur now.If this one question must be answered in the negative, the other may as\ncertainly be answered in the affirmative, inasmuch as no nation in any\nage or in any part of the globe has failed to invent for itself a true\nand appropriate style of architecture whenever it chose to set about it\nin the right way, and there certainly can be no great difficulty in our\ndoing now what has been so often done before, if we only set to work in\na proper spirit, and are prepared to follow the same process which\nothers have followed to obtain this result.What that process is, may perhaps be best explained by such an example\nas that of ship-building before alluded to, which, though totally\ndistinct, is still so nearly allied to architecture, as to make a\ncomparison between the two easy and intelligible.Let us, for instance, take a series of ships, beginning with those in\nwhich William the Conqueror invaded our shores, or the fleet with which\nEdward III.Next take the vessels which\ntransported Henry VIII.to his meeting with Francis I., and then pass on\nto the time of the Spanish Armada and the sea fights of Van Tromp and De\nRuyter, and on to the times of William III., and then through the\nfamiliar examples till we come to such ships as the ‘Wellington’ and\n‘Marlborough’ of yesterday, and the ‘Warrior’ or ‘Minotaur’ of to-day.In all this long list of examples we have a gradual, steady, forward\nprogress without one check or break.Each century is in advance of the\none before it, and the result is as near perfection as we can well\nconceive.But if we ask who effected these improvements, or who invented any part\nof the last-named wonderful fabrics, we must search deep indeed into the\nannals of the navy to find out.But no one has inquired and no one cares\nto know, for the simple reason that, like architecture in the Middle\nAges, it is a true and living art, and the improvements were not\neffected by individuals, but by all classes—owners, sailors,\nshipwrights, and men of science, all working together through centuries,\neach lending the aid of his experience or of his reasoning.If we place alongside of this series of ships a list of churches or\ncathedrals, commencing with Charlemagne and ending with Charles V., we\nfind the same steady and assured progress obtained by the same identical\nmeans.In this instance, princes, priests, masons, and mathematicians,\nall worked steadily together for the whole period, striving to obtain a\nwell-defined result.In the ship the most suitable materials only are employed in every part,\nand neither below nor aloft is there one single timber nor spar nor one\nrope which is superfluous.Nor in the cathedral was any material ever\nused that was not believed to be the most suitable for its purpose; nor\nany form of construction adopted which did not seem the best to those\nwho employed it; nor any detail added which did not appear necessary for\nthe purpose it was designed to express?the result being, that we can']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['I\'m not much\nfor excitement in that direction, anyhow.""It is a matter of taste, isn\'t it?""You\'re living in the city, of course?"And he\ndeftly changed the subject before waving him a perfunctory\nfarewell.Lester missed at once the inquiries which a man like Dodge would\nhave made if he had really believed that he was married.Under\nordinary circumstances his friend would have wanted to know a great\ndeal about the new Mrs.There would have been all those little\nfamiliar touches common to people living on the same social plane.Dodge would have asked Lester to bring his wife over to see them,\nwould have definitely promised to call.Nothing of the sort happened,\nand Lester noticed the significant omission.It was the same with the Burnham Moores, the Henry Aldriches, and a\nscore of other people whom he knew equally well.Apparently they all\nthought that he had married and settled down.They were interested to\nknow where he was living, and they were rather disposed to joke him\nabout being so very secretive on the subject, but they were not\nwilling to discuss the supposed Mrs.He was beginning to see\nthat this move of his was going to tell against him notably.One of the worst stabs--it was the cruelest because, in a way,\nit was the most unintentional--he received from an old\nacquaintance, Will Whitney, at the Union Club.Lester was dining there\none evening, and Whitney met him in the main reading-room as he was\ncrossing from the cloak-room to the cigar-stand.The latter was a\ntypical society figure, tall, lean, smooth-faced, immaculately garbed,\na little cynical, and to-night a little the worse for liquor.he called out, "what\'s this talk about a menage\nof yours out in Hyde Park?How are you going\nto explain all this to your wife when you get married?""I don\'t have to explain it," replied Lester irritably."Why should\nyou be so interested in my affairs?You\'re not living in a stone\nhouse, are you?"that\'s pretty good now, isn\'t it?You didn\'t marry\nthat little beauty you used to travel around with on the North Side,\ndid you?You didn\'t, now,\ndid you?""Cut it out, Whitney," said Lester roughly."Pardon, Lester," said the other aimlessly, but sobering.Eight whisky-sours\nstraight in the other room there.I\'ll talk to you some time\nwhen I\'m all right.I\'m a little loose,\nthat\'s right.Lester could not get over that cacophonous "ha!It cut him,\neven though it came from a drunken man\'s mouth."That little beauty\nyou used to travel with on the North Side.You didn\'t marry her, did\nyou?"He quoted Whitney\'s impertinences resentfully.He had never endured anything like this\nbefore--he, Lester Kane.Certainly he was\npaying dearly for trying to do the kind thing by Jennie.CHAPTER XLI\n\n\nBut worse was to follow.The American public likes gossip about\nwell-known people, and the Kanes were wealthy and socially prominent.The report was that Lester, one of its principal heirs, had married a\nservant girl.What a\npiquant morsel for the newspapers!Very soon the paragraphs began to\nappear.A small society paper, called the South Side Budget,\nreferred to him anonymously as "the son of a famous and wealthy\ncarriage manufacturer of Cincinnati," and outlined briefly what it\nknew of the story.----" it went on, sagely, "not\nso much is known, except that she once worked in a well-known\nCleveland society family as a maid and was, before that, a\nworking-girl in Columbus, Ohio.After such a picturesque love-affair\nin high society, who shall say that romance is dead?"He did not take the paper, but some kind soul\ntook good care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him.It\nirritated him greatly, for he suspected at once that it was a scheme\nto blackmail him.But he did not know exactly what to do about it.He\npreferred, of course, that such comments should cease, but he also\nthought that if he made any effort to have them stopped he might make\nmatters worse.Naturally, the paragraph in the\nBudget attracted the attention of other newspapers.It sounded\nlike a good story, and one Sunday editor, more enterprising than the\nothers, conceived the notion of having this romance written up.A\nfull-page Sunday story with a scare-head such as "Sacrifices Millions\nfor His Servant Girl Love," pictures of Lester, Jennie, the house at\nHyde Park, the Kane manufactory at Cincinnati, the warehouse on\nMichigan Avenue--certainly, such a display would make a\nsensation.The Kane Company was not an advertiser in any daily or\nSunday paper.If Lester had been\nforewarned he might have put a stop to the whole business by putting\nan advertisement in the paper or appealing to the publisher.He did\nnot know, however, and so was without power to prevent the\npublication.The editor made a thorough job of the business.Local\nnewspaper men in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus were instructed\nto report by wire whether anything of Jennie\'s history was known in\ntheir city.The Bracebridge family in Cleveland was asked whether\nJennie had ever worked there.A garbled history of the Gerhardts was\nobtained from Columbus.Jennie\'s residence on the North Side, for\nseveral years prior to her supposed marriage, was discovered and so\nthe whole story was nicely pieced together.It was not the idea of the\nnewspaper editor to be cruel or critical, but rather complimentary.All the bitter things, such as the probable illegitimacy of Vesta, the\nsuspected immorality of Lester and Jennie in residing together as man\nand wife, the real grounds of the well-known objections of his family\nto the match, were ignored.The idea was to frame up a Romeo and\nJuliet story in which Lester should appear as an ardent,\nself-sacrificing lover, and Jennie as a poor and lovely working-girl,\nlifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion of her\nmillionaire lover.An exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to make\nscenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing\nwas handled in the most approved yellow-journal style.There was a\npicture of Lester obtained from his Cincinnati photographer for a\nconsideration; Jennie had been surreptitiously "snapped" by a staff\nartist while she was out walking.And so, apparently out of a clear sky, the story\nappeared--highly complimentary, running over with sugary phrases,\nbut with all the dark, sad facts looming up in the background.Jennie\ndid not see it at first.Lester came across the page accidentally, and\ntore it out.He was stunned and chagrined beyond words."To think the\ndamned newspaper would do that to a private citizen who was quietly\nminding his own business!"He went out of the house, the\nbetter to conceal his deep inward mortification.He avoided the more\npopulous parts of the town, particularly the down-town section, and\nrode far out on Cottage Grove Avenue to the open prairie.He wondered,\nas the trolley-car rumbled along, what his friends were\nthinking--Dodge, and Burnham Moore, and Henry Aldrich, and the\nothers.The best he could do was to put a\nbrave face on it and say nothing, or else wave it off with an\nindifferent motion of the hand.One thing was sure--he would\nprevent further comment.He returned to the house calmer, his\nself-poise restored, but he was eager for Monday to come in order that\nhe might get in touch with his lawyer, Mr.Watson it was soon agreed between the two men that it would be\nfoolish to take any legal action.It was the part of wisdom to let the\nmatter drop."But I won\'t stand for anything more," concluded\nLester."I\'ll attend to that," said the lawyer, consolingly."It\'s amazing--this damned country of ours!""A man with a little money hasn\'t any more privacy than a\npublic monument.""A man with a little money," said Mr.Watson, "is just like a cat\nwith a bell around its neck.Every rat knows exactly where it is and\nwhat it is doing.""That\'s an apt simile," assented Lester, bitterly.Jennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days.Lester felt that he could not talk it over, and Gerhardt never read\nthe wicked Sunday newspapers.Finally, one of Jennie\'s neighborhood\nfriends, less tactful than the others, called her attention to the\nfact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it."Why, I hadn\'t seen it," she said."Are you\nsure it was about us?"I\'ll send Marie over with it when\nI get back."I wish you would," she said, weakly.She was wondering where they had secured her picture, what the\narticle said.Above all, she was dismayed to think of its effect upon\nLester.Why had he not spoken to her about\nit?The neighbor\'s daughter brought over the paper, and Jennie\'s heart\nstood still as she glanced at the title-page.There it all\nwas--uncompromising and direct.How dreadfully conspicuous the\nheadline--"This Millionaire Fell in Love With This Lady\'s Maid,"\nwhich ran between a picture of Lester on the left and Jennie on the\nright.There was an additional caption which explained how Lester, son\nof the famous carriage family of Cincinnati, had sacrificed great\nsocial opportunity and distinction to marry his heart\'s desire.Below\nwere scattered a number of other pictures--Lester addressing\nJennie in the mansion of Mrs.Bracebridge, Lester standing with her\nbefore an imposing and conventional-looking parson, Lester driving\nwith her in a handsome victoria, Jennie standing beside the window of\nan imposing mansion (the fact that it was a mansion being indicated by\nmost sumptuous-looking hangings) and gazing out on a very modest\nworking-man\'s cottage pictured in the distance.Jennie felt as though\nshe must die for very shame.She did not so much mind what it meant to\nher, but Lester, Lester, how must he feel?Now they\nwould have another club with which to strike him and her.She tried to\nkeep calm about it, to exert emotional control, but again the tears\nwould rise, only this time they were tears of opposition to defeat.She did not want to be hounded this way.Why couldn\'t the world help her,\ninstead of seeking to push her down?CHAPTER XLII\n\n\nThe fact that Lester had seen this page was made perfectly clear to\nJennie that evening, for he brought it home himself, having concluded,\nafter mature deliberation, that he ought to.He had told her once that\nthere was to be no concealment between them, and this thing, coming so\nbrutally to disturb their peace, was nevertheless a case in point.He\nhad decided to tell her not to think anything of it--that it did\nnot make much difference, though to him it made all the difference in\nthe world.The effect of this chill history could never be undone.The\nwise--and they included all his social world and many who were\nnot of it--could see just how he had been living.The article\nwhich accompanied the pictures told how he had followed Jennie from\nCleveland to Chicago, how she had been coy and distant and that he had\nto court her a long time to win her consent.This was to explain their\nliving together on the North Side.Lester realized that this was an\nasinine attempt to sugar-coat the true story and it made him angry.Still he preferred to have it that way rather than in some more brutal\nvein.He took the paper out of his pocket when he arrived at the\nhouse, spreading it on the library table.Jennie, who was close by,\nwatched him, for she knew what was coming."Here\'s something that will interest you, Jennie," he said dryly,\npointing to the array of text and pictures."I\'ve already seen it, Lester," she said wearily.Stendahl\nshowed it to me this afternoon."Rather high-flown description of my attitude, isn\'t it?I didn\'t\nknow I was such an ardent Romeo.""I\'m awfully sorry, Lester," said Jennie, reading behind the dry\nface of humor the serious import of this affair to him.She had long\nsince learned that Lester did not express his real feeling, his big\nills in words.He was inclined to jest and make light of the\ninevitable, the inexorable.This light comment merely meant "this\nmatter cannot be helped, so we will make the best of it.""Oh, don\'t feel badly about it," he went on."It isn\'t anything\nwhich can be adjusted now.We just\nhappen to be in the limelight.""I understand," said Jennie, coming over to him."I\'m sorry,\nthough, anyway."Dinner was announced a moment later and the incident\nwas closed.But Lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting\nin a bad way.His father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at\nthe last interview, and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the\nclimax.He might as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his\nold world.It would have none of him, or at least the more\nconservative part of it would not.There were a few bachelors, a few\ngay married men, some sophisticated women, single and married, who saw\nthrough it all and liked him just the same, but they did not make\nsociety.He was virtually an outcast, and nothing could save him but\nto reform his ways; in other words, he must give up Jennie once and\nfor all.The thought was painful to\nhim--objectionable in every way.Jennie was growing in mental\nacumen.She was beginning to see things quite as clearly as he did.She was not a cheap, ambitious, climbing creature.She was a big woman\nand a good one.It would be a shame to throw her down, and besides she\nwas good-looking.He was forty-six and she was twenty-nine; and she\nlooked twenty-four or five.It is an exceptional thing to find beauty,\nyouth, compatibility, intelligence, your own point of\nview--softened and charmingly emotionalized--in another.He\nhad made his bed, as his father had said.It was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper\nincident that Lester had word that his father was quite ill and\nfailing; it might be necessary for him to go to Cincinnati at any\nmoment.Pressure of work was holding him pretty close when the news\ncame that his father was dead.Lester, of course, was greatly shocked\nand grieved, and he returned to Cincinnati in a retrospective and\nsorrowful mood.His father had been a great character to him--a\nfine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside from his\nrelationship to him as his son.He remembered him now dandling him\nupon his knee as a child, telling him stories of his early life in\nIreland, and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a\nlittle older, impressing the maxims of his business career and his\ncommercial wisdom on him as he grew to manhood.Old Archibald had been\nradically honest.It was to him that Lester owed his instincts for\nplain speech and direct statement of fact."Never lie," was\nArchibald\'s constant, reiterated statement."Never try to make a thing\nlook different from what it is to you.It\'s the breath of\nlife--truth--it\'s the basis of real worth, while commercial\nsuccess--it will make a notable character of any one who will\nstick to it."He admired his father intensely\nfor his rigid insistence on truth, and now that he was really gone he\nfelt sorry.He wished he might have been spared to be reconciled to\nhim.He half fancied that old Archibald would have liked Jennie if he\nhad known her.He did not imagine that he would ever have had the\nopportunity to straighten things out, although he still felt that\nArchibald would have liked her.When he reached Cincinnati it was snowing, a windy, blustery snow.The traffic of the city\nhad a muffled sound.When he stepped down from the train he was met by\nAmy, who was glad to see him in spite of all their past differences.Of all the girls she was the most tolerant.Lester put his arms about\nher, and kissed her."It seems like old times to see you, Amy," he said, "your coming to\nmeet me this way.Well,\npoor father, his time had to come.Still, he lived to see everything\nthat he wanted to see.I guess he was pretty well satisfied with the\noutcome of his efforts.""Yes," replied Amy, "and since mother died he was very lonely."They rode up to the house in kindly good feeling, chatting of old\ntimes and places.All the members of the immediate family, and the\nvarious relatives, were gathered in the old family mansion.Lester\nexchanged the customary condolences with the others, realizing all the\nwhile that his father had lived long enough.He had had a successful\nlife, and had fallen like a ripe apple from the tree.Lester looked at\nhim where he lay in the great parlor, in his black coffin, and a\nfeeling of the old-time affection swept over him.He smiled at the\nclean-cut, determined, conscientious face."The old gentleman was a big man all the way through," he said to\nRobert, who was present."We won\'t find a better figure of a man\nsoon.""We will not," said his brother, solemnly.After the funeral it was decided to read the will at once.Louise\'s\nhusband was anxious to return to Buffalo; Lester was compelled to be\nin Chicago.A conference of the various members of the family was\ncalled for the second day after the funeral, to be held at the offices\nof Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O\'Brien, counselors of the late\nmanufacturer.As Lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father\nhad not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests.It had not been\nso very long since they had had their last conversation; he had been\ntaking his time to think about things, and his father had given him\ntime.He always felt that he had stood well with the old gentleman,\nexcept for his alliance with Jennie.His business judgment had been\nvaluable to the company.Why should there be any discrimination\nagainst him?When they reached the offices of the law firm, Mr.O\'Brien, a\nshort, fussy, albeit comfortable-looking little person, greeted all\nthe members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a\nhearty handshake.He had been personal counsel to Archibald Kane for\ntwenty years.He knew his whims and idiosyncrasies, and considered\nhimself very much in the light of a father confessor.He liked all the\nchildren, Lester especially."Now I believe we are all here," he said, finally, extracting a\npair of large horn reading-glasses from his coat pocket and looking\nsagely about.I will\njust read the will without any preliminary remarks."He turned to his desk, picked up a paper lying upon it, cleared his\nthroat, and began.It was a peculiar document, in some respects, for it began with all\nthe minor bequests; first, small sums to old employees, servants, and\nfriends.It then took up a few institutional bequests, and finally\ncame to the immediate family, beginning with the girls.Imogene, as a\nfaithful and loving daughter was left a sixth of the stock of the\ncarriage company and a fourth of the remaining properties of the\ndeceased, which roughly aggregated (the estate--not her share)\nabout eight hundred thousand dollars.Amy and Louise were provided for\nin exactly the same proportion.The grandchildren were given certain\nlittle bonuses for good conduct, when they should come of age.Then it\ntook up the cases of Robert and Lester."Owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of\nmy son Lester," it began, "I deem it my duty to make certain\nconditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of my\nproperty, to wit: One-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing\nCompany and one-fourth of the remainder of my various properties,\nreal, personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to go to my beloved son\nRobert, in recognition of the faithful performance of his duty, and\none-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing Company and the\nremaining fourth of my various properties, real, personal, moneys,\nstocks and bonds, to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his\nbrother Lester, until such time as such conditions as may hereinafter\nbe set forth shall have been complied with.And it is my wish and\ndesire that my children shall concur in his direction of the Kane\nManufacturing Company, and of such other interests as are entrusted to\nhim, until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such control,\nor shall indicate another arrangement which shall be better."His cheeks changed color, but he did\nnot move.It appeared that he was\nnot even mentioned separately.The conditions "hereinafter set forth" dealt very fully with his\ncase, however, though they were not read aloud to the family at the\ntime, Mr.O\'Brien stating that this was in accordance with their\nfather\'s wish.Lester learned immediately afterward that he was to\nhave ten thousand a year for three years, during which time he had the\nchoice of doing either one of two things: First, he was to leave\nJennie, if he had not already married her, and so bring his life into\nmoral conformity with the wishes of his father.In this event Lester\'s\nshare of the estate was to be immediately turned over to him.Secondly, he might elect to marry Jennie, if he had not already done\nso, in which case the ten thousand a year, specifically set aside to\nhim for three years, was to be continued for life--but for his\nlife only.Mary went to the garden.Jennie was not to have anything of it after his death.The\nten thousand in question represented the annual interest on two\nhundred shares of L. S. and M. S. stock which were also to be held in\ntrust until his decision had been reached and their final disposition\neffected.If Lester refused to marry Jennie, or to leave her, he was\nto have nothing at all after the three years were up.At Lester\'s\ndeath the stock on which his interest was drawn was to be divided pro\nrata among the surviving members of the family.If any heir or assign\ncontested the will, his or her share was thereby forfeited\nentirely.It was astonishing to Lester to see how thoroughly his father had\ntaken his case into consideration.He half suspected, on reading these\nconditions, that his brother Robert had had something to do with the\nframing of them, but of course he could not be sure.Robert had not\ngiven any direct evidence of enmity.he demanded of O\'Brien, a little later."Well, we all had a hand in it," replied O\'Brien, a little\nshamefacedly."It was a very difficult document to draw up.Kane, there was no budging your father.He has\ncome very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses.Of\ncourse, you know, we had nothing to do with its spirit.I hated very much to have to do it."During the reading of the will Lester had sat as stolid as an\nox.He got up after a time, as did the others, assuming an air of\nnonchalance.Robert, Amy, Louise and Imogene all felt shocked, but not\nexactly, not unqualifiedly regretful."I think the old gentleman has been a little rough in this," said\nRobert, who had been sitting next him."I certainly did not expect him\nto go as far as that.So far as I am concerned some other arrangement\nwould have been satisfactory."Imogene, Amy, and Louise were anxious to be consolatory, but they\ndid not know what to say."I\ndon\'t think papa acted quite right, Lester," ventured Amy, but Lester\nwaved her away almost gruffly.He figured out, as he stood there, what his income would be in case\nhe refused to comply with his father\'s wishes.Two hundred shares of\nL. S. and M. S., in open market, were worth a little over one thousand\neach.They yielded from five to six per cent., sometimes more,\nsometimes less.At this rate he would have ten thousand a year, not\nmore.The family gathering broke up, each going his way, and Lester\nreturned to his sister\'s house.He wanted to get out of the city\nquickly, gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one,\nand caught the earliest train back to Chicago.So this was how much his father really cared for him!He, Lester Kane, ten thousand a year, for only three\nyears, and then longer only on condition that he married Jennie!"Ten\nthousand a year," he thought, "and that for three years!To think he should have done that to\nme!"CHAPTER XLIII\n\n\nThis attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely\nset Lester in opposition to his family, at least for the time being.He had realized clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake;\nfirst in not having married Jennie, thus avoiding scandal; and in the\nsecond place in not having accepted her proposition at the time when\nshe wanted to leave him; There were no two ways about it, he had made\na mess of this business.He could not afford to lose his fortune\nentirely.He did not have enough money of his own.Jennie was unhappy,\nhe could see that.Did he want\nto accept the shabby ten thousand a year, even if he were willing to\nmarry her?Finally, did he want to lose Jennie, to have her go out of\nhis life once and for all?He could not make up his mind; the problem\nwas too complicated.When Lester returned to his home, after the funeral, Jennie saw at\nonce that something was amiss with him, something beyond a son\'s\nnatural grief for his father\'s death was weighing upon his spirits.She tried to draw near to him\nsympathetically, but his wounded spirit could not be healed so easily.When hurt in his pride he was savage and sullen--he could have\nstruck any man who irritated him.She watched him interestedly,\nwishing to do something for him, but he would not give her his\nconfidence.He grieved, and she could only grieve with him.Days passed, and now the financial situation which had been created\nby his father\'s death came up for careful consideration.The factory\nmanagement had to be reorganized.Robert would have to be made\npresident, as his father wished.Lester\'s own relationship to the\nbusiness would have to come up for adjudication.Unless he changed his\nmind about Jennie, he was not a stockholder.As a matter of fact, he\nwas not anything.To continue to be secretary and treasurer, it was\nnecessary that he should own at least one share of the company\'s\nstock.Would the other members of the family care to do\nanything which would infringe on Robert\'s prerogatives under the will?They were all rather unfriendly to Lester at present, and he realized\nthat he was facing a ticklish situation.The solution was--to get\nrid of Jennie.If he did that he would not need to be begging for\nstock.If he didn\'t, he was flying in the face of his father\'s last\nwill and testament.He turned the matter over in his mind slowly and\ndeliberately.He could quite see how things were coming out.He must\nabandon either Jennie or his prospects in life.Despite Robert\'s assertion, that so far as he was concerned another\narrangement would have been satisfactory, he was really very well\npleased with the situation; his dreams were slowly nearing completion.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Robert had long had his plans perfected, not only for a thorough\nreorganization of the company proper, but for an extension of the\nbusiness in the direction of a combination of carriage companies.If\nhe could get two or three of the larger organizations in the East and\nWest to join with him, selling costs could be reduced, over-production\nwould be avoided, and the general expenses could be materially scaled\ndown.Through a New York representative, he had been picking up stock\nin outside carriage companies for some time and he was almost ready to\nact.In the first place he would have himself elected president of the\nKane Company, and since Lester was no longer a factor, he could select\nAmy\'s husband as vice-president, and possibly some one other than\nLester as secretary and treasurer.Under the conditions of the will,\nthe stock and other properties set aside temporarily for Lester, in\nthe hope that he would come to his senses, were to be managed and\nvoted by Robert.His father had meant, obviously, that he, Robert,\nshould help him coerce his brother.He did not want to appear mean,\nbut this was such an easy way.It gave him a righteous duty to\nperform.Lester must come to his senses or he must let Robert run the\nbusiness to suit himself.Lester, attending to his branch duties in Chicago, foresaw the\ndrift of things.He realized now that he was permanently out of the\ncompany, a branch manager at his brother\'s sufferance, and the thought\nirritated him greatly.Nothing had been said by Robert to indicate\nthat such a change had taken place--things went on very much as\nbefore--but Robert\'s suggestions were now obviously law.Lester\nwas really his brother\'s employee at so much a year.There came a time, after a few weeks, when he felt as if he could\nnot stand this any longer.Hitherto he had been a free and independent\nagent.The approaching annual stockholder\'s meeting which hitherto had\nbeen a one-man affair and a formality, his father doing all the\nvoting, would be now a combination of voters, his brother presiding,\nhis sisters very likely represented by their husbands, and he not\nthere at all.It was going to be a great come-down, but as Robert had\nnot said anything about offering to give or sell him any stock which\nwould entitle him to sit as a director or hold any official position\nin the company, he decided to write and resign.That would bring\nmatters to a crisis.It would show his brother that he felt no desire\nto be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which\nwas not his--and gladly so--by right of ability and the\ndesire of those with whom he was associated.If he wanted to move back\ninto the company by deserting Jennie he would come in a very different\ncapacity from that of branch manager.He dictated a simple,\nstraight-forward business letter, saying:\n\n"DEAR ROBERT, I know the time is drawing near when the company\nmust be reorganized under your direction.Not having any stock, I am\nnot entitled to sit as a director, or to hold the joint position of\nsecretary and treasurer.I want you to accept this letter as formal\nnotice of my resignation from both positions, and I want to have your\ndirectors consider what disposition should be made of this position\nand my services.I am not anxious to retain the branch-managership as\na branch-managership merely; at the same time I do not want to do\nanything which will embarrass you in your plans for the future.You\nsee by this that I am not ready to accept the proposition laid down in\nfather\'s will--at least, not at present.I would like a definite\nunderstanding of how you feel in this matter."Yours,\n\n"LESTER."Robert, sitting in his office at Cincinnati, considered this letter\ngravely.It was like his brother to come down to "brass tacks."If\nLester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct,\nwhat a man he would be!But there was no guile in the man--no\nsubtlety.He would never do a snaky thing--and Robert knew, in\nhis own soul, that to succeed greatly one must."You have to be\nruthless at times--you have to be subtle," Robert would say to\nhimself."Why not face the facts to yourself when you are playing for\nbig stakes?"He would, for one, and he did.Robert felt that although Lester was a tremendously decent fellow\nand his brother, he wasn\'t pliable enough to suit his needs.He was\ntoo outspoken, too inclined to take issue.If Lester yielded to his\nfather\'s wishes, and took possession of his share of the estate, he\nwould become, necessarily, an active partner in the affairs of the\ncompany.Lester would be a barrier in Robert\'s path.He much preferred that Lester should hold\nfast to Jennie, for the present at least, and so be quietly shelved by\nhis own act.After long consideration, Robert dictated a politic letter.He\nhadn\'t made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do.He did not know\nwhat his sisters\' husbands would like.For his part, he would be very glad to have Lester remain as\nsecretary and treasurer, if it could be arranged.Perhaps it would be\nbetter to let the matter rest for the present.What did Robert mean by beating around the bush?He\nknew well enough how it could be arranged.One share of stock would be\nenough for Lester to qualify.Robert was afraid of him--that was\nthe basic fact.Well, he would not retain any branch-managership,\ndepend on that.Lester accordingly wrote\nback, saying that he had considered all sides, and had decided to look\nafter some interests of his own, for the time being.If Robert could\narrange it, he would like to have some one come on to Chicago and take\nover the branch agency.In a few\ndays came a regretful reply, saying that Robert was awfully sorry, but\nthat if Lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any\nplans he might have in view.Imogene\'s husband, Jefferson Midgely, had\nlong thought he would like to reside in Chicago.He could undertake\nthe work for the time being.Evidently Robert was making the best of a very\nsubtle situation.Robert knew that he, Lester, could sue and tie\nthings up, and also that he would be very loath to do so.The\nnewspapers would get hold of the whole story.This matter of his\nrelationship to Jennie was in the air, anyhow.He could best solve the\nproblem by leaving her.CHAPTER XLIV\n\n\nFor a man of Lester\'s years--he was now forty-six--to be\ntossed out in the world without a definite connection, even though he\ndid have a present income (including this new ten thousand) of fifteen\nthousand a year, was a disturbing and discouraging thing.He realized\nnow that, unless he made some very fortunate and profitable\narrangements in the near future, his career was virtually at an end.That would give him the ten thousand\nfor the rest of his life, but it would also end his chance of getting\nhis legitimate share of the Kane estate.Again, he might sell out the\nseventy-five thousand dollars\' worth of moderate interest-bearing\nstocks, which now yielded him about five thousand, and try a practical\ninvestment of some kind--say a rival carriage company.But did he\nwant to jump in, at this stage of the game, and begin a running fight\non his father\'s old organization?Moreover, it would be a hard row to\nhoe.There was the keenest rivalry for business as it was, with the\nKane Company very much in the lead.Lester\'s only available capital\nwas his seventy-five thousand dollars.Did he want to begin in a\npicayune, obscure way?It took money to get a foothold in the carriage\nbusiness as things were now.The trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine\nimagination and considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless,\nnarrow-minded insistence on his individual superiority which is a\nnecessary element in almost every great business success.To be a\nforceful figure in the business world means, as a rule, that you must\nbe an individual of one idea, and that idea the God-given one that\nlife has destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field\nyou have chosen.It means that one thing, a cake of soap, a new\ncan-opener, a safety razor, or speed-accelerator, must seize on your\nimagination with tremendous force, burn as a raging flame, and make\nitself the be-all and end-all of your existence.As a rule, a man\nneeds poverty to help him to this enthusiasm, and youth.The thing he\nhas discovered, and with which he is going to busy himself, must be\nthe door to a thousand opportunities and a thousand joys.Happiness\nmust be beyond or the fire will not burn as brightly as it\nmight--the urge will not be great enough to make a great\nsuccess.Lester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm.Life had already shown him the greater part of its so-called joys.He\nsaw through the illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled\npleasure.Money, of course, was essential, and he had already had\nmoney--enough to keep him comfortably.Certainly he could not\ncomfortably contemplate the thought of sitting by and watching other\npeople work for the rest of his days.In the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into\nthings.He was, as he said to himself, in no hurry; he was not going\nto make a mistake.He would first give the trade, the people who were\nidentified with v he manufacture and sale of carriages, time to\nrealize that he was out of the Kane Company, for the time being,\nanyhow, and open to other connections.So he announced that he was\nleaving the Kane Company and going to Europe, ostensibly for a rest.He had never been abroad, and Jennie, too, would enjoy it.Vesta could\nbe left at home with Gerhardt and a maid, and he and Jennie would\ntravel around a bit, seeing what Europe had to show.He wanted to\nvisit Venice and Baden-Baden, and the great watering-places that had\nbeen recommended to him.Cairo and Luxor and the Parthenon had always\nappealed to his imagination.After he had had his outing he could come\nback and seriously gather up the threads of his intentions.The spring after his father died, he put his plan into execution.He had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a pleasant\ndeliberation had studied out a tour.He made Jennie his confidante,\nand now, having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a\nsteamer from New York to Liverpool.After a few weeks in the British\nIsles they went to Egypt.From there they came back, through Greece\nand Italy, into Austria and Switzerland, and then later, through\nFrance and Paris, to Germany and Berlin.Lester was diverted by the\nnovelty of the experience and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that\nhe was wasting his time.Great business enterprises were not built by\ntravelers, and he was not looking for health.Jennie, on the other hand, was transported by what she saw, and\nenjoyed the new life to the full.Before Luxor and Karnak--places\nwhich Jennie had never dreamed existed--she learned of an older\ncivilization, powerful, complex, complete.Millions of people had\nlived and died here, believing in other gods, other forms of\ngovernment, other conditions of existence.For the first time in her\nlife Jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is.Now from\nthis point of view--of decayed Greece, of fallen Rome, of\nforgotten Egypt, she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties, our\nminor beliefs.Her father\'s Lutheranism--it did not seem so\nsignificant any more; and the social economy of Columbus,\nOhio--rather pointless, perhaps.Her mother had worried so of\nwhat people--her neighbors--thought, but here were dead\nworlds of people, some bad, some good.Lester explained that their\ndifferences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate,\nsometimes to religious beliefs, and sometimes to the rise of peculiar\npersonalities like Mohammed.Lester liked to point out how small\nconventions bulked in this, the larger world, and vaguely she began to\nsee.Admitting that she had been bad--locally it was important,\nperhaps, but in the sum of civilization, in the sum of big forces,\nwhat did it all amount to?They would be dead after a little while,\nshe and Lester and all these people.Did anything matter except\ngoodness--goodness of heart?CHAPTER XLV\n\n\nIt was while traveling abroad that Lester came across, first at the\nCarlton in London and later at Shepheards in Cairo, the one girl,\nbefore Jennie, whom it might have been said he truly\nadmired--Letty Pace.He had not seen her for a long time, and she\nhad been Mrs.Malcolm Gerald for nearly four years, and a charming\nwidow for nearly two years more.Malcolm Gerald had been a wealthy\nman, having amassed a fortune in banking and stock-brokering in\nCincinnati, and he had left Mrs.She was\nthe mother of one child, a little girl, who was safely in charge of a\nnurse and maid at all times, and she was invariably the picturesque\ncenter of a group of admirers recruited from every capital of the\ncivilized world.Letty Gerald was a talented woman, beautiful,\ngraceful, artistic, a writer of verse, an omnivorous reader, a student\nof art, and a sincere and ardent admirer of Lester Kane.In her day she had truly loved him, for she had been a wise\nobserver of men and affairs, and Lester had always appealed to her as\na real man.He was so sane, she thought, so calm.He was always\nintolerant of sham, and she liked him for it.He was inclined to wave\naside the petty little frivolities of common society conversation, and\nto talk of simple and homely things.Many and many a time, in years\npast, they had deserted a dance to sit out on a balcony somewhere, and\ntalk while Lester smoked.He had argued philosophy with her, discussed\nbooks, described political and social conditions in other\ncities--in a word, he had treated her like a sensible human\nbeing, and she had hoped and hoped and hoped that he would propose to\nher.More than once she had looked at his big, solid head with its\nshort growth of hardy brown hair, and wished that she could stroke it.It was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to Chicago; at\nthat time she knew nothing of Jennie, but she felt instinctively that\nher chance of winning him was gone.Then Malcolm Gerald, always an ardent admirer, proposed for\nsomething like the sixty-fifth time, and she took him.She did not\nlove him, but she was getting along, and she had to marry some one.He\nwas forty-four when he married her, and he lived only four\nyears--just long enough to realize that he had married a\ncharming, tolerant, broad-minded woman.Gerald was a rich widow, sympathetic, attractive, delightful in\nher knowledge of the world, and with nothing to do except to live and\nto spend her money.She was not inclined to do either indifferently.She had long since\nhad her ideal of a man established by Lester.These whipper-snappers\nof counts, earls, lords, barons, whom she met in one social world and\nanother (for her friendship and connections had broadened notably with\nthe years), did not interest her a particle.She was terribly weary of\nthe superficial veneer of the titled fortune-hunter whom she met\nabroad.John travelled to the bedroom.A good judge of character, a student of men and manners, a\nnatural reasoner along sociologic and psychologic lines, she saw\nthrough them and through the civilization which they represented."I\ncould have been happy in a cottage with a man I once knew out in\nCincinnati," she told one of her titled women friends who had been an\nAmerican before her marriage."He was the biggest, cleanest, sanest\nfellow.If he had proposed to me I would have married him if I had had\nto work for a living myself."He was comfortably rich, but that did not make\nany difference to me."It would have made a difference in the long run," said the\nother."You misjudge me," replied Mrs."I waited for him for a\nnumber of years, and I know."Lester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories\nof Letty Pace, or Mrs.He had been fond of her\nin a way, very fond.He had asked himself\nthat question time and again.She would have made him an ideal wife,\nhis father would have been pleased, everybody would have been\ndelighted.Instead he had drifted and drifted, and then he had met\nJennie; and somehow, after that, he did not want her any more.Now\nafter six years of separation he met her again.She was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an\naffair--she had heard that he had subsequently married the woman\nand was living on the South Side.She did not know of the loss of his\nfortune.She ran across him first in the Carlton one June evening.The\nwindows were open, and the flowers were blooming everywhere, odorous\nwith that sense of new life in the air which runs through the world\nwhen spring comes back.For the moment she was a little beside\nherself.Something choked in her throat; but she collected herself and\nextended a graceful arm and hand.It seems truly like a breath\nof spring to see you again.Kane, but\nI\'m delighted to see your husband.I\'m ashamed to say how many years\nit is, Lester, since I saw you last!I feel quite old when I think of\nit.Why, Lester, think; it\'s been all of six or seven years!And I\'ve\nbeen married and had a child, and poor Mr.Gerald has died, and oh,\ndear, I don\'t know what all hasn\'t happened to me.""You don\'t look it," commented Lester, smiling.He was pleased to\nsee her again, for they had been good friends.She liked him\nstill--that was evident, and he truly liked her.She was glad to see this old friend of Lester\'s.This woman, trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale,\nmother-of-pearl satin, her round, smooth arms bare to the shoulder,\nher corsage cut low and a dark red rose blowing at her waist, seemed\nto her the ideal of what a woman should be.She liked looking at\nlovely women quite as much as Lester; she enjoyed calling his\nattention to them, and teasing him, in the mildest way, about their\ncharms."Wouldn\'t you like to run and talk to her, Lester, instead of\nto me?"she would ask when some particularly striking or beautiful\nwoman chanced to attract her attention.Lester would examine her\nchoice critically, for he had come to know that her judge of feminine\ncharms was excellent."Oh, I\'m pretty well off where I am," he would\nretort, looking into her eyes; or, jestingly, "I\'m not as young as I\nused to be, or I\'d get in tow of that.""What would you do if I really should?""Why, Lester, I wouldn\'t do anything.You\'d come back to me,\nmaybe."But if you felt that you wanted to, I wouldn\'t\ntry to stop you.I wouldn\'t expect to be all in all to one man, unless\nhe wanted me to be.""Where do you get those ideas, Jennie?"he asked her once, curious\nto test the breadth of her philosophy."Oh, I don\'t know, why?""They\'re so broad, so good-natured, so charitable.They\'re not\ncommon, that\'s sure.""Why, I don\'t think we ought to be selfish, Lester.Some women think differently, I know, but a man and a woman ought\nto want to live together, or they ought not to--don\'t you think?It doesn\'t make so much difference if a man goes off for a little\nwhile--just so long as he doesn\'t stay--if he wants to come\nback at all."Lester smiled, but he respected her for the sweetness of her point\nof view--he had to.To-night, when she saw this woman so eager to talk to Lester, she\nrealized at once that they must have a great deal in common to talk\nover; whereupon she did a characteristic thing."Won\'t you excuse me\nfor a little while?""I left some things uncared\nfor in our rooms.She went away, remaining in her room as long as she reasonably\ncould, and Lester and Letty fell to discussing old times in earnest.He recounted as much of his experiences as he deemed wise, and Letty\nbrought the history of her life up to date."Now that you\'re safely\nmarried, Lester," she said daringly, "I\'ll confess to you that you\nwere the one man I always wanted to have propose to me--and you\nnever did.""Maybe I never dared," he said, gazing into her superb black eyes,\nand thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not married.He\nfelt that she had grown more beautiful in every way.She seemed to him\nnow to be an ideal society figure-perfection itself--gracious,\nnatural, witty, the type of woman who mixes and mingles well, meeting\neach new-comer upon the plane best suited to him or her."Anyhow, I allow you some credit."Jennie has her good points," he replied simply.Yes, I suppose I\'m happy--as happy as any one\ncan be who sees life as it is.You know I\'m not troubled with many\nillusions.""Not any, I think, kind sir, if I know you.""Very likely, not any, Letty; but sometimes I wish I had a few.Really, I look on my life as a kind of\nfailure, you know, in spite of the fact that I\'m almost as rich as\nCroesus--not quite.I think he had some more than I have.""What talk from you--you, with your beauty and talent, and\nmoney--good heavens!"Travel, talk, shoo away silly\nfortune-hunters.Oh, dear, sometimes I get so tired!"In spite of Jennie, the old feeling came\nback.They were as\ncomfortable together as old married people, or young lovers.She looked at him, and her eyes fairly spoke."We\'ll have to brace up and talk of\nother things."Yes, I know," she replied, and turned on Jennie a radiant\nsmile.Jennie felt a faint sense of misgiving.She thought vaguely that\nthis might be one of Lester\'s old flames.This was the kind of woman\nhe should have chosen--not her.She was suited to his station in\nlife, and he would have been as happy--perhaps happier.Then she put away the uncomfortable thought;\npretty soon she would be getting jealous, and that would be\ncontemptible.Gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward\nthe Kanes.She invited them the next day to join her on a drive\nthrough Rotten Row.There was a dinner later at Claridge\'s, and then\nshe was compelled to keep some engagement which was taking her to\nParis.She bade them both an affectionate farewell, and hoped that\nthey would soon meet again.She was envious, in a sad way, of Jennie\'s\ngood fortune.Lester had lost none of his charm for her.If anything,\nhe seemed nicer, more considerate, more wholesome.She wished\nsincerely that he were free.And Lester--subconsciously\nperhaps--was thinking the same thing.No doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it, he had\nbeen led over mentally all of the things which might have happened if\nhe had married her.They were so congenial now, philosophically,\nartistically, practically.There was a natural flow of conversation\nbetween them all the time, like two old comrades among men.She knew\neverybody in his social sphere, which was equally hers, but Jennie did\nnot.They could talk of certain subtle characteristics of life in a\nway which was not possible between him and Jennie, for the latter did\nnot have the vocabulary.Her ideas did not flow as fast as those of\nMrs.Jennie had actually the deeper, more comprehensive,\nsympathetic, and emotional note in her nature, but she could not show\nit in light conversation.Actually she was living the thing she was,\nand that was perhaps the thing which drew Lester to her.Just now, and\noften in situations of this kind, she seemed at a disadvantage, and\nshe was.It seemed to Lester for the time being as if Mrs.Gerald\nwould perhaps have been a better choice after all--certainly as\ngood, and he would not now have this distressing thought as to his\nfuture.In the\ngardens about the hotel they suddenly encountered her, or rather\nLester did, for he was alone at the time, strolling and smoking."Well, this is good luck," he exclaimed.I didn\'t know I was coming until last\nThursday.You know I\nwondered where you might be.Then I remembered that you said you were\ngoing to Egypt."In her bath, I fancy, at this moment.This warm weather makes\nJennie take to water.Letty was in light blue silk, with\na blue and white parasol held daintily over her shoulder, and looked\nvery pretty.she suddenly ejaculated, "I wonder sometimes\nwhat I am to do with myself.I think\nI\'ll go back to the States to live."I haven\'t\nany one to marry now--that I want."She glanced at Lester\nsignificantly, then looked away."Oh, you\'ll find some one eventually," he said, somewhat awkwardly."You can\'t escape for long--not with your looks and money."she inquired lightly, thinking of a ball\nwhich was to be given at the hotel that evening.He had danced so well\na few years before."Now, Lester, you don\'t mean to say that you have gone and\nabandoned that last charming art.Come to\nthink of it, I suppose that is my fault.I haven\'t thought of dancing\nin some time."It occurred to him that he hadn\'t been going to functions of any\nkind much for some time.The opposition his entanglement had generated\nhad put a stop to that."Come and dance with me to-night."I\'ll have to think about that," replied Lester.Dancing will probably go hard with me at my time of\nlife.""Oh, hush, Lester," replied Mrs.Mercy alive, you\'d think you were an old\nman!""Pshaw, that simply makes us more attractive," replied his old\nflame.CHAPTER XLVI\n\n\nThat night after dinner the music was already sounding in the\nball-room of the great hotel adjacent to the palm-gardens when Mrs.Gerald found Lester smoking on one of the verandas with Jennie by his\nside.The latter was in white satin and white slippers, her hair lying\na heavy, enticing mass about her forehead and ears.Lester was\nbrooding over the history of Egypt, its successive tides or waves of\nrather weak-bodied people; the thin, narrow strip of soil along either\nside of the Nile that had given these successive waves of population\nsustenance; the wonder of heat and tropic life, and this hotel with\nits modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among ancient,\nsoul-weary, almost despairing conditions.He and Jennie had looked\nthis morning on the pyramids.They had taken a trolley to the Sphinx!They had watched swarms of ragged, half-clad, curiously costumed men\nand boys moving through narrow, smelly, albeit brightly colored, lanes\nand alleys."It all seems such a mess to me," Jennie had said at one place.I like it, but somehow they seem tangled\nup, like a lot of worms."Lester chuckled, "You\'re almost right.Life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions.To-night he was brooding over this, the moon shining down into the\ngrounds with an exuberant, sensuous luster."Well, at last I\'ve found you!""I couldn\'t\nget down to dinner, after all.I\'ve made your husband agree to dance with me, Mrs.Kane," she went on\nsmilingly.She, like Lester and Jennie, was under the sensuous\ninfluence of the warmth, the spring, the moonlight.There were rich\nodors abroad, floating subtly from groves and gardens; from the remote\ndistance camel-bells were sounding and exotic cries, "Ayah!"as though a drove of strange animals were\nbeing rounded up and driven through the crowded streets."You\'re welcome to him," replied Jennie pleasantly."You ought to take lessons right away then," replied Lester\ngenially."I\'ll do my best to keep you company.I\'m not as light on my\nfeet as I was once, but I guess I can get around.""Oh, I don\'t want to dance that badly," smiled Jennie."But you two\ngo on, I\'m going up-stairs in a little while, anyway.""Why don\'t you come sit in the ball-room?I can\'t do more than a\nfew rounds.Then we can watch the others," said Lester rising.Gerald in dark wine-colored silk, covered with\nglistening black beads, her shapely arms and neck bare, and a flashing\ndiamond of great size set just above her forehead in her dark hair.Her lips were red, and she had an engaging smile, showing an even row\nof white teeth between wide, full, friendly lips.Lester\'s strong,\nvigorous figure was well set off by his evening clothes, he looked\ndistinguished."That is the woman he should have married," said Jennie to herself\nas he disappeared.She fell into a reverie, going over the steps of\nher past life.Sometimes it seemed to her now as if she had been\nliving in a dream.At other times she felt as though she were in that\ndream yet.Life sounded in her ears much as this night did._Passing mendicant_\n   Out of the joy of your marriage feast,\n     Oh, brothers, be good to me.The way is long and the Shrine is far,\n     Where my weary feet would be.And feasting is always somewhat sad\n     To those outside the door--\n   Still; Love is only a dream, and Life\n     Itself is hardly more!To the Unattainable:\n\n   Lament of Mahomed Akram\n\n   I would have taken Golden Stars from the sky for your necklace,\n   I would have shaken rose-leaves for your rest from all the rose-trees.But you had no need; the short sweet grass sufficed for your slumber,\n   And you took no heed of such trifles as gold or a necklace.There is an hour, at twilight, too heavy with memory.There is a flower that I fear, for your hair had its fragrance.I would have squandered Youth for you, and its hope and its promise,\n   Before you wandered, careless, away from my useless passion.But what is the use of my speech, since I know of no words to recall you?I am praying that Time may teach, you, your Cruelty, me, Forgetfulness.Mahomed Akram\'s Appeal to the Stars\n\n   Oh, Silver Stars that shine on what I love,\n     Touch the soft hair and sparkle in the eyes,--\n   Send, from your calm serenity above,\n     Sleep to whom, sleepless, here, despairing lies.Broken, forlorn, upon the Desert sand\n     That sucks these tears, and utterly abased,\n   Looking across the lonely, level land,\n     With thoughts more desolate than any waste.Planets that shine on what I so adore,\n     Now thrown, the hour is late, in careless rest,\n   Protect that sleep, which I may watch no more,\n     I, the cast out, dismissed and dispossessed.Far in the hillside camp, in slumber lies\n     What my worn eyes worship but never see.your myriad silver eyes\n     Feast on the quiet face denied to me.Loved with a love beyond all words or sense,\n     Lost with a grief beyond the saltest tear,\n   So lovely, so removed, remote, and hence\n     So doubly and so desperately dear!from your skies so purple and so calm,\n     That through the centuries your secrets keep,\n   Send to this worn-out brain some Occult Balm,\n     Send me, for many nights so sleepless, sleep.And ere the sunshine of the Desert jars\n     My sense with sorrow and another day,\n   Through your soft Magic, oh, my Silver Stars!Reminiscence of Mahomed Akram\n\n   I shall never forget you, never.Never escape\n   Your memory woven about the beautiful things of life.The sudden Thought of your Face is like a Wound\n             When it comes unsought\n   On some scent of Jasmin, Lilies, or pale Tuberose.Any one of the sweet white fragrant flowers,\n   Flowers I used to love and lay in your hair.I saw you stand\n   Tall against the red and the gold like a slender palm;\n   The light wind stirred your hair as you waved your hand,\n   Waved farewell, as ever, serene and calm,\n   To me, the passion-wearied and tost and torn,\n   Riding down the road in the gathering grey.Since that day\n   The sunset red is empty, the gold forlorn.Often across the Banqueting board at nights\n   Men linger about your name in careless praise\n   The name that cuts deep into my soul like a knife;\n   And the gay guest-faces and flowers and leaves and lights\n   Fade away from the failing sense in a haze,\n             And the music sways\n   Far away in unmeasured distance....\n             I cannot forget--\n   I cannot escape.Stars that meant so much, too much, in my youth;\n   Stars that sparkled about your eyes,\n   Made a radiance round your hair,\n             What are they now?Lingering lights of a Finished Feast,\n   Little lingering sparks rather,\n             Of a Light that is long gone out.Story by Lalla-ji, the Priest\n\n   He loved the Plant with a keen delight,\n     A passionate fervour, strange to see,\n   Tended it ardently, day and night,\n     Yet never a flower lit up the tree.The leaves were succulent, thick, and green,\n     And, sessile, out of the snakelike stem\n   Rose spine-like fingers, alert and keen,\n     To catch at aught that molested them.But though they nurtured it day and night,\n     With love and labour, the child and he\n   Were never granted the longed-for sight\n     Of a flower crowning the twisted tree.Until one evening a wayworn Priest\n     Stopped for the night in the Temple shade\n   And shared the fare of their simple feast\n     Under the vines and the jasmin laid.He, later, wandering round the flowers\n     Paused awhile by the blossomless tree.The man said, "May it be fault of ours,\n     That never its buds my eyes may see?"Aslip it came from the further East\n     Many a sunlit summer ago.""It grows in our Jungles," said the Priest,\n     "Men see it rarely; but this I know,\n\n   "The Jungle people worship it; say\n     They bury a child around its roots--\n   Bury it living:--the only way\n     To crimson glory of flowers and fruits."He spoke in whispers; his furtive glance\n     Probing the depths of the garden shade.The man came closer, with eyes askance,\n     The child beside them shivered, afraid.A cold wind drifted about the three,\n     Jarring the spines with a hungry sound,\n   The spines that grew on the snakelike tree\n     And guarded its roots beneath the ground......\n\n   After the fall of the summer rain\n     The plant was glorious, redly gay,\n   Blood-red with blossom.Never again\n     Men saw the child in the Temple play.Request\n\n   Give me your self one hour; I do not crave\n     For any love, or even thought, of me.Come, as a Sultan may caress a slave\n     And then forget for ever, utterly.as west winds, that passing, cool and wet,\n     O\'er desert places, leave them fields in flower\n   And all my life, for I shall not forget,\n     Will keep the fragrance of that perfect hour!Story of Udaipore:\n\n   Told by Lalla-ji, the Priest\n\n         "And when the Summer Heat is great,\n           And every hour intense,\n         The Moghra, with its subtle flowers,\n           Intoxicates the sense."The Coco palms stood tall and slim, against the golden-glow,\n   And all their grey and graceful plumes were waving to and fro.She lay forgetful in the boat, and watched the dying Sun\n   Sink slowly lakewards, while the stars replaced him, one by one.She saw the marble Temple walls long white reflections make,\n   The echoes of their silvery bells were blown across the lake.The evening air was very sweet; from off the island bowers\n   Came scents of Moghra trees in bloom, and Oleander flowers."The Moghra flowers that smell so sweet\n           When love\'s young fancies play;\n         The acrid Moghra flowers, still sweet\n           Though love be burnt away."The boat went drifting, uncontrolled, the rower rowed no more,\n   But deftly turned the slender prow towards the further shore.The dying sunset touched with gold the Jasmin in his hair;\n   His eyes were darkly luminous: she looked and found him fair.And so persuasively he spoke, she could not say him nay,\n   And when his young hands took her own, she smiled and let them stay.And all the youth awake in him, all love of Love in her,\n   All scents of white and subtle flowers that filled the twilight air\n\n   Combined together with the night in kind conspiracy\n   To do Love service, while the boat went drifting onwards, free."The Moghra flowers, the Moghra flowers,\n           While Youth\'s quick pulses play\n         They are so sweet, they still are sweet,\n           Though passion burns away."Low in the boat the lovers lay, and from his sable curls\n   The Jasmin flowers slipped away to rest among the girl\'s.Oh, silver lake and silver night and tender silver sky!Where as the hours passed, the moon rose white and cold on high."The Moghra flowers, the Moghra flowers,\n           So dear to Youth at play;\n         The small and subtle Moghra flowers\n           That only last a day."Suddenly, frightened, she awoke, and waking vaguely saw\n   The boat had stranded in the sedge that fringed the further shore.The breeze grown chilly, swayed the palms; she heard, still half awake,\n   A prowling jackal\'s hungry cry blown faintly o\'er the lake.She shivered, but she turned to kiss his soft, remembered face,\n   Lit by the pallid light he lay, in Youth\'s abandoned grace.But as her lips met his she paused, in terror and dismay,\n   The white moon showed her by her side asleep a Leper lay."Ah, Moghra flowers, white Moghra flowers,\n           All love is blind, they say;\n         The Moghra flowers, so sweet, so sweet,\n           Though love be burnt away!"Valgovind\'s Song in the Spring\n\n   The Temple bells are ringing,\n   The young green corn is springing,\n         And the marriage month is drawing very near.I lie hidden in the grass,\n   And I count the moments pass,\n         For the month of marriages is drawing near.Soon, ah, soon, the women spread\n   The appointed bridal bed\n         With hibiscus buds and crimson marriage flowers,\n\n   Where, when all the songs are done,\n   And the dear dark night begun,\n         I shall hold her in my happy arms for hours.She is young and very sweet,\n   From the silver on her feet\n         To the silver and the flowers in her hair,\n   And her beauty makes me swoon,\n   As the Moghra trees at noon\n         Intoxicate the hot and quivering air.Ah, I would the hours were fleet\n   As her silver circled feet,\n         I am weary of the daytime and the night;\n   I am weary unto death,\n   Oh my rose with jasmin breath,\n         With this longing for your beauty and your light.Youth\n\n   I am not sure if I knew the truth\n     What his case or crime might be,\n   I only know that he pleaded Youth,\n     A beautiful, golden plea!Youth, with its sunlit, passionate eyes,\n     Its roseate velvet skin--\n   A plea to cancel a thousand lies,\n     Or a thousand nights of sin.The men who judged him were old and grey\n     Their eyes and their senses dim,\n   He brought the light of a warm Spring day\n     To the Court-house bare and grim.Could he plead guilty in a lovelier way?When Love is Over\n\n   Song of Khan Zada\n\n   Only in August my heart was aflame,\n     Catching the scent of your Wind-stirred hair,\n   Now, though you spread it to soften my sleep\n     Through the night, I should hardly care.Only last August I drank that water\n     Because it had chanced to cool your hands;\n   When love is over, how little of love\n     Even the lover understands!"Golden Eyes"\n\n   Oh Amber Eyes, oh Golden Eyes!Wherein swift fancies fall and rise,\n     Grow dark and fade away.Eyes like a little limpid pool\n     That holds a sunset sky,\n   While on its surface, calm and cool,\n     Blue water lilies lie.Oh Tender Eyes, oh Wistful Eyes,\n     You smiled on me one day,\n   And all my life, in glad surprise,\n     Leapt up and pleaded "Stay!"Alas, oh cruel, starlike eyes,\n     So grave and yet so gay,\n   You went to lighten other skies,\n     Smiled once and passed away.Oh, you whom I name "Golden Eyes,"\n     Perhaps I used to know\n   Your beauty under other skies\n     In lives lived long ago.Perhaps I rowed with galley slaves,\n     Whose labour never ceased,\n   To bring across Phoenician waves\n     Your treasure from the East.Maybe you were an Emperor then\n     And I a favourite slave;\n   Some youth, whom from the lions\' den\n     You vainly tried to save!Maybe I reigned, a mighty King,\n     The early nations knew,\n   And you were some slight captive thing,\n     Some maiden whom I slew.Perhaps, adrift on desert shores\n     Beside some shipwrecked prow,\n   I gladly gave my life for yours.Or on some sacrificial stone\n     Strange Gods we satisfied,\n   Perhaps you stooped and left a throne\n     To kiss me ere I died.Perhaps, still further back than this,\n     In times ere men were men,\n   You granted me a moment\'s bliss\n     In some dark desert den,\n   When, with your amber eyes alight\n     With iridescent flame,\n   And fierce desire for love\'s delight,\n     Towards my lair you came\n\n   Ah laughing, ever-brilliant eyes,\n     These things men may not know,\n   But something in your radiance lies,\n     That, centuries ago,\n   Lit up my life in one wild blaze\n     Of infinite desire\n   To revel in your golden rays,\n     Or in your light expire.If this, oh Strange Ringed Eyes, be true,\n     That through all changing lives\n   This longing love I have for you\n     Eternally survives,\n   May I not sometimes dare to dream\n     In some far time to be\n   Your softly golden eyes may gleam\n     Responsively on me?Ah gentle, subtly changing eyes,\n     You smiled on me one day,\n   And all my life in glad surprise\n     Leaped up, imploring "Stay!"Alas, alas, oh Golden Eyes,\n     So cruel and so gay,\n   You went to shine in other skies,\n     Smiled once and passed away.Kotri, by the River\n\n   At Kotri, by the river, when the evening\'s sun is low,\n   The waving palm trees quiver, the golden waters glow,\n   The shining ripples shiver, descending to the sea;\n   At Kotri, by the river, she used to wait for me.So young, she was, and slender, so pale with wistful eyes\n   As luminous and tender as Kotri\'s twilight skies.Her face broke into flowers, red flowers at the mouth,\n   Her voice,--she sang for hours like bulbuls in the south.We sat beside the water through burning summer days,\n   And many things I taught her of Life and all its ways\n   Of Love, man\'s loveliest duty, of Passion\'s reckless pain,\n   Of Youth, whose transient beauty comes once, but not again.She lay and laughed and listened beside the water\'s edge.The glancing river glistened and glinted through the sedge.Green parrots flew above her and, as the daylight died,\n   Her young arms drew her lover more closely to her side.When Love would not be holden, and Pleasure had his will.Days, when in after leisure, content to rest we lay,\n   Nights, when her lips\' soft pressure drained all my life away.And while we sat together, beneath the Babul trees,\n   The fragrant, sultry weather cooled by the river breeze,\n   If passion faltered ever, and left the senses free,\n   We heard the tireless river decending to the sea.I know not where she wandered, or went in after days,\n   Or if her youth she squandered in Love\'s more doubtful ways.Perhaps, beside the river, she died, still young and fair;\n   Perchance the grasses quiver above her slumber there.At Kotri, by the river, maybe I too shall sleep\n   The sleep that lasts for ever, too deep for dreams; too deep.Maybe among the shingle and sand of floods to be\n   Her dust and mine may mingle and float away to sea.Ah Kotri, by the river, when evening\'s sun is low,\n   Your faint reflections quiver, your golden ripples glow.You knew, oh Kotri river, that love which could not last.For me your palms still shiver with passions of the past.Farewell\n\n   Farewell, Aziz, it was not mine to fold you\n     Against my heart for any length of days.I had no loveliness, alas, to hold you,\n     No siren voice, no charm that lovers praise.Yet, in the midst of grief and desolation,\n     Solace I my despairing soul with this:\n   Once, for my life\'s eternal consolation,\n     You lent my lips your loveliness to kiss.I think Love\'s very essence\n     Distilled itself from out my joy and pain,\n   Like tropical trees, whose fervid inflorescence\n     Glows, gleams, and dies, never to bloom again.Often I marvel how I met the morning\n     With living eyes after that night with you,\n   Ah, how I cursed the wan, white light for dawning,\n     And mourned the paling stars, as each withdrew!Yet I, even I, who am less than dust before you,\n     Less than the lowest lintel of your door,\n   Was given one breathless midnight, to adore you.Fate, having granted this, can give no more!Afridi Love\n\n   Since, Oh, Beloved, you are not even faithful\n     To me, who loved you so, for one short night,\n   For one brief space of darkness, though my absence\n     Did but endure until the dawning light;\n\n   Since all your beauty--which was _mine_--you squandered\n     On _that_ which now lies dead across your door;\n   See here this knife, made keen and bright to kill you.You shall not see the sun rise any more.In all the empty village\n     Who is there left to hear or heed your cry?All are gone to labour in the valley,\n     Who will return before your time to die?No use to struggle; when I found you sleeping,\n     I took your hands and bound them to your side,\n   And both these slender feet, too apt at straying,\n     Down to the cot on which you lie are tied.Lie still, Beloved; that dead thing lying yonder,\n     I hated and I killed, but love is sweet,\n   And you are more than sweet to me, who love you,\n     Who decked my eyes with dust from off your feet.Give me your lips; Ah, lovely and disloyal\n     Give me yourself again; before you go\n   Down through the darkness of the Great, Blind Portal,\n     All of life\'s best and basest you must know.Erstwhile Beloved, you were so young and fragile\n     I held you gently, as one holds a flower:\n   But now, God knows, what use to still be tender\n     To one whose life is done within an hour?Death will not hurt you, dearest,\n     As you hurt me, for just a single night,\n   You call me cruel, who laid my life in ruins\n     To gain one little moment of delight.Look up, look out, across the open doorway\n     The sunlight streams.Look at the pale, pink peach trees in our garden,\n     Sweet fruit will come of them;--but not for you.The fair, far snow, upon those jagged mountains\n     That gnaw against the hard blue Afghan sky\n   Will soon descend, set free by summer sunshine.You will not see those torrents sweeping by.From this day forward,\n     You must lie still alone; who would not lie\n   Alone for one night only, though returning\n     I was, when earliest dawn should break the sky.There lies my lute, and many strings are broken,\n     Some one was playing it, and some one tore\n   The silken tassels round my Hookah woven;\n     Some one who plays, and smokes, and loves, no more!Some one who took last night his fill of pleasure,\n     As I took mine at dawn!The knife went home\n   Straight through his heart!God only knows my rapture\n     Bathing my chill hands in the warm red foam.This is only loving,\n     Wait till I kill you!Surely the fault was mine, to love and leave you\n     Even a single night, you are so fair.Cold steel is very cooling to the fervour\n     Of over passionate ones, Beloved, like you.Not quite unlovely\n     They are as yet, as yet, though quite untrue.What will your brother say, to-night returning\n     With laden camels homewards to the hills,\n   Finding you dead, and me asleep beside you,\n     Will he awake me first before he kills?Here on the cot beside you\n     When you, my Heart\'s Delight, are cold in death.When your young heart and restless lips are silent,\n     Grown chilly, even beneath my burning breath.When I have slowly drawn my knife across you,\n     Taking my pleasure as I see you swoon,\n   I shall sleep sound, worn out by love\'s last fervour,\n     And then, God grant your kinsmen kill me soon!Yasmini\n\n   At night, when Passion\'s ebbing tide\n     Left bare the Sands of Truth,\n   Yasmini, resting by my side,\n     Spoke softly of her youth."And one" she said "was tall and slim,\n     Two crimson rose leaves made his mouth,\n   And I was fain to follow him\n     Down to his village in the South."He was to build a hut hard by\n     The stream where palms were growing,\n   We were to live, and love, and lie,\n     And watch the water flowing."Ah, dear, delusive, distant shore,\n     By dreams of futile fancy gilt!The riverside we never saw,\n     The palm leaf hut was never built!"One had a Tope of Mangoe trees,\n     Where early morning, noon and late,\n   The Persian wheels, with patient ease,\n     Brought up their liquid, silver freight."And he was fain to rise and reach\n     That garden sloping to the sea,\n   Whose groves along the wave-swept beach\n     Should shelter him and love and me."Doubtless, upon that western shore\n     With ripe fruit falling to the ground,\n   There dwells the Peace he hungered for,\n     The lovely Peace we never found."Then there came one with eager eyes\n     And keen sword, ready for the fray.He missed the storms of Northern skies,\n     The reckless raid and skirmish gay!"He rose from dreams of war\'s alarms,\n     To make his daggers keen and bright,\n   Desiring, in my very arms,\n     The fiercer rapture of the fight!"He left me soon; too soon, and sought\n     The stronger, earlier love again.News reached me from the Cabul Court,\n     Afterwards nothing; doubtless slain."Doubtless his brilliant, haggard eyes,\n     Long since took leave of life and light,\n   And those lithe limbs I used to prize\n     Feasted the jackal and the kite.his sixteen years\n     Shone in his cheeks\' transparent red.My kisses were his first: my tears\n     Fell on his face when he was dead."He died, he died, I speak the truth,\n     Though light love leave his memory dim,\n   He was the Lover of my Youth\n     And all my youth went down with him."For passion ebbs and passion flows,\n     But under every new caress\n   The riven heart more keenly knows\n     Its own inviolate faithfulness."Our Gods are kind and still deem fit\n     As in old days, with those to lie,\n   Whose silent hearths are yet unlit\n     By the soft light of infancy."Therefore, one strange, mysterious night\n     Alone within the Temple shade,\n   Recipient of a God\'s delight\n     I lay enraptured, unafraid."Also to me the boon was given,\n     But mourning quickly followed mirth,\n   My son, whose father stooped from Heaven,\n     Died in the moment of his birth."When from the war beyond the seas\n     The reckless Lancers home returned,\n   Their spoils were laid across my knees\n     About my lips their kisses burned."Back from the Comradeship of Death,\n     Free from the Friendship of the Sword,\n   With brilliant eyes and famished breath\n     They came to me for their reward."Why do I tell you all these things,\n     Baring my life to you, unsought?When Passion folds his wearied wings\n     Sleep should be follower, never Thought.The window pane\n     Grows pale against the purple sky.The dawn is with us once again,\n     The dawn; which always means good-bye."Within her little trellised room, beside the palm-fringed sea,\n   She wakeful in the scented gloom, spoke of her youth to me.Ojira, to Her Lover\n\n   I am waiting in the desert, looking out towards the sunset,\n   And counting every moment till we meet.I am waiting by the marshes and I tremble and I listen\n   Till the soft sands thrill beneath your coming feet.Till I see you, tall and slender, standing clear against the skyline\n   A graceful shade across the lingering red,\n   While your hair the breezes ruffle, turns to silver in the twilight,\n   And makes a fair faint aureole round your head.Far away towards the sunset I can see a narrow river,\n   That unwinds itself in red tranquillity;\n   I can hear its rippled meeting, and the gurgle of its greeting,\n   As it mingles with the loved and long sought sea.In the purple sky above me showing dark against the starlight,\n   Long wavering flights of homeward birds fly low,\n   They cry each one to the other, and their weird and wistful calling,\n   Makes most melancholy music as they go.Oh, my dearest hasten, hasten!Already\n   Have I heard the jackals\' first assembling cry,\n   And among the purple shadows of the mangroves and the marshes\n   Fitful echoes of their footfalls passing by.my arms are empty, and so weary for your beauty,\n   I am thirsty for the music of your voice.Come to make the marshes joyous with the sweetness of your presence,\n   Let your nearing feet bid all the sands rejoice!My hands, my lips are feverish with the longing and the waiting\n   And no softness of the twilight soothes their heat,\n   Till I see your radiant eyes, shining stars beneath the starlight,\n   Till I kiss the slender coolness of your feet.Ah, loveliest, most reluctant, when you lay yourself beside me\n   All the planets reel around me--fade away,\n   And the sands grow dim, uncertain,--I stretch out my hands towards you\n   While I try to speak but know not what I say!I am faint with love and longing, and my burning eyes are gazing\n   Where the furtive Jackals wage their famished strife,\n   Oh, your shadow on the mangroves!and your step upon the sandhills,--\n   This is the loveliest evening of my Life!Thoughts: Mahomed Akram\n\n   If some day this body of mine were burned\n   (It found no favour alas!with you)\n   And the ashes scattered abroad, unurned,\n   Would Love die also, would Thought die too?But who can answer, or who can trust,\n       No dreams would harry the windblown dust?Were I laid away in the furrows deep\n   Secure from jackal and passing plough,\n   Would your eyes not follow me still through sleep\n   Torment me then as they torture now?Would you ever have loved me, Golden Eyes,\n       Had I done aught better or otherwise?Was I overspeechful, or did you yearn\n   When I sat silent, for songs or speech?Ah, Beloved, I had been so apt to learn,\n   So apt, had you only cared to teach.But time for silence and song is done,\n       You wanted nothing, my Golden Sun!That drifts in its lonely orbit far\n   Away from your soft, effulgent light\n   In outer planes of Eternal night?Prayer\n\n   You are all that is lovely and light,\n     Aziza whom I adore,\n   And, waking, after the night,\n     I am weary with dreams of you.Every nerve in my heart is tense and sore\n     As I rise to another morning apart from you.I dream of your luminous eyes,\n     Aziza whom I adore!Of the ruffled silk of your hair,\n   I dream, and the dreams are lies.But I love them, knowing no more\n     Will ever be mine of you\n   Aziza, my life\'s despair.I would burn for a thousand days,\n   Aziza whom I adore,\n   Be tortured, slain, in unheard of ways\n     If you pitied the pain I bore.Your bright eyes, fastened on other things,\n   Are keener to sting my soul, than scorpion stings!You are all that is lovely to me,\n     All that is light,\n   One white rose in a Desert of weariness.I only live in the night,\n   The night, with its fair false dreams of you,\n     You and your loveliness.Give me your love for a day,\n             A night, an hour:\n           If the wages of sin are Death\n             I am willing to pay.What is my life but a breath\n       Of passion burning away?O Aziza whom I adore,\n     Aziza my one delight,\n       Only one night, I will die before day,\n     And trouble your life no more.The Aloe\n\n   My life was like an Aloe flower, beneath an orient sky,\n   Your sunshine touched it for an hour; it blossomed but to die.Torn up, cast out, on rubbish heaps where red flames work their will\n   Each atom of the Aloe keeps the flower-time fragrance still.Memory\n\n   How I loved you in your sleep,\n   With the starlight on your hair!The touch of your lips was sweet,\n     Aziza whom I adore,\n   I lay at your slender feet,\n     And against their soft palms pressed,\n   I fitted my face to rest.As winds blow over the sea\n     From Citron gardens ashore,\n   Came, through your scented hair,\n     The breeze of the night to me.My lips grew arid and dry,\n     My nerves were tense,\n   Though your beauty soothe the eye\n     It maddens the sense.Every curve of that beauty is known to me,\n   Every tint of that delicate roseleaf skin,\n     And these are printed on every atom of me,\n   Burnt in on every fibre until I die.And for this, my sin,\n   I doubt if ever, though dust I be,\n   The dust will lose the desire,\n   The torment and hidden fire,\n   Of my passionate love for you.Aziza whom I adore,\n   My dust will be full of your beauty, as is the blue\n   And infinite ocean full of the azure sky.In the light that waxed and waned\n   Playing about your slumber in silver bars,\n   As the palm trees swung their feathery fronds athwart the stars,\n   How quiet and young you were,\n   Pale as the Champa flowers, violet veined,\n   That, sweet and fading, lay in your loosened hair.How sweet you were in your sleep,\n   With the starlight on your hair!Your throat thrown backwards, bare,\n   And touched with circling moonbeams, silver white\n     On the couch\'s sombre shade.O Aziza my one delight,\n   When Youth\'s passionate pulses fade,\n   And his golden heart beats slow,\n   When across the infinite sky\n   I see the roseate glow\n   Of my last, last sunset flare,\n   I shall send my thoughts to this night\n   And remember you as I die,\n   The one thing, among all the things of this earth, found fair.How sweet you were in your sleep,\n   With the starlight, silver and sable, across your hair!The First Lover\n\n   As o\'er the vessel\'s side she leant,\n     She saw the swimmer in the sea\n   With eager eyes on her intent,\n     "Come down, come down and swim with me."So weary was she of her lot,\n     Tired of the ship\'s monotony,\n   She straightway all the world forgot\n     Save the young swimmer in the sea\n\n   So when the dusky, dying light\n     Left all the water dark and dim,\n   She softly, in the friendly night,\n     Slipped down the vessel\'s side to him.Intent and brilliant, brightly dark,\n     She saw his burning, eager eyes,\n   And many a phosphorescent spark\n     About his shoulders fall and rise.As through the hushed and Eastern night\n     They swam together, hand in hand,\n   Or lay and laughed in sheer delight\n     Full length upon the level sand."Ah, soft, delusive, purple night\n     Whose darkness knew no vexing moon!Ah, cruel, needless, dawning light\n     That trembled in the sky too soon!"Khan Zada\'s Song on the Hillside\n\n   The fires that burn on all the hills\n     Light up the landscape grey,\n   The arid desert land distills\n     The fervours of the day.The clear white moon sails through the skies\n     And silvers all the night,\n   I see the brilliance of your eyes\n     And need no other light.The death sighs of a thousand flowers\n     The fervent day has slain\n   Are wafted through the twilight hours,\n     And perfume all the plain.My senses strain, and try to clasp\n     Their sweetness in the air,\n   In vain, in vain; they only grasp\n     The fragrance of your hair.The plain is endless space expressed;\n     Vast is the sky above,\n   I only feel, against your breast,\n     Infinities of love.Deserted Gipsy\'s Song: Hillside Camp\n\n   She is glad to receive your turquoise ring,\n         Dear and dark-eyed Lover of mine!I, to have given you everything:\n         Beauty maddens the soul like Wine."She is proud to have held aloof her charms,\n         Slender, dark-eyed Lover of mine!But I, of the night you lay in my arms:\n         Beauty maddens the sense like Wine!"She triumphs to think that your heart is won,\n         Stately, dark-eyed Lover of mine!I had not a thought of myself, not one:\n         Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!"She will speak you softly, while skies are blue,\n         Dear, deluded Lover of mine!I would lose both body and soul for you:\n         Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!"While the ways are fair she will love you well,\n         Dear, disdainful Lover of mine!But I would have followed you down to Hell:\n         Beauty maddens the soul like Wine!"Though you lay at her feet the days to be,\n         Now no longer Lover of mine!You can give her naught that you gave not me:\n         Beauty maddened my soul like Wine!"When the years have shown what is false or true:\n         Beauty maddens the sight like Wine!You will understand how I cared for you,\n         First and only Lover of mine!"The Plains\n\n               How one loves them\n   These wide horizons; whether Desert or Sea,--\n          Vague and vast and infinite; faintly clear--\n   Surely, hid in the far away, unknown "There,"\n          Lie the things so longed for and found not, found not, Here.Only where some passionate, level land\n          Stretches itself in reaches of golden sand,\n   Only where the sea line is joined to the sky-line, clear,\n          Beyond the curve of ripple or white foamed crest,--\n                         Shall the weary eyes\n             Distressed by the broken skies,--\n             Broken by Minaret, mountain, or towering tree,--\n          Shall the weary eyes be assuaged,--be assuaged,--and rest."Lost Delight"\n\n   After the Hazara War\n\n   I lie alone beneath the Almond blossoms,\n        Where we two lay together in the spring,\n   And now, as then, the mountain snows are melting,\n        This year, as last, the water-courses sing.That was another spring, and other flowers,\n        Hung, pink and fragile, on the leafless tree,\n   The land rejoiced in other running water,\n        And I rejoiced, because you were with me.You, with your soft eyes, darkly lashed and shaded,\n        Your red lips like a living, laughing rose,\n   Your restless, amber limbs so lithe and slender\n        Now lost to me.You lay beside me singing in the sunshine;\n        The rough, white fur, unloosened at the neck,\n   Showed the smooth skin, fair as the Almond blossoms,\n        On which the sun could find no flaw or fleck.I lie alone, beneath the Almond flowers,\n        I hated them to touch you as they fell.worse, Ah, worse, who loves you?(My soul is burning as men burn in Hell.)How I have sought you in the crowded cities!I have been mad, they say, for many days.I know not how I came here, to the valley,\n        What fate has led me, through what doubtful ways.Somewhere I see my sword has done good service,\n        Some one I killed, who, smiling, used your name,\n   But in what country?Nay, I have forgotten,\n        All thought is shrivelled in my heart\'s hot flame.Where are you now, Delight, and where your beauty,\n        Your subtle curls, and laughing, changeful face?Bound, bruised and naked (dear God, grant me patience),\n        And sold in Cabul in the market-place.Among so many captured, sold, or slain,\n   What fate was yours?(Ah, dear God, grant me patience,\n        My heart is burnt, is burnt, with fire and pain.)my heart is almost breaking,\n        My sword is broken and my feet are sore,\n   The people look at me and say in passing,\n        "He will not leave the village any more."For as the evening falls, the fever rises,\n        With frantic thoughts careering through the brain,\n   Wild thoughts of you.(Ah, dear God, grant me patience,\n        My soul is hurt beyond all men call pain.)I lie alone, beneath the Almond blossoms,\n        And see the white snow melting on the hills\n   Till Khorassan is gay with water-courses,\n        Glad with the tinkling sound of running rills,\n\n   And well I know that when the fragile petals\n        Fall softly, ere the first green leaves appear,\n   (Ah, for these last few days, God, grant me patience,)\n        Since Delight is not, I shall not be, here!Unforgotten\n\n   Do you ever think of me?you who died\n       Ere our Youth\'s first fervour chilled,\n   With your soft eyes and your pulses stilled\n       Lying alone, aside,\n   Do you ever think of me, left in the light,\n   From the endless calm of your dawnless night?I am faithful always: I do not say\n       That the lips which thrilled to your lips of old\n   To lesser kisses are always cold;\n       Had you wished for this in its narrow sense\n       Our love perhaps had been less intense;\n   But as we held faithfulness, you and I,\n       I am faithful always, as you who lie,\n       Asleep for ever, beneath the grass,\n       While the days and nights and the seasons pass,--\n           Pass away.I keep your memory near my heart,\n       My brilliant, beautiful guiding Star,\n   Till long live over, I too depart\n       To the infinite night where perhaps you are.I would rather know you alive in Hell\n   Than think your beauty is nothing now,\n   With its deep dark eyes and tranquil brow\n   Where the hair fell softly.Can this be true\n   That nothing, nowhere, exists of you?Nothing, nowhere, oh, loved so well\n       I have _never_ forgotten.Do you still keep\n   Thoughts of me through your dreamless sleep?lost in Eternal Night,\n       Lost Star of light,\n   Risen splendidly, set so soon,\n       Through the weariness of life\'s afternoon\n             I dream of your memory yet.My loved and lost, whom I could not save,\n   My youth went down with you to the grave,\n   Though other planets and stars may rise,\n   I dream of your soft and sorrowful eyes\n           And I cannot forget.Song of Faiz Ulla\n\n   Just at the time when Jasmins bloom, most sweetly in the summer weather,\n   Lost in the scented Jungle gloom, one sultry night we spent together\n   We, Love and Night, together blent, a Trinity of tranced content.Yet, while your lips were wholly mine, to kiss, to drink from, to caress,\n   We heard some far-off faint distress; harsh drop of poison in sweet wine\n   Lessening the fulness of delight,--\n            Some quivering note of human pain,\n   Which rose and fell and rose again, in plaintive sobs throughout the night,\n\n   Spoiling the perfumed, moonless hours\n   We spent among the Jasmin flowers.Story of Lilavanti\n\n   They lay the slender body down\n     With all its wealth of wetted hair,\n   Only a daughter of the town,\n     But very young and slight and fair.The eyes, whose light one cannot see,\n     Are sombre doubtless, like the tresses,\n   The mouth\'s soft curvings seem to be\n     A roseate series of caresses.And where the skin has all but dried\n     (The air is sultry in the room)\n   Upon her breast and either side,\n     It shows a soft and amber bloom.By women here, who knew her life,\n     A leper husband, I am told,\n   Took all this loveliness to wife\n     When it was barely ten years old.And when the child in shocked dismay\n     Fled from the hated husband\'s care\n   He caught and tied her, so they say,\n     Down to his bedside by her hair.To some low quarter of the town,\n     Escaped a second time, she flew;\n   Her beauty brought her great renown\n     And many lovers here she knew,\n\n   When, as the mystic Eastern night\n     With purple shadow filled the air,\n   Behind her window framed in light,\n     She sat with jasmin in her hair.At last she loved a youth, who chose\n     To keep this wild flower for his own,\n   He in his garden set his rose\n     Where it might bloom for him alone.Cholera came; her lover died,\n     Want drove her to the streets again,\n   And women found her there, who tried\n     To turn her beauty into gain.But she who in those garden ways\n     Had learnt of Love, would now no more\n   Be bartered in the market place\n     For silver, as in days before.That former life she strove to change;\n     She sold the silver off her arms,\n   While all the world grew cold and strange\n     To broken health and fading charms.Till, finding lovers, but no friend,\n     Nor any place to rest or hide,\n   She grew despairing at the end,\n     Slipped softly down a well and died.And yet, how short, when all is said,\n     This little life of love and tears!Her age, they say, beside her bed,\n     To-day is only fifteen years.The Garden by the Bridge\n\n   The Desert sands are heated, parched and dreary,\n     The tigers rend alive their quivering prey\n   In the near Jungle; here the kites rise, weary,\n     Too gorged with living food to fly away.All night the hungry jackals howl together\n     Over the carrion in the river bed,\n   Or seize some small soft thing of fur or feather\n     Whose dying shrieks on the night air are shed.I hear from yonder Temple in the distance\n     Whose roof with obscene carven Gods is piled,\n   Reiterated with a sad insistence\n     Sobs of, perhaps, some immolated child.Strange rites here, where the archway\'s shade is deeper,\n     Are consummated in the river bed;\n   Parias steal the rotten railway sleeper\n     To burn the bodies of their cholera dead.But yet, their lust, their hunger, cannot shame them\n     Goaded by fierce desire, that flays and stings;\n   Poor beasts, and poorer men.Blame the Inherent Cruelty of Things.The world is horrible and I am lonely,\n     Let me rest here where yellow roses bloom\n   And find forgetfulness, remembering only\n     Your face beside me in the scented gloom.I am not here for passion,\n     I crave no love, only a little rest,\n   Although I would my face lay, lover\'s fashion,\n     Against the tender coolness of your breast.I am so weary of the Curse of Living\n     The endless, aimless torture, tumult, fears.Surely, if life were any God\'s free giving,\n     He, seeing His gift, long since went blind with tears.Seeing us; our fruitless strife, our futile praying,\n     Our luckless Present and our bloodstained Past.Poor players, who make a trick or two in playing,\n     But know that death _must_ win the game at last.As round the Fowler, red with feathered slaughter,\n     The little joyous lark, unconscious, sings,--\n   As the pink Lotus floats on azure water,\n     Innocent of the mud from whence it springs.You walk through life, unheeding all the sorrow,\n     The fear and pain set close around your way,\n   Meeting with hopeful eyes each gay to-morrow,\n     Living with joy each hour of glad to-day.I love to have you thus (nay, dear, lie quiet,\n     How should these reverent fingers wrong your hair?)So calmly careless of the rush and riot\n     That rages round is seething everywhere.You think your beauty\n     Does but inflame my senses to desire,\n   Till all you hold as loyalty and duty,\n     Is shrunk and shrivelled in the ardent fire.You wrong me, wearied out with thought and grieving\n     As though the whole world\'s sorrow eat my heart,\n   I come to gaze upon your face believing\n     Its beauty is as ointment to the smart.Lie still and let me in my desolation\n     Caress the soft loose hair a moment\'s span.Since Loveliness is Life\'s one Consolation,\n     And love the only Lethe left to man.Ah, give me here beneath the trees in flower,\n     Beside the river where the fireflies pass,\n   One little dusky, all consoling hour\n     Lost in the shadow of the long grown grass\n\n   Give me, oh you whose arms are soft and slender,\n     Whose eyes are nothing but one long caress,\n   Against your heart, so innocent and tender,\n     A little Love and some Forgetfulness.Fate Knows no Tears\n\n   Just as the dawn of Love was breaking\n          Across the weary world of grey,\n   Just as my life once more was waking\n          As roses waken late in May,\n   Fate, blindly cruel and havoc-making,\n          Stepped in and carried you away.Memories have I none in keeping\n          Of times I held you near my heart,\n   Of dreams when we were near to weeping\n          That dawn should bid us rise and part;\n   Never, alas, I saw you sleeping\n          With soft closed eyes and lips apart,\n\n   Breathing my name still through your dreaming.--\n          Ah!But Fate, unheeding human scheming,\n          Serenely reckless came between--\n   Fate with her cold eyes hard and gleaming\n          Unseared by all the sorrow seen.well-beloved, I never told you,\n          I did not show in speech or song,\n   How at the end I longed to fold you\n          Close in my arms; so fierce and strong\n   The longing grew to have and hold you,\n          You, and you only, all life long.They who know nothing call me fickle,\n          Keen to pursue and loth to keep.Ah, could they see these tears that trickle\n          From eyes erstwhile too proud to weep.Could see me, prone, beneath the sickle,\n          While pain and sorrow stand and reap!Unopened scarce, yet overblown, lie\n          The hopes that rose-like round me grew,\n   The lights are low, and more than lonely\n          This life I lead apart from you.I want you only,\n          And you who loved me never knew.You loved me, pleaded for compassion\n          On all the pain I would not share;\n   And I in weary, halting fashion\n          Was loth to listen, long to care;\n   But now, dear God!I faint with passion\n          For your far eyes and distant hair.Yes, I am faint with love, and broken\n          With sleepless nights and empty days;\n   I want your soft words fiercely spoken,\n          Your tender looks and wayward ways--\n   Want that strange smile that gave me token\n          Of many things that no man says.Cold was I, weary, slow to waken\n          Till, startled by your ardent eyes,\n   I felt the soul within me shaken\n          And long-forgotten senses rise;\n   But in that moment you were taken,\n          And thus we lost our Paradise!Farewell, we may not now recover\n          That golden "Then" misspent, passed by,\n   We shall not meet as loved and lover\n          Here, or hereafter, you and I.\n   My time for loving you is over,\n          Love has no future, but to die.And thus we part, with no believing\n          In any chance of future years.We have no idle self-deceiving,\n          No half-consoling hopes and fears;\n   We know the Gods grant no retrieving\n          A wasted chance.Verses: Faiz Ulla\n\n   Just in the hush before dawn\n   A little wistful wind is born.A little chilly errant breeze,\n   That thrills the grasses, stirs the trees.And, as it wanders on its way,\n   While yet the night is cool and dark,\n   The first carol of the lark,--\n   Its plaintive murmurs seem to say\n   "I wait the sorrows of the day."Two Songs by Sitara, of Kashmir\n\n   Beloved!your hair was golden\n   As tender tints of sunrise,\n   As corn beside the River\n         In softly varying hues.I loved you for your slightness,\n   Your melancholy sweetness,\n   Your changeful eyes, that promised\n         What your lips would still refuse.You came to me, and loved me,\n   Were mine upon the River,\n   The azure water saw us\n         And the blue transparent sky;\n   The Lotus flowers knew it,\n   Our happiness together,\n   While life was only River,\n         Only love, and you and I.\n\n   Love wakened on the River,\n   To sounds of running water,\n   With silver Stars for witness\n         And reflected Stars for light;\n   Awakened to existence,\n   With ripples for first music\n   And sunlight on the River\n         For earliest sense of sight.Love grew upon the River\n   Among the scented flowers,\n   The open rosy flowers\n         Of the Lotus buds in bloom--\n   Love, brilliant as the Morning,\n   More fervent than the Noon-day,\n   And tender as the Twilight\n         In its blue transparent gloom.Cold snow upon the mountains,\n   The Lotus leaves turned yellow\n         And the water very grey.Our kisses faint and falter,\n   The clinging hands unfasten,\n   The golden time is over\n         And our passion dies away.To be forgotten,\n           A ripple on the River,\n           That flashes in the sunset,\n           That flashed,--and died away.Second Song: The Girl from Baltistan\n\n                            Throb, throb, throb,\n   Far away in the blue transparent Night,\n   On the outer horizon of a dreaming consciousness,\n   She hears the sound of her lover\'s nearing boat\n               Afar, afloat\n   On the river\'s loneliness, where the Stars are the only light;\n      Hear the sound of the straining wood\n          Like a broken sob\n          Of a heart\'s distress,\n      Loving misunderstood.She lies, with her loose hair spent in soft disorder,\n   On a silken sheet with a purple woven border,\n   Every cell of her brain is latent fire,\n   Every fibre tense with restrained desire.And the straining oars sound clearer, clearer,\n          The boat is approaching nearer, nearer;\n        "How to wait through the moments\' space\n        Till I see the light of my lover\'s face?"Throb, throb, throb,\n   The sound dies down the stream\n   Till it only clings at the senses\' edge\n   Like a half-remembered dream.Doubtless, he in the silence lies,\n         His fair face turned to the tender skies,\n         Starlight touching his sleeping eyes.While his boat caught in the thickset sedge\n   And the waters round it gurgle and sob,\n         Or floats set free on the river\'s tide,\n                                  Oars laid aside.She is awake and knows no rest,\n   Passion dies and is dispossessed\n          Of his brief, despotic power.But the Brain, once kindled, would still be afire\n   Were the whole world pasture to its desire,\n   And all of love, in a single hour,--\n   A single wine cup, filled to the brim,\n                              Given to slake its thirst.Some there are who are thus-wise cursed\n         Times that follow fulfilled desire\n         Are of all their hours the worst.They find no Respite and reach no Rest,\n   Though passion fail and desire grow dim,\n         No assuagement comes from the thing possessed\n                      For possession feeds the fire."Oh, for the life of the bright hued things\n          Whose marriage and death are one,\n        A floating fusion on golden wings."But we who re-marry a thousand times,\n          As the spirit or senses will,\n        In a thousand ways, in a thousand climes,\n          We remain unsatisfied still."As her lover left her, alone, awake she lies,\n   With a sleepless brain and weary, half-closed eyes.She turns her face where the purple silk is spread,\n   Still sweet with delicate perfume his presence shed.Her arms remembered his vanished beauty still,\n   And, reminiscent of clustered curls, her fingers thrill.While the wonderful, Starlit Night wears slowly on\n   Till the light of another day, serene and wan,\n                              Pierces the eastern skies.Palm Trees by the Sea\n\n   Love, let me thank you for this!Now we have drifted apart,\n   Wandered away from the sea,--\n     For the fresh touch of your kiss,\n   For the young warmth of your heart,\n     For your youth given to me.Thanks: for the curls of your hair,\n     Softer than silk to the hand,\n   For the clear gaze of your eyes.For yourself: delicate, fair,\n   Seen as you lay on the sand,\n     Under the violet skies.Thanks: for the words that you said,--\n     Secretly, tenderly sweet,\n   All through the tropical day,\n     Till, when the sunset was red,\n   I, who lay still at your feet,\n     Felt my life ebbing away,\n\n   Weary and worn with desire,\n     Only yourself could console.For that fierce fervour and fire\n   Burnt through my lips to my soul\n     From the white heat of your kiss!You were the essence of Spring,\n     Wayward and bright as a flame:\n   Though we have drifted apart,\n     Still how the syllables sing\n   Mixed in your musical name,\n     Deep in the well of my heart!Once in the lingering light,\n     Thrown from the west on the Sea,\n   Laid you your garments aside,\n     Slender and goldenly bright,\n   Glimmered your beauty, set free,\n     Bright as a pearl in the tide.Once, ere the thrill of the dawn\n     Silvered the edge of the sea,\n   I, who lay watching you rest,--\n     Pale in the chill of the morn\n   Found you still dreaming of me\n     Stilled by love\'s fancies possessed.Fallen on sorrowful days,\n     Love, let me thank you for this,\n   You were so happy with me!Wrapped in Youth\'s roseate haze,\n   Wanting no more than my kiss\n     By the blue edge of the sea!Ah, for those nights on the sand\n     Under the palms by the sea,\n   For the strange dream of those days\n     Spent in the passionate land,\n   For your youth given to me,\n     I am your debtor always!Song by Gulbaz\n\n   "Is it safe to lie so lonely when the summer twilight closes\n   No companion maidens, only you asleep among the roses?"Thirteen, fourteen years you number, and your hair is soft and scented,\n   Perilous is such a slumber in the twilight all untented."Lonely loveliness means danger, lying in your rose-leaf nest,\n   What if some young passing stranger broke into your careless rest?"But she would not heed the warning, lay alone serene and slight,\n   Till the rosy spears of morning slew the darkness of the night.Young love, walking softly, found her, in the scented, shady closes,\n   Threw his ardent arms around her, kissed her lips beneath the roses.And she said, with smiles and blushes, "Would that I had sooner known!Never now the morning thrushes wake and find me all alone."Since you said the rose-leaf cover sweet protection gave, but slight,\n   I have found this dear young lover to protect me through the night!"Kashmiri Song\n\n   Pale hands I love beside the Shalimar,\n     Where are you now?Whom do you lead on Rapture\'s roadway, far,\n     Before you agonise them in farewell?Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains,\n     Holding the doors of Heaven and of Hell,\n   How the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins\n     Beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.Pale hands, pink tipped, like Lotus buds that float\n     On those cool waters where we used to dwell,\n   I would have rather felt you round my throat,\n     Crushing out life, than waving me farewell!Reverie of Ormuz the Persian\n\n   Softly the feathery Palm-trees fade in the violet Distance,\n   Faintly the lingering light touches the edge of the sea,\n   Sadly the Music of Waves, drifts, faint as an Anthem\'s insistence,\n   Heard in the aisles of a dream, over the sandhills, to me.Now that the Lights are reversed, and the Singing changed into sighing,\n   Now that the wings of our fierce, fugitive passion are furled,\n   Take I unto myself, all alone in the light that is dying,\n   Much of the sorrow that lies hid at the Heart of the World.Sad am I, sad for your loss: for failing the charm of your presence,\n   Even the sunshine has paled, leaving the Zenith less blue.Even the ocean lessens the light of its green opalescence,\n   Since, to my sorrow I loved, loved and grew weary of, you.Why was our passion so fleeting, why had the flush of your beauty\n   Only so slender a spell, only so futile a power?Yet, even thus ever is life, save when long custom or duty\n   Moulds into sober fruit Love\'s fragile and fugitive flower.Fain would my soul have been faithful; never an alien pleasure\n   Lured me away from the light lit in your luminous eyes,\n   But we have altered the World as pitiful man has leisure\n   To criticise, balance, take counsel, assuredly lies.All through the centuries Man has gathered his flower, and fenced it,\n   --Infinite strife to attain; infinite struggle to keep,--\n   Holding his treasure awhile, all Fate and all forces against it,\n   Knowing it his no more, if ever his vigilance sleep.But we have altered the World as pitiful man has grown stronger,\n   So that the things we love are as easily kept as won,\n   Therefore the ancient fight can engage and detain us no longer,\n   And all too swiftly, alas, passion is over and done.Far too speedily now we can gather the coveted treasure,\n   Enjoy it awhile, be satiated, begin to tire;\n   And what shall be done henceforth with the profitless after-leisure,\n   Who has the breath to kindle the ash of a faded fire?After my ardent endeavour\n   Came the delirious Joy, flooding my life like a sea,\n   Days of delight that are burnt on the brain for ever and ever,\n   Days and nights when you loved, before you grew weary of me.Softly the sunset decreases dim in the violet Distance,\n   Even as Love\'s own fervour has faded away from me,\n   Leaving the weariness, the monotonous Weight of Existence,--\n   All the farewells in the world weep in the sound of the sea.Sunstroke\n\n   Oh, straight, white road that runs to meet,\n            Across green fields, the blue green sea,\n   You knew the little weary feet\n            Of my child bride that was to be!Her people brought her from the shore\n            One golden day in sultry June,\n   And I stood, waiting, at the door,\n            Praying my eyes might see her soon.With eager arms, wide open thrown,\n            Now never to be satisfied!Ere I could make my love my own\n            She closed her amber eyes and died.they took no heed\n            How frail she was, my little one,\n   But brought her here with cruel speed\n            Beneath the fierce, relentless sun.We laid her on the marriage bed\n            The bridal flowers in her hand,\n   A maiden from the ocean led\n            Only, alas!I walk alone; the air is sweet,\n            The white road wanders to the sea,\n   I dream of those two little feet\n            That grew so tired in reaching me.Adoration\n\n   Who does not feel desire unending\n     To solace through his daily strife,\n   With some mysterious Mental Blending,\n     The hungry loneliness of life?Until, by sudden passion shaken,\n     As terriers shake a rat at play,\n   He finds, all blindly, he has taken\n     The old, Hereditary way.Yet, in the moment of communion,\n     The very heart of passion\'s fire,\n   His spirit spurns the mortal union,\n     "Not this, not this, the Soul\'s desire!"*        *        *        *\n\n   Oh You, by whom my life is riven,\n     And reft away from my control,\n   Take back the hours of passion given!Although I once, in ardent fashion,\n     Implored you long to give me this;\n   (In hopes to stem, or stifle, passion)\n     Your hair to touch, your lips to kiss\n\n   Now that your gracious self has granted\n     The loveliness you hold as naught,\n   I find, alas!not that I wanted--\n     Possession has not stifled Thought.Desire its aim has only shifted,--\n     Built hopes upon another plan,\n   And I in love for you have drifted\n     Beyond all passion known to man.Beyond all dreams of soft caresses\n     The solacing of any kiss,--\n   Beyond the fragrance of your tresses\n     (Once I had sold my soul for this!)But now I crave no mortal union\n     (Thanks for that sweetness in the past);\n   I need some subtle, strange communion,\n     Some sense that _I_ join _you_, at last.Long past the pulse and pain of passion,\n     Long left the limits of all love,--\n   I crave some nearer, fuller fashion,\n     Some unknown way, beyond, above,--\n\n   Some infinitely inner fusion,\n     As Wave with Water; Flame with Fire,--\n   Let me dream once the dear delusion\n     That I am You, Oh, Heart\'s Desire!Your kindness lent to my caresses\n     That beauty you so lightly prize,--\n   The midnight of your sable tresses,\n     The twilight of your shadowed eyes.Ah, for that gift all thanks are given!Yet, Oh, adored, beyond control,\n   Count all the passionate past forgiven\n     And love me once, once, from your soul.Three Songs of Zahir-u-Din\n\n   The tropic day\'s redundant charms\n     Cool twilight soothes away,\n

    And find the morning blue,\n   A night of dreams behind me lies\n     And all were dreams of you!Ah, how I wish the while I rise,\n           That what I dream were true.The weary day\'s laborious pace,\n     I hasten and beguile\n   By fancies, which I backwards trace\n     To things I loved erstwhile;\n           The weary sweetness of your face,\n           Your faint, illusive smile.The silken softness of your hair\n     Where faint bronze shadows are,\n   Your strangely slight and youthful air,\n     No passions seem to mar,--\n           Oh, why, since Fate has made you fair,\n           Must Fortune keep you far?Thus spent, the day so long and bright\n     Less hot and brilliant seems,\n   Till in a final flare of light\n     The sun withdraws his beams.Then, in the coolness of the night,\n           I meet you in my dreams!Second Song\n\n   How much I loved that way you had\n   Of smiling most, when very sad,\n   A smile which carried tender hints\n       Of delicate

The essence of all Gaiety lay,\n   Of all mad mirth that men may know,\n   In that sad smile, serene and slow,\n   That on your lips was wont to play.It needed many delicate lines\n   And subtle

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['She had had her with her at Cleveland,\nand he had never found out anything.The arrangements completed, Jennie returned at the first\nopportunity to Cleveland to take Vesta away.Gerhardt, who had been\nbrooding over his approaching loss, appeared most solicitous about her\nfuture."She should grow up to be a fine girl," he said."You should\ngive her a good education--she is so smart."He spoke of the\nadvisability of sending her to a Lutheran school and church, but\nJennie was not so sure of that.Time and association with Lester had\nled her to think that perhaps the public school was better than any\nprivate institution.She had no particular objection to the church,\nbut she no longer depended upon its teachings as a guide in the\naffairs of life.The next day it was necessary for Jennie to return to Chicago.Vesta, excited and eager, was made ready for the journey.Gerhardt had\nbeen wandering about, restless as a lost spirit, while the process of\ndressing was going on; now that the hour had actually struck he was\ndoing his best to control his feelings.He could see that the\nfive-year-old child had no conception of what it meant to him.She was\nhappy and self-interested, chattering about the ride and the\ntrain."Be a good little girl," he said, lifting her up and kissing her."See that you study your catechism and say your prayers.And you won\'t\nforget the grandpa--what?--" He tried to go on, but his\nvoice failed him.Jennie, whose heart ached for her father, choked back her emotion."There," she said, "if I\'d thought you were going to act like\nthat--" She stopped."Go," said Gerhardt, manfully, "go.And he\nstood solemnly by as they went out of the door.Then he turned back to\nhis favorite haunt, the kitchen, and stood there staring at the floor.One by one they were leaving him--Mrs.Gerhardt, Bass, Martha,\nJennie, Vesta.He clasped his hands together, after his old-time\nfashion, and shook his head again and again.CHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nDuring the three years in which Jennie and Lester had been\nassociated there had grown up between them a strong feeling of mutual\nsympathy and understanding.Lester truly loved her in his own way.It\nwas a strong, self-satisfying, determined kind of way, based solidly\non a big natural foundation, but rising to a plane of genuine\nspiritual affinity.The yielding sweetness of her character both\nattracted and held him.She was true, and good, and womanly to the\nvery center of her being; he had learned to trust her, to depend upon\nher, and the feeling had but deepened with the passing of the\nyears.On her part Jennie had sincerely, deeply, truly learned to love\nthis man.At first when he had swept her off her feet, overawed her\nsoul, and used her necessity as a chain wherewith to bind her to him,\nshe was a little doubtful, a little afraid of him, although she had\nalways liked him.Now, however, by living with him, by knowing him\nbetter, by watching his moods, she had come to love him.He was so\nbig, so vocal, so handsome.His point of view and opinions of anything\nand everything were so positive.His pet motto, "Hew to the line, let\nthe chips fall where they may," had clung in her brain as something\nimmensely characteristic.Apparently he was not afraid of\nanything--God, man, or devil.He used to look at her, holding her\nchin between the thumb and fingers of his big brown hand, and say:\n"You\'re sweet, all right, but you need courage and defiance.And her eyes would meet his in dumb\nappeal."Never mind," he would add, "you have other things."One of the most appealing things to Lester was the simple way in\nwhich she tried to avoid exposure of her various social and\neducational shortcomings.She could not write very well, and once he\nfound a list of words he had used written out on a piece of paper with\nthe meanings opposite.He smiled, but he liked her better for it.Louis he watched her\npretending a loss of appetite because she thought that her lack of\ntable manners was being observed by nearby diners.John moved to the kitchen.She could not\nalways be sure of the right forks and knives, and the strange-looking\ndishes bothered her; how did one eat asparagus and artichokes?"You\'re\nhungry, aren\'t you?"I wouldn\'t bring you here if\nthey weren\'t.I\'d tell\nyou quick enough when there was anything wrong."His brown eyes held a\nfriendly gleam."I do feel a little nervous at times," she\nadmitted.By degrees Jennie grew into an understanding of the usages and\ncustoms of comfortable existence.All that the Gerhardt family had\never had were the bare necessities of life.Now she was surrounded\nwith whatever she wanted--trunks, clothes, toilet articles, the\nwhole varied equipment of comfort--and while she liked it all, it\ndid not upset her sense of proportion and her sense of the fitness of\nthings.There was no element of vanity in her, only a sense of joy in\nprivilege and opportunity.She was grateful to Lester for all that he\nhad done and was doing for her.If only she could hold\nhim--always!The details of getting Vesta established once adjusted, Jennie\nsettled down into the routine of home life.Lester, busy about his\nmultitudinous affairs, was in and out.He had a suite of rooms\nreserved for himself at the Grand Pacific, which was then the\nexclusive hotel of Chicago, and this was his ostensible residence.His\nluncheon and evening appointments were kept at the Union Club.An\nearly patron of the telephone, he had one installed in the apartment,\nso that he could reach Jennie quickly and at any time.He was home two\nor three nights a week, sometimes oftener.He insisted at first on\nJennie having a girl of general housework, but acquiesced in the more\nsensible arrangement which she suggested later of letting some one\ncome in to do the cleaning.Her\nnatural industry and love of order prompted this feeling.Lester liked his breakfast promptly at eight in the morning.He\nwanted dinner served nicely at seven.Silverware, cut glass, imported\nchina--all the little luxuries of life appealed to him.He kept\nhis trunks and wardrobe at the apartment.He was in the\nhabit of taking Jennie to the theater now and then, and if he chanced\nto run across an acquaintance he always introduced her as Miss\nGerhardt.When he registered her as his wife it was usually under an\nassumed name; where there was no danger of detection he did not mind\nusing his own signature.Thus far there had been no difficulty or\nunpleasantness of any kind.The trouble with this situation was that it was criss-crossed with\nthe danger and consequent worry which the deception in regard to Vesta\nhad entailed, as well as with Jennie\'s natural anxiety about her\nfather and the disorganized home.Jennie feared, as Veronica hinted,\nthat she and William would go to live with Martha, who was installed\nin a boarding-house in Cleveland, and that Gerhardt would be left\nalone.He was such a pathetic figure to her, with his injured hands\nand his one ability--that of being a watchman--that she was\nhurt to think of his being left alone.She knew\nthat he would not--feeling as he did at present.Would Lester\nhave him--she was not sure of that.If he came Vesta would have\nto be accounted for.The situation in regard to Vesta was really complicated.Owing to\nthe feeling that she was doing her daughter a great injustice, Jennie\nwas particularly sensitive in regard to her, anxious to do a thousand\nthings to make up for the one great duty that she could not perform.She daily paid a visit to the home of Mrs.Olsen, always taking with\nher toys, candy, or whatever came into her mind as being likely to\ninterest and please the child.She liked to sit with Vesta and tell\nher stories of fairy and giant, which kept the little girl wide-eyed.At last she went so far as to bring her to the apartment, when Lester\nwas away visiting his parents, and she soon found it possible, during\nhis several absences, to do this regularly.After that, as time went\non and she began to know his habits, she became more\nbold--although bold is scarcely the word to use in connection\nwith Jennie.She became venturesome much as a mouse might; she would\nrisk Vesta\'s presence on the assurance of even short\nabsences--two or three days.She even got into the habit of\nkeeping a few of Vesta\'s toys at the apartment, so that she could have\nsomething to play with when she came.During these several visits from her child Jennie could not but\nrealize the lovely thing life would be were she only an honored wife\nand a happy mother.Vesta was a most observant little girl.She could\nby her innocent childish questions give a hundred turns to the dagger\nof self-reproach which was already planted deeply in Jennie\'s\nheart.was one of her simplest and most\nfrequently repeated questions.Jennie would reply that mamma could not\nhave her just yet, but that very soon now, just as soon as she\npossibly could, Vesta should come to stay always."No, dearest, not just when.You won\'t mind waiting\na little while."Yes," replied Vesta; "but then she ain\'t got any nice things now.And Jennie, stricken to the heart, would\ntake Vesta to the toy shop, and load her down with a new assortment of\nplaythings.Of course Lester was not in the least suspicious.His observation\nof things relating to the home were rather casual.He went about his\nwork and his pleasures believing Jennie to be the soul of sincerity\nand good-natured service, and it never occurred to him that there was\nanything underhanded in her actions.Once he did come home sick in the\nafternoon and found her absent--an absence which endured from two\no\'clock to five.He was a little irritated and grumbled on her return,\nbut his annoyance was as nothing to her astonishment and fright when\nshe found him there.She blanched at the thought of his suspecting\nsomething, and explained as best she could.She had gone to see her\nwasherwoman.She was sorry, too, that her absence had lost her an\nopportunity to serve him.It showed her what a mess she was likely to\nmake of it all.It happened that about three weeks after the above occurrence\nLester had occasion to return to Cincinnati for a week, and during\nthis time Jennie again brought Vesta to the flat; for four days there\nwas the happiest goings on between the mother and child.Nothing would have come of this little reunion had it not been for\nan oversight on Jennie\'s part, the far-reaching effects of which she\ncould only afterward regret.This was the leaving of a little toy lamb\nunder the large leather divan in the front room, where Lester was wont\nto lie and smoke.A little bell held by a thread of blue ribbon was\nfastened about its neck, and this tinkled feebly whenever it was\nshaken.Vesta, with the unaccountable freakishness of children had\ndeliberately dropped it behind the divan, an action which Jennie did\nnot notice at the time.When she gathered up the various playthings\nafter Vesta\'s departure she overlooked it entirely, and there it\nrested, its innocent eyes still staring upon the sunlit regions of\ntoyland, when Lester returned.That same evening, when he was lying on the divan, quietly enjoying\nhis cigar and his newspaper, he chanced to drop the former, fully\nlighted.Wishing to recover it before it should do any damage, he\nleaned over and looked under the divan.The cigar was not in sight, so\nhe rose and pulled the lounge out, a move which revealed to him the\nlittle lamb still standing where Vesta had dropped it.He picked it\nup, turning it over and over, and wondering how it had come there.It must belong to some neighbor\'s child in whom Jennie had\ntaken an interest, he thought.He would have to go and tease her about\nthis.Accordingly he held the toy jovially before him, and, coming out\ninto the dining-room, where Jennie was working at the sideboard, he\nexclaimed in a mock solemn voice, "Where did this come from?"Jennie, who was totally unconscious of the existence of this\nevidence of her duplicity, turned, and was instantly possessed with\nthe idea that he had suspected all and was about to visit his just\nwrath upon her.Instantly the blood flamed in her cheeks and as\nquickly left them.she stuttered, "it\'s a little toy I bought.""I see it is," he returned genially, her guilty tremor not escaping\nhis observation, but having at the same time no explicable\nsignificance to him."It\'s frisking around a mighty lone\nsheepfold."He touched the little bell at its throat, while Jennie stood there,\nunable to speak.It tinkled feebly, and then he looked at her again.His manner was so humorous that she could tell he suspected nothing.However, it was almost impossible for her to recover her\nself-possession."You look as though a lamb was a terrible shock to you.""I forgot to take it out from there, that was all," she went on\nblindly."It looks as though it has been played with enough," he added more\nseriously, and then seeing that the discussion was evidently painful\nto her, he dropped it.The lamb had not furnished him the amusement\nthat he had expected.Lester went back into the front room, stretched himself out and\nthought it over.What was there about a toy to\nmake her grow pale?Surely there was no harm in her harboring some\nyoungster of the neighborhood when she was alone--having it come\nin and play.He thought it over, but\ncould come to no conclusion.Nothing more was said about the incident of the toy lamb.Time\nmight have wholly effaced the impression from Lester\'s memory had\nnothing else intervened to arouse his suspicions; but a mishap of any\nkind seems invariably to be linked with others which follow close upon\nits heels.One evening when Lester happened to be lingering about the flat\nlater than usual the door bell rang, and, Jennie being busy in the\nkitchen, Lester went himself to open the door.He was greeted by a\nmiddle-aged lady, who frowned very nervously upon him, and inquired in\nbroken Swedish accents for Jennie."Wait a moment," said Lester; and stepping to the rear door he\ncalled her.Jennie came, and seeing who the visitor was, she stepped nervously\nout in the hall and closed the door after her.The action instantly\nstruck Lester as suspicious.He frowned and determined to inquire\nthoroughly into the matter.Her face\nwas white and her fingers seemed to be nervously seeking something to\nseize upon.he inquired, the irritation he had felt the\nmoment before giving his voice a touch of gruffness."I\'ve got to go out for a little while," she at last managed to\nreply."Very well," he assented unwillingly."But you can tell me what\'s\nthe trouble with you, can\'t you?"I--I," began Jennie, stammering."I--have--"\n\n"Yes," he said grimly."I have to go on an errand," she stumbled on.I\'ll tell you when I come back, Lester.She looked vainly at him, her troubled countenance still marked by\npreoccupation and anxiety to get away, and Lester, who had never seen\nthis look of intense responsibility in her before, was moved and\nirritated by it."That\'s all right," he said, "but what\'s the use of all this\nsecrecy?Why can\'t you come out and tell what\'s the matter with you?What\'s the use of this whispering behind doors?He paused, checked by his own harshness, and Jennie, who was\nintensely wrought up by the information she had received, as well as\nthe unwonted verbal castigation she was now enduring, rose to an\nemotional state never reached by her before."I will, Lester, I will," she exclaimed.I\'ll tell you everything when I come back.She hurried to the adjoining chamber to get her wraps, and Lester,\nwho had even yet no clear conception of what it all meant, followed\nher stubbornly to the door."See here," he exclaimed in his vigorous, brutal way, "you\'re not\nacting right.He stood in the doorway, his whole frame exhibiting the pugnacity\nand settled determination of a man who is bound to be obeyed.Jennie,\ntroubled and driven to bay, turned at last."It\'s my child, Lester," she exclaimed.I\'ll tell you everything when I\ncome back.""What the hell are you talking\nabout?""I couldn\'t help it," she returned."I was afraid--I should\nhave told you long ago.I meant to only--only--Oh, let me go\nnow, and I\'ll tell you all when I come back!"He stared at her in amazement; then he stepped aside, unwilling to\nforce her any further for the present."Well, go ahead," he said\nquietly."Don\'t you want some one to go along with you?"She hurried forth, white-faced, and he stood there, pondering.Could this be the woman he had thought he knew?Why, she had been\ndeceiving him for years.He choked a little as he muttered:\n\n"Well, I\'ll be damned!"CHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe reason why Jennie had been called was nothing more than one of\nthose infantile seizures the coming and result of which no man can\npredict two hours beforehand.Vesta had been seriously taken with\nmembranous croup only a few hours before, and the development since\nhad been so rapid that the poor old Swedish mother was half frightened\nto death herself, and hastily despatched a neighbor to say that Vesta\nwas very ill and Mrs.This message,\ndelivered as it was in a very nervous manner by one whose only object\nwas to bring her, had induced the soul-racking fear of death in Jennie\nand caused her to brave the discovery of Lester in the manner\ndescribed.Jennie hurried on anxiously, her one thought being to reach\nher child before the arm of death could interfere and snatch it from\nher, her mind weighed upon by a legion of fears.What if it should\nalready be too late when she got there; what if Vesta already should\nbe no more.Instinctively she quickened her pace and as the street\nlamps came and receded in the gloom she forgot all the sting of\nLester\'s words, all fear that he might turn her out and leave her\nalone in a great city with a little child to care for, and remembered\nonly the fact that her Vesta was very ill, possibly dying, and that\nshe was the direct cause of the child\'s absence from her; that perhaps\nbut for the want of her care and attention Vesta might be well\nto-night."If I can only get there," she kept saying to herself; and then,\nwith that frantic unreason which is the chief characteristic of the\ninstinct-driven mother: "I might have known that God would punish me\nfor my unnatural conduct.I might have known--I might have\nknown."When she reached the gate she fairly sped up the little walk and\ninto the house, where Vesta was lying pale, quiet, and weak, but\nconsiderably better.Several Swedish neighbors and a middle-aged\nphysician were in attendance, all of whom looked at her curiously as\nshe dropped beside the child\'s bed and spoke to her.She had sinned, and sinned\ngrievously, against her daughter, but now she would make amends so far\nas possible.Lester was very dear to her, but she would no longer\nattempt to deceive him in anything, even if he left her--she felt\nan agonized stab, a pain at the thought--she must still do the\none right thing.Vesta must not be an outcast any longer.Where Jennie was, there must Vesta be.Sitting by the bedside in this humble Swedish cottage, Jennie\nrealized the fruitlessness of her deception, the trouble and pain it\nhad created in her home, the months of suffering it had given her with\nLester, the agony it had heaped upon her this night--and to what\nend?She sat there and\nmeditated, not knowing what next was to happen, while Vesta quieted\ndown, and then went soundly to sleep.Lester, after recovering from the first heavy import of this\ndiscovery, asked himself some perfectly natural questions."Who was\nthe father of the child?How did it chance to be in\nChicago, and who was taking care of it?"He could ask, but he could\nnot answer; he knew absolutely nothing.Curiously, now, as he thought, his first meeting with Jennie at\nMrs.What was it about her then that\nhad attracted him?What made him think, after a few hours\'\nobservation, that he could seduce her to do his will?What was\nit--moral looseness, or weakness, or what?There must have been\nart in the sorry affair, the practised art of the cheat, and, in\ndeceiving such a confiding nature as his, she had done even more than\npractise deception--she had been ungrateful.Now the quality of ingratitude was a very objectionable thing to\nLester--the last and most offensive trait of a debased nature,\nand to be able to discover a trace of it in Jennie was very\ndisturbing.It is true that she had not exhibited it in any other way\nbefore--quite to the contrary--but nevertheless he saw\nstrong evidences of it now, and it made him very bitter in his feeling\ntoward her.How could she be guilty of any such conduct toward him?Had he not picked her up out of nothing, so to speak, and befriended\nher?He moved from his chair in this silent room and began to pace\nslowly to and fro, the weightiness of this subject exercising to the\nfull his power of decision.She was guilty of a misdeed which he felt\nable to condemn.The original concealment was evil; the continued\ndeception more.Lastly, there was the thought that her love after all\nhad been divided, part for him, part for the child, a discovery which\nno man in his position could contemplate with serenity.He moved\nirritably as he thought of it, shoved his hands in his pockets and\nwalked to and fro across the floor.That a man of Lester\'s temperament should consider himself wronged\nby Jennie merely because she had concealed a child whose existence was\ndue to conduct no more irregular than was involved later in the\nyielding of herself to him was an example of those inexplicable\nperversions of judgment to which the human mind, in its capacity of\nkeeper of the honor of others, seems permanently committed.Lester,\naside from his own personal conduct (for men seldom judge with that in\nthe balance), had faith in the ideal that a woman should reveal\nherself completely to the one man with whom she is in love; and the\nfact that she had not done so was a grief to him.He had asked her\nonce tentatively about her past.That\nwas the time she should have spoken of any child.His first impulse, after he had thought the thing over, was to walk\nout and leave her.At the same time he was curious to hear the end of\nthis business.He did put on his hat and coat, however, and went out,\nstopping at the first convenient saloon to get a drink.He took a car\nand went down to the club, strolling about the different rooms and\nchatting with several people whom he encountered.He was restless and\nirritated; and finally, after three hours of meditation, he took a cab\nand returned to his apartment.The distraught Jennie, sitting by her sleeping child, was at last\nmade to realize, by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over.There was nothing more that she could do for Vesta, and now the claims\nof the home that she had deserted began to reassert themselves, the\npromise to Lester and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the\nvery end.It was just\nprobable that he wished to hear the remainder of her story before\nbreaking with her entirely.Although anguished and frightened by the\ncertainty, as she deemed it, of his forsaking her, she nevertheless\nfelt that it was no more than she deserved--a just punishment for\nall her misdoings.When Jennie arrived at the flat it was after eleven, and the hall\nlight was already out.She first tried the door, and then inserted her\nkey.No one stirred, however, and, opening the door, she entered in\nthe expectation of seeing Lester sternly confronting her.The burning gas had merely been an oversight on his\npart.She glanced quickly about, but seeing only the empty room, she\ncame instantly to the other conclusion, that he had forsaken\nher--and so stood there, a meditative, helpless figure.At this moment his footsteps sounded on the stairs.He came in with\nhis derby hat pulled low over his broad forehead, close to his sandy\neyebrows, and with his overcoat buttoned up closely about his neck.He\ntook off the coat without looking at Jennie and hung it on the rack.Then he deliberately took off his hat and hung that up also.When he\nwas through he turned to where she was watching him with wide\neyes."I want to know about this thing now from beginning to end," he\nbegan.Jennie wavered a moment, as one who might be going to take a leap\nin the dark, then opened her lips mechanically and confessed:\n\n"It\'s Senator Brander\'s."echoed Lester, the familiar name of the dead but\nstill famous statesman ringing with shocking and unexpected force in\nhis ears."We used to do his washing for him," she rejoined simply--"my\nmother and I."Lester paused, the baldness of the statements issuing from her\nsobering even his rancorous mood."Senator Brander\'s child," he\nthought to himself.So that great representative of the interests of\nthe common people was the undoer of her--a self-confessed\nwasherwoman\'s daughter.A fine tragedy of low life all this was.he demanded, his face the picture of a\ndarkling mood."It\'s been nearly six years now," she returned.He calculated the time that had elapsed since he had known her, and\nthen continued:\n\n"How old is the child?"The need for serious thought made his tone\nmore peremptory but less bitter."Where have you been keeping her all this time?""She was at home until you went to Cincinnati last spring."Was she there the times I came to Cleveland?""Yes," said Jennie; "but I didn\'t let her come out anywhere where\nyou could see her.""I thought you said you told your people that you were married," he\nexclaimed, wondering how this relationship of the child to the family\ncould have been adjusted."I did," she replied, "but I didn\'t want to tell you about her."I didn\'t know what was going to become of me when I went with you,\nLester.I didn\'t want to do her any harm if I could help it.I was\nashamed, afterward; when you said you didn\'t like children I was\nafraid."He stopped, the simplicity of her answers removing a part of the\nsuspicion of artful duplicity which had originally weighed upon him.After all, there was not so much of that in it as mere wretchedness of\ncircumstance and cowardice of morals.What queer non-moral natures they must have to have brooked any such a\ncombination of affairs!"Didn\'t you know that you\'d be found out in the long run?""Surely you might have seen that you couldn\'t raise her\nthat way.Why didn\'t you tell me in the first place?I wouldn\'t have\nthought anything of it then."She stood there, the contradictory aspect of these questions and of\nhis attitude puzzling even herself.She did try to explain them after\na time, but all Lester could gain was that she had blundered along\nwithout any artifice at all--a condition that was so manifest\nthat, had he been in any other position than that he was, he might\nhave pitied her.As it was, the revelation concerning Brander was\nhanging over him, and he finally returned to that."You say your mother used to do washing for him.How did you come\nto get in with him?"Jennie, who until now had borne his questions with unmoving pain,\nwinced at this.He was now encroaching upon the period that was by far\nthe most distressing memory of her life.What he had just asked seemed\nto be a demand upon her to make everything clear."I was so young, Lester," she pleaded.I used to go to the hotel where he was stopping and get\nhis laundry, and at the end of the week I\'d take it to him again."She paused, and as he took a chair, looking as if he expected to\nhear the whole story, she continued: "We were so poor.He used to give\nme money to give to my mother.She paused again, totally unable to go on, and he, seeing that it\nwould be impossible for her to explain without prompting, took up his\nquestioning again--eliciting by degrees the whole pitiful story.He had written to her, but before\nhe could come to her he died.It was followed by a period of five\nminutes, in which Lester said nothing at all; he put his arm on the\nmantel and stared at the wall, while Jennie waited, not knowing what\nwould follow--not wishing to make a single plea.Lester\'s face betrayed no sign of either thought or feeling.He was now quite calm, quite sober, wondering what he should do.Jennie was before him as the criminal at the bar.He, the righteous,\nthe moral, the pure of heart, was in the judgment seat.Now to\nsentence her--to make up his mind what course of action he should\npursue.It was a disagreeable tangle, to be sure, something that a man of\nhis position and wealth really ought not to have anything to do with.This child, the actuality of it, put an almost unbearable face upon\nthe whole matter--and yet he was not quite prepared to speak.He\nturned after a time, the silvery tinkle of the French clock on the\nmantel striking three and causing him to become aware of Jennie, pale,\nuncertain, still standing as she had stood all this while."Better go to bed," he said at last, and fell again to pondering\nthis difficult problem.But Jennie continued to stand there wide-eyed, expectant, ready to\nhear at any moment his decision as to her fate.After a long time of musing he turned and went to the\nclothes-rack near the door."Better go to bed," he said, indifferently.She turned instinctively, feeling that even in this crisis there\nwas some little service that she might render, but he did not see her.He went out, vouchsafing no further speech.She looked after him, and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she\nfelt as if she were doomed and hearing her own death-knell.She stood there a dissonance of\ndespair, and when the lower door clicked moved her hand out of the\nagony of her suppressed hopelessness.In the light of a late dawn she was still sitting there pondering,\nher state far too urgent for idle tears.CHAPTER XXX\n\n\nThe sullen, philosophic Lester was not so determined upon his\nfuture course of action as he appeared to be.Stern as was his mood,\nhe did not see, after all, exactly what grounds he had for complaint.And yet the child\'s existence complicated matters considerably.He did\nnot like to see the evidence of Jennie\'s previous misdeeds walking\nabout in the shape of a human being; but, as a matter of fact, he\nadmitted to himself that long ago he might have forced Jennie\'s story\nout of her if he had gone about it in earnest.She would not have\nlied, he knew that.At the very outset he might have demanded the\nhistory of her past.He had not done so; well, now it was too late.The one thing it did fix in his mind was that it would be useless to\never think of marrying her.It couldn\'t be done, not by a man in his\nposition.The best solution of the problem was to make reasonable\nprovision for Jennie and then leave her.He went to his hotel with his\nmind made up, but he did not actually say to himself that he would do\nit at once.It is an easy thing for a man to theorize in a situation of this\nkind, quite another to act.Our comforts, appetites and passions grow\nwith usage, and Jennie was not only a comfort, but an appetite, with\nhim.Almost four years of constant association had taught him so much\nabout her and himself that he was not prepared to let go easily or\nquickly.He could think of it bustling\nabout the work of a great organization during the daytime, but when\nnight came it was a different matter.He could be lonely, too, he\ndiscovered much to his surprise, and it disturbed him.One of the things that interested him in this situation was\nJennie\'s early theory that the intermingling of Vesta with him and her\nin this new relationship would injure the child.Just how did she come\nby that feeling, he wanted to know?His place in the world was better\nthan hers, yet it dawned on him after a time that there might have\nbeen something in her point of view.She did not know who he was or\nwhat he would do with her.Being\nuncertain, she wished to protect her baby.Then\nagain, he was curious to know what the child was like.The daughter of\na man like Senator Brander might be somewhat of an infant.He was a\nbrilliant man and Jennie was a charming woman.He thought of this,\nand, while it irritated him, it aroused his curiosity.He ought to go\nback and see the child--he was really entitled to a view of\nit--but he hesitated because of his own attitude in the\nbeginning.It seemed to him that he really ought to quit, and here he\nwas parleying with himself.These years of living with Jennie\nhad made him curiously dependent upon her.Who had ever been so close\nto him before?His mother loved him, but her attitude toward him had\nnot so much to do with real love as with ambition.His\nfather--well, his father was a man, like himself.All of his\nsisters were distinctly wrapped up in their own affairs; Robert and he\nwere temperamentally uncongenial.With Jennie he had really been\nhappy, he had truly lived.She was necessary to him; the longer he\nstayed away from her the more he wanted her.He finally decided to\nhave a straight-out talk with her, to arrive at some sort of\nunderstanding.She ought to get the child and take care of it.She\nmust understand that he might eventually want to quit.She ought to be\nmade to feel that a definite change had taken place, though no\nimmediate break might occur.That same evening he went out to the\napartment.Jennie heard him enter, and her heart began to flutter.Then she took her courage in both hands, and went to meet him."There\'s just one thing to be done about this as far as I can see,"\nbegan Lester, with characteristic directness."Get the child and bring her here where you can take care of her.There\'s no use leaving her in the hands of strangers.""I will, Lester," said Jennie submissively."Very well, then, you\'d better do it at once."He took an evening\nnewspaper out of his pocket and strolled toward one of the front\nwindows; then he turned to her."You and I might as well understand\neach other, Jennie," he went on."I can see how this thing came about.It was a piece of foolishness on my part not to have asked you before,\nand made you tell me.It was silly for you to conceal it, even if you\ndidn\'t want the child\'s life mixed with mine.You might have known\nthat it couldn\'t be done.That\'s neither here nor there, though, now.The thing that I want to point out is that one can\'t live and hold a\nrelationship such as ours without confidence.You and I had that, I\nthought.I don\'t see my way clear to ever hold more than a tentative\nrelationship with you on this basis."Now, I don\'t propose to do anything hasty.For my part I don\'t see\nwhy things can\'t go on about as they are--certainly for the\npresent--but I want you to look the facts in the face.""I know, Lester," she said, "I know."There were some trees in the\nyard, where the darkness was settling.He wondered how this would\nreally come out, for he liked a home atmosphere.Should he leave the\napartment and go to his club?"You\'d better get the dinner," he suggested, after a time, turning\ntoward her irritably; but he did not feel so distant as he looked.It\nwas a shame that life could not be more decently organized.He\nstrolled back to his lounge, and Jennie went about her duties.She was\nthinking of Vesta, of her ungrateful attitude toward Lester, of his\nfinal decision never to marry her.So that was how one dream had been\nwrecked by folly.She spread the table, lighted the pretty silver candles, made his\nfavorite biscuit, put a small leg of lamb in the oven to roast, and\nwashed some lettuce-leaves for a salad.She had been a diligent\nstudent of a cook-book for some time, and she had learned a good deal\nfrom her mother.All the time she was wondering how the situation\nwould work out.He would leave her eventually--no doubt of that.He would go away and marry some one else."Oh, well," she thought finally, "he is not going to leave me right\naway--that is something.She sighed\nas she carried the things to the table.If life would only give her\nLester and Vesta together--but that hope was over.CHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nThere was peace and quiet for some time after this storm.Jennie\nwent the next day and brought Vesta away with her.The joy of the\nreunion between mother and child made up for many other worries."Now\nI can do by her as I ought," she thought; and three or four times\nduring the day she found herself humming a little song.He was trying to make\nhimself believe that he ought to do something toward reforming his\nlife--toward bringing about that eventual separation which he had\nsuggested.He did not like the idea of a child being in this\napartment--particularly that particular child.He fought his way\nthrough a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to\nthe apartment more regularly.In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a\nplace of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.During the first days of Lester\'s return it was difficult for\nJennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost\nuncontrollable child from annoying the staid, emphatic,\ncommercial-minded man.Jennie gave Vesta a severe talking to the first\nnight Lester telephoned that he was coming, telling her that he was a\nvery bad-tempered man who didn\'t like children, and that she mustn\'t\ngo near him."You mustn\'t talk," she said.Let mamma ask you what you want.Vesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the\nfull significance of the warning.Jennie, who had taken great pains to array\nVesta as attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give\nher own toilet a last touch.As a\nmatter of fact, she had followed her mother to the door of the\nsitting-room, where now she could be plainly seen.Lester hung up his\nhat and coat, then, turning, he caught his first glimpse.The child\nlooked very sweet--he admitted that at a glance.She was arrayed\nin a blue-dotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll collar and\ncuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes.Her\ncorn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face.Blue eyes, rosy lips,\nrosy cheeks completed the picture.Lester stared, almost inclined to\nsay something, but restrained himself.When Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had\narrived."Rather sweet-looking child," he said."Do you have much\ntrouble in making her mind?"Jennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of\ntheir conversation.Didn\'t I tell you you mustn\'t\ntalk?"What might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen,\npeevish, or all three, can scarcely be conjectured.Had Jennie been\nless tactful, even in the beginning, he might have obtained a\ndisagreeable impression.As it was, the natural beauty of the child,\ncombined with the mother\'s gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the\nbackground, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and\nyouth which is always pleasant.The thought struck him that Jennie had\nbeen the mother of a child all these years; she had been separated\nfrom it for months at a time; she had never even hinted at its\nexistence, and yet her affection for Vesta was obviously great."It\'s\nqueer," he said.One morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when\nhe thought he heard something stir.He turned, and was surprised to\nsee a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring\ndoor--the effect was most disconcerting.It was not like the\nordinary eye, which, under such embarrassing circumstances, would have\nbeen immediately withdrawn; it kept its position with deliberate\nboldness.He turned his paper solemnly and looked again.He crossed his\nlegs and looked again.This little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with\nthe saving grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially\nresponsive.Although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude\nof aloofness, he found his mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by\nthe mysterious appearance; the corners of his mouth were animated by a\ndesire to turn up.He did not give way to the feeling, and stuck by\nhis paper, but the incident remained very clearly in his mind.The\nyoung wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon\nhim.Not long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast,\ncalmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused\nby another visitation--this time not quite so simple.Jennie had\ngiven Vesta her breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until\nLester should leave the house.Jennie was seated at the table, pouring\nout the coffee, when Vesta suddenly appeared, very business-like in\nmanner, and marched through the room.Lester looked up, and Jennie\ncolored and arose.By this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a\nlittle broom, and returned, a droll determination lighting her\nface."I want my little broom," she exclaimed and marched sedately past,\nat which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched internally,\nthis time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across\nhis mouth.The final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down\nthe feeling of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in\nits place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a\nhuman being.The developments of the next six months were of a kind to further\nrelax the strain of opposition which still existed in Lester\'s mind.Although not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in\nwhich he was living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could\nnot persuade himself to give it up.It was too much like a bed of\ndown.The condition of unquestioned\nliberty, so far as all his old social relationships were concerned,\ncoupled with the privilege of quiet, simplicity, and affection in the\nhome was too inviting.He lingered on, and began to feel that perhaps\nit would be just as well to let matters rest as they were.During this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta\ninsensibly strengthened.He discovered that there was a real flavor of\nhumor about Vesta\'s doings, and so came to watch for its development.She was forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie\nwatched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him,\nnevertheless Vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and\ncame straight home with her remarks.Once, for example, she was sawing\naway at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife,\nwhen Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a\nlittle breakfast set.Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow,\nreached over and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained\na desire to laugh.Another morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the\nlumps of sugar in Lester\'s cup, when she broke in with, "I want two\nlumps in mine, mamma.""No, dearest," replied Jennie, "you don\'t need any in yours."Uncle Lester has two," she protested."Yes," returned Jennie; "but you\'re only a little girl.Besides you\nmustn\'t say anything like that at the table."Uncle Lester eats too much sugar," was her immediate rejoinder, at\nwhich that fine gourmet smiled broadly."I don\'t know about that," he put in, for the first time deigning\nto answer her directly."That sounds like the fox and grapes to me."Vesta smiled back at him, and now that the ice was broken she\nchattered on unrestrainedly.One thing led to another, and at last\nLester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to him; he\nwas willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his\nposition and wealth might make possible--provided, of course,\nthat he stayed with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement\nwhich would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which\nwas back of him, and which he had to keep constantly in mind.CHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nThe following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed,\nand Lester removed his office to the new building.Heretofore, he had\nbeen transacting all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the\nclub.From now on he felt himself to be firmly established in\nChicago--as if that was to be his future home.A large number of\ndetails were thrown upon him--the control of a considerable\noffice force, and the handling of various important transactions.It\ntook away from him the need of traveling, that duty going to Amy\'s\nhusband, under the direction of Robert.The latter was doing his best\nto push his personal interests, not only through the influence he was\nbringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his reorganization of\nthe factory.Several men whom Lester was personally fond of were in\ndanger of elimination.But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane\nsenior was inclined to give Robert a free hand.He was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take\ncharge.Apparently he and Robert were on\nbetter terms than ever before.Matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact\nthat Lester\'s private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be\npermanently kept under cover.At times he was seen driving with her by\npeople who knew him in a social and commercial way.He was for\nbrazening it out on the ground that he was a single man, and at\nliberty to associate with anybody he pleased.Jennie might be any\nyoung woman of good family in whom he was interested.He did not\npropose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always\nmade it a point to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others\nmight not attempt to detain and talk to him.At the theater, as has\nbeen said, she was simply "Miss Gerhardt."The trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers\nof life.They had no quarrel to pick with Lester\'s conduct.Only he\nhad been seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman.She must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly.Wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling.Rumors came\nto Robert, who, however, kept his own counsel.If Lester wanted to do\nthis sort of thing, well and good.But there must come a time when\nthere would be a show-down.This came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester\nand Jennie had been living in the north side apartment.It so happened\nthat, during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was\nseized with a mild form of grip.When he felt the first symptoms he\nthought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration,\nand tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of\nquinine.But the infection was stronger than he counted on; by morning\nhe was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a splitting\nheadache.His long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious.Policy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel\nand endure his sickness alone.As a matter of fact, he was very glad\nto be in the house with her.He had to call up the office to say that\nhe was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so; then he\nyielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations.Jennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or\nwell.She persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe.She\nbrought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and hands in\ncold water over and over.Later, when he was recovering, she made him\nappetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.It was during this illness that the first real contretemps\noccurred.Lester\'s sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St.Paul, and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on\nher way, decided upon an earlier return than she had originally\nplanned.While Lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in\nChicago.Calling up the office, and finding that he was not there and\nwould not be down for several days, she asked where he could be\nreached."I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific," said an\nincautious secretary.Louise, a little\ndisturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told that Mr.Kane\nhad not been there for several days--did not, as a matter of\nfact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week.Piqued by\nthis, she telephoned his club.It so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had\ncalled up the apartment a number of times for Lester himself.He had\nnot been cautioned not to give its number--as a matter of fact,\nit had never been asked for by any one else.When Louise stated that\nshe was Lester\'s sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied,\n"I think he lives at 19 Schiller Place.""Whose address is that you\'re giving?""Well, don\'t be giving out addresses.The boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was\ngone.About an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her\nbrother, Louise arrived at Schiller Place.Ascending the\nsteps--it was a two-apartment house--she saw the name of\nKane on the door leading to the second floor.Ringing the bell, she\nwas opened to by Jennie, who was surprised to see so fashionably\nattired a young woman.Kane\'s apartment, I believe," began Louise,\ncondescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie.She\nwas a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were\nas yet only vaguely aroused.Jennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried\nto make some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and\nstation, swept past before Jennie could say a word.Daniel went back to the garden.Once inside Louise\nlooked about her inquiringly.She found herself in the sitting-room,\nwhich gave into the bedroom where Lester was lying.Vesta happened to\nbe playing in one corner of the room, and stood up to eye the\nnew-comer.The open bedroom showed Lester quite plainly lying in bed,\na window to the left of him, his eyes closed."Oh, there you are, old fellow!"Lester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized\nin an instant how things were.He pulled himself up on one elbow, but\nwords failed him."Why, hello, Louise," he finally forced himself to say.I came back sooner than I thought," she answered lamely,\na sense of something wrong irritating her."I had a hard time finding\nyou, too.Who\'s your--" she was about to say "pretty\nhousekeeper," but turned to find Jennie dazedly gathering up certain\narticles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught.His sister swept the place with an observing eye.It took in the\nhome atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive.There was a\ndress of Jennie\'s lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which\ncaused Miss Kane to draw herself up warily.She looked at her brother,\nwho had a rather curious expression in his eyes--he seemed\nslightly nonplussed, but cool and defiant."You shouldn\'t have come out here," said Lester finally, before\nLouise could give vent to the rising question in her mind."You\'re my brother, aren\'t you?Why should you have any place that I\ncouldn\'t come.Well, I like that--and from you to me.""Listen, Louise," went on Lester, drawing himself up further on one\nelbow."You know as much about life as I do.There is no need of our\ngetting into an argument.I didn\'t know you were coming, or I would\nhave made other arrangements.""Other arrangements, indeed," she sneered.She was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this\ntrap; it was really disgraceful of Lester."I wouldn\'t be so haughty about it," he declared, his color rising."I\'m not apologizing to you for my conduct.I\'m saying I would have\nmade other arrangements, which is a very different thing from begging\nyour pardon.If you don\'t want to be civil, you needn\'t.""I thought\nbetter of you, honestly I did.I should think you would be ashamed of\nyourself living here in open--" she paused without using the\nword--"and our friends scattered all over the city.I thought you had more sense of decency and\nconsideration.""I tell you I\'m not apologizing to\nyou.If you don\'t like this you know what you can do."she demanded, savagely and yet\ncuriously.If it were it wouldn\'t make any\ndifference.I wish you wouldn\'t busy yourself about my affairs."Jennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the\nsitting-room, heard the cutting references to herself.I won\'t any more," retorted Louise."I\nshould think, though, that you, of all men, would be above anything\nlike this--and that with a woman so obviously beneath you.Why, I\nthought she was--" she was again going to add "your housekeeper,"\nbut she was interrupted by Lester, who was angry to the point of\nbrutality."Never mind what you thought she was," he growled."She\'s better\nthan some who do the so-called superior thinking.It\'s neither here nor there, I tell you.I\'m doing this, and I\ndon\'t care what you think."Well, I won\'t, I assure you," she flung back."It\'s quite plain\nthat your family means nothing to you.But if you had any sense of\ndecency, Lester Kane, you would never let your sister be trapped into\ncoming into a place like this.I\'m disgusted, that\'s all, and so will\nthe others be when they hear of it."She turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look\nbeing reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door\nof the dining-room.Jennie came in a little\nwhile later and closed the door.Lester,\nhis thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily\non his pillow."What a devilish trick of fortune," he thought.Now she\nwould go home and tell it to the family.His father would know, and\nhis mother.Robert, Imogene, Amy all would hear.He would have no\nexplanation to make--she had seen.Meanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for\nreflection.So this was her real position in another woman\'s eyes.Now\nshe could see what the world thought.This family was as aloof from\nher as if it lived on another planet.To his sisters and brothers, his\nfather and mother, she was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him\nsocially, far beneath him mentally and morally, a creature of the\nstreets.And she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes\nof the world.It cut her as nothing before had ever done.The thought\ntore a great, gaping wound in her sensibilities.She was really low\nand vile in her--Louise\'s--eyes, in the world\'s eyes,\nbasically so in Lester\'s eyes.She went\nabout numb and still, but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it\nall.Oh, if she could only see some way to make herself right with the\nworld, to live honorably, to be decent.How could that possibly be\nbrought about?CHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nOutraged in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to\nCincinnati, where she told the story of her discovery, embellished\nwith many details.According to her, she was met at the door by a\n"silly-looking, white-faced woman," who did not even offer to invite\nher in when she announced her name, but stood there "looking just as\nguilty as a person possibly could."Lester also had acted shamefully,\nhaving outbrazened the matter to her face.When she had demanded to\nknow whose the child was he had refused to tell her."It isn\'t mine,"\nwas all he would say.Kane, who was the first to hear\nthe story.exclaimed Louise emphatically, as though the\nwords needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality."I went there solely because I thought I could help him," continued\nLouise."I thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be\nseriously ill."To think he would come to\nanything like that!"Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having\nno previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old\nArchibald, who came out from the factory and sat through the\ndiscussion with a solemn countenance.So Lester was living openly with\na woman of whom they had never heard.He would probably be as defiant\nand indifferent as his nature was strong.The standpoint of parental\nauthority was impossible.Lester was a centralized authority in\nhimself, and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made,\nthey would have to be very diplomatically executed.Archibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but\ndetermined that something ought to be done.He held a consultation\nwith Robert, who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from\ntime to time, but had not wanted to say anything.Kane suggested\nthat Robert might go to Chicago and have a talk with Lester."He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him\nirreparable damage," said Mr."He cannot hope to carry it off\nsuccessfully.He ought to marry her or he ought to quit.I\nwant you to tell him that for me.""All well and good," said Robert, "but who\'s going to convince him?I\'m sure I don\'t want the job.""I hope to," said old Archibald, "eventually; but you\'d better go\nup and try, anyhow."I don\'t believe it," replied Robert.You see\nhow much good talk does down here.Still, I\'ll go if it will relieve\nyour feelings any."Yes, yes," said his father distractedly, "better go."Without allowing himself to anticipate any\nparticular measure of success in this adventure, he rode pleasantly\ninto Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of\nmorality and justice on his side.Upon Robert\'s arrival, the third morning after Louise\'s interview,\nhe called up the warerooms, but Lester was not there.He then\ntelephoned to the house, and tactfully made an appointment.Lester was\nstill indisposed, but he preferred to come down to the office, and he\ndid.He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way, and together they\ntalked business for a time."Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here," began Robert\ntentatively."I think I could make a guess at it," Lester replied."They were all very much worried over the fact that you were\nsick--mother particularly.You\'re not in any danger of having a\nrelapse, are you?""Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage\nshe ran into up here."The young woman Louise saw is just--" Robert waved his hand\nexpressively."I don\'t want to be inquisitive, Lester.I\'m simply here because the family felt that I ought to come.Mother\nwas so very much distressed that I couldn\'t do less than see you for\nher sake"--he paused, and Lester, touched by the fairness and\nrespect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at least made some\nexplanation due."I don\'t know that anything I can say will help matters much," he\nreplied thoughtfully.I have the\nwoman and the family has its objections.The chief difficulty about\nthe thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out."He stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly\nreasoning in his mind.He seemed, as\nusual, to be most convincingly sane."You\'re not contemplating marrying her, are you?""I hadn\'t come to that," answered Lester coolly.They looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert\nturned his glance to the distant scene of the city."It\'s useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her, I\nsuppose," ventured Robert."I don\'t know whether I\'d be able to discuss that divine afflatus\nwith you or not," returned Lester, with a touch of grim humor."I have\nnever experienced the sensation myself.All I know is that the lady is\nvery pleasing to me.""Well, it\'s all a question of your own well-being and the family\'s,\nLester," went on Robert, after another pause."Morality doesn\'t seem\nto figure in it anyway--at least you and I can\'t discuss that\ntogether.John moved to the office.Your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone.But the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be\nsubstantial enough ground to base a plea on.The family\'s feelings and\npride are also fairly important.Father\'s the kind of a man who sets\nmore store by the honor of his family than most men.You know that as\nwell as I do, of course.""I know how father feels about it," returned Lester."The whole\nbusiness is as clear to me as it is to any of you, though off-hand I\ndon\'t see just what\'s to be done about it.These matters aren\'t always\nof a day\'s growth, and they can\'t be settled in a day.To a certain extent I\'m responsible that she is here.While I\'m\nnot willing to go into details, there\'s always more in these affairs\nthan appears on the court calendar.""Of course I don\'t know what your relations with her have been,"\nreturned Robert, "and I\'m not curious to know, but it does look like a\nbit of injustice all around, don\'t you think--unless you intend\nto marry her?"This last was put forth as a feeler."I might be willing to agree to that, too," was Lester\'s baffling\nreply, "if anything were to be gained by it.The point is, the woman\nis here, and the family is in possession of the fact.Now if there is\nanything to be done I have to do it.There isn\'t anybody else who can\nact for me in this matter."Lester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor,\ncoming back after a time to say: "You say you haven\'t any idea of\nmarrying her--or rather you haven\'t come to it.It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life,\nfrom every point of view.I don\'t want to orate, but a man of your\nposition has so much to lose; you can\'t afford to do it.Aside from\nfamily considerations, you have too much at stake.You\'d be simply\nthrowing your life away--"\n\nHe paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was\ncustomary when he was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor\nand simplicity of this appeal.He\nwas making an appeal to him, and this was somewhat different.The appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began\non a new tack, this time picturing old Archibald\'s fondness for Lester\nand the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some\nwell-to-do Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at\nleast worthy of his station.Kane felt the same way; surely\nLester must realize that."I know just how all of them feel about it," Lester interrupted at\nlast, "but I don\'t see that anything\'s to be done right now.""You mean that you don\'t think it would be policy for you to give\nher up just at present?""I mean that she\'s been exceptionally good to me, and that I\'m\nmorally under obligations to do the best I can by her.What that may\nbe, I can\'t tell.""Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been\naccustomed to live with me," replied Lester.Robert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal\nfutile."Can\'t family reasons persuade you to make some amicable\narrangements with her and let her go?""Not without due consideration of the matter; no.""You don\'t think you could hold out some hope that the thing will\nend quickly--something that would give me a reasonable excuse for\nsoftening down the pain of it to the family?""I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away\nthe edge of this thing for the family, but the truth\'s the truth, and\nI can\'t see any room for equivocation between you and me.As I\'ve said\nbefore, these relationships are involved with things which make it\nimpossible to discuss them--unfair to me, unfair to the woman.No\none can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in\nthem, and even they can\'t always see.I\'d be a damned dog to stand up\nhere and give you my word to do anything except the best I can."Lester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only\nto come back after a time and say, "You don\'t think there\'s anything\nto be done just at present?""Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going.I don\'t know\nthat there\'s anything else we can talk about.""Won\'t you stay and take lunch with me?I think I might manage to\nget down to the hotel if you\'ll stay.""I believe I can make that one\no\'clock train for Cincinnati.They stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid,\nRobert clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the\ndifference time had already made.Robert was the clean, decisive man,\nLester the man of doubts.Robert was the spirit of business energy and\nintegrity embodied, Lester the spirit of commercial self-sufficiency,\nlooking at life with an uncertain eye.Together they made a striking\npicture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were\nnow running through their minds."Well," said the older brother, after a time, "I don\'t suppose\nthere is anything more I can say.I had hoped to make you feel just as\nwe do about this thing, but of course you are your own best judge of\nthis.If you don\'t see it now, nothing I could say would make you.It\nstrikes me as a very bad move on your part though."He said nothing, but his face expressed an\nunchanged purpose.Robert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door\ntogether."I\'ll put the best face I can on it," said Robert, and walked\nout.CHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nIn this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be\nlimited to a plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to\nthe creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about\nthe sun.A fish, for instance, may not pass out of the circle of the\nseas without courting annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of\nthe fishes without paying for it dearly.From the parasites of the\nflowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the\ncircumscribed nature of their movements--the emphatic manner in\nwhich life has limited them to a sphere; and we are content to note\nthe ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on\ntheir part to depart from their environment.In the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of\nlimitations has not as yet been so clearly observed.The laws\ngoverning our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit\nof a clear generalization.Still, the opinions, pleas, and judgments\nof society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being\nintangible.When men or women err--that is, pass out from the\nsphere in which they are accustomed to move--it is not as if the\nbird had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the\nhaunts of man.People may do\nno more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh\nsarcastically, lift up their hands in protest.And yet so well defined\nis the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is\ndoomed.Born and bred in this environment, the individual is\npractically unfitted for any other state.He is like a bird accustomed\nto a certain density of atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably\nat either higher or lower level.Lester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother\nhad gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city.Yonder\nwas spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy,\nhope, prosperity, and pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a\nwind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being--his\nprospects and purposes dissipated.Could he continue as cheerily in\nthe paths he had hitherto pursued?Would not his relations with Jennie\nbe necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition?Was not his\nown home now a thing of the past so far as his old easy-going\nrelationship was concerned?All the atmosphere of unstained affection\nwould be gone out of it now.That hearty look of approval which used\nto dwell in his father\'s eye--would it be there any longer?Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part\nof his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of\nLouise."It\'s unfortunate," was all that he thought to himself, and\ntherewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the\nconsideration of what, if anything, was to be done."I\'m thinking I\'d take a run up to Mt.Clemens to-morrow, or\nThursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough," he said to Jennie after he\nhad returned."I\'m not feeling as well as I might.He wanted to get off by himself and think.Jennie packed his\nbag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a\nsullen, meditative mood.During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all\nover, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of\nmaking a decisive move at present.A few weeks more, one way or the\nother, could not make any practical difference.Neither Robert nor any\nother member of the family was at all likely to seek another\nconference with him.His business relations would necessarily go on as\nusual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;\ncertainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted.But the\nconsciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed\nupon him."Bad business," he meditated--"bad business."For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs\ncontinued.Lester did not go home for six months; then an important\nbusiness conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it\noff quite as though nothing important had happened.His mother kissed\nhim affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his\ncustomary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,\nconcertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore\nthe one real issue.But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it\npersisted.Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far\nbetween as he could possibly make them.CHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nIn the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her\nown.For the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude,\nwhich had afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought\nof her.She had yielded on two\noccasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought\nout differently.If she did not\nalways have this haunting sense of fear!If she could only make up her\nmind to do the right thing!She loved him, but she could leave him, and it would be better for\nhim.Probably her father would live with her if she went back to\nCleveland.He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand.Yet\nthe thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to her--he had\nbeen so good.As for her father, she was not sure whether he would\nreceive her or not.After the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a\nlittle money, laying it aside as best she could from her allowance.Lester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly\nfifteen dollars a week to maintain the family--as much as they\nhad lived on before, without any help from the outside.She spent\ntwenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of\neverything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not.The\nrent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone.She\nthought how she might economize but this seemed wrong.Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the\nthought that came to her.She thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise,\ntrying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act.Lester was consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that\nhe himself might wish it.Since the\nscene with Louise it seemed to her that he had been a little\ndifferent.If she could only say to him that she was not satisfied\nwith the way she was living, and then leave.But he himself had\nplainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her feelings on\nthat score could not matter so very much to him, since he thought the\npresence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever\nmarrying her.It was her presence he wanted on another basis.And he\nwas so forceful, she could not argue with him very well.She decided\nif she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why.Then\nmaybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing\nmore about it.The condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving.Since\nJennie had left Martha had married.After several years of teaching in\nthe public schools of Cleveland she had met a young architect, and\nthey were united after a short engagement.Martha had been always a\nlittle ashamed of her family, and now, when this new life dawned, she\nwas anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible.She barely\nnotified the members of the family of the approaching\nmarriage--Jennie not at all--and to the actual ceremony she\ninvited only Bass and George.Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented\nthe slight.She hoped that life would give her an\nopportunity to pay her sister off.William, of course, did not mind\nparticularly.He was interested in the possibilities of becoming an\nelectrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had\npointed out to him as being attractive and promising.Jennie heard of Martha\'s marriage after it was all over, a note\nfrom Veronica giving her the main details.She was glad from one point\nof view, but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away\nfrom her.A little while after Martha\'s marriage Veronica and William went to\nreside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of\nGerhardt himself.Ever since his wife\'s death and the departure of the\nother children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from\nwhich he was not easily aroused.Life, it seemed, was drawing to a\nclose for him, although he was only sixty-five years of age.The\nearthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever.He saw\nSebastian, Martha, and George out in the world practically ignoring\nhim, contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have\ntaken a dollar from Jennie.They\nobjected to leaving school and going to work, apparently preferring to\nlive on money which Gerhardt had long since concluded was not being\ncome by honestly.He was now pretty well satisfied as to the true\nrelations of Jennie and Lester.At first he had believed them to be\nmarried, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the\nhumbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of\ntelling him about Vesta--somehow it all pointed to the same\nthing.Gerhardt had never had sight\nof her marriage certificate.Since she was away she might have been\nmarried, but he did not believe it.The real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and\ncrotchety, and it was becoming impossible for young people to live\nwith him.They resented the way in which\nhe took charge of the expenditures after Martha left.He accused them\nof spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a\nsmaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of\nthe money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess.As a matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order\nto repay Jennie eventually.He thought it was sinful to go on in this\nway, and this was his one method, out side of his meager earnings, to\nredeem himself.If his other children had acted rightly by him he felt\nthat he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity\nfrom one, who, despite her other good qualities, was certainly not\nleading a righteous life.It ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his\ncomplaining brother and sister on condition that they should get\nsomething to do.Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited\nthem to take the furniture and go their way.His generosity shamed\nthem for the moment; they even tentatively invited him to come and\nlive with them, but this he would not do.He would ask the foreman of\nthe mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some\nout-of-the-way garret.And this would\nsave him a little money.So in a fit of pique he did this, and there was seen the spectacle\nof an old man watching through a dreary season of nights, in a lonely\ntrafficless neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere.He had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from\nthe tear and grind of the factory proper.In the afternoon he would take a little walk, strolling toward the\nbusiness center, or out along the banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake.As a rule his hands were below his back, his brow bent in meditation.He would even talk to himself a little--an occasional "By chops!"or "So it is" being indicative of his dreary mood.At dusk he would\nreturn, taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of\nduty.His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen\'s boarding-house,\nsuch as he felt he must have.The nature of the old German\'s reflections at this time were of a\npeculiarly subtle and somber character.What did it all come to after the struggle, and the\nworry, and the grieving?People die; you hear\nnothing more from them.Yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions.He\nbelieved there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there.He believed that both had\nsinned woefully.He believed that the just would be rewarded in\nheaven.Sebastian\nwas a good boy, but he was cold, and certainly indifferent to his\nfather.Take Martha--she was ambitious, but obviously selfish.Somehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed self-centered.Bass\nwalked off when he got married, and did nothing more for anybody.Martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on.George had\ncontributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.Veronica and William had been content to live on Jennie\'s money so\nlong as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right.His\nvery existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his\nchildren?Life was truly strange, and dark, and uncertain.Still he\ndid not want to go and live with any of his children.Actually they\nwere not worthy of him--none but Jennie, and she was not good.This woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for\nsome time.She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her\nleaving, Jennie had been writing directly to Gerhardt.After\nVeronica\'s departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was no\nneed of sending any more money.Veronica and William were going to\nlive with George.He himself had a good place in a factory, and would\nlive there a little while.He returned her a moderate sum that he had\nsaved--one hundred and fifteen dollars--with the word that\nhe would not need it.Jennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was\nnot sure but what it might be all right--her father was so\ndetermined.But by degrees, however, a sense of what it really must\nmean overtook her--a sense of something wrong, and she worried,\nhesitating between leaving Lester and going to see about her father,\nwhether she left him or not.Yet if she did not get some work which paid well\nthey would have a difficult time.If she could get five\nor six dollars a week they could live.This hundred and fifteen\ndollars which Gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst\ndifficulties perhaps.CHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nThe trouble with Jennie\'s plan was that it did not definitely take\ninto consideration Lester\'s attitude.He did care for her in an\nelemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the\nconventional world in which he had been reared.To say that he loved\nher well enough to take her for better or worse--to legalize her\nanomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he\nhad chosen a wife who suited him--was perhaps going a little too\nfar, but he did really care for her, and he was not in a mood, at this\nparticular time, to contemplate parting with her for good.Lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of\nwomanhood were fixed and not subject to change.Thus far, on his own\nplane and within the circle of his own associates, he had met no one\nwho appealed to him as did Jennie.She was gentle, intelligent,\ngracious, a handmaiden to his every need; and he had taught her the\nlittle customs of polite society, until she was as agreeable a\ncompanion as he cared to have.He was comfortable, he was\nsatisfied--why seek further?But Jennie\'s restlessness increased day by day.She tried writing\nout her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally\nworded one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings.It was a long letter for her, and it ran as follows:\n\n"Lester dear, When you get this I won\'t be here, and I want you\nnot to think harshly of me until you have read it all.I am taking\nVesta and leaving, and I think it is really better that I should.You know when you met me we were very poor,\nand my condition was such that I didn\'t think any good man would ever\nwant me.When you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly\nable to think just what I ought to do.You made me love you, Lester,\nin spite of myself."You know I told you that I oughtn\'t to do anything wrong any more\nand that I wasn\'t good, but somehow when you were near me I couldn\'t\nthink just right, and I didn\'t see just how I was to get away from\nyou.Papa was sick at home that time, and there was hardly anything in\nthe house to eat.My brother George\ndidn\'t have good shoes, and mamma was so worried.I have often\nthought, Lester, if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she\nmight be alive to-day.I thought if you liked me and I really liked\nyou--I love you, Lester--maybe it wouldn\'t make so much\ndifference about me.You know you told me right away you would like to\nhelp my family, and I felt that maybe that would be the right thing to\ndo."Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way; it seems so mean,\nbut if you knew how I have been feeling these days you would forgive\nme.Oh, I love you, Lester, I do, I do.But for months past--ever\nsince your sister came--I felt that I was doing wrong, and that I\noughtn\'t to go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is.It\nwas wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator Brander, but\nI was such a girl then--I hardly knew what I was doing.It was\nwrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I first met you, though I\nthought I was doing right when I did it.It was terribly wrong of me\nto keep her here all that time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of\nyou then--afraid of what you would say and do.When your sister\nLouise came it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never\nbeen able to think right about it since.It can\'t be right, Lester,\nbut I don\'t blame you."I don\'t ask you to marry me, Lester.I know how you feel about me\nand how you feel about your family, and I don\'t think it would be\nright.They would never want you to do it, and it isn\'t right that I\nshould ask you.At the same time I know I oughtn\'t to go on living\nthis way.Vesta is getting along where she understands everything.She\nthinks you are her really truly uncle.I have thought of it all so\nmuch.I have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to you\nabout it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and I don\'t seem\nto be able to say what I want to.So I thought if I could just write\nyou this and then go you would understand.I know it\'s for the best for you and for\nme.Please forgive me, Lester, please; and don\'t\nthink of me any more.But I love you--oh yes, I\ndo--and I will never be grateful enough for all you have done for\nme.I wish you all the luck that can come to you."P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa.It\'s best that you\nshouldn\'t."She put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in\nher bosom, for the time being, awaited the hour when she could\nconveniently take her departure.It was several days before she could bring herself to the actual\nexecution of the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned\nthat he would not be home for a day or two, she packed some necessary\ngarments for herself and Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an\nexpressman.She thought of telegraphing her father that she was\ncoming; but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as\nwell to go and find him.George and Veronica had not taken all the\nfurniture.The major portion of it was in storage--so Gerhard t\nhad written.She might take that and furnish a little home or flat.Sandra went to the bathroom.She was ready for the end, waiting for the expressman, when the door\nopened and in walked Lester.For some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind.He was not in\nthe least psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings\nhad served him a peculiar turn.He had thought of going for a day\'s\nduck-shooting with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of\nChicago, but had finally changed his mind; he even decided to go out\nto the house early.As he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home\nso early; then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle\nof the room he stood dumfounded.What did it mean--Jennie dressed\nand ready to depart?He stared in\namazement, his brown eyes keen in inquiry."Why--why--" she began, falling back."I thought I would go to Cleveland," she replied."Why--why--I meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn\'t\nthink I ought to stay here any longer this way.I thought I\'d tell you, but I couldn\'t."What the deuce are you talking about?"There," she said, mechanically pointing to a small center-table\nwhere the letter lay conspicuous on a large book."And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a\nletter?"said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke."I\nswear to heaven you are beyond me.He tore open the\nenvelope and looked at the beginning."Better send Vesta from the\nroom," he suggested.Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed,\nlooking at the wall, at the trunks, and at him.He shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the\npaper on the floor."Well, I\'ll tell you, Jennie," he said finally, looking at her\ncuriously and wondering just what he was going to say.Here again was\nhis chance to end this relationship if he wished.He couldn\'t feel\nthat he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things were running.They\nhad gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now.He truly\nloved her--there was no doubt of that.Still he did not want to\nmarry her--could not very well."You have this thing wrong," he went on slowly."I don\'t know\nwhat comes over you at times, but you don\'t view the situation right.I\'ve told you before that I can\'t marry you--not now, anyhow.There are too many big things involved in this, which you don\'t know\nanything about.But my family has to be\ntaken into consideration, and the business.You can\'t see the\ndifficulties raised on these scores, but I can.Now I don\'t want you\nto leave me.I can\'t prevent you, of\ncourse.But I don\'t think you ought to want\nto.Jennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen,\nwas now thoroughly nonplussed.To have him begin a quiet\nargument--a plea as it were.He, Lester, pleading\nwith her, and she loved him so.She went over to him, and he took her hand."There\'s really nothing to be gained by\nyour leaving me at present."Well, how did you expect to get along?""I thought I\'d take papa, if he\'d come with me--he\'s alone\nnow--and get something to do, maybe.""Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have\ndone?You wouldn\'t expect to be a lady\'s maid again, would you?"I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper," she suggested.She had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most\npromising idea that had occurred to her."No, no," he grumbled, shaking his head.There\'s nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion.Why, you\nwon\'t be any better off morally than you are right now.It doesn\'t make any difference, anyhow.I might in the future, but I can\'t tell anything about that, and\nI don\'t want to promise anything.You\'re not going to leave me though\nwith my consent, and if you were going I wouldn\'t have you dropping\nback into any such thing as you\'re contemplating.I\'ll make some\nprovision for you.You don\'t really want to leave me, do you,\nJennie?"Against Lester\'s strong personality and vigorous protest Jennie\'s\nown conclusions and decisions went to pieces.Just the pressure of his\nhand was enough to upset her."Don\'t cry, Jennie," he said."This thing may work out better than\nyou think.You\'re not\ngoing to leave me any more, are you?""Let things rest as they are," he went on.I\'m putting up with some things myself that I ordinarily\nwouldn\'t stand for."He finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly\nthrough her tears."Now you put those things away," he said genially, pointing to the\ntrunks."Besides, I want you to promise me one thing.""No more concealment of anything, do you hear?No more thinking\nthings out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about\nit.If you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it.I\'ll help you solve it, or, if I can\'t, at least there won\'t be any\nconcealment between us.""I know, Lester," she said earnestly, looking him straight in the\neyes."I promise I\'ll never conceal anything any more--truly I\nwon\'t.I\'ve been afraid, but I won\'t be now."That sounds like what you ought to be," he replied.A few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future\nof Gerhardt came up for discussion.Jennie had been worrying about him\nfor several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to\ntalk over with Lester.Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner\nwhat had happened in Cleveland."I know he is very unhappy there all\nalone," she said, "and I hate to think of it.I was going to get him\nif I went back to Cleveland.Now I don\'t know what to do about\nit.""Why don\'t you send him some money?""He won\'t take any more money from me, Lester," she explained."He\nthinks I\'m not good--not acting right."He has pretty good reason, hasn\'t he?""I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory.He\'s so old and\nlonely.""What\'s the matter with the rest of the family in Cleveland?Won\'t\nthey do anything for him?"I think maybe they don\'t want him, he\'s so cross," she said\nsimply."I hardly know what to suggest in that case," smiled Lester."The\nold gentleman oughtn\'t to be so fussy.""I know," she said, "but he\'s old now, and he has had so much\ntrouble."Lester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork."I\'ll tell you\nwhat I\'ve been thinking, Jennie," he said finally."There\'s no use\nliving this way any longer, if we\'re going to stick it out.I\'ve been\nthinking that we might take a house out in Hyde Park.It\'s something\nof a run from the office, but I\'m not much for this apartment life.You and Vesta would be better off for a yard.In that case you might\nbring your father on to live with us.He couldn\'t do any harm\npottering about; indeed, he might help keep things straight.""Oh, that would just suit papa, if he\'d come," she replied."He\nloves to fix things, and he\'d cut the grass and look after the\nfurnace.But he won\'t come unless he\'s sure I\'m married.""I don\'t know how that could be arranged unless you could show the\nold gentleman a marriage certificate.He seems to want something that\ncan\'t be produced very well.A steady job he\'d have running the\nfurnace of a country house," he added meditatively.Jennie did not notice the grimness of the jest.She was too busy\nthinking what a tangle she had made of her life.Gerhardt would not\ncome now, even if they had a lovely home to share with him.And yet he\nought to be with Vesta again.She remained lost in a sad abstraction, until Lester, following the\ndrift of her thoughts, said: "I don\'t see how it can be arranged.Marriage certificate blanks aren\'t easily procurable.It\'s bad\nbusiness--a criminal offense to forge one, I believe.I wouldn\'t\nwant to be mixed up in that sort of thing.""Oh, I don\'t want you to do anything like that, Lester.I\'m just\nsorry papa is so stubborn.When he gets a notion you can\'t change\nhim.""Suppose we wait until we get settled after moving," he suggested."Then you can go to Cleveland and talk to him personally.It was\nso decent that he rather wished he could help her carry out her\nscheme.While not very interesting, Gerhardt was not objectionable to\nLester, and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around a big\nplace, why not?CHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nThe plan for a residence in Hyde Park was not long in taking shape.After several weeks had passed, and things had quieted down again,\nLester invited Jennie to go with him to South Hyde Park to look for a\nhouse.On the first trip they found something which seemed to suit\nadmirably--an old-time home of eleven large rooms, set in a lawn\nfully two hundred feet square and shaded by trees which had been\nplanted when the city was young.It was ornate, homelike, peaceful.Jennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country, although\ndepressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home\nunder the right auspices.She had vaguely hoped that in planning to go\naway she was bringing about a condition under which Lester might have\ncome after her and married her.She had\npromised to stay, and she would have to make the best of it.She\nsuggested that they would never know what to do with so much room, but\nhe waved that aside."We will very likely have people in now and\nthen," he said."We can furnish it up anyhow, and see how it looks."He had the agent make out a five-year lease, with an option for\nrenewal, and set at once the forces to work to put the establishment\nin order.The house was painted and decorated, the lawn put in order, and\neverything done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance.There was a large, comfortable library and sitting-room, a big\ndining-room, a handsome reception-hall, a parlor, a large kitchen,\nserving-room, and in fact all the ground-floor essentials of a\ncomfortable home.On the second floor were bedrooms, baths, and the\nmaid\'s room.It was all very comfortable and harmonious, and Jennie\ntook an immense pride and pleasure in getting things in order.Immediately after moving in, Jennie, with Lester\'s permission,\nwrote to her father asking him to come to her.She did not say that\nshe was married, but left it to be inferred.She descanted on the\nbeauty of the neighborhood, the size of the yard, and the manifold\nconveniences of the establishment."It is so very nice," she added,\n"you would like it, papa.Vesta is here and goes to school every day.Won\'t you come and stay with us?It\'s so much better than living in a\nfactory.Gerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance, Was it really\ntrue?Would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently\nunited?Well, it was high time--but should he go?He had lived\nalone this long time now--should he go to Chicago and live with\nJennie?Her appeal did touch him, but somehow he decided against it.That would be too generous an acknowledgment of the fact that there\nhad been fault on his side as well as on hers.Jennie was disappointed at Gerhardt\'s refusal.She talked it over\nwith Lester, and decided that she would go on to Cleveland and see\nhim.Accordingly, she made the trip, hunted up the factory, a great\nrumbling furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city,\nand inquired at the office for her father.The clerk directed her to a\ndistant warehouse, and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see\nhim.He crawled out of his humble cot and came down, curious as to who\nit could be.When Jennie saw him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair\ngray, his eye brows shaggy, coming out of the dark door, a keen sense\nof the pathetic moved her again.He came\ntoward her, his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his\nconsciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit."I want you to come home with me, papa," she pleaded yearningly."I\ndon\'t want you to stay here any more.I can\'t think of you living\nalone any longer.""So," he said, nonplussed, "that brings you?""Yes," she replied; "Won\'t you?"I have a good bed," he explained by way of apology for his\nstate."I know," she replied, "but we have a good home now and Vesta is\nthere."Yes," she replied, lying hopelessly."I have been married a long\ntime.She could scarcely look him\nin the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her."Well," he said, "it is time.""Won\'t you come, papa?"He threw out his hands after his characteristic manner.The urgency\nof her appeal touched him to the quick."Yes, I come," he said, and\nturned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening.For answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his\nthings.CHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\nGerhardt, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once\nbestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively\nconcerned him.He took charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at\nthe thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had\nnothing to do.The trees, he declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful\ncondition.If Lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would\nattend to them in the spring.In Germany they knew how to care for\nsuch things, but these Americans were so shiftless.Then he wanted\ntools and nails, and in time all the closets and shelves were put in\norder.He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away, and declared\nthat it was better than the one in Cleveland.The pastor, of course,\nwas a heaven-sent son of divinity.And nothing would do but that Vesta\nmust go to church with him regularly.Jennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with\nsome misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise.On the North\nSide it had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing.Now they were occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate\nneighbors would feel it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to\nplay the part of an experienced hostess.She and Lester had talked\nthis situation over.It might as well be understood here, he said,\nthat they were husband and wife.Vesta was to be introduced as\nJennie\'s daughter by her first marriage, her husband, a Mr.Stover\n(her mother\'s maiden name), having died immediately after the child\'s\nbirth.Lester, of course, was the stepfather.This particular\nneighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of Chicago that\nLester did not expect to run into many of his friends.He explained to\nJennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so that when\nthe first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.Within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs.Jacob Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular\nsection.She lived five doors from Jennie--the houses of the\nneighborhood were all set in spacious lawns--and drove up in her\ncarriage, on her return from her shopping, one afternoon.she asked of Jeannette, the new maid."I think so, mam," answered the girl."Won\'t you let me have your\ncard?"The card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it\ncuriously.When Jennie came into the parlor Mrs.Stendahl, a tall dark,\ninquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially."I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you," she said\nmost winningly.I live on the other side\nof the street, some few doors up.Perhaps you have seen the\nhouse--the one with the white stone gate-posts.""Oh, yes indeed," replied Jennie.Kane and I\nwere admiring it the first day we came out here.""I know of your husband, of course, by reputation.My husband is\nconnected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company."She knew that the latter concern must be\nsomething important and profitable from the way in which Mrs."We have lived here quite a number of years, and I know how you\nmust feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city.I\nhope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon."Indeed I shall," answered Jennie, a little nervously, for the\nordeal was a trying one.Kane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure he would\nbe most pleased to meet you and your husband.""You must both come over some evening," replied Mrs.Jennie smiled her assurances of good-will.Stendahl to the door, and shook hands with her."I\'m so glad to find\nyou so charming," observed Mrs."Oh, thank you," said Jennie flushing a little."I\'m sure I don\'t\ndeserve so much praise.""Well, now I will expect you some afternoon.Good-by," and she\nwaved a gracious farewell."That wasn\'t so bad," thought Jennie as she watched Mrs.Timothy Ballinger--all of whom left\ncards, or stayed to chat a few minutes.Jennie found herself taken\nquite seriously as a woman of importance, and she did her best to\nsupport the dignity of her position.And, indeed, she did\nexceptionally well.She had a\nkindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded in making a\nmost favorable impression.She explained to her guests that she had\nbeen living on the North Side until recently, that her husband,\nMr.Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park, that her father\nand daughter were living here, and that Lester was the child\'s\nstepfather.She said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and\nto be a good neighbor.Lester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care\nto meet these people.Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way.She liked\nmaking new friends, and she was hoping that something definite could\nbe worked out here which would make Lester look upon her as a good\nwife and an ideal companion.Perhaps, some day, he might really want\nto marry her.First impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to\ndiscover.The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too\nhastily, and now rumors began to fly about.Sommerville,\ncalling on Mrs.Craig, one of Jennie\'s near neighbors, intimated that\nshe knew who Lester was--"oh, yes, indeed.You know, my dear,"\nshe went on, "his reputation is just a little--" she raised her\neyebrows and her hand at the same time."He looks like\nsuch a staid, conservative person.""Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is," went on Mrs."His\nfamily is of the very best.There was some young woman he went\nwith--so my husband tells me.I don\'t know whether this is the\none or not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such\nname as that, when they were living together as husband and wife on\nthe North Side."Craig with her tongue at this\nastonishing news.Come to think of it, it must be\nthe same woman.It\nseems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with\nher--at least there was a child.Whether he married her afterward\nor not, I don\'t know.Anyhow, I understand his family will not have\nanything to do with her.""And to think he\nshould have married her afterward, if he really did.I\'m sure you\ncan\'t tell with whom you\'re coming in contact these days, can\nyou?""Well, it may be," went on her guest, "that this isn\'t the same\nwoman after all.She told me they had been living\non the North Side.""Then I\'m sure it\'s the same person.How curious that you should\nspeak of her!""It is, indeed," went on Mrs.Craig, who was speculating as to what\nher attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.There were people who had\nseen Jennie and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been\nintroduced to her as Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family\nthought.Of course her present position, the handsome house, the\nwealth of Lester, the beauty of Vesta--all these things helped to\nsoften the situation.She was apparently too circumspect, too much the\ngood wife and mother, too really nice to be angry with; but she had a\npast, and that had to be taken into consideration.An opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when\nVesta, returning from school, suddenly asked: "Mamma, who was my\npapa?""His name was Stover, dear," replied her mother, struck at once by\nthe thought that there might have been some criticism--that some\none must have been saying something.continued Vesta, ignoring the last inquiry, and\ninterested in clearing up her own identity."Anita Ballinger said I didn\'t have any papa, and that you weren\'t\never married when you had me.She said I wasn\'t a really, truly girl\nat all--just a nobody.Ballinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious\nand helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter\nhad said this to Vesta."You mustn\'t pay any attention to her, dearie," said Jennie at\nlast.Stover, and you were born\nin Columbus.Of course they say\nnasty things when they fight--sometimes things they don\'t really\nmean.Just let her alone and don\'t go near her any more.Then she\nwon\'t say anything to you."It was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time\nbeing."I\'ll slap her if she tries to slap me," she persisted."You mustn\'t go near her, pet, do you hear?Then she can\'t try to\nslap you," returned her mother."Just go about your studies, and don\'t\nmind her.She can\'t quarrel with you if you don\'t let her."Vesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words.It is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound\nopened from time to time by additional stabs.One day Jennie, having\ngone to call on Mrs.Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met\na Mrs.Williston Baker, who was there taking tea.Baker knew of\nthe Kanes, of Jennie\'s history on the North Side, and of the attitude\nof the Kane family.She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman,\nsomewhat on the order of Mrs.Bracebridge, and very careful of her\nsocial connections.Field a woman of\nthe same rigid circumspectness of attitude, and when she found Jennie\ncalling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated.Field, introducing her guests with a\nsmiling countenance."Indeed," she went on freezingly."I\'ve heard a great deal about\nMrs.--" accenting the word "Mrs.--Lester Kane."Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started\nan intimate conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share.Jennie stood helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would\nbe suitable to so trying a situation.Baker soon announced her\ndeparture, although she had intended to stay longer."I can\'t remain\nanother minute," she said; "I promised Mrs.Neil that I would stop in\nto see her to-day.I\'m sure I\'ve bored you enough already as it\nis."She walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she\nwas nearly out of the room.Then she looked in her direction, and gave\nher a frigid nod."We meet such curious people now and again," she observed finally\nto her hostess as she swept away.Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was\nin no notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other\nmiddle-class woman of means, to get along.Williston Baker, who was socially so much more important than\nJennie.She came back to where Jennie was sitting, smiling\napologetically, but she was a little bit flustered.Jennie was out of\ncountenance, of course.Presently she excused herself and went home.She had been cut deeply by the slight offered her, and she felt that\nMrs.Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up.There would be no additional exchange of visits there--that she\nknew.The old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a\nfailure.It couldn\'t be made right, or, if it could, it wouldn\'t be.Lester was not inclined to marry her and put her right.Time went on and matters remained very much as they were.To look\nat this large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its\nvines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing\nthemselves into a transparent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering\nabout the yard, Vesta coming home from school, Lester leaving in the\nmorning in his smart trap--one would have said that here is peace\nand plenty, no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming\nhome.And as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run\nsmoothly.It is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only\na very few of them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the\ndeprivation was hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to\nplease and interest.Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play\nquite well.Jennie was a charming figure\nin blue, lavender, and olive-green house-gowns as she went about her\naffairs, sewing, dusting, getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that\nthings generally were put to rights.Gerhardt busied himself about his\nmultitudinous duties, for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands\ninto all the domestic economies of the household.One of his\nself-imposed tasks was to go about the house after Lester, or the\nservants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs which might\naccidentally have been left burning.Again, Lester\'s expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside\nafter a few month\'s use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old\nGerman.Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of\na few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole.Gerhardt was for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old\nman\'s querulous inquiry as to what was wrong "with them shoes" by\nsaying that they weren\'t comfortable any more.No\ngood can come of anything like that, It will mean want one of these\ndays.""He can\'t help it, papa," Jennie excused."That\'s the way he was\nraised."These Americans, they know nothing of\neconomy.Then they would know\nwhat a dollar can do."Lester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled.Another grievance was Lester\'s extravagant use of matches.He had\nthe habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of\nlighting his cigar, and then throwing it away.Sometimes he would\nbegin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually\ndo so, tossing aside match after match.There was a place out in one\ncorner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer\nevening, smoking and throwing away half-burned matches.Jennie would\nsit with him, and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out\non the lawn.At one time, while engaged in cutting the grass, Gerhardt\nfound, to his horror, not a handful, but literally boxes of\nhalf-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the\nfallen blades.He gathered up\nthis damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the\nsitting-room where Jennie was sewing.That man,\nhe has no more sense of economy than a--than a--" the right\nterm failed him."He sits and smokes, and this is the way he uses\nmatches.Five cents a box they cost--five cents.How can a man\nhope to do well and carry on like that, I like to know."Lester is extravagant," she\nsaid.At least they should be\nburned in the furnace.He would have used them as lighters for his own\npipe, sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers\nwere better, and he had stacks of these--another evidence of his\nlord and master\'s wretched, spendthrift disposition.It was a sad\nworld to work in.Still he fought\nas valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance.He would wear the same suit of\nblack--cut down from one of Lester\'s expensive investments of\nyears before--every Sunday for a couple of years.Lester\'s shoes,\nby a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit,\nand these he wore.His old ties also--the black ones--they\nwere fine.If he could have cut down Lester\'s shirts he would have\ndone so; he did make over the underwear, with the friendly aid of the\ncook\'s needle.Lester\'s socks, of course, were just right.There was\nnever any expense for Gerhardt\'s clothing.The remaining stock of Lester\'s discarded clothing--shoes,\nshirts, collars, suits, ties, and what not--he would store away\nfor weeks and months, and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he\nwould call in a tailor, or an old-shoe man, or a ragman, and dispose\nof the lot at the best price he could.He learned that all second-hand\nclothes men were sharks; that there was no use in putting the least\nfaith in the protests of any rag dealer or old-shoe man.They all claimed to be very poor, when as a matter of fact they\nwere actually rolling in wealth.Gerhardt had investigated these\nstories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they were doing\nwith the things he sold them."They offer me ten cents for a pair of\nshoes, and then I see them hanging out in front of their places marked\ntwo dollars.They could afford to give me a\ndollar."It was only to her that he complained, for he could\nexpect no sympathy from\' Lester.So far as his own meager store of\nmoney was concerned, he gave the most of it to his beloved church,\nwhere he was considered to be a model of propriety, honesty,\nfaith--in fact, the embodiment of all the virtues.And so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially,\nJennie was now leading the dream years of her existence.Lester, in\nspite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of\nhis career, was invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to\nenjoy his home life.she would ask when he came in of an\nevening.he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.She would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take\nhis coat and hat.In the winter-time they would sit in the library\nbefore the big grate-fire.In the spring, summer, or fall Lester\npreferred to walk out on the porch, one corner of which commanded a\nsweeping view of the lawn and the distant street, and light his\nbefore-dinner cigar.Jennie would sit on the side of his chair and\nstroke his head."Your hair is not getting the least bit thin, Lester;\naren\'t you glad?"she would say; or, "Oh, see how your brow is\nwrinkled now.You didn\'t change your tie, mister,\nthis morning."Oh, I forgot," he would answer, or he would cause the wrinkles to\ndisappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if\nhe wasn\'t so now.In the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was\nnot less loving, though a little more circumspect.She loved odd\npuzzles like pigs in clover, the spider\'s hole, baby billiards, and\nthe like.He would work by\nthe hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right.Jennie\nwas clever at solving these mechanical problems.Sometimes she would\nhave to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely\npleased with herself.At other times she would stand behind him\nwatching, her chin on his shoulder, her arms about his neck.He seemed\nnot to mind--indeed, he was happy in the wealth of affection she\nbestowed.Her cleverness, her gentleness, her tact created an\natmosphere which was immensely pleasing; above all her youth and\nbeauty appealed to him.It made him feel young, and if there was one\nthing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up into an\naimless old age."I want to keep young, or die young," was one of his\npet remarks; and Jennie came to understand.She was glad that she was\nso much younger now for his sake.Another pleasant feature of the home life was Lester\'s steadily\nincreasing affection for Vesta.The child would sit at the big table\nin the library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would\nsew, and Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran\npapers.It grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go\nto a German Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to\nnothing of the sort."We\'ll not have any thick-headed German training\nin this," he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had\ncomplained."The public schools are good enough for any child.There were really some delightful hours among the four.Lester\nliked to take the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees\nand tease her.He liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to\npropound its paradoxes, and watch how the child\'s budding mind took\nthem.he would ask; and being informed that it was\n"what we drink," he would stare and say, "That\'s so, but what is it?Don\'t they teach you any better than that?""Well, it is what we drink, isn\'t it?""The fact that we drink it doesn\'t explain what it is," he would\nretort."You ask your teacher what water is"; and then he would leave\nher with this irritating problem troubling her young soul.Food, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its\nchemical constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these\ndark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance\nof things until she was actually in awe of him.She had a way of\nshowing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the\nmorning, a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her\nappearance.He wanted her to look smart, he insisted on a big bow of\nblue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her shoes be changed from\nlow quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons\'\nand that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her\ncomplexion and disposition."That child\'s light and gay by disposition.Don\'t put anything\nsomber on her," he once remarked.Jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and\nwould say, "Run to your papa and show him how you look."Vesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,\n"See."He grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when\nthey drove he would always have her in between them.He insisted that\nJennie send her to dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself\nwith rage and grief."Such\ndevil\'s fol-de-rol.To make a no-good\nout of her--a creature to be ashamed of?""Oh no, papa," replied Jennie.A fine lot he knows about what is good\nfor a child.A card-player, a whisky-drinker!""Now, hush, papa; I won\'t have you talk like that," Jennie would\nreply warmly."He\'s a good man, and you know it."When Lester was near he said nothing, and\nVesta could wind him around her finger."Oh you," she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled\ncheek.There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this.He\nlost control of himself--something welled up and choked his\nthroat."Yes, I know how you do," he would exclaim.It was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless\nshe herself willed it.Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do\nanything with him; he was always her devoted servitor.CHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nDuring this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with\nLester\'s irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger.That it could\nnot help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was\nsufficiently obvious to them.People\nseemed to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said\ndirectly.Kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to\nfly in the face of conventions in this manner.If the woman had been\nsome one of distinction--some sorceress of the stage, or of the\nworld of art, or letters, his action would have been explicable if not\ncommendable, but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities, as\nLouise had described her, this putty-faced nobody--he could not\npossibly understand it.Lester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had\nnot settled down in the ordinary way.Look at the women in Cincinnati\nwho knew him and liked him.Why in the\nname of common sense had he not married her?She was good looking,\nsympathetic, talented.The old man grieved bitterly, and then, by\ndegrees, he began to harden.It seemed a shame that Lester should\ntreat him so.It wasn\'t natural, or justifiable, or decent.Archibald\nKane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be\nenforced, but just what it should be he could not say.Lester was his\nown boss, and he would resent any criticism of his actions.Certain changes helped along an approaching denouement.Louise\nmarried not many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago,\nand then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting\ngrandchildren.Lester did not attend the wedding, though he was\ninvited.Kane died, making a readjustment of\nthe family will necessary.Lester came home on this occasion, grieved\nto think he had lately seen so little of his mother--that he had\ncaused her so much pain--but he had no explanation to make.His\nfather thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because\nof his obvious gloom.He went back to Chicago, and there were more\nmonths of silence.Kane\'s death and Louise\'s marriage, the father went to\nlive with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his\ngreatest pleasure in his old age.The business, except for the final\nadjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert\'s hands.The latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their\nhusbands and to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped\nto obtain.He was not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a\nshrewd, cold business man, far shrewder than his brother gave him\ncredit for.He was already richer than any two of the other children\nput together, but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty\nof fortune.He realized the danger of envy, and preferred a Spartan\nform of existence, putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very\nready and very hard cash.While Lester was drifting Robert was\nworking--working all the time.Robert\'s scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in\nthe control of the business was really not very essential, for his\nfather, after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation,\nhad come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his\nproperty ought not to go to Lester.Obviously, Lester was not so\nstrong a man as he had thought him to be.Of the two brothers, Lester\nmight be the bigger intellectually or\nsympathetically--artistically and socially there was no\ncomparison--but Robert got commercial results in a silent,\neffective way.If Lester was not going to pull himself together at\nthis stage of the game, when would he?Better leave his property to\nthose who would take care of it.Archibald Kane thought seriously of\nhaving his lawyer revise his will in such a way that, unless Lester\nshould reform, he would be cut off with only a nominal income.But he\ndecided to give Lester one more chance--to make a plea, in fact,\nthat he should abandon his false way of living, and put himself on a\nsound basis before the world.Old\nArchibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at\nhis convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was\nin Cincinnati."I thought I\'d have one more talk with you, Lester, on a subject\nthat\'s rather difficult for me to bring up," began the elder Kane."Yes, I know," replied Lester, calmly."I used to think, when I was much younger that my son\'s matrimonial\nventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that score\nwhen I got a little farther along.I began to see through my business\nconnections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and\nthen I got rather anxious that my boys should marry well.I used to\nworry about you, Lester, and I\'m worrying yet.This recent connection\nyou\'ve made has caused me no end of trouble.It worried your mother up\nto the very last.Don\'t you think you\nhave gone far enough with it?What\nit is in Chicago I don\'t know, but it can\'t be a secret.That can\'t\nhelp the house in business there.The\nwhole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects\nall around, and yet you continue."I suppose because I love her," Lester replied."You can\'t be serious in that," said his father."If you had loved\nher, you\'d have married her in the first place.Surely you wouldn\'t\ntake a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,\ndisgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her.You\nmay have a passion for her, but it isn\'t love.""How do you know I haven\'t married her?"He\nwanted to see how his father would take to that idea.The old gentleman propped himself up on his\narms and looked at him."No, I\'m not," replied Lester, "but I might be.I can\'t believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,\nLester.Why, you\'ve lived in open adultery\nwith her for years, and now you talk of marrying her.Why, in heaven\'s\nname, if you were going to do anything like that, didn\'t you do it in\nthe first place?Disgrace your parents, break your mother\'s heart,\ninjure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause\nof it?"Don\'t get excited, father," said Lester quickly."We won\'t get\nanywhere that way.She\'s not a bad woman, and\nI wish you wouldn\'t talk about her as you do."I know enough," insisted old Archibald, determinedly."I know that\nno good woman would act as she has done.Why, man, she\'s after your\nmoney.It\'s as plain as the nose on your\nface.""Father," said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, "why do you\ntalk like that?You wouldn\'t know her from\nAdam\'s off ox.Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and\nyou people swallow it whole.She isn\'t as bad as you think she is, and\nI wouldn\'t use the language you\'re using about her if I were you.You\'re doing a good woman an injustice, and you won\'t, for some\nreason, be fair."Is it\nfair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the\nstreets and live with her?Is it--"\n\n"Stop now, father," exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand.You\'re talking about the woman\nthat I\'m living with--that I may marry.I love you, but I won\'t\nhave you saying things that aren\'t so.She isn\'t a woman of the\nstreets.You know, as well as you know anything, that I wouldn\'t take\nup with a woman of that kind.We\'ll have to discuss this in a calmer\nmood, or I won\'t stay here.But I won\'t\nlisten to any such language as that."In spite of his opposition, he\nrespected his son\'s point of view.He sat back in his chair and stared\nat the floor."No, we\'ve moved out to Hyde Park."Well, that\'s a God\'s blessing.""I didn\'t say that," replied his son.exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling again.How do you\nsuppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune\nto a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as\nright and proper?Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family,\nyour personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you.I\ncan\'t understand what has happened to your pride.It seems like some\nwild, impossible fancy.""It\'s pretty hard to explain, father, and I can\'t do it very well.I simply know that I\'m in this affair, and that I\'m bound to see it\nthrough.I\'m not prepared now to say what I\'ll do.Old Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly."You\'ve made a bad mess of this, Lester," he said finally.But I suppose you are determined to go your way.Nothing\nthat I have said appears to move you.""Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration\nfor the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will\nmake a difference in my will.I can\'t go on countenancing this thing,\nand not be a party to it morally and every other way.You can leave her, or you can marry her.You certainly ought to do one\nor the other.If you leave her, everything will be all right.You can\nmake any provision for her you like.I\'ll\ngladly pay whatever you agree to.You will share with the rest of the\nchildren, just as I had planned.If you marry her it will make a\ndifference.I\'m doing what I think is my bounden duty.Now you think\nthat over and let me know."He felt that\nhis father probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie,\nand justify himself to himself?The old gentleman loved him even now--he could see\nit.Lester felt troubled and distressed; this attempt at coercion\nirritated him.The idea--he, Lester Kane, being made to do such a\nthing to throw Jennie down.Old Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet."Well," said Lester finally, "there\'s no use of our discussing it\nany further now--that\'s certain, isn\'t it?I can\'t say what I\'ll\ndo.Lester was sorry for the world\'s\nattitude and for his father\'s keen feeling about the affair.Kane\nsenior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing\nthrough.He wasn\'t sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but he\nwas hopeful."Good-by, father," said Lester, holding out his hand."I think I\'ll\ntry and make that two-ten train.There isn\'t anything else you wanted\nto see me about?"The old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply.What a foolhardy\npersistence in evil and error!He\nwas the one to control a business.It was a long time\nbefore he stirred.And still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring\nson continued to appeal to him.CHAPTER XL\n\n\nLester returned to Chicago.He realized that he had offended his\nfather seriously, how seriously he could not say.In all his personal\nrelations with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up.But\neven now Lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he\nhardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he\nhoped to retain his father\'s affection and confidence.As for the\nworld at large, what did it matter how much people talked or what they\nsaid.People turn so\nquickly from weakness or the shadow of it.To get away from\nfailure--even the mere suspicion of it--that seems to be a\nsubconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid\nnon-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious.Lester was\nsoon to feel the force of this prejudice.One day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire\nhead of Dodge, Holbrook & Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the\ndry-goods world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world.Dodge had been one of Lester\'s best friends.He knew him as intimately\nas he knew Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of\nCincinnati.He visited at his handsome home on the North Shore Drive,\nand they met constantly in a business and social way.But since Lester\nhad moved out to Hyde Park, the old intimacy had lapsed.Now they came\nface to face on Michigan Avenue near the Kane building."Why, Lester, I\'m glad to see you again," said Dodge.He extended a formal hand, and seemed just a little cool."I hear\nyou\'ve gone and married since I saw you.""No, nothing like that," replied Lester, easily, with the air of\none who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense."Why so secret about it, if you have?"asked Dodge, attempting to\nsmile, but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth.He was trying\nto be nice, and to go through a difficult situation gracefully."We\nfellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing."Well," said Lester, feeling the edge of the social blade']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['He opposed secession to the last, and when the State\nseceded he retired to his plantation, and all during the war was a\nnon-combatant.So grand was his character, such confidence did both\nsides have in his integrity, that he was honored and trusted by both.He\nnever faltered in his love for the Union, yet did everything possible to\nsave his friends and neighbors from the wrath of the Federal\nauthorities.It was common report that more than once he saved Gallatin\nfrom being burned to the ground for its many acts of hostility to the\nUnion forces.War laid a heavy hand on Colonel Peyton; and his son the\napple of his eye was brought home a corpse.He bound up his broken heart, and did what he could to\nsoothe others who had been stricken the same as he.Fred was given a genuine Southern welcome at the hospitable mansion of\nColonel Peyton.As for Bailie, the younger members of the household went\nwild over him, even the servants wore a happier smile now "dat Massa\nBailie had cum."After supper the family assembled on the old-fashioned porch to enjoy\nthe cool evening air, and the conversation, as all conversations were in\nthose days, was on the war.Bailie was overflowing with the exuberance\nof his spirits.He believed that the victory at Bull Run was the\nbeginning of the end, that Washington was destined to fall, and that\nPresident Davis would dictate peace from that city.He saw arise before\nhim a great nation, the admiration of the whole world; and as he spoke\nof the glory that would come to the South, his whole soul seemed to\nlight up his countenance.Throughout Bailie\'s discourse, Colonel Peyton sat silent and listened.Sometimes a sad smile would come over his features at some of his son\'s\nwitty sallies or extravagant expressions.Bailie seeing his father\' dejection, turned to him and said:\n\n"Cheer up, father; I shall soon be back in Nashville practicing my\nprofession, the war over; and in the greatness and grandeur of the South\nyou will forget your love for the old Union."The colonel shook his head, and turning to Fred, began to ask him\nquestions concerning Kentucky and the situation there.Fred answered him\ntruthfully and fully to the best of his knowledge.Colonel Peyton then\nsaid to his son:\n\n"Bailie, you know how dear you are to me, and how much I regret the\ncourse you are taking; yet I will not chide you, for it is but natural\nfor you to go with the people you love.It is not only you, it is the\nentire South that has made a terrible mistake.That the South had\ngrievances, we all know; but secession was not the cure.Bailie, you are\nmistaken about the war being nearly over; it has hardly begun.If\nBeauregard ever had a chance to capture Washington, that chance is now\nlost by his tardiness.The North has men and money; it will spare\nneither.You have heard what this young man has said about Kentucky.Neither side will\nkeep up the farce of neutrality longer than it thinks it an advantage to\ndo so.When the time comes, the Federal armies will sweep through\nKentucky and invade Tennessee.Their banners will be seen waving along\nthis road; Nashville will fall."Mary travelled to the office.cried Bailie, springing to his feet, "Nashville in the hands of\nthe Lincolnites.May I die before I see the accursed flag of the\nNorth waving over the proud capitol of my beloved Tennessee."He looked like a young god, as he stood there, proud, defiant, his eye\nflashing, his breast heaving with emotion.His father gazed on him a moment in silence.A look of pride, love,\ntenderness, passed over his face; then his eyes filled with tears, and\nhe turned away trembling with emotion.Had he a dim realization that the\nprayer of his son would be granted, and that he would not live to see\nthe Union flag floating over Nashville?That night Frederic Shackelford knelt by his bedside with a trembling\nheart.Bailie Peyton\'s speech, his enthusiasm, his earnestness had had a\npowerful influence on him.Was the South\nfighting, as Bailie claimed, for one of the holiest causes for which a\npatriotic people ever combated; and that their homes, the honor of their\nwives and daughters were at stake?"Oh, Lord, show me the right way!"Then there came to him, as if whispered in his ear by the sweetest of\nvoices, the words of his mother, "_God will never permit a nation to be\nfounded whose chief corner-stone is human slavery._" He arose, strong,\ncomforted; the way was clear; there would be no more doubt.The next morning the young men journeyed to Nashville together.On the\nway Bailie poured out his whole soul to his young companion.He saw\nnothing in the future but success.In no possible way could the North\nsubjugate the South.But the silver tones no longer influenced Fred;\nthere was no more wavering in his heart.But he ever said that Bailie\nPeyton was one of the most fascinating young men he ever met, and that\nthe remembrance of that ride was one of the sweetest of his life.When a few months afterward, he wept over Peyton\'s lifeless body\nstretched on the battlefield, he breathed a prayer for the noble soul\nthat had gone so early to its Creator.Fred found Nashville a seething sea of excitement.Nothing was thought\nof, talked of, but the war.There was no thought of the hardships, the\nsuffering, the agony, the death that it would bring--nothing but vain\nboasting, and how soon the North would get enough of it.The people\nacted as though they were about to engage in the festivities of some\ngala day, instead of one of the most gigantic wars of modern times.It\nwas the case of not one, but of a whole people gone mad.Although Fred\'s uncle and family were greatly surprised to see him, he\nwas received with open arms.Shackelford was busily engaged in\nraising a regiment for the Confederate service, and as Bailie Peyton had\nsaid, had been commissioned as major.Fred\'s cousin, George Shackelford,\nalthough but two years older than he, was to be adjutant, and Fred found\nthe young man a little too conceited for comfort.Not so with his cousin Kate, a most beautiful girl the same age as\nhimself, and they were soon the closest of friends.But Kate was a\nterrible fire-eater.She fretted and pouted because Fred would not abuse\nthe Yankees with the same vehemence that she did."We women would turn\nout and beat them back with broomsticks."Fred laughed, and then little Bess came toddling up to him, with "Tousin\nFed, do \'ankees eat \'ittle girls?""Bless you, Bessie, I am afraid they would eat you, you are so sweet,"\ncried Fred, catching her in his arms and covering her face with kisses."No danger," tartly responded Kate; "they will never reach here to get\na chance.""Don\'t be too sure, my pretty cousin; I may yet live to see you flirting\nwith a Yankee officer.""You will see me dead first," answered Kate, with flashing eye.It was a very pleasant visit that Fred had, and he was sorry when the\nfour days, the limit of his visit, were up.The papers that he had\nbrought were all signed, and in addition he took numerous letters and\nmessages back with him.When leaving, his uncle handed him a pass signed by the Governor of the\nState."There will be no getting through our lines into Kentucky without this,"\nsaid his uncle."Tennessee is like a rat-trap; it is much easier to get\nin than to get out."Fred met with no adventure going back, until he approached the Kentucky\nline south of Scottsville.Here he found the road strongly guarded by\nsoldiers."To my home near Danville, Kentucky," answered Fred."No, you don\'t," said the officer; "we have orders to let no one pass.""But I have permission from the Governor," replied Fred, handing out his\npass.The officer looked at it carefully, then looked Fred over, for he was\nfully described in the document, and handed it back with, "I reckon\nit\'s all right; you can go."And Fred was about to ride on, when a man\ncame running up with a fearful oath, and shouting: "That\'s you, is it,\nmy fine gentleman?Now you will settle with Bill Pearson for striking\nhim like a <DW65>!"and there stood the man he had struck at Gallatin,\nwith the fiery red mark still showing across his face.As quick as a flash Fred snatched a revolver from the holster."Up with\nyour hands," said he coolly but firmly.Pearson was taken by surprise,\nand his hands went slowly up.The officer looked from one to the other,\nand then asked what it meant.[Illustration: As quick as a flash Fred snatched a Revolver from the\nholster.]Bill, in a whining tone, told him how on the day he had enlisted, Fred\nhad struck him "just like a <DW65>."Fred, in a few words, told his side\nof the story."And Bailie Peyton said ye were all right, and Bill here called ye a\ncoward and a liah?""Well, Bill, I reckon you got what you deserved.With a muttered curse, Pearson fell back, and Fred rode on, but had gone\nbut a few yards when there was the sharp report of a pistol, and a ball\ncut through his hat rim.He looked back just in time to see Bill Pearson\nfelled like an ox by a blow from the butt of a revolver in the hands of\nthe angry officer.Once in Kentucky Fred breathed freer, but he was stopped several times\nand closely questioned, and once or twice the fleetness of his horse\nsaved him from unpleasant companions.It was with a glad heart that he\nfound himself once more at home.CHAPTER V.\n\nFATHER AND SON.Fred\'s journey to Nashville and back had consumed eleven days.It was\nnow August, a month of intense excitement throughout Kentucky.It was a\nmonth of plot and counterplot.The great question as to whether Kentucky\nwould be Union or Confederate trembled in the balance.Those who had been neutral were becoming outspoken\nfor one side or the other.He was fast\nbecoming a partisan of the South.Letters which Fred brought him from\nhis brother in Nashville confirmed him in his opinion.In these letters\nhis brother begged him not to disgrace the name of Shackelford by siding\nwith the Lincolnites.He heard from Fred a full account of his journey, commended him for his\nbravery, and said that he did what every true Kentuckian should do,\nresent an insult; but he should not have sent him had he known he would\nhave been exposed to such grave dangers."Now, Fred," he continued; "you and your horse need rest.Do not leave\nhome for a few days."His cousin Calhoun came to see him, and\nwhen he told him how he had served the fellow in Gallatin who called him\na liar, Calhoun\'s enthusiasm knew no bounds.He jumped up and down and\nyelled, and clapped Fred on the back, and called him a true Kentuckian,\neven if he didn\'t favor the South."It seems to me, Fred, you are having all the fun, while I am staying\nhere humdrumming around home."That\'s what I envy, Fred; I must be a soldier.I long to hear the\nsinging of bullets, the wild cheering of men, to be in the headlong\ncharge," and the boy\'s face glowed with enthusiasm."I reckon, Cal, you will get there, if this racket keeps up much\nlonger," answered Fred."Speed the day," shouted Cal, as he jumped on his horse and rode away,\nwaving back a farewell.During these days, Fred noticed that quite a number of gentlemen, all\nprominent Southern sympathizers, called on his father.It seemed to him\nthat his father was drifting away, and that a great gulf was growing\nbetween them; and he resolved to open his whole heart and tell his\nfather just how he felt.One evening his uncle, Judge Pennington, came out from Danville,\naccompanied by no less distinguished gentlemen than John C.\nBreckinridge, Humphrey Marshall, John A. Morgan and Major Hockoday.Breckinridge was the idol of Kentucky, a knightly man in every respect.They had come to discuss the situation with Mr.Ten\nthousand rifles had been shipped to Cincinnati, to be forwarded to Camp\nDick Robinson, for the purpose of arming the troops there; and the\nquestion was should they allow these arms to be sent.The consultation\nwas held in the room directly below the one Fred occupied, and through a\nfriendly ventilator he heard the whole conversation.Morgan and Major Hockoday were for calling out the State Guards,\ncapturing Camp Dick Robinson, then march on Frankfort, drive out the\nLegislature, and declare the State out of the Union.This was vigorously opposed by Breckinridge."You must remember," said\nhe, "that State sovereignty is the underlying principle of the Southern\nConfederacy.If the States are not sovereign, the South had no right to\nsecede, and every man in arms against the Federal government is a\ntraitor.Kentucky, by more than a two-thirds vote, declined to go out of\nthe Union.But she has declared for neutrality; let us see that\nneutrality is enforced.""Breckinridge," said Morgan, "your logic is good, but your position is\nweak."Their shipment in the State would be a violation of our neutrality; the\nwhole power of the State should be used to prevent it," answered\nBreckinridge."Now\nthat he is gone, the State Guard is virtually without a head.""Hobnobbing with President Lincoln in Washington, or with President\nDavis in Richmond, I don\'t know which," answered Marshall, with a laugh.Buckner is all right," responded Breckinridge; "but he ought to be\nhere now."It was finally agreed that a meeting should be called at Georgetown, in\nScott county, on the 17th, at which meeting decisive steps should be\ntaken to prevent the shipment of the arms.All of this Fred heard, and then, to his consternation, he heard his\nfather say:\n\n"Gentlemen, before you go, I want to introduce my son to you.I am\nafraid he is a little inclined to be for the Union, and I think a\nmeeting with you gentlemen may serve to make him see things in a\ndifferent light."So Fred was called, and nerving himself for the interview, he went down.As he entered the room, Major Hockoday stared at him a moment in\nsurprise, and then exclaimed:\n\n"Great God!Shackelford, that is not your son; that is the young villain\nwho stole my dispatch from Conway!""The very same," said Fred, smiling."How do you do, Major; I am glad to\nsee you looking so well.I see that the loss of that dispatch didn\'t\nworry you so much as to make you sick."stammered the major, choking with rage, "you--you impudent\nyoung----" here the major did choke.Fred rather enjoyed it, and he continued: "And how is my friend Captain\nConway?I trust that he was not injured in his hurried exit from the\ncars the other night."All the rest of the company looked nonplused, but Morgan, who roared\nwith laughter."It means," answered Fred, "that I got the major\'s dispatches away from\nCaptain Conway, and thus saved Louisville from a scene of bloodshed and\nhorror.And, Major, you should thank me, for your scheme would have\nfailed anyway.I really saved any\nnumber of your friends from being killed, and there you sit choking with\nrage, instead of calling me a good boy.""Leave the room, Fred," commanded Mr.Shackelford; "that you should\ninsult a guest here in my own house is more than I can imagine."Bowing, Fred retired, and the company turned to Major Hockoday for an\nexplanation of the extraordinary scene.The major told the story and\nended with saying: "I am sorry, Shackelford, that he is your boy.If I\nwere you, I should get him out of the country as soon as possible; he\nwill make you trouble.""I will settle with him, never fear," replied Mr."Look here, Major," spoke up Morgan; "you are sore because that boy\noutwitted you, and he did you a good turn, as he said.If your program\nhad been carried out, Louisville would be occupied by Federal troops\nto-day.Thank him because he pulled the wool over Conway\'s eyes.two old duffers fooled by a boy!"and Morgan enjoyed a hearty laugh, in\nwhich all but Major Hockoday and Mr."And, Shackelford," continued Morgan, after he had enjoyed his laugh, "I\nwant you to let that boy alone; he is the smartest boy in Kentucky.I\nwant him with me when I organize my cavalry brigade.""I am afraid, Morgan," said Breckinridge, "that you will be disappointed\nin that, though I hope not for Mr.The boy looks to\nme as if he had a will of his own.""Oh, he will come around all right," responded Morgan.After making full arrangements for the meeting to be held in Scott\ncounty on the 17th, the company dispersed.Hours after they had gone Fred heard his father restlessly pacing the\nfloor.thought he, "like me, he cannot sleep.I wonder what he\nwill say to me in the morning; but come what may, I must and shall be\nfor the Union."Shackelford was silent until the close of the\nmeal, when he simply said, "Fred, I would like to see you in the\nlibrary."Fred bowed, and replied, "I will be there in a few moments, father."When Fred entered the library, his father was seated at the table\nwriting.There was a look of care on his face, and Fred was startled to\nsee how pale he was.Pushing aside his writing, he sat for some moments looking at his son in\nsilence.At last he said:\n\n"Fred, you can hardly realize how pained I was last night to hear what I\ndid.You are\nold enough to realize something of the desperate nature of the struggle\nin which the two sections of the country are engaged.For the past two\nweeks I have thought much of what was the right thing to do.I love my\ncountry; I love and revere the old flag.As long as the slightest hope\nremained of restoring it as it was, I was for the Union.But this is now\nhopeless; too much blood has been shed.Neither would the South, if\ngranted her own terms, now go back to a Union she not only hates, but\nloathes.The North has no lawful right to use coercion.Kentucky, in her\nsovereign right as a State, has declared for neutrality; and it has been\ncontemptuously ignored by the North.Nelson, a man to be despised by\nevery patriot, has not only organized troops in our midst, but now seeks\nto have the Federal government arm them.Such true men as Breckinridge,\nMarshall, Buckner, Morgan, and a host of other loyal Kentuckians have\nsworn that this shall never be.If\nhe ascertains that the Lincoln government will not respect the\nneutrality of the State by withdrawing every Federal officer and\nsoldier, he is going to proceed to Richmond and offer his services to\nthe Confederate Government.Once accepted, he will immediately form the\nState Guards into an army, and turn them over to the Confederacy.Regiments must be formed, and I have been offered the colonelcy of one\nof these regiments."Fred was startled, and stammered, "You--father--you?"If your mother had lived, it would have been\ndifferent, but now I can go far better than many who have gone.I have\narranged all of my business.I shall place Belle in school in\nCincinnati.John Stimson, who has been our overseer for so many years,\nwill remain and conduct the plantation.My only trouble has been to\ndispose of you satisfactorily.My wish is to send you to college, but\nknowing your adventurous disposition, and how fond you are of exciting\nand, I might add, desperate deeds, I am afraid you would do no good in\nyour studies.""You are right, father," said Fred, in a low voice.Shackelford, "I was going to offer\nto take you with me in the army, not as an enlisted soldier, but rather\nas company and aid to me.But from what I heard last night, I do not see\nhow this is possible, unless what you have done has been a mere boyish\nfreak, which I do not think.""It was no freak," said Fred, with an unsteady voice.Therefore, the only thing I can do is to send you\naway--to Europe.What do you say, an English or a German university?""And you are really going into the Confederate army, father?""And you want me to play the coward and flee my country in this her hour\nof greatest peril?Shackelford looked astonished, and then a smile of joy passed over\nhis features; could it be that Fred was going with him?"Not if you wish to go with me, my son."Fred arose and tottered to his father, sank beside his knee, and looking\nup with a tear-stained face, said in a pleading voice:\n\n"Don\'t go into the Confederate army, father; don\'t turn against the old\nflag."And the boy laid his head on his father\'s knee and sobbed as if\nhis heart would break.He tried to speak, but a lump arose\nin his throat and choked him; so he sat in silence smoothing the hair of\nhis son with his hand as gently as his mother would have done."What would mother say," at length sobbed the boy.Shackelford shivered as with a chill; then said brokenly: "If your\nmother had lived, child, my first duty would have been to her.Neither would your mother, it mattered not what she\nthought herself, ever have asked me to violate my own conscience.""Father, let us both stay at home.We can do that, you thinking as you\ndo, and I thinking as I do.We can\ndo good by comforting those who will be stricken; and mother will look\ndown from heaven, and bless us.We cannot control our sympathies, but we\ncan our actions.We can both be truly non-combatants.""Don\'t, Fred, don\'t tempt me," gasped Mr."My word is\ngiven, and a Shackelford never breaks his word.Then I cannot stand idly\nby, and see my kindred made slaves.I must draw my sword for the right,\nand the South has the right.I go in the\nConfederate army--you to Europe.Fred arose, his face as pale as death, but with a look so determined, so\nfixed that it seemed as if in a moment the boy had been transformed into\na man."Father," he asked, "I have always been a good son, obeying you, and\nnever intentionally grieving you, have I not?""You have, Fred, been a good, obedient son, God bless you!""Just before mother died," continued Fred, "she called me to her\nbedside.She told me how my great-grandfather had died on Bunker Hill,\nand asked me to always be true to my country.She asked me to promise\nnever to raise my hand against the flag.You\nwould not have me break that promise, father?"Go to Europe, stay there until the trouble is over."Listen, for I believe her words to be prophetic:\n\'God will never prosper a nation whose chief corner-stone is human\nslavery.\'""Stop, Fred, stop, I can\'t bear it.This\nwar is not waged to perpetuate slavery; it is waged to preserve the\nrights of the States guaranteed to them by the Constitution.""Do not deceive yourself, father; slavery has everything to do with it.No State would have thought of seceding if it had not been for slavery.Slavery is the sole, the only cause of the war.It is a poor cause for\nnoble men to give up their lives.""We will not argue the question," said Mr.Shackelford, pettishly; "you\nwill forget your foolishness in Europe.""I shall not only not go to Europe, but I shall enter the army."The father staggered as if a knife had pierced his heart.He threw out\nhis hands wildly, and then pressed them to his breast and gasped: "Fred,\nFred, you don\'t mean it!""I was never more in earnest in my life."Shackelford\'s feelings underwent a sudden change.His face became\npurple with rage; love for his son was forgotten."Do that," he thundered, "do that, and you are no son of mine.I will\ndisown you, I will cast you out, I will curse you.""Father," said Fred, in a low tremulous voice, "if part we must, do not\nlet us part in anger.Never have I loved you better than now; you do\nwhat you believe to be right; I do what I believe to be right.We both\nperform our duty as we see it.God will hold the one who blunders\nblameless.Shackelford, with white, drawn face, pointed to the door, and\nuttered the one word, "Go!""Oh, father, father, do not send me away with a curse.Daniel journeyed to the garden.See, father,"\nand he turned to his mother\'s portrait which hung on the wall, "mother\nis looking down on us; mother, who loved us both so well.How can you\naccount to her that you have turned away her only son with a curse, and\nfor no crime, but the one of loving his country.""Boy, boy, have you no mercy that you will not only break my heart, but\ntear it out by the roots.""I am the one who asks for mercy, who pleads that you send me not away\nwith a curse.""Fred, for the sake of your mother, I will not curse you, but I will, if\nyou remain in my sight.Here," and he went to his safe, opened it, and\ntook out a package of money."Here is $1,000, take it and Prince, and\nbegone.Go to that man, Nelson, who has seduced you.It is a heavy\naccount I have to settle with him.Go before I forget myself and curse\nyou."For a moment Fred gazed in his father\'s face; there was no wrath,\nnothing but love in his look.Then he took the money and said: "Father,\nI thank you; I not only thank you, but bless you.May God protect you in\nthe midst of dangers.Not a day shall pass but I shall pray for your\nsafety.Shackelford staggered towards the door.It was the cry of a\nrepentant soul.The boy\'s footstep echoed outside along the hall,\nfainter and fainter.The father groped blindly, as if about to fall.The outer door closed; his boy was gone.Shackelford staggered backward and groaned, as if in mortal agony.Then his eye caught the portrait of his wife looking down on him.Raising his arms beseechingly, he cried: "Oh, Laura!Don\'t look at me so; I didn\'t curse him.It was with a heavy heart that Fred left the house.As he shut the door,\nhe thought he heard his father call.He stopped and listened, but\nhearing nothing, he went on.Getting his horse, he rode to Danville.His\nlittle sister was visiting at Judge Pennington\'s, and he wanted to see\nher, as well as to bid farewell to his uncle, and see Calhoun.He had no\nidea but that his uncle would forbid him the house when he heard of his\nbeing cast off by his father.He found Judge Pennington at home, and frankly told him what had\nhappened, shielding his father as much as possible, and not sparing\nhimself."Why, why, you young jackanapes," he roared; "it\'s a horse-whipping you\nwant, and you would get it if you were a boy of mine!A good tanning is what\nyou need, and, by Jove!I have a mind to give it to you," and he shook\nhis cane threateningly."Going to join the Yankee army, are you?A Shackelford in the Yankee army!I\'ll,\nI\'ll--" but the judge was too angry to say more."Now, uncle, don\'t get in a rage; it\'s no use.I shall join the Union army in some capacity.""Get out of my sight, you young idiot, you!"he asked, looking from one\nto the other."If you were as big a fool as your\ncousin there, I would skin you alive.""Glad you have at last come to a full appreciation of my worth," coolly\nreplied Calhoun."For years I have had the virtues of my cousin held up\nto me as a shining mark to follow.Now, I find I am saving my skin by\nsurpassing him in the wisdom of this world."Why, this fool says he is going to enlist in the Yankee army," foamed\nthe Judge, pointing at Fred."And this fool says he is going to enlist in the Southern army,"\nanswered Calhoun, pointing to himself."Calhoun, you don\'t mean it?""Yes, I do mean it," stoutly replied the boy.Haven\'t you been\ntalking for years of the rights of the South?Are you not doing\neverything possible to take Kentucky out of the Union?Haven\'t you\nencouraged the enlistment of soldiers for the South?Father, I don\'t want to quarrel with you as\nFred has with his father, but I am going into the Southern army, and I\nhope with your blessing."Having his son go to war was so much\ndifferent from having some one else\'s son go."Do not do anything rash, my son," he said to Calhoun."When the time\ncomes if you must go, I will see what can be done for you.As for you,\nFred," he said, "you stay here with Calhoun until I return.I am going\nto see your father," and calling for his horse, the judge rode away.Calling the boys into a\nroom for a private interview, he said: "Fred, I have been to see your\nfather, and he is very much chagrined over your disobedience.His fierce\nanger is gone, and in its place a deep sorrow.He does not ask you to\ngive up your principle, but he does ask that you do not enter the\nFederal army.You are much too young, to say nothing of other\nconsiderations.You should accept his proposition and go to Europe.We\nhave come to this conclusion, that if you will go I will send Calhoun\nwith you.Calhoun wants to enter the\nSouthern army, you the Northern, so neither section loses anything.You\nhave both done your duty to your section, and both will have the\npleasure and advantage of a university course in Europe."That it is a mean underhanded way to prevent me from entering the\narmy," flared up Calhoun."Be careful, boy," said the judge, getting red in the face."You will\nnot find me as lenient as Mr.Shackelford has been with Fred.Calhoun\'s temper was up, and there would have been a scene right then\nand there if Fred had not interfered."Uncle," said he, "there is no use of Calhoun and you disagreeing over\nthis matter.I shall not go to Europe; so far as I am concerned, it is\nsettled.As for Calhoun entering the army, you must settle that between\nyou."Calhoun pressed Fred\'s hand, and whispered, "Good for you, Fred; you\nhave got me out of a bad scrape.I think father will consent to my going\nin the army now."The judge stared at the boys, and then sputtered: "Both of you ought to\nbe soundly thrashed.But if Fred\'s mind is made up, it is no use\npursuing the matter further.""Then," answered the judge, "I will say no more, only, Fred, my house is\nopen to you.When you get sick of your foolish experiment you can have\na home here.Your father refuses to see you unless you consent to obey.""I thank you, uncle," said Fred, in a low voice, "but I do not think I\nshall trouble you much."Shackelford, it must be said it was by his request\nthat Judge Pennington made this offer to Fred.Shackelford\'s heart\nhad softened towards his son, and he did not wish to cast him off\nentirely.But the destiny of father and son was to be more closely\ninterwoven than either thought.Fred remained at his uncle\'s until the next day.He and Calhoun slept\ntogether or rather occupied the same bed, for they had too much talking\nto do to sleep.Both\nlonged for the fierce excitement of war.They did not realize that they might face each other on the field of\nbattle.They talked of their oath, and again promised to keep it to the\nletter.They were like two brothers, each going on a long journey in different\ndirections.Their parting the next morning was most affectionate, and when Fred rode\naway he turned his horse\'s head in the direction of Camp Dick Robinson.The soldiers that Nelson had gathered at Camp Dick Robinson were a\nnondescript set, not only in clothing, but in arms.Squirrel rifles and\nshotguns were the principal weapons.When he first began organizing his\ntroops, Nelson had ordered guns and ammunition from the Federal\ngovernment, and his impetuous spirit chafed at their non-arrival.Consequently he was not in the best of humor, and was mentally cursing\nthe government for its exceeding slowness when Fred rode up to his\nheadquarters.Fred\'s ride had been anything but a pleasant one.That he had taken a\ndesperate step for a boy of his age, he well knew.He passionately loved\nhis father, and the thought that he had been disowned for disobedience\nwas a bitter one.He strove to fight back the lump that would rise in\nhis throat; and in spite of all his efforts to keep them back, the tears\nwould well up in his eyes.He had given himself, heart and soul, to the cause of the Union, and had\nno thought of turning back.Even if Nelson did not receive him, if it\ncame to the worst he would enlist as a private soldier."A boy to see me," snapped Nelson, when an orderly reported that a boy\nwas outside and wished to see him.The orderly reported to Fred Nelson\'s kind wish."Tell him," replied Fred, rather indignantly, "that Fred Shackelford\nwishes to see him."The orderly soon returned, and ushered Fred into the presence of the\nirate officer."It is you, Fred, is it?"said Nelson, as our hero entered and saluted\nhim."I am sorry I told you to go where I did, but the truth is I am out\nof sorts."News, General, yes; and quite important, if you do not already know it.But first," continued Fred, glancing at the star which glistened on\nNelson\'s shoulder, "let me congratulate you.I see you are no longer\nLieutenant Nelson of the navy, but General Nelson of the army.""Yes," replied Nelson, with a twinkle in his eye, "I now command on\nland; so, young man, be careful how you try to ride over me."Fred laughed as he thought of his first meeting with Nelson, and\nreplied: "I shall never so forget myself again, General.""Now," continued Nelson, "give me the news.You said you had something\nimportant to communicate.""So I have if you are not already informed.You are expecting arms for\nyour men, are you not?""I am, and I am all out of patience because I do not receive them."I know that you will never receive them, if the friends of the South\ncan prevent it; and that they are taking active measures to do.""Tell me all about it," said Nelson, manifesting the greatest interest.Fred then related all that he had heard at the meeting which took place\nat his father\'s house.Then he asked,\n"Where did you learn of all this?""Please do not ask me," replied Fred, in a low voice."I can only say\nthe information is absolutely correct."Your news is,\nindeed, important.You have again rendered me important service, Fred.How I wish you could\ntake up with that offer I made you.""That is what I have come for, General, if you will accept my poor\nservices."Fred, and then replied: "I have no home; my father has cast me\nout.""I had my choice to accompany him in the Confederate army or to go to\nEurope to attend some university.Nelson knitted his brows a moment as if in thought, and then replied:\n"You were certainly right in refusing the first; I wonder at your father\nmaking you the proposition.The last was a very reasonable proposition,\nand a wise one.I am afraid I am to blame\nfor your folly--for such it is.The offer I made you appealed to your\nboyish imagination and love of adventure, and caused you to go against\nthe wishes of your father.Four or five years at some foreign university\nis a chance not to be idly thrown away, to say nothing about obeying the\nwishes of your father.As much as I would like your services, Fred, be\nreconciled to your father; go to Europe, and keep out of this infernal\nwar.It will cost the lives of thousands of just such noble youths as\nyou before it ends; and," he continued, with a tinge of sadness in his\ntone, "I sometimes think I shall never live to see it end.I am\nsurrounded by hundreds of enemies who are hungering for my life.""Your advice, General, is most kindly given," answered Fred, "and I\nsincerely thank you for what you have said; but it is impossible for me\nto accept it.He gave me\n$1,000 and my horse, and told me to go my way.I love my father, but if\nI should now go back after what has passed, he would despise me, as I\nwould despise myself.Father is the soul of honor; if I should play the\ncraven after all that I have said, he would not only despise, but loathe\nme.Now I can hope that time may once more unite us.Be assured that\nthough his heart may be filled with anger towards me now, if I prove\nmyself worthy, he will yet be proud of his son."He grasped Fred\'s hand, and exclaimed with\nmuch feeling: "You must have a noble father, or he could not have such a\nson.Consider yourself attached to my staff\nas confidential scout and messenger.I do not wish you to enlist; you\nwill be more free to act if you are not an enlisted soldier."Fred warmly thanked the general for his expression of confidence, and\nannounced himself as ready for orders.Nelson smiled at his ardor, and then said: "I believe you stated that\nthat meeting is to take place in Scott county the 17th?"How would you like to go\nthere, and see what you can learn?""I can make it all right, but I am afraid some of\nthem may know me.""We will fix that all right," responded Nelson.The next morning, a boy with jet black hair and hands and face stained\nbrown rode away from General Nelson\'s headquarters.It would have been\na close observer indeed that would have taken that boy for Fred\nShackelford.It was on the evening of the 16th that Fred reached Georgetown.He found\nthe little city full of excited partisans of the South.At the meeting\nthe next day many fierce speeches were made.The extremists were for at\nonce calling out the State Guards, and marching on Camp Dick Robinson,\nand capturing it at the point of the bayonet.Governor Magoffin was instructed to protest in the strongest\nlanguage to President Lincoln, and to call on him at once to disband the\ntroops at Dick Robinson.As for allowing the arms to be shipped, it was\nresolved that it should be prevented at all hazards.When Fred arrived at Georgetown, he found at the hotel that he could\nprocure a room next to the one occupied by Major Hockoday, and believing\nthat the major\'s room might be used for secret consultations of the more\nviolent partisans of the South, he engaged it, hoping that in some\nmanner he might become possessed of some of their secrets.While the\nroom engaged by Major Hockoday was unoccupied he deftly made a hole\nthrough the plastering in his room, and then with the aid of a sharpened\nstick made a very small opening through the plastering into the next\nroom.He then rolled up a sheet of paper in the shape of a trumpet.By\nplacing the small end of the paper in the small opening, and putting his\near to the larger end, he was enabled to hear much that was said,\nespecially if everything was still and the conversation was animated.The result exceeded his most sanguine expectations.After the close of\nthe public meeting, a number of the more prominent actors gathered in\nMajor Hockoday\'s room.A heated discussion arose as to how Kentucky could the most quickly\nthrow off her neutrality, and join her fortune to that of the\nConfederacy."Gentlemen," said Major Hockoday, "I believe every one present is a true\nson of the South, therefore I can speak to you freely.The first thing,\nas we all agree, is to prevent the shipment of these arms.Then if\nLincoln refuses to disband the troops at Dick Robinson, the program is\nthis: You all know that General Buckner has been in Washington for some\ntime talking neutrality.In a measure he has gained the confidence of\nLincoln, and has nearly received the promise that no Federal troops from\nother States will be ordered into the State as long as the Confederate\ntroops keep out.Buckner has secretly gone to Richmond, where he will\naccept a commission from the Confederate government.He will then come\nback by way of the South, and issue a proclamation to loyal Kentuckians\nto join his standard.The State Guards should join him to a man.Then,\nif Lincoln refuses to disband the soldiers at Dick Robinson, the\nConfederate government will occupy the State with troops, claiming and\njustly, too, that the Federal government has not respected the\nneutrality of the State.The coming of the Confederate troops will fire\nthe heart of every true Kentuckian, and all over the State Confederates\nwill spring to arms, and the half-armed ragamuffins of Nelson will be\nscattered like a flock of sheep.By a dash Louisville can be occupied,\nand Kentucky will be where she belongs--in the Southern Confederacy.What think you, gentlemen, of the program?"Strong men embraced each other\nwith tears streaming down their cheeks.They believed with their whole\nhearts and souls that the South was right, and that Kentucky\'s place was\nwith her Southern sisters, and now that there seemed to be a possibility\nof this, their enthusiasm knew no bounds.As for Fred, he drew a long breath.He knew that he had gained\ninformation of the greatest value to the Federal cause."It is time for me to be going," he said to himself."Nelson must know\nof this as soon as possible."As he passed out of the room, he came face to face with Major Hockoday.The major stared at him a moment, and then roughly asked: "What is your\nname, and what are you doing here?""I see no reason why I should report to you," replied Fred."I am a\nguest at this hotel, and am minding my own business.I wish I could say\nas much for you," and he walked away.The major looked after him, his face red with anger, and muttered:\n"Strange!but if that boy didn\'t have black hair and was not dark, I\nshould swear it was Fred Shackelford.But a gentleman came along just then and engaged him in conversation.As\nsoon as he could disengage himself, the major examined the hotel\nregister to find who occupied room 13.Opposite that number he found\nwritten in a bold, boyish hand:\n\n"F. Carrington....Fred\'s full name was Fred Carrington Shackelford, and he had registered\nhis given names only.Major Hockoday made careful inquiry about the boy,\nbut no one knew him.He had paid his bill, called for his horse, and\nrode away.Major Hockoday was troubled,\nwhy he hardly knew; but somehow he felt as if the presence of that\nblack-haired boy boded no good to their cause.All of this time Fred was riding swiftly towards Lexington.General Nelson listened to his report not only with attention, but with\nastonishment."Fred," said he, "you are a marvel; you are worth a brigade of soldiers.I have been reporting all the time to the authorities at Washington that\nBuckner was heart and soul with the South; but they wouldn\'t believe me.Neither will they believe me now, but I can act on your information.""Fred," continued the general, walking rapidly up and down the room, "I\nsometimes think there is a set of dunderheads at Washington.They think\nthey know everything, and don\'t know anything.If Kentucky is saved, it\nwill be saved by the loyal men of the State.Just think of their\nlistening to Buckner instead of me," and the general worked himself into\na violent rage, and it took him some time to cool off.Then he said: "I\nwill try once more to hurry up those arms.I will send you to-morrow to\nCincinnati as a special messenger.I will write what you have told me,\nand I want you to impress it on General Anderson\'s mind.Tell him to\nhurry, hurry, or it will be too late."The next morning Fred was on his way back to Nicholasville.From there\nhe took the train for Cincinnati, at which place he arrived in due time.He delivered his dispatches to General Anderson, who, after reading\nthem, looked at him kindly and said:\n\n"General Nelson sends a young messenger, but he tells me of the great\nservice you have performed and the valuable information you have\ngathered.It is certainly wonderful for so young a boy.Fred modestly related what had occurred at Georgetown.General Anderson listened attentively, and when Fred had finished, said:\n"You certainly deserve the credit General Nelson has given you.The\ninformation you received is of the greatest importance, and will be at\nonce forwarded to Washington.In the mean time, we must do the best we\ncan.General Nelson may think I am slow, but there is so much to do--so\nmuch to do, and so little to do with," and the general sighed.Fred\nobserved him with interest, for he realized that he was talking to the\nhero who had defended Fort Sumter to the last.The general was broken in health, and looked sick and careworn, and not\nthe man to assume the great burden he was bearing.It was with joy that\nFred heard that the arms would be shipped in a day or two.But when the\ntrain carrying them was ready to start, Fred saw, to his amazement, that\nit was not to be guarded."That train will never get through," he thought."It is funny how they\ndo things."Fred was right; the enemies of the government were not idle.Spies were\nall around, and they knew when the train was to start to a minute, and\nthe news was flashed ahead.At a small station in Harrison county the\ntrain was stopped by a large mob, who tore up the track in front, making\nit impossible for it to proceed.There was nothing to do but to take the\ntrain back to Cincinnati, and with it a communication to the officials\nof the road that if they attempted to run the train again the whole\ntrack would be torn up from Covington to Lexington.The railway officials, thoroughly frightened, begged General Anderson\nnot to attempt to run the train again.The Southern sympathizers were\njubilant over their success, and boldly declared the arms would never be\nshipped.As for Fred, he was completely disgusted, and expressed himself so."Well, my boy, what would you do?""I would send a regiment and a\nbattery on a train ahead of the one carrying the arms, and if the mob\ninterfered I would sweep them from the face of the earth.""Well said, my lad," replied Anderson, his face lighting up and his eyes\nkindling."I feel that way myself, but a soldier must obey orders, and\nunfortunately I have different orders.""I have orders to load them on a steamboat, and send them up the\nKentucky River to Hickman Bridge.""You don\'t seem pleased," said the general.blurted out Fred; "excuse me, General, but it is all\nfoolishness.The boat will be\nstopped the same as the train."The general turned away, but Fred heard him say, as if to himself: "I am\nafraid it will be so, but the government persists in tying our hands as\nfar as Kentucky is concerned."General Anderson\'s position was certainly an anomalous one--the\ncommander of a department, and yet not allowed to move troops into it.According to his orders, Fred took passage on the boat with the arms,\nbut he felt it would never be permitted to reach its destination.When the boat reached the confines of Owen\ncounty they found a great mob congregated on the banks of the river.was the cry, "or we will burn the boat."The\ncaptain tried to parley, but he was met with curses and jeers.Fred went on shore, and mingling with the mob, soon learned there was a\nconspiracy on the part of the more daring to burn the boat, even if it\ndid turn back.Hurrying on board, Fred told the captain his only\nsalvation was to turn back at once, and to put on all steam.He did so,\nand the boat and cargo were saved.Once more the Confederate sympathizers went wild with rejoicing, and the\nUnion men were correspondingly depressed.But the boat made an unexpected move, as far as the enemy were\nconcerned.Instead of proceeding back to Cincinnati, it turned down the\nOhio to Louisville.Here the arms were hastily loaded on the cars, and\nstarted for Lexington.Fred was hurried on ahead to apprise General\nNelson of their coming.Fred delivered his message to the general, and\nthen said: "The train will never get through; it will be stopped at\nLexington, if not before.""If the train ever reaches Lexington I will have the arms," grimly\nreplied Nelson."Lexington is in my jurisdiction; there will be no\nfooling, no parleying with traitors, if the train reaches that city."Then he turned to Colonel Thomas E. Bramlette, and said: "Colonel, take\na squadron of cavalry, proceed to Lexington, and when that train comes,\ntake charge of it and guard it to Nicholasville.I will have wagons\nthere to transport the arms here."Colonel Bramlette saluted, and replied: "General, I will return with\nthose arms or not at all.""Certainly, if you wish," answered Nelson."You have stayed by the arms\nso far, and it is no more than right that you should be in at the\nfinish."The enemy was alert, and the news reached Lexington that the train\nloaded with the arms and ammunition for the soldiers at Dick Robinson\nwas coming.Instantly the little city was aflame with excitement.The State Guards\nunder the command of John H. Morgan gathered at their armory with the\navowed intention of seizing the train by force.John C. Breckinridge\nmade a speech to the excited citizens, saying the train must be stopped,\nif blood flowed.In the midst of this excitement Colonel Bramlette with his cavalry\narrived."Drive the Lincoln hirelings from the city!"shouted Breckinridge, and\nthe excited crowd took up the cry.A demand was at once drawn up, signed by Breckinridge, Morgan and many\nothers, and sent to Colonel Bramlette, requesting him to at once\nwithdraw from the city, or blood would be shed.Colonel Bramlette\'s lips curled in scorn as he read the demand, and\nturning to the messenger who brought it, said: "Go tell the gentlemen\nthey shall have my answer shortly."Writing an answer, he turned to Fred, saying: "Here, my boy, for what\nyou have done, you richly deserve the honor of delivering this message."Right proudly did Fred bear himself as he delivered his message to\nBreckinridge.Major Hockoday, who was standing by Breckinridge, scowled\nand muttered, "It\'s that ---- Shackelford boy."Captain Conway heard him, and seeing Fred, with a fearful oath, sprang\ntowards him with uplifted hand.He had not seen Fred since that night he\nplunged from the train.His adventure had become known, and he had to\nsubmit to any amount of chaffing at being outwitted by a boy; and his\nbrother officers took great delight in calling out: "Look out, Conway,\nhere comes that detective from Danville!"This made Captain Conway hate Fred with all the ardor of his small soul,\nand seeing the boy, made him so forget himself as to attack him.But a revolver flashed in his face, and a firm voice said: "Not so fast,\nCaptain."The irate captain was seized and dragged away, and when the tumult had\nsubsided Breckinridge said: "I am sorry to see the son of my friend,\nColonel Shackelford, engaged in such business; but it is the message\nthat he brings that concerns us."He then read the following laconic note from Colonel Bramlette:\n\n\n     LEXINGTON, Aug.JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE, JOHN H. MORGAN AND OTHERS.Gentlemen:--I shall take those arms, and if a drop of Union blood\n     be shed, I will not leave a single Secessionist alive in Lexington.THOMAS E. BRAMLETTE,\n     _Colonel Commanding_.There was a breathless silence; faces of brave men grew pale.There were\noaths and muttered curses, but the mob began to melt away.The train arrived, and Colonel Bramlette took charge of it without\ntrouble.Just as the troop of cavalry was leaving Lexington, a boy came\nout and thrust a note into Fred\'s hand.He opened it and read:\n\n\n     TO FRED SHACKELFORD:\n\n     Boy as you are, I propose to shoot you on sight, so be on your\n     guard.Fred smiled, and handed the note to Colonel Bramlette, who read it and\nsaid: "Fred, you will have to look out for that fellow."The journey back to Dick Robinson was without incident.The long looked\nfor arms and ammunition had come.It meant everything to those men\nsurrounded as they were with enemies on every side.In the midst of the\nrejoicing, Fred was not forgotten.He and Colonel Bramlette were the\nheroes of the hour.The fight for the possession of the arms was over.General Nelson, the man of iron\nnerve, who, in the face of opposition from friends, the most direful\nthreats from foes, saved Central Kentucky to the Union, had been\nrelieved of his command and assigned to another field of labor.The new\ncommander to take his place was General George H. Thomas.To Fred the news that _his_ general, as he had come to look upon Nelson,\nhad been assigned to another command, was anything but pleasing."But\nwhere Nelson goes, there will I go," was his thought."After all," he\nsaid, bitterly, "what does it matter where I go.General Thomas, like Nelson, was a heavy, thickset man, but there the\nlikeness ended.Thomas never lost his temper, he never swore, he never\ncomplained, he never got excited.He was always cool and collected, even\nunder the most trying circumstances.He afterwards became known to his\nsoldiers as "Pap Thomas," and was sometimes called "Slow-Trot Thomas,"\nfor the reason he was never known to ride his horse off a trot, even in\nthe most desperate battle.When General Thomas reported to Camp Dick Robinson he and Nelson held a\nlong consultation."This, General, is Fred Shackelford, the boy of whom I spoke," said\nNelson.Fred saluted the new commander, and then respectfully remained standing,\nawaiting orders."Fred," continued General Nelson, "General Thomas and I have been\ndiscussing you, and I have been telling him how valuable your services\nhave been.I fully expected to take you with me to my new command, but\nboth General Thomas and myself feel that just at present your services\nare very much needed here.This camp is very important, and it is\nsurrounded with so many dangers that we need to take every precaution.You are not only well acquainted with the country, but you seem to have\na peculiar way of getting at the enemy\'s secrets no other one possesses.There is no doubt but you are needed here more than at Maysville, where\nI am going.But we have concluded to leave it to you, whether you go or\nstay.You may be sure I shall be pleased to have you go with me.Fred looked at General Thomas, and thought he had never seen a finer,\ngrander face; but he had grown very fond of the fiery Nelson, so he\nreplied:\n\n"General Nelson, you know my feelings towards you.If I consulted simply my own wishes I should go with you.But\nyou have pointed out to me my duty.I am very grateful to General Thomas\nfor his feelings towards me.I shall stay as long as I am needed here,\nand serve the general to the best of my ability.""Bravely said, Fred, bravely said," responded Nelson."You will find\nGeneral Thomas a more agreeable commander than myself.""There, General, that will do," said Thomas quietly.So it was settled that Fred was to stay for the present with General\nThomas.The next day Generals Thomas and Nelson went to Cincinnati to confer\nwith General Anderson, and Fred was invited to accompany them.Once more he was asked to lay before General Anderson the full text of\nthe conversation he had overheard at Georgetown.asked Thomas, who had listened very\nclosely to the recital."I am afraid," replied General Anderson, "that the authorities at\nWashington do not fully realize the condition of affairs in Kentucky.Neither have they any conception of the intrigue going on to take the\nState out of the Union.No doubt, General Buckner has been playing a\nsharp game at Washington.He seems to have completely won the confidence\nof the President.It is for this reason so many of our requests pass\nunheeded.If what young Shackelford has heard is true, General Buckner\nis now in Richmond.He is there to accept a command from the\nConfederate government, and is to return here to organize the disloyal\nforces of Kentucky to force the State out of the Union.Now, in the face\nof these facts, what do you think of this," and the general read the\nfollowing:\n\n\n     EXECUTIVE MANSION, Aug.My Dear Sir:--Unless there be reason to the contrary, not known to\n     me, make out a commission for Simon B. Buckner as a\n     Brigadier-General of volunteers.It is to be put in the hands of\n     General Anderson, and delivered to General Buckner, or not, at the\n     discretion of General Anderson.Of course, it is to remain a secret\n     unless and until the commission is delivered.During the reading, General Thomas sat with immovable countenance,\nbetraying neither approbation nor disgust.he roared, "are they all idiots at Washington?Give him his commission,\nAnderson, give him his commission, and then let Lincoln invite Jeff\nDavis to a seat in the cabinet.It would be as sensible," and then he\npoured forth such a volley of oaths that what he really meant to say\nbecame obscure.When he had blown himself out, General Thomas quietly said: "Now,\nGeneral, that you have relieved yourself, let us again talk business.""I don\'t believe you would change countenance, Thomas, if Beauregard was\nplaced in command of the Federal armies," replied Nelson, pettishly."But Central Kentucky needed just\nsuch fire and enthusiasm as you possess to save it from the clutches of\nthe rebels, and if I can only complete the grand work you have begun I\nshall be content, and not worry over whom the President recommends for\noffice.""You will complete it, General; my work could not be left in better\nhands," replied Nelson, completely mollified.In a few moments Nelson excused himself, as he had other duties to\nperform.Looking after him, General Anderson said: "I am afraid Nelson\'s temper\nand unruly tongue will get him into serious trouble yet.But he has done\nwhat I believe no other man could have done as well.To his efforts,\nmore than to any other one man, do we owe our hold on Kentucky.""His lion-like courage and indomitable energy will cover a multitude of\nfaults," was the reply of General Thomas.Fred returned to Camp Dick Robinson with General Thomas, and he soon\nfound that the general was fully as energetic as Nelson, though in a\nmore quiet way.The amount of work that General Thomas dispatched was\nprodigious.Every little detail was looked after, but there was no\nhurry, no confusion.The camp began to assume a more military aspect,\nand the men were brought under more thorough discipline.According to the\nprogram which Fred had heard outlined at Georgetown, the Confederates\nbegan their aggressive movements.Hickman, on the Mississippi River, was\noccupied by the Confederate army under General Polk on the 5th.As swift\nas a stroke of lightning, General Grant, who was in command at Cairo,\nIllinois, retaliated by occupying Paducah on the 6th.General Polk then\nseized the important post of Columbus on the 7th.A few days afterward\nGeneral Buckner moved north from Tennessee, and occupied Bowling Green.At the same time General Zollicoffer invaded the State from Cumberland\nGap.All three of these Confederate generals issued stirring addresses\nto all true Kentuckians to rally to their support.It was confidently\nexpected by the Confederate authorities that there would be a general\nuprising throughout the State in favor of the South.But they were\ngrievously disappointed; the effect was just the opposite.The\nLegislature, then in session at Frankfort, passed a resolution\ncommanding the Governor to issue a proclamation ordering the\nConfederates at once to evacuate the State.Governor Magoffin, much to\nhis chagrin, was obliged to issue the proclamation.A few days later the\nLegislature voted that the State should raise a force of 40,000 men, and\nthat this force be tendered the United States for the purpose of putting\ndown rebellion.An invitation was also extended to General Anderson to\nassume command of all these forces.Thus, to their chagrin, the\nConfederates saw their brightest hopes perish.Instead of their getting\npossession of the State, even neutrality had perished.The State was\nirrevocably committed to the Union, but the people were as hopelessly\ndivided as ever.It was to be a battle to the death between the opposing\nfactions.Shortly after his return to Dick Robinson, Fred began to long to hear\nfrom home, to know how those he loved fared; so he asked General Thomas\nfor a day or two of absence.It was readily granted, and soon he was on\nhis way to Danville.He found only his Uncle and Aunt Pennington at\nhome.His father had gone South to accept the colonelcy of a regiment,\nand was with Buckner.His cousin Calhoun had accompanied Colonel\nShackelford South, having the promise of a position on the staff of some\ngeneral officer.His little sister Bessie had been sent to Cincinnati to\na convent school.The adherents of the opposing factions were more\nbitter toward each other than ever, and were ready to spring at each\nother\'s throats at the slightest provocation.Neighbors were estranged,\nfamilies were broken, nevermore to be reunited; and over all there\nseemed to be hanging the black shadow of coming sorrow.Kentucky was not\nonly to be deluged in blood, but with the hot burning tears of those\nleft behind to groan and weep.Fred was received coldly by his uncle and aunt."You know," said Judge\nPennington, "my house is open to you, but I cannot help feeling the\nkeenest sorrow over your conduct.""I am sorry, very sorry, uncle, if what I have done has grieved you,"\nanswered Fred."No one can be really sorry who persists in his course," answered the\njudge."Fred, rather--yes, a thousand times--had I rather see you dead\nthan doing as you are.If my brave boy falls," and his voice trembled as\nhe spoke, "I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that he fell in a\nglorious cause.But you, Fred, you----" his voice broke; he could say no\nmore."Uncle," he softly said, "I admit you are honest\nand sincere in your belief.Why can you not admit as much for me?Why is\nit a disgrace to fight for the old flag, to defend the Union that\nWashington and Jefferson helped form, and that Jackson defended?""The wrong," answered Judge Pennington, "consists in trying to coerce\nsovereign States.The Constitution gives any State the right to withdraw\nfrom the Union at pleasure.The South is fighting for her constitutional\nrights----"\n\n"And for human slavery," added Fred."Look out, Fred," he exclaimed, choking with passion, "lest I drive you\nfrom my door, despite my promise to your father.You\nare not only fighting against the South, but you are becoming a detested\nAbolitionist--a <DW65> worshiper."Sandra went back to the hallway.Fred felt his manhood aroused, but controlling his passion he calmly\nreplied:\n\n"Uncle, I will not displease you longer with my presence.The time may\ncome when you may need my help, instead of my needing yours.If so, do\nnot hesitate to call on me.I still love my kindred as well as ever;\nthey are as near to me as ever.There is no dishonor in a man loyally\nfollowing what he honestly believes to be right.I believe you and my\nfather to be wrong--that your sympathies have led you terribly astray;\nbut in my sight you are none the less true, noble, honest men.As for\nme, I answer for myself.I am for the Union, now and forever.May God keep all of those we love from harm," and he rode away.Judge Pennington gazed after him with a troubled look, and then murmured\nto himself: "After all, a fine boy, a grand boy!Upon Fred\'s return to headquarters he found General Thomas in deep\nconsultation with his staff.Circulars had been scattered all over the\nState and notices printed in newspapers calling for a meeting of the\nState Guards at Lexington on the 20th.Ostensibly the object of the\nmeeting was to be for a week\'s drill, and for the purpose of better\npreparing the Guards to protect the interests of the State.But General\nThomas believed there was a hidden meaning in the call; that it was\nconceived in deceit, and that it meant treachery.What this treachery\nwas he did not know, and it was this point he was discussing with his\nstaff when Fred entered.The sight of the boy brought a smile to his\nface.he exclaimed, "I am glad to see you.We have a hard\nproblem; it is one rather in your line.He then laid the circular before Fred, and expressed his opinion that it\ncontained a hidden meaning."There is no end to those fellows\'\nplottings," he said, "and we are still weak, very weak here.With\nGeneral Zollicoffer moving this way from Cumberland Gap, it would not\ntake much of a force in our rear to cause a great disaster.In fact, a\nhostile force at Lexington, even if small, would be a serious matter."Fred read the circular carefully, as if reading between the lines, and\nthen asked:\n\n"It is the real meaning of this call that you wish?""By all means, if it can be obtained," answered the general."I will try to obtain it," replied Fred, quietly."General you may not\nhear from me for two or three days.""May success attend you, my boy," replied the general, kindly, and with\nthis he dismissed his staff."It has come to a pretty pass," said a dapper young lieutenant of the\nstaff to an older member, "that the general prefers a boy to one of us,"\nand he drew himself proudly up, as if to say, "Now, if the general had\ndetailed me, there might have been some hopes of success."The older member smiled, and answered: "I think it just as well,\nLieutenant, that he chose the boy.I don\'t think either you or me fitted\nfor that kind of work."Again a black-haired, dark-skinned boy left headquarters at Dick\nRobinson, this time for Lexington.Arriving there, Fred took a room at\nthe leading hotel, registering as Charles Danford, Cincinnati, thinking\nit best to take an entirely fictitious name.He soon learned that the\nleading Southern sympathizers of the city were in the habit of meeting\nin a certain room at the hotel.He kept very quiet, for there was one\nman in Lexington he did not care to meet, and that man was Major\nHockoday.He knew that the major would recognize him as the boy he met\nat Georgetown, and that meant the defeat of his whole scheme.Fred\'s\nfirst step was to make friends with the chamber maid, a comely mulatto\ngirl.This he did with a bit of flattery and a generous tip.By adroit\nquestioning, he learned that the girl had charge of the room in which\nthe meetings of the conspirators were held.Could she in any manner secrete him in the room during one of the\nmeetings?"No, youn\' massa, no!""Not fo\' fiv\' \'undred," answered the girl.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom."Massa kill me, if he foun\'\nit out."Fred saw that she could not be bribed; he would have to try a new tack."See here, Mary," he asked, "you would like to be free, would you not,\njust like a white girl?""Yes, massa, I woul\' like dat.""You have heard of President Lincoln, have you not?"The girl\'s eyes lit up with a sudden fire."Yes, Massa Linkun good; he\nwant to free we \'uns.All de <DW65>s talkin\' \'bout dat.""Mary, I am a friend of Lincoln.The\nmen who meet in that room are his enemies."I am here trying to find out their plans, so we can keep them from\nkilling Mr.Mary, you must help me, or you will be blamed for\nwhat may happen, and you will never be free.""Massa will whip me to death, if he foun\' it\nout," she blubbered."Your master will never find it out, even if I am discovered, for I will\nnever tell on you.""Yes; I will swear it on the Bible."Like most of her race, the girl was very superstitious, and had great\nreverence for the Bible.She went and brought one, and with his hand on\nthe book Fred took a most solemn oath never to betray her--no, not if he\nwas torn to pieces with red-hot pincers.Along toward night she came and whispered to Fred that she had been\ntold to place the room in order.There was, she said, but one place to\nhide, and that was behind a large sofa, which stood across one corner of\nthe room.It was a perilous hiding place, but Fred resolved to risk it."They can but kill me," thought he, "and I had almost as soon die as\nfail."It was getting dark when Mary unlocked the door of the room and let Fred\nslip in.He found that by lying close to the sofa, he might escape\ndetection, though one should glance over the top.The minutes passed like hours to the excited boy.The slightest noise\nstartled him, and he found himself growing nervous, and in spite of all\nhis efforts, a slight tremor shook his limbs.At last he heard\nfoot-falls along the hall, the door was unlocked, and some one entered\nthe room.It was the landlord, who lit the gas, looked carefully around,\nand went out.Fred\'s nervousness was all\ngone; but his heart beat so loudly that he thought it must be heard.It\nwas a notable gathering of men distinguished not only in State but\nnational affairs.Chief among them was John C. Breckinridge, as knightly\nand courteous as ever; then there were Colonel Humphrey Marshall, John\nH. Morgan, Colonel Preston, and a score of others.These men had\ngathered for the purpose of dragging Kentucky out of the Union over the\nvote of her citizens, and in spite of her loyal Legislature.In their\nzeal they threw to the winds their own beloved doctrine of State\nrights, and would force Kentucky into the Southern Confederacy whether\nshe wanted to go or not.They believed the South was right, that it was their duty to defend her,\nand that any means were lawful to bring about the desired end.Fred, as he lay in his hiding place, hardly dared to breathe.Once his\nheart ceased to beat when he heard Morgan say: "There is room behind\nthat sofa for one to hide."Colonel Marshall glanced behind it, and said: "There is no one there."Then they commenced to talk, and Fred lay and listened to the whole\nplot.The State Guards were to assemble, professedly, as the circular\nstated, for muster and drill, but really for one of the most daring of\n_coups-de-main_.The State arsenal at Frankfort was to be taken by surprise, and the arms\nsecured.The loyal Legislature was then to be dispersed at the point of\nthe bayonet, a provisional Legislature organized, and the State voted\nout of the Union.The force was then to attack Camp Dick Robinson, in\nconjunction with General Zollicoffer, who was to move up from Cumberland\nGap; and between the two forces it was thought the camp would fall an\neasy prey.In the mean time, Buckner was to make a dash for Louisville\nfrom Bowling Green.If he failed to take it by surprise, all the forces\nwere to join and capture it, thus placing the whole State in the control\nof the Confederates.It was a bold, but admirably conceived plan.Breckinridge pointed out that the plan was\nfeasible.He said the ball once started, thousands of Kentuckians would\nspring to arms all over the State.The plan was earnestly discussed and\nfully agreed to.The work of each man was carefully mapped out, and\nevery detail carefully arranged.At last the meeting was over, and the\ncompany began to pass out.He had succeeded; the full details of\nthe plot were in his possession.Waiting until all were well out of the\nroom, he crawled from his hiding place, and passed out.But he had\nexulted too soon in his success.He had scarcely taken three steps from\nthe door before he came face to face with Major Hockoday, who was\nreturning for something he had forgotten."Now I have you, you young imp of Satan,"\nand he made a grab for his collar.But Fred was as quick and lithe as a\ncat, and eluding the major\'s clutch, he gave him such a blow in the face\nthat it staggered him against the wall.Before he recovered from the\neffects of the blow Fred had disappeared.gasped the Major, and he made a grab for his\ncollar.]The major\'s face was\ncovered with blood, and he truly presented a gory appearance.It was\nsome time before the excitement subsided so the major could tell his\nstory.It was that a young villain had assaulted and attempted to murder\nhim.By his description, the landlord at once identified the boy as the\none who occupied room 45.But a search revealed the fact that the bird\nhad flown.It was also ascertained that the major had received no\nserious injury.By request of the major the meeting was hastily re-convened.There, in\nits privacy, he gave the true history of the attempted murder, as the\nguests of the hotel thought it.The major expressed his opinion that the\nboy was a spy.He was sure it was the same boy he had met in the hotel\nat Georgetown."You know," he said, "that the landlord at Georgetown\nfound a hole drilled through the plastering of the room that this boy\noccupied, into the one which was occupied by me and in which we held a\nmeeting.I tell you, the boy is a first-class spy, and I would not be\nsurprised if he was concealed somewhere in this room during the\nmeeting."cried several voices, but nevertheless a\nnumber of faces grew pale."There is no place he could hide in this room, except behind the sofa,\nand I looked there," said Marshall."Gentlemen," said the landlord, "this room is kept locked."All I know," said the major, "I met him about three paces from the\ndoor, just as I turned the corner.When I attempted to stop him, he\nsuddenly struck the blow and disappeared.If it was not for his black\nhair, I should be more than ever convinced that the boy was Fred\nShackelford.""In league with the devil, probably," growled Captain Conway.Daniel moved to the office."For if\nthere was ever one of his imps on earth, it\'s that Shackelford boy.Curse him, I will be even with him yet.""And so will I," replied the major, gently feeling of his swollen nose."Gentlemen," said John H. Morgan, "this is no time for idle regrets.Whether that boy has heard anything or not, we cannot tell.But from\nwhat Major Hockoday has said, there is no doubt but that he is a spy.His assault on the major and fleeing show that.So it behooves us to be\ncareful.I have a trusty agent at Nicholasville, who keeps me fully\ninformed of all that transpires there.I will telegraph him particulars,\nand have him be on the watch for such a boy."It was an uneasy crowd that separated that night.It looked as if one\nboy might bring to naught all their well-laid plans.The next morning Morgan received the following telegram from\nNicholasville:\n\n\n     JOHN H. MORGAN:\n\n     Early this morning a black-haired, dark-skinned boy, riding a jaded\n     horse, came in on the Lexington pike.Without stopping for\n     refreshments he left his horse, and procured a fresh one, which the\n     same boy left here a couple of days ago, and rode rapidly away in\n     the direction of Camp Dick Robinson."I must put all the boys on their\nguard."Late in the afternoon of the 19th the following telegram was received by\nMorgan from Nicholasville:\n\n\n     JOHN H. MORGAN:\n\n     Colonel Bramlette with his regiment has just forcibly taken\n     possession of a train of cars, and will at once start for\n     Lexington.That night Breckinridge, Marshall, Morgan and half a score of others\nfled from Lexington.Their plottings had come to naught; instead of\ntheir bright visions of success, they were fugitives from their homes.It would have fared ill with that black-haired boy if they could have\ngot hold of him just then.When Fred escaped from Major Hockoday, he lost no time in making his way\nto the home of one of the most prominent Union men of Lexington.Telling\nhim he had most important dispatches for General Thomas, a horse was\nprocured, and through the darkness of the night Fred rode to\nNicholasville, reaching there early in the morning.Leaving his tired\nhorse, and taking his own, which he had left there, he rode with all\nspeed to Camp Dick Robinson, and made his report to General Thomas.He warmly congratulated\nFred, saying it was a wonderful piece of work."Let\'s see," said he,\n"this is the 16th.I do not want to scare them, as I wish to make a fine\nhaul, take them right in their treasonable acts.It\'s the only way I can\nmake the government believe it.On the 19th I will send Colonel\nBramlette with his regiment with orders to capture the lot.I will also\nhave to guard against the advance of General Zollicoffer.As for the\nadvance of General Buckner on Louisville, that is out of my department.""And there," said Fred, "is where our greatest danger lies.Louisville\nis so far north they are careless, forgetting that Buckner has a\nrailroad in good repair on which to transport his men."answered Fred, and then he asked for a map.After studying it\nfor some time, he turned to Thomas and said:\n\n"General, I have a favor to ask.I would like a leave of absence for a\nweek.I have an idea I want to work out."Thomas sat looking at the boy a moment, and then said: "It is nothing\nrash, is it, my boy?""No more so than what I have done," answered Fred."In fact, I don\'t\nknow that I will do anything.It is only an idea I want to work on; it\nmay be all wrong.That is the reason I can\'t explain it to you.""You are not going to enter the enemy\'s lines as a spy, are you?You are too young and too valuable to risk your life that\nway.""No, General, at least I trust not.The rebels will have to get much\nfarther north than they are now if I enter their lines, even if I carry\nout my idea."Sandra went back to the kitchen."Very well, Fred; you have my consent, but be very careful.""I shall try to be so, General.I only hope that the suspicions I have\nare groundless, and my journey will prove a pleasure trip."Thus saying, Fred bade the general good day, and early the next morning\nhe rode away, taking the road to Danville.Fred did not stop in Danville; instead, he avoided the main street, so\nas to be seen by as few of his acquaintances as possible.He rode\nstraight on to Lebanon before he stopped.Here he put up for the night,\ngiving himself and his horse a good rest.The country was in such a\ndisturbed condition that every stranger was regarded with suspicion, and\nforced to answer a multitude of questions.Fred did not escape, and to\nall he gave the same answer, that he was from Danville, and that he was\non his way to Elizabethtown to visit his sick grandfather.He was especially interested\nin Prince, examining him closely, and remarking he was one of the finest\nhorses he ever saw.Fred learned that the man\'s name was Mathews, that\nhe was a horse dealer, and was also a violent sympathizer with the\nSouth.He was also reputed to be something of a bully.Fred thought some\nof his questions rather impertinent, and gave rather short answers,\nwhich did not seem to please Mathews.Leaving Lebanon early the next morning, he rode nearly west, it being\nhis intention to strike the Louisville and Nashville railroad a little\nsouth of Elizabethtown.It was a beautiful September day, and as Fred\ncantered along, he sang snatches of songs, and felt merrier and happier\nthan at any time since that sad parting with his father.And he thought of that strange\noath which bound Calhoun and himself together, and wondered what would\ncome of it all.But what was uppermost in his mind was the object of his\npresent journey.Was there anything in it, or was it a fool\'s errand?As he was riding along a country road, pondering these\nthings, it suddenly occurred to him that the landscape appeared\nfamiliar.He reined up his horse, and looked around.The fields\nstretching away before him, the few trees, and above all a tumbled down,\nhalf-ruined log hut.Yet he knew he had never\nbeen there before.Could he have seen this in a dream\nsometime?The more he looked, the more familiar it seemed; and the more\nhe was troubled.A countryman came along riding a raw-boned spavined horse; a rope served\nfor a bridle, and an old coffee sack strapped on the sharp back of the\nhorse took the place of a saddle.Having no stirrups, the countryman\'s\nhuge feet hung dangling down and swung to and fro, like two weights tied\nto a string; a dilapidated old hat, through whose holes stuck tufts of\nhis bleached tow hair, adorned his head."Stranger, you \'uns \'pears to be interested," he remarked to Fred, as\nhe reined in his steed, and at the same time ejected about a pint of\ntobacco juice from his capacious mouth."Yes," answered Fred, "this place seems to be very familiar--one that I\nhave seen many times; yet to my certain knowledge, I have never been\nhere before."Seen it in a picter, I reckon," drawled the countryman."Nothin\', stranger, only they do say the picter of that air blamed old\nshanty is every whar up No\'th.I don\'t see anything\ngreat in it.I wish it war sunk before he war born.""Why, man, what do you mean?replied the native, expectorating at a stone in the road, and\nhitting it fairly."I mean that the gol-all-fir\'-est, meanest cuss that\never lived war born thar, the man what\'s making war on the South, and\nwants to put the <DW65>s ekal to us.Abe Lincoln, drat him, war born in\nthat ole house."This then was the lowly birthplace of\nthe man whose name was in the mouths of millions.How mean, how poor it\nlooked, and yet to what a master mind it gave birth!The life of\nLincoln had possessed a peculiar fascination for Fred, and during the\npresidential campaign of the year before the picture of his birthplace\nhad been a familiar one to him.He now understood why the place looked\nso familiar.It was like looking on the face of one he had carefully\nstudied in a photograph."Reckon you are a stranger, or you would have knowed the place?""Yes, I am a stranger," answered Fred."Then this is the place where the\nPresident of the United States was born?""Yes, an\' it war a po\' day for ole Kentuck when he war born.Oughter to\nha\' died, the ole Abolitioner."Fred smiled, "Well," he said, "I must be going.I am very much obliged\nto you for your information.""Don\'t mention it, stranger, don\'t mention it.Say, that\'s a mighty fine\nhoss you air ridin\'; look out or some of them fellers scootin\' round the\ncountry will get him.Times mighty ticklish, stranger, mighty ticklish.and he extended a huge roll of Kentucky\ntwist."No, thank you," responded Fred, and bidding the countryman good day, he\nrode away leaving him in the road staring after him, and muttering:\n"Mighty stuck up!Wonder if he aint one of them\nAbolitioners!"It was the middle of the afternoon when Fred struck the railroad at a\nsmall station a few miles south of Elizabethtown.There was a crowd\naround the little depot, and Fred saw that they were greatly excited.Hitching his horse, he mingled with the throng, and soon learned that\nthe train from the south was overdue several hours.To add to the\nmystery, all telegraphic communication with the south had been severed.Strike the instrument as often as he might, the operator could get no\nresponse."It\'s mighty queer," said an intelligent looking man."There is mischief\nup the road of some kind.Here Louisville has been telegraphing like mad\nfor hours, and can\'t get a reply beyond this place."Here the operator came out and announced that telegraphic communication\nhad also been severed on the north."We are entirely cut off," he said.We will have\nto wait and see what\'s the matter, that\'s all."Just then away to the south a faint tinge of smoke was seen rising, and\nthe cry was raised that a train was coming.The excitement arose to\nfever heat, and necks were craned, and eyes strained to catch the first\nglimpse of the train.At length its low rumbling could be heard, and\nwhen at last it hove in sight, it was seen to be a very heavy one.Slowly it drew up to the station, and to the surprise of the lookers-on\nit was loaded down with soldiers.shouted the soldiers, and the crowd took up\nthe cry.It was Buckner\'s army from Bowling Green en route for\nLouisville by train, hoping thereby to take the place completely by\nsurprise.Telegraphic communications\nall along the line had been severed by trusty agents; the Federal\nauthorities at Louisville were resting in fancied security; the city was\nlightly guarded.In fancy, he heard his name\non every tongue, and heard himself called the greatest military genius\nof the country.When the crowd caught the full meaning of the movement,\ncheer after cheer made the welkin ring.They grasped the soldiers\'\nhands, and bade them wipe the Yankees from the face of the earth.This was the idea of which he\nspoke to General Thomas.He had an impression that General Buckner might\nattempt to do just what he was now doing.It was the hope of thwarting\nthe movement, if made, that had led Fred to make the journey.His\nimpressions had proven true; he was on the ground, but how to stop the\ntrain was now the question.He had calculated on plenty of time, that he\ncould find out when the train was due, and plan his work accordingly.In a moment or two it would be gone, and\nwith it all opportunity to stop it.If\nanything was done, it must be done quickly.The entire population of\nthe little village was at the depot; there was little danger of his\nbeing noticed.Dashing into a blacksmith shop he secured a sledge; then\nmounting his horse, he rode swiftly to the north.About half a mile from\nthe depot there was a curve in the track which would hide him from\nobservation.Jumping Prince over the low fence which guarded the\nrailroad, in a few seconds he was at work with the sledge trying to\nbatter out the spikes which held a rail in position.His face was pale,\nhis teeth set.Great drops of perspiration stood\nout on his forehead, and his blows rang out like the blows of a giant.The train whistled; it was ready to start.Between his strokes he could hear the clang of the bell, the\nparting cheers of the crowd.The heads of the\nspikes flew off; they were driven in and the plates smashed.One end of\na rail was loosened; it was driven in a few inches.The deed was done,\nand none too soon.So busy was Fred that he had not noticed that two men on horseback had\nridden up to the fence, gazed at him a moment in astonishment, then\nshouted in anger, and dismounted.Snatching a revolver from his pocket,\nFred sent a ball whistling by their ears, and yelled: "Back!Jumping on their horses quicker than they dismounted, they galloped\ntoward the approaching train, yelling and wildly gesticulating.The\nengineer saw them, but it was before the day of air brakes, and it was\nimpossible to stop the heavy train.The engine plunged off the track,\ntore up the ground and ties for a few yards, and then turned over on its\nside, where it lay spouting smoke and steam, and groaning like a thing\nof life.It lay partly across the track, thus completely blocking it.The engineer and fireman had jumped, and so slowly was the train running\nthat the cars did not leave the track.For this Fred was devoutly\nthankful.He had accomplished his object, and no one had been injured.Jumping on his horse, he gave a shout of triumph and rode away.But the frightened soldiers had been pouring from the cars.The two men\non horseback were pointing at Fred and yelling: "There!there goes the\nvillain who did it."thundered a colonel who had just sprung out of the\nforemost car.Fred\'s horse, was seen to stumble\nslightly; the boy swayed, and leaned forward in his seat; but quickly\nrecovering himself, he turned around and waving his hat shouted\ndefiance.thundered a Colonel who had just sprung out\nof the foremost car.]"That is Fred Shackelford, and\nthat horse is Prince."The colonel\nwho had given the order to fire turned pale, staggered and would have\nfallen if one of his officers had not caught him."I ordered my men to fire on my own son."The officers gathered around General Buckner, who stood looking at the\nwrecked engine with hopeless despair pictured in every feature.His\nvisions of glory had vanished, as it were, in a moment.No plaudits from\nan admiring world, no "Hail!Utter failure\nwas the end of the movement for which he had hoped so much.It would take hours to clear away the wreck.He groaned\nin the agony of his spirit, and turned away.His officers stood by in\nsilence; his sorrow was too great for words of encouragement.Colonel Shackelford tottered up\nto General Buckner, pale as death, and trembling in every limb."General," he gasped, "it was my boy, my son who did this.I am unworthy\nto stand in your presence for bringing such a son into the world.Cashier me, shoot me if you will.The soul of the man who refused to desert his soldiers at Fort Donelson,\nwhen those in command above him fled, who afterwards helped bear General\nGrant to his tomb, with a heart as tender as that of a woman, now\nasserted itself.His own terrible disappointment was forgotten in the\nsorrow of his friend.Grasping the hand of Colonel Shackelford, he said\nwith the deepest emotion:\n\n"Colonel, not a soldier will hold you responsible.This is a struggle\nin which the noblest families are divided.If this deed had been for the\nSouth instead of the North, you would be the proudest man in the\nConfederacy.Can we not see the bravery, the heroism of the deed, even\nthough it has dashed our fondest hopes to the ground, shattered and\nbroken?No, Colonel, I shall not accept your resignation.I know you\nwill be as valiant for the South, as your son has been for the North."Tears gushed from Colonel Shackelford\'s eyes; he endeavored to speak,\nbut his tongue refused to express his feelings.The officers, although\nbowed down with disappointment, burst into a cheer, and there was not\none who did not feel prouder of their general in his disappointment than\nif he had been successful.General Thomas had warned\nGeneral Anderson, who had moved his headquarters to that city, that\nGeneral Buckner was contemplating an advance.But it was thought that he\nwould come with waving banners and with the tramp of a great army, and\nthat there would be plenty of time to prepare for him.Little did they\nthink he would try to storm the city with a train of cars, and be in\ntheir midst before they knew it.When the train was delayed and\ntelegraphic communications severed, it was thought that some accident\nhad happened.There was not the slightest idea of the true state of\naffairs.As hours passed and nothing was heard of the delayed train, a\ntrain of discovery was sent south to find out what was the matter.This\ntrain ran into Buckner\'s advance at Elizabethtown, and was seized.Not hearing anything from this train, an engine was sent after it.Still\nthere was no idea of what had happened, no preparations to save\nLouisville.This engine ran into Buckner\'s advance at Muldraugh Hill.The fireman was a loyal man and at once grasped the situation.He leaped\nfrom his engine and ran back.What could this one man do, miles from\nLouisville, and on foot!Meeting some section hands\nwith a handcar, he shouted: "Back!the road above is swarming with\nrebels."Great streams of perspiration ran down their\nbodies; their breath came in gasps, and still the fireman shouted: "Work\nher lively, boys, for God\'s sake, work her lively!"At last Louisville was reached, and for the first time the facts known.Once\nmore the devoted Home Guards, the men who saved the city from riot and\nbloodshed on July 22d, sprang to arms.General Rousseau was ordered from\nacross the river.These, with the Home Guards,\nmade a force of nearly 3,000 men.These men were hurried on board the\ncars, and sent forward under the command of General W. T. Sherman.Through the darkness of the night this train felt its way.On reaching\nRolling Fork of Salt River the bridge was found to be burnt.Despairing\nof reaching Louisville, General Buckner had destroyed the bridge to\ndelay the advance of the Federal troops.But how many American boys and girls know the name\nof the daring young man who tore up the track, or the brave fireman who\nbrought back the news?[A]\n\nBut how was it with Fred; had he escaped unhurt from that volley?The stumble of his horse was caused by stepping into a hole, yet slight\nas the incident was, it saved Fred\'s life, for it threw him slightly\nforward, and at the same moment a ball tore through the crown of his\nhat.Another ball struck the crupper of his saddle, and another one\nbored a hole through Prince\'s right ear.As soon as he was out of sight Fred stopped, and, ascertaining that no\ndamage had been done, excepting the perforating of Prince\'s ear and his\nhat, he patted his horse\'s neck and said: "Ah, Prince, old boy, you are\nmarked now for life, but it is all right.I shall always know you by\nthat little hole through your ear."Fred stopped that night at a planter\'s house, who at first viewed him\nwith some suspicion; but when he was told of Buckner\'s advance, he was\nso overjoyed, being an ardent Secessionist, that there was nothing good\nenough for his guest.The next day, when Fred rode into Lebanon, the first man that he saw\nwas Mathews, who sauntered up to him, and said in a sarcastic tone: "It\nseems, young man, that you made a short visit to your poor sick\ngrandfather."I didn\'t\nsee the old gentleman; I concluded to come back.Things are getting a\nlittle too brisk up there for me.Buckner has advanced, and there may be\nsome skirmishing around Elizabethtown.""And so you run," exclaimed Mathews in a tone which made Fred\'s blood\nboil.All of this time Mathews had been carefully looking over the boy\nand horse, and quite a crowd had collected around them.continued Mathews; "a round hole through your horse\'s ear, been\nbleeding, too; your saddle torn by a bullet, and a hole through your\nhat.Boy, you had better give an account of yourself.""Not at your command," replied Fred, hotly."And I deny your right to\nquestion me.""You do, do you, my fine young fellow?I will show you," and he made a\ngrab for Prince\'s bridle.A sharp, quick word from Fred, and the horse sprang, overthrowing\nMathews, and scattering the crowd right and left.Mathews arose, shaking\nthe dust from his clothes and swearing like a trooper.A fine-looking man had just ridden up to the crowd as the incident\noccurred.He looked after the flying boy, and nervously fingered the\nrevolver in his holster.Then a smile came over his face, and he spoke\nto Mathews, who was still swearing and loudly calling for a horse to\npursue Fred."No use, Jim; you might as well chase a streak of lightning.That is the\nfastest horse in Kentucky."Mathews looked at the man a moment in surprise, and then exclaimed:\n"Heavens!"Made a run for it night before last," replied Morgan with a laugh, "to\nkeep from being nabbed by old Thomas.But what was the fuss between you\nand that boy?I wonder what he was doing out here any way?But, Mathews,\nhe did upset you nicely; I think you rolled over at least six times.""I will be even with him yet," growled Mathews.I have heard half a dozen men say that, myself included.But let\'s\nhear what the rumpus was about."When Morgan heard the story, he said: "So Buckner is at Elizabethtown,\nis he?I was going to Bowling Green, but now\nI will change my course to Elizabethtown.But I would like to know what\nthat boy has been doing.From what you say he must have been in a\nskirmish.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Trying to throw a train off the track, perhaps; it would be\njust like him.""But, Mathews," he continued, "the boy is gone, so let us talk\nbusiness.I am going to raise a regiment of cavalry for the Confederate\nservice, and I want you to raise a company.""That I will, John," said Mathews."There is no other man I had rather\nride under."Fred laughed heartily as he looked back and saw Mathews shaking the dust\nfrom himself.Finding that he was not pursued he brought Prince down to\na walk."I could almost swear," he said to himself, "that I caught a\nglimpse of Morgan as I dashed through the crowd.Thomas surely ought to\nhave him before this time.As he was riding through Danville he met his uncle, Judge Pennington,\nwho, to his surprise, greeted him most cordially, and would insist on\nhis stopping a while."Over towards Elizabethtown to see my sick grandfather," replied Fred,\ngravely.asked his uncle, somewhat nettled."Well, uncle, I have been over towards Elizabethtown ostensibly to see\nmy grandfather, but really to see what I could find over there.""I found Buckner\'s men as thick as hops, and I found a warm reception\nbesides.Look here," and he showed his uncle the hole through his hat."If you will go out and look at Prince, you will find a hole through\nhis ear, and you will also find the saddle torn with a bullet.Oh, yes,\nBuckner\'s men were glad to see me; they gave me a warm reception.""Oh, I side-tracked one of their trains.""Fred," said he, "you are engaging in\ndangerous business.I have heard of\nsome of your doings."Then it was he I saw at Lebanon."Because--because--I thought--I thought he was in Lexington.""It was because," answered the judge, severely, "that you thought he was\na prisoner at Camp Dick Robinson.Ah, Fred, you were not as sharp as you\nthought.You foiled their plans; but, thank God!All pretense of neutrality is now at an\nend.These men will now be found in the ranks, fighting for the liberty\nof the South.As for Morgan, he will be heard from, mark my word.""He is a daring fellow, and sharp,\ntoo; yes, I believe he will be heard from.""Fred, Morgan thinks you have had more to do with finding out their\nplans than any other one person.""Morgan does me too much honor," replied Fred, quietly.The judge remained quiet for a moment, and then said: "My boy, I wish\nyou could have seen Morgan before you had so thoroughly committed\nyourself to the other side.He\nbelieves if he could talk with you, you might be induced to change your\nmind.He says in the kind of work in which he expects to engage, you\nwould be worth a brigade of men.Fred, will you, will you not think of\nthis?You are breaking our hearts with your course now.""Dear uncle," replied Fred, "I thank Morgan for his good opinion, and I\nreciprocate his opinion; for of all the men I have met, I believe he,\nmost of all, has the elements of a dashing, successful leader.But as\nfor his offer, I cannot consider it for a moment."The judge sighed, and Fred saw that his further presence was not\ndesirable, so he made his adieus, and rode away.Morgan wants to win me over," thought Fred, "and that was the\nreason uncle was so nice.I think this last scrape has burnt the bridges\nbetween us, and they will trouble me no more."Fred made his report to General Thomas, who heard it with evident\nsatisfaction."This, then, was your idea, Fred?""Yes, General, I in some way conceived the notion that Buckner would try\nto surprise Louisville just as he did try to do.I knew that trains were\nrunning regularly between Nashville and Louisville, and thought that a\nsurprise could be effected.But the idea was so vague I was ashamed to\ntell you, for fear of exciting ridicule.So, I got my leave of absence\nand stole off, and if nothing had come of it, no one would have been the\nwiser."General Thomas smiled, and said: "It was an idea worthy of a great\ngeneral, Fred.General Anderson has much to thank you for, as well as\nthe people of Louisville.But you must take a good rest now, both you\nand your horse.From appearances, I think it will not be many days\nbefore General Zollicoffer will give us plenty to do."FOOTNOTE:\n\n[A] The name of the gallant young man who tore up the track was\nCrutcher; the author does not know the name of the fireman.On October 7th General Anderson, at his own request, was relieved of the\ncommand of the Department of Kentucky, on account of continued\nill-health.The next day General W. T. Sherman, a man destined to fill\nan important place in the history of the war, was appointed to the\nposition.Sandra moved to the office.Both the Federal and the Confederate governments had now\nthrown aside all pretense of neutrality.Kentucky echoed to the martial\ntread of armed men.At Maysville under General Nelson, at Camp Dick Robinson under General\nThomas, at Louisville under General Sherman, and at Paducah under\nGeneral Grant, the Federal government was gathering its hosts; while the\nConfederate government with its troops occupied Columbus, Bowling Green,\nCumberland Gap, and the mountains of eastern Kentucky.General Albert\nSydney Johnston, one of the ablest of the Confederate generals, was in\nsupreme command, with headquarters at Bowling Green.General Zollicoffer marched from Cumberland Gap early in the month, and\nassumed offensive operations.When General Sherman took command, Fred was sent by General Thomas to\nLouisville with dispatches.General Sherman had heard of some of the\nexploits of the young messenger, and he was received very kindly.Sherman, at that time, was in the prime of life.Straight as an arrow,\nof commanding presence, he was every inch a soldier.He was quick and\nimpulsive in his actions, and to Fred seemed to be a bundle of nerves.In conversation he was open and frank and expressed his opinion freely,\nin this resembling General Nelson.But the rough, overbearing nature of\nNelson he entirely lacked.He was one of the most courteous of men.He would have Fred tell of some of his exploits, and when he gave an\naccount of his first journey to Louisville, and his adventure with\nCaptain Conway, the general was greatly pleased.Fred\'s account of how\nhe discovered the details of the plot at Lexington was received with\nastonishment, and he was highly complimented.But the climax came when\nhe told of how he had thrown the train from the track, and thus brought\nBuckner\'s intended surprise to naught.The general jumped up, grasped\nFred\'s hand, and exclaimed:\n\n"That, young man, calls for a commission, if I can get you one, and I\nthink I can.""General," replied Fred, "I thank you very much, but I do not wish a\ncommission.It is true, I am hired\nprivately by General Nelson, and if I understand rightly I am getting\nthe pay of a lieutenant; but I am not bound by oath to serve any length\nof time, neither could I have accomplished what I have if I had been a\nregular enlisted soldier.""But remember, if you are ever in\nneed of any favor, do not hesitate to call on me."This Fred readily promised, and left the general, highly elated over the\ninterview.Before leaving Louisville, Fred did not forget to call on the Vaughns.He found Miss Mabel well, and he thought her more beautiful than ever.A\nsad, pensive look on her face but added to her loveliness.Only the day\nbefore she had bidden her betrothed farewell, and he had marched to the\nfront to help fight the battles of his country.As she hung weeping\naround his neck, he pointed to a little miniature flag pinned on his\nbreast--it was the same flag that Mabel wore on that day she was beset\nby the mob--and said:\n\n"Dearest, it shall be worn there as long as my heart beats.Never shall\nit be touched by a traitorous hand as long as I live.Every time I look\nupon it, it will be an incentive to prove worthy of the brave girl who\nwore it on her breast in the face of a brutal mob."Then with one fond clasp of the hands, one long lingering kiss, he was\ngone; and to Mabel all the light and joy of the world seemed to go with\nhim.But the coming of Fred brought new thoughts, and for the time her eyes\ngrew brighter, her cheeks rosier and laugh happier.The bright, brave\nboy who saved her from the mob was very welcome, and to her he was only\na boy, a precious, darling boy.They made Fred relate his adventures, and one minute Mabel\'s eyes would\nsparkle with fun, and the next melt in tenderness.In spite of himself,\nFred\'s heart beat very fast, he hardly knew why.But when he told with\ntrembling voice how he had parted from his father, and how he had been\ndisowned and driven from home, the sympathy of the impulsive girl\novercame her, and with eyes swimming in tears, she arose, threw her arms\naround him, imprinted a kiss on his forehead, and murmured: "Poor boy!Then turning to her mother, she said, "We will adopt him,\nwon\'t we, mother, and I will have a brother."Then remembering what she had done, she retired blushing and in\nconfusion to her seat.That kiss finished Fred; it thrilled him through\nand through.Yet somehow the thought of being a brother to Mabel didn\'t\ngive him any satisfaction.He knew Mabel looked upon him as only a boy,\nand the thought made him angry, but the next moment he was ashamed of\nhimself.He took his leave, promising to call the next time he was in\nthe city, and went away with conflicting emotions.Fred was really suffering from an attack of first love, and didn\'t know\nit.It was better for him that he didn\'t, for it was the sooner\nforgotten.On his return to Camp Dick Robinson Fred found that General Thomas had\nadvanced some of his troops toward Cumberland Gap.Colonel Garrard was\noccupying an exposed position on the Rock Castle Hills, and Fred was\nsent to him with dispatches.Fred found the little command in\nconsiderable doubt over the movements of General Zollicoffer.One hour\nthe rumor would be that he was advancing, and the next hour would bring\nthe story that he was surely retreating.Colonel Garrard feared that he\nwould be attacked with a greatly superior force.Fred resolved that he would do a little scouting on his own account.Colonel Garrard offered to send a small party with him, but Fred\ndeclined the offer, saying that a squad would only attract attention,\nand if he ran into danger he would trust to the fleetness of his horse\nto save him.Riding east, he made a wide detour, and at last came to where he thought\nhe must be near the enemy\'s lines.In his front was a fine plantation;\nnear by, in the woods, some <DW64>s were chopping.These <DW64>s he\nresolved to interview.His appearance created great consternation, and\nsome of them dropped their axes, and looked as if about to run."Don\'t be afraid, boys," said Fred, kindly."I only want to know who\nlives in yonder house.""Not now, sah; he down to Zollicoffer camp.""Oh, then General Zollicoffer is camped near here?""Yes, sah; \'bout two mile down de road.""Do any of the soldiers ever come this way?""Yes, sah; \'bout twenty went up de road not mo\' than two hours ago.Den\na capin man, he cum to see Missy Alice most ebber day.""Thank you," said Fred, as he rode away."I think I will pay a visit to\nMissy Alice myself."Riding boldly up to the house, he dismounted.Before entering the house\nhe accosted an old <DW64> who was working in the yard, and slipping a\ndollar into his hand, said:\n\n"Uncle, if you see any one coming either way, will you cry, \'Massa, your\nhorse is getting away?\'""Trus\' me fo\' dat," said the old man, grinning from ear to ear."I jess\nmake dat hoss jump, and den I yell, \'Massa, hoss gittin\' way.\'""That\'s it, uncle, you are all right," and Fred turned and went into the\nhouse, where he introduced himself as a Mr.He\nhad friends in Zollicoffer\'s army, and had run the gauntlet of the\nFederal lines to visit them.Could they tell him how far it was to\nGeneral Zollicoffer\'s camp.Mary went back to the office.The ladies received him coldly, but told him the distance.But Fred was\nnot to be repulsed.He was a good talker, and he tried his best.He told\nthem the news of the outside world, and what the Yankees were doing, and\nhow they would soon be driven from the State.This at once endeared him\nto the ladies, especially the younger, who was a most pronounced little\nrebel.Miss Alice was a comely girl, somewhere between twenty and\ntwenty-five years of age, and by a little but well directed flattery\nFred completely won her confidence.She inquired after some\nacquaintances in Lexington, and by a happy coincidence Fred knew them,\nand the conversation became animated.At length Fred remarked: "I hope it will not be long before General\nZollicoffer will advance.We are getting anxious up at Lexington; we\nwant to see the Yankees driven into the Ohio.""You will not have to wait long," replied the girl."Captain Conway\ntells me they are about ready, and will advance on the 20th or 21st----"\nshe stopped suddenly, bit her lip, and looked scared.In all probability she had told something that Captain Conway had told\nher to keep secret.Fred did not appear to notice her confusion, and at\nonce said: "Conway, Conway, Captain Conway.Is it Captain P. C. Conway\nof whom you speak?""Yes, sir," replied the girl, brightening up."Why, I know him, know him like a book; in fact, we are old\nfriends--special friends, I may say.He would rejoice to find me here,"\nand then he added mentally, "and cut my throat.""A brilliant soldier, and a brave one, is Captain Conway," continued\nFred, "and if he is given an opportunity to distinguish himself, it will\nnot be long before it will be Major or Colonel Conway."This praise pleased Miss Alice greatly, and she informed Fred that he\nwould soon have the pleasure of meeting his friend; that she expected\nhim every moment.Fred moved somewhat uneasily in his chair.He had no desire to meet\nCaptain Conway, and he was about to make an excuse of going out to see\nhow his horse was standing, when they were startled by the old <DW64>\nrunning toward the house and yelling at the top of his voice: "Massa,\nmassa, yo\' hoss is gittin\' away."The sly old fellow had thrown a stone at Prince, and the horse was\nrearing and plunging.Fred dashed out of the house; a party of horsemen was coming up the\nroad, in fact, was nearly to the house.It was but the work of a moment\nfor Fred to unhitch his horse and vault into the saddle, but the party\nwas now not more than fifty yards away.They had noticed the horse hitched at the gate, and were coming at full\nspeed to try and surprise the owner.The moment Conway saw Fred he knew\nhim.he cried, "Fred Shackelford, what luck!"and snatched a pistol\nfrom the holster and fired.The ball whistled past Fred\'s head\nharmlessly, and he turned in the saddle and returned the fire.It was\nthe first time he had ever shot at a man, and even in the heat of\nexcitement he experienced a queer sensation, a sinking of the heart, as\nthough he were committing a crime.Fairly and squarely the ball from his revolver struck the horse of\nCaptain Conway in the forehead, and the animal fell dead, the rider\nrolling in the dust.His men stopped the pursuit, and,\ndismounting, gathered around the captain, thinking he was killed.But he sprang to his feet, shouting: "A hundred dollars to the one who\nwill take that young devil, dead or alive.Here, Corporal Smith, you\nhave a fleet horse, let me take him," and jumping into the saddle, he\nwas in pursuit, followed by all his men, except Corporal Smith, who\nstood in the road looking after them.asked the two ladies, who stood\non the veranda, wringing their hands, and very much excited."Blamed if I know," answered the corporal."The sight of that young chap\nseemed to make the captain kinder crazy.The moment he caught sight of\nhim, he called him by name, and banged away at him.""You say the captain called him by name?""Well, he said he knew the captain, and that he was one of his best\nfriends.The corporal had no explanation to offer, so went and took a look at the\ncaptain\'s horse.In the meantime the pursued and the pursuers had passed out of sight up\nthe road, enveloped in a cloud of dust."Remember, boys," shouted Conway, "a hundred dollars to the one who\nbrings him down.But it was nothing but play for Fred to distance them, and he laughed to\nthink that they expected to catch him.But the laugh suddenly died on\nhis lips; he turned pale, and glanced hurriedly to the right and left.A\nhigh rail fence ran on each side of the road.The scouting party of\nwhich the <DW64>s spoke was returning.Captain Conway saw the other party, and shouted in triumph."Now, boys, we have him," and he spurred his horse forward, revolver in\nhand.There was a look of malignant hatred on his face, and he muttered:\n"Now, my boy, I will settle scores with you.I shall never take you back\nto camp.\'Captured a spy, killed while trying to escape.\'As for Fred, even in his extremity, his courage or his presence of mind\nnever deserted him.He felt that to be captured by Conway was death, for\nhad not the captain sworn to kill him on sight?His mind was made up; he\nwould wheel and charge the captain\'s party.Just as he was about to do this, he espied an opening in the\nfence on the left.As quick as thought he dashed through it, thinking it\nmight afford a chance of escape.The field\nwas a perfect cul-de-sac, bounded on all sides by a high rail fence, the\nonly opening the one he had come through.Through this opening the enemy poured, and when they saw the trap which\nFred had entered, their shouts made the welkin ring.Their shouts rang in Fred\'s ears like the tolling of a\nfuneral bell.So must the bay of hounds sound in the ears of the hunted\nquarry.It was built of heavy rails, and\nfull seven feet high.Bending over his horse\'s\nneck, Fred said: "Prince, it is a question of life or death.Do your\nbest, old fellow; we can but fail."With\ndistended nostrils, eyes flashing with excitement, and every muscle\nquivering, he gathered himself for the mighty spring.As lightly as a\nbird he cleared the fence, staggered as he struck the ground on the\nother side, then on again like the wind.Mary moved to the kitchen.Fred turned in his saddle, and uttered a yell of defiance.But the hands of his troopers were unsteady,\nand the shots went wild.Before his men could dismount and throw down\nthe fence, Fred was beyond pursuit.Captain Conway fairly foamed at the\nmouth.He raved and swore like a madman."It\'s no use swearing, Captain," said a grizzled lieutenant."I thought\nI knew something about horses, but that beat any leap I ever saw.I would rather have the horse than the boy."it\'s the divil\'s own lape," said an Irishman in the\ncompany, and he crossed himself.The baffled troopers returned crestfallen and cross.Captain Conway was\nso out of temper that even when the ladies asked him if his fall hurt\nhim, he answered angrily."Captain," said Alice, somewhat ruffled by his manner, "what is it\nbetween that boy and you?He said he knew you, was in fact a dear friend\nof yours, but you no sooner saw him than you shot at him; and Corporal\nSmith says you called him by name, so you did know him.""Alice," replied the captain, "I do not intend to be rude, but I am all\nput out.That boy is a spy, a mean, sneaking spy.It was he that discovered our plot at Lexington.""And I told him----" She stopped\nsuddenly.nothing, nothing; only what a good fellow you were."The captain looked at her sharply, and said: "It is well you gave away\nno secrets."Fred made his way back to camp with a thankful heart.He told Colonel\nGarrard of the intended attack, and then started back for the\nheadquarters of General Thomas.It was a long and hard ride, and it was\nwell in the small hours of the night when he arrived.The general was\naroused and the news of the expected attack told.He quietly wrote a\ncouple of orders, and went back to his bed.One order was to General\nSchoepf to at once march his brigade to the relief of Colonel Garrard at\nRock Castle.The other was sent to Colonel Connell at Big Hill to move\nhis regiment to Rock Castle, instead of advancing toward London as\nordered.Both orders were obeyed, and both commands were in position on the 20th.General Zollicoffer made his expected attack on the 21st, and was easily\nrepulsed.The battle was a small one; nothing but a skirmish it would\nhave been called afterwards; but to the soldiers engaged at that time,\nit looked like a big thing.It greatly encouraged the Federal soldiers,\nand correspondingly depressed the soldiers of Zollicoffer\'s army.Fred got back to Rock Castle in time to see the battle.It was his first\nsight of dead and wounded soldiers.And as he looked on the faces of the\ndead, their sightless eyes upturned to heaven, and the groans of the\nwounded sounding in his ears, he turned sick at heart, and wondered why\nmen created in the image of God would try to kill and maim each other.And yet, a few moments before, he himself was wild with the excitement\nof battle, and could scarcely be restrained from rushing into it.The next day the army advanced, and passed the place where Fred met\nwith his adventure, and he thought he would make another visit to Miss\nAlice Johnson.But that young lady gave him a cold reception.She called\nhim a "miserable, sneaking Yankee," and turned her back on him in\ndisgust.He didn\'t hear the last of his call on Miss Johnson.Fred pointed out the place where his horse had leaped the fence, and\nofficers and men were astonished, and Prince became as much a subject of\npraise as his rider.It was a common saying among the soldiers as he\nrode by, "There goes the smartest boy and best horse in Kentucky."When Fred returned to Camp Dick Robinson, he found a letter awaiting him\nfrom General Nelson.The general was making a campaign against a portion\nof the command of General Humphrey Marshall in the mountains of Eastern\nKentucky, and wrote that if Fred could possibly come to him to do so."Of course; go at once," said General Thomas, when the letter was shown\nhim."I am sorry to lose you, but I think Zollicoffer will be rather\nquiet for a while, and General Nelson has the first claim on you.I\nshall always be grateful to you for the service you have rendered me.I\ntrust that it is but the beginning of still closer relations in the\nfuture."It was fated that General Thomas and Fred were to be much together\nbefore the war closed.CHAPTER X.\n\nIN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.To his dismay, Fred noticed that the letter of General Nelson was dated\nthe 10th of October, and it was now the last of the month.For some\nreason the letter had been greatly delayed.It was known that Nelson was already in the mountains of Eastern\nKentucky; therefore no time was to be lost if Fred joined him.Much to\nhis regret, Fred had to leave Prince behind.Afterwards he blessed his\nstars that he did, for if he had taken the horse he would have lost him\nforever.Fred traveled to Cincinnati by rail, and then by boat up the Ohio to\nMaysville.He found that Nelson had not only been gone from Maysville\nfor some days, but that there was no direct line of communication with\nhis army.Nothing daunted, he determined to follow, and procuring a\nhorse, he started on his journey alone and unattended, and against the\nadvice of the officer in command at Maysville."Wait," said that officer, "until we send forward a train.It will be\nstrongly guarded, and you will escape all danger of capture."He believed it to be his duty to join Nelson\nas soon as possible.By hard riding, he reached Hazel Green on the\nevening of the second day, and without adventure.Here he learned that\nNelson\'s command had left the place only two days before, and was now\nsupposed to be at or near Prestonburg, and there were rumors of fighting\nat that place.The next morning Fred pressed forward in high spirits, thinking he would\novertake at least the rear of Nelson\'s army by night.Along in the\nafternoon four cavalrymen suddenly confronted him, blocking the road.As they all had on the blue Federal overcoat, Fred had not the remotest\nidea but that they belonged to Nelson\'s army, and riding boldly up to\nthem asked how far the command was in advance.asked one of the party, who appeared to be the leader."Why, Nelson\'s command, of course," replied Fred, in surprise.But the\nwords were hardly out of his mouth before four revolvers were leveled on\nhim, and he was commanded to surrender.There was no alternative but to\nsubmit as gracefully as possible."Now, boys," said the leader, "we will see what we have captured.It must be borne in mind that Fred was dressed in civilian clothes, and\ntherefore could not be taken prisoner as a soldier.The soldiers, after going through his pockets, handed the contents to\ntheir leader."Ah," said that personage with a wicked grin, "young man, you may go\nalong with us to Colonel Williams.For aught I know, these letters may\nhang you," and filing off from the Prestonburg road, they took a rough\nmountain road for Piketon.Fred afterward found that the four soldiers were a scouting party that\nhad got in the rear of Nelson\'s army in the hopes of picking up some\nstragglers, their only reward being himself.As was said, the party\nconsisted of four.The leader, Captain Bascom, was a hooked-nosed,\nferret-eyed man, who frequently took deep draughts from a canteen\ncontaining what was familiarly known as "mountain dew"--whisky distilled\nby the rough mountaineers.Being half-drunk all the time added intensity\nto a naturally cruel, tyrannical disposition.One of the soldiers named Drake was a burly, red-faced fellow, who\nseemed to be a boon companion of the captain; at least one took a drink\nas often as the other.Another of the soldiers answered to the name of\nLyle; he was a gloomy, taciturn man, and said little.The remaining one\nof Fred\'s captors was a mere boy, not older than himself.He was a\nbright-eyed, intelligent looking fellow, tough and muscular, and from\nhis conversation vastly above the station in life of his comrades before\nhe enlisted.It was not long before Fred discovered that Captain Bascom\ntook delight in worrying the boy, whose name was Robert Ferror.In this\nhe was followed to a greater or less extent by Drake.Not only this,\nbut when they stopped for the night at the rude home of a mountaineer,\nFred noticed that Bob, as all called him, was the drudge of the party.He not only had to care for the captain\'s horse, but to perform menial\nservice, even to cleaning the mud from the captain\'s boots.As he was\ndoing this, Bob caught Fred looking at him, and coloring to the roots of\nhis hair, he trembled violently.It was evident that he felt himself\ndegraded by his work, but seeing a look of pity in Fred\'s eyes, he\nfiercely whispered, "My mother\'s <DW65>s used to do this for me," and\nthen he cast such a look of hate on Captain Bascom that Fred shuddered.It was not until the evening of the second day of his capture that\nPiketon was reached.Along in the afternoon, away to the left, firing\nwas heard, and every now and then, the deep boom of cannon reverberated\nthrough the valleys and gorges.It made\nFred sick at heart to think that his friends were so near, and yet so\nfar.The knowledge that the Confederates were being driven seemed to anger\nBascom, and he drank oftener than usual.Noticing that Bob was talking\nto Fred as they were riding along, he turned back and struck the boy\nsuch a cruel blow in the face that he was knocked from his horse.By order of Bascom, Drake and Lyle dismounted, picked Bob up, wiped the\nblood from his face, and after forcing some whisky down his throat,\nplaced him on his horse.At first he seemed dazed and could not guide\nhis horse.He gradually came to himself, and when he looked at Bascom\nFred saw that same murderous look come over his face which he had\nnoticed once before."Bascom has cause to fear that boy," thought Fred.When the party rode into Piketon they found everything in the utmost\nconfusion.Preparations were being made to evacuate the place.The\nsoldiers who had been in the fight came streaming back, bringing with\nthem their wounded and a few prisoners.They reported thousands and\nthousands of Yankees coming.This added to the confusion and the\ndemoralization of the troops.The prisoners were thrown, for the night, in a building used as a jail.It was of hewn logs, without windows or doors, being entered through the\nroof, access being had to the roof by an outside stairway, then by a\nladder down in the inside.When all were down, the ladder was drawn up,\nand the opening in the roof closed.The place was indescribably filthy,\nand Fred always wondered how he lived through the night.When morning\ncame and the ladder was put down for them to ascend, each and every one\nthanked the Lord the rebels were to retreat, and that their stay in the\nnoisome hole was thus ended.With gratitude they drank in mouthfuls of\nthe fresh air.The whole place was in a frenzy of excitement.Commissary stores they\nwere not able to carry away were given to the flames.Every moment the\nadvance of Nelson\'s army was expected.But as time passed, and no army\nappeared the panic somewhat subsided and something like order was\nrestored.That night, the retreating army camped in a pine forest at the base of a\nmountain.Black clouds swept across the\nsky, the wind howled mournfully through the forest, and the cold\npitiless rain chilled to the bone.Huge fires were kindled, and around\nthem the men gathered to dry their streaming clothes and to warm their\nbenumbed limbs.Just before the prisoners were made to lie down to sleep, the boy,\nRobert Ferror, passed by Fred, and said in a low whisper:\n\n"I will be on guard to-night.Was Robert Ferror going to aid him to escape?He\nwatched where the guard over the prisoners was stationed, and lay down\nas close to him as possible.Soon he was apparently fast asleep, but he\nwas never wider awake.At eleven o\'clock Robert Ferror came on guard.He\nlooked eagerly around, and Fred, to show him where he was slightly\nraised his head.The boy smiled, and placed his finger on his lips.Slowly Ferror paced his beat, to and fro.Ferror\'s answer\nwas, "All is well."Another half-hour passed; still he paced to and\nfro.After all, was Ferror to do nothing, or were his\nwords a hoax to raise false hopes?The camp had sunk to rest; the fires\nwere burning low.Then as Ferror passed Fred, he slightly touched him\nwith his foot.The next time Ferror passed\nhe stooped as if he had dropped something, and as he was fumbling on the\nground, whispered:\n\n"Crawl back like a snake.About fifty yards to the rear is a large pine\ntree.It is out of the range of the light of the fires.It would have taken a lynx\'s eye to\nhave noticed that one of the prisoners was missing, so silently had Fred\nmade his way back.One o\'clock came, and Ferror was relieved.Five, ten, fifteen minutes\npassed, and still Fred was waiting."I will wait a little longer," thought Fred, "and then if he does not\ncome, I will go by myself."Soon a light footstep was heard, and Fred whispered, "Here."A hand was stretched out, and Fred took it.It was as cold as death, and\nshook like one with the palsy."He is quaking with fear," thought Fred."Have you got the revolver and cartridge belt?"asked Ferror, in a\nhoarse whisper.He still seemed to be quaking as with ague.Silently Ferror led the way, Fred following.Slowly feeling their way\nthrough the darkness, they had gone some distance when they were\nsuddenly commanded to halt.Ferror gave a start of surprise,\nand then answered:\n\n"A friend with the countersign.""Advance, friend, and give the countersign."Ferror boldly advanced, leaned forward as if to whisper the word in the\near of the guard.Then there was a flash, a loud report, and with a moan\nthe soldier sank to the ground."Come," shrieked Ferror, and Fred, horrified, sprang forward.Through\nthe woods, falling over rocks, running against trees, they dashed, until\nat last they had to stop from sheer exhaustion.Men\nwere heard crashing through the forest, escaping as they thought from an\nunseen foe.But when no attack came, and no other shot was heard, the\nconfusion and excitement began to abate, and every one was asking, "What\nis it?""The sound of the shot came from that direction," said the soldier who\nhad taken the place of Ferror as guard."There is where I stationed Drake," said the officer of the guard."I\ndiscovered a path leading up the mountain, and I concluded to post a\nsentinel on it.Sergeant, make a detail, and come with me."The detail was made, and they filed out in the darkness in the direction\nthat Drake was stationed."We must have gone far enough," said the officer."It was about here I\nstationed him."It is not possible he has deserted, is\nit?"He was groping around when he stumbled over something on the ground.He\nreached out his hand, and touched the lifeless body of Drake.A cry of\nhorror burst from him.The body was taken up and carried back to camp.The officer bent over and examined it by the firelight."Shot through the heart," he muttered; "and, by heavens!Drake was shot not by some prowler, but by some one\ninside the lines.The prisoners, who had all been aroused by the commotion, were huddled\ntogether, quaking with fear.The sergeant soon reported: "Lieutenant, there is one missing; the boy\nin citizen\'s clothes."Colonel Williams, who had been looking on with stern countenance, now\nasked:\n\n"Who was guarding the prisoners?"The colonel\'s tones were low and\nominous."Scott, sir," replied the sergeant of the guard."Colonel," said Scott, shaking so he could hardly talk, "before God, I\nknow nothing about the escape of the prisoner.I had not been on guard\nmore than ten or fifteen minutes before the shot was fired.Up to that\ntime, not a prisoner had stirred."I do not know whether he escaped before I came\non guard or after the alarm.The sergeant will bear me witness that\nduring the alarm I stayed at my post and kept the prisoners from\nescaping.The boy might have slipped away in the confusion, but I do not\nthink he did."The sergeant soon returned with the information that Ferror could not be\nfound.He cast his eye over the group of officers\nstanding around him, and then suddenly asked: "Where is Captain Bascom?"The officers looked blank, then inquiringly into each other\'s faces.No\none had seen him during or since the alarm.The sergeant of the guard hurriedly went to a rude tent where the\ncaptain slept.Pulling aside a blanket which served as a door he entered\nthe tent.A moment, and he reappeared with face as white as a sheet.his ashen lips shaped the words, but they died away in a\ngurgle in his throat.Captain Bascom had been stabbed through the heart.The whole turmoil in camp was heard by Fred and Robert Ferror, as they\nstood panting for breath.Fred shuddered as the horrified cry of the\nofficer of the day was borne to his ears when he stumbled on the dead\nbody of the guard.The boys were bruised and bleeding, and their\nclothing was torn in shreds from their flight through the forest."It is all right now," said Ferror."They can never find us in the\ndarkness, but some of the frightened fools may come as far as this; so\nwe had better be moving."The boys slowly and painfully worked their way up the mountain, and at\nlast the roar of the camp was no longer heard.They came to a place\nwhere the jutting rocks formed a sort of a cave, keeping out the rain,\nand the ground and leaves were comparatively dry.The place was also\nsheltered from the wind."Let us stay here," said Fred, "until it gets a little light.We can\nthen more easily make our way.We are entirely out of danger for\nto-night."To this Ferror assented, and the two boys crept as far back as they\ncould and snuggled down close together.Fred noticed']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['(19) The Long Parliament had dissolved itself, and had decreed the\nelection of its successor.733) the Long Parliament is “declared and adjudged to be fully\ndissolved and determined;” but it is not said when it was dissolved and\ndetermined.5; Hallam’s Constitutional History,\nii.21, where the whole matter is discussed, and it is remarked that\n“the next Parliament never gave their predecessors any other name in\nthe Journals than ‘the late assembly.’”\n\n(20) See Norman Conquest, i.(21) See the discussion on the famous vote of the Convention Parliament\nin Hallam, Constitutional History, ii.Hallam remarks that “the word ‘forfeiture’ might better have answered\nthis purpose than ‘abdication’ or ‘desertion,’” and he adds, “they\nproceeded not by the stated rules of the English government, but by\nthe general rights of mankind.They looked not so much to Magna Charta\nas the original compact of society, and rejected Coke and Hale for\nHooker and Harrington.” My position is that there is no need to go to\nwhat Hallam calls “higher constitutional laws” for the justification\nof the doings of the Convention, but that they were fully justified\nby the precedents of English History from the eighth century to the\nfourteenth.The Scottish Estates, it should be remembered, did not shrink from\nusing the word “forfeited.” Macaulay, iii.(22) See the Act 1 William and Mary “for removing and preventing all\nQuestions and Disputes concerning the Assembling and Sitting of this\nPresent Parliament” (Revised Statutes, ii.It decrees “That the\nLords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons convened at Westminster the\ntwo and twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand\nsix hundred eighty-eight, and there sitting on the thirteenth day of\nFebruary following, are the two Houses of Parliament, and so shall be\nand are hereby declared enacted and adjudged to be to all intents,\nconstructions, and purposes whatsoever, notwithstanding any fault of\nwrit or writs of summons, or any defect of form or default whatsoever,\nas if they had been summoned according to the usual form.” The whole\nhistory of the question is given in Macaulay, iii.The whole\nmatter is summed up in the words (iii.27), “It was answered that the\nroyal writ was mere matter of form, and that to expose the substance\nof our laws and liberties to serious hazard for the sake of a form\nwould be the most senseless superstition.Wherever the Sovereign, the\nPeers spiritual and temporal, and the Representatives freely chosen by\nthe constituent bodies of the realm were met together, there was the\nessence of a Parliament.” In earlier times it might perhaps have been\nheld that there might be the essence of a Parliament even without the\nSovereign.“A paper had been circulated, in which the\nlogic of a small sharp pettifogger was employed to prove that writs,\nissued in the joint names of William and Mary, ceased to be of force\nas soon as William reigned alone.But this paltry cavil had completely\nfailed.It had not even been mentioned in the Lower House, and had been\nmentioned in the Upper only to be contemptuously overruled.” From my\npoint of view the cavil is certainly paltry, but it is hard to see that\nit is more paltry than the others.(24) This is by the Acts 7 and 8 Will.See Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.Blackstone’s\nreasoning runs thus: “This dissolution formerly happened immediately\nupon the death of the reigning sovereign; for he being considered in\nlaw as the head of the parliament (caput principium, et finis), that\nfailing, the whole body was held to be extinct.But the calling a new\nparliament immediately on the inauguration of the successor being found\ninconvenient, and dangers being apprehended from having no parliament\nin being, in case of a disputed succession, it was enacted,” etc.By\nthe Reform Act of 1867 the whole tradition of the lawyers was swept\naway.(25) I have said something on this head in Norman Conquest, i.94,\nbut the whole thing should be studied in Allen’s great section on the\nTenure of Landed Property; Royal Prerogative, 125-155.It is to Allen\nthat the honour belongs of showing what _bookland_ and _folkland_\nreally were.(26) I have given a few examples in Norman Conquest, i.Endless\nexamples will be found in Kemble’s Codex Diplomaticus.(27) See the complaints on this head as late as the time of William\nthe Third, in Macaulay, iv.On the Acts by which the power of the\nCrown in this matter is restrained, see Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.See also May’s Constitutional History, i.(29) This is discussed in full by Allen, Royal Prerogative, 143-145.The great example is the will of King Ælfred.249; Allen, 154-155, who remarks: “By a singular\nrevolution of policy there was a recurrence in the late reign to the\nancient policy of the Anglo-Saxons.The crown lands were virtually\nrestored to the public, while the King obtained the right of acquiring\nlanded property by purchase, and of bequeathing it by will like a\nprivate person.”\n\n(31) Edward the First was the earliest King whose reign is dated from\na time earlier than his coronation.He was out of the kingdom at his\nfather’s death, and his right was acknowledged without opposition.But\neven in this case there was an interregnum.The regnal years of Edward\nthe First are not reckoned from the day of his father’s death, but\nfrom the day of his funeral, when Edward was acknowledged King, and\nwhen the prelates and nobles swore allegiance to him.See the account\nin the Worcester Annals, Annales Monastici, iv.462, and the documents\nin Rymer, i. part ii.See also the remarks of Allen, 46, 47.The\ndoctrine that there can be no interregnum seems to have been put into\nshape to please James the First, and it was of course altogether upset\nby the great vote of 1688.Now of course there is no interregnum; not\nindeed from any mysterious prerogative of the Crown, but simply because\nthe Act of Settlement has entailed the Crown in a particular way.(32) On this see Norman Conquest, i.See the same\nquestion discussed in quite another part of the world in Herodotus,\nvii.(33) The helpless way in which Blackstone himself wrote was perhaps\npardonable in the dark times in which he lived.But it is really too\nbad when lawyer after lawyer, in successive editions, gives again to\nthe world the astounding rubbish which in Blackstone’s day passed\nfor early constitutional history.In Kerr’s edition of Blackstone,\npublished in 1857, vol.180, I find repeated, without alteration\nor comment, the monstrous assertion of Blackstone: “I believe there\nis no instance wherein the Crown of England has ever been asserted to\nbe elective, except by the regicides at the infamous and unparalleled\ntrial of King Charles I.” And in Serjeant Stephen’s Commentaries\n(1853), which are not a mere edition of Blackstone, but “New\nCommentaries partly founded on Blackstone,” the same words are found\nin vol.403, only leaving out the epithet “unparalleled,” which\nmight with truth have been allowed to stay.481-2) we read how “after the Saxon government was firmly established\nin this island” came “the subdivision of the kingdom into a heptarchy,\nconsisting of seven independent kingdoms, peopled and governed by\ndifferent clans and colonies.” It seems then that in 1857 there\nwere learned gentlemen who believed in a kingdom subdivided into a\nheptarchy.But when, in the next page, Blackstone tells us how Ælfred\nset about “to new-model the constitution, to rebuild it on a plan that\nshould endure for ages,” and goes on in the usual style to attribute\neverything whatever to Ælfred personally, this seems to have been too\nmuch, and the editor gives an extract from Kemble by way of correction.One wonders that, if he had read Kemble at all, he had not learned a\nlittle more from him.It is amusing again when Blackstone tells us (i.186, Kerr), “From Egbert to the death of Edmund Ironside, a period\nof above two hundred years, the Crown descended regularly through a\nsuccession of fifteen princes, without any deviation or interruption:\nsave only”—all the cases where it did not descend regularly, according\nto Blackstone’s notions of regularity: But it is almost more amusing\nwhen Serjeant Stephen (ii.410) throws Blackstone’s exceptions, which\nare at least historical facts, into a note, and gives us instead as\nhis own exceptions, the statement, very doubtful and, if true, utterly\nirrelevant, that Æthelstan and Eadmund Ironside were illegitimate (see\nNorman Conquest, i.We of course get the usual talk about the\nusurpations of Harold, Stephen, John, and Henry the Fourth, and about\nthe rights of Eadgar and Arthur of Britanny.For the former we get a\nquotation from Matthew Paris, to whom it would have been more to the\npurpose to go for the great speech of Archbishop Hubert.The comments\non the succession of John (i.Sandra moved to the kitchen.189, Kerr) are singularly amusing, but\ntoo long to quote.To prove the strictly hereditary\nnature of the succession, Blackstone (i.189, Kerr) quotes the Statute\nof 25 Edward III.“that the law of the Crown of England is, and always\nhath been, that the children of the King of England, whether born in\nEngland or elsewhere, ought to bear the inheritance after the death of\ntheir ancestors.” We are bound to suppose that these learned lawyers\nhad read through the statute which they quoted; but it is wonderful\nthat they did not see that it had nothing whatever to do with fixing\nthe hereditary succession of the Crown.The original text (Revised\nStatutes, i.176) runs thus:—\n\n“La lei de la Corone Dengleterre est, et ad este touz jours tiele,\nque les enfantz des Rois Dengleterre, _queu part qils soient neez en\nEngleterre ou aillors_, sont ables et deivent porter heritage, apres la\nmort lour auncestors.”\n\nThe object of the statute is something quite different from what any\none would think from Blackstone’s way of quoting it.The emphatic words\nare those which are put in italics.The object of the statute is to\nmake the King’s children and others born of English parents beyond sea\ncapable of inheriting in England.As far as the succession to the Crown\nis concerned, its effect is simply to put a child of the King born out\nof the realm on a level with his brother born in the realm; that is,\nin the view of our older Law, to give both alike the preference due to\nan Ætheling.(34) It is as well to explain this, because most people seem to think\nthat a man becomes a Bishop by virtue of receiving a private letter\nfrom the First Lord of the Treasury.We constantly see a man spoken of\nas Bishop of such a see, and his works advertised as such, before a\nsingle ecclesiastical or legal step has been taken to make him so.(36) The succession of a grandson, which first took place in England in\nthe case of Richard the Second, marks a distinct stage in the growth\nof the doctrine of hereditary right.It involves the doctrine of\nrepresentation, which is a very subtle and technical one, and is not\nnearly so obvious or so likely to occur in an early state of society\nas the doctrine of nearness of kin.John travelled to the kitchen.No opposition was made to the\naccession of Richard the Second, but there seems to have been a strong\nnotion in men’s minds that John of Gaunt sought to displace his nephew.In earlier times, as the eldest and most eminent of the surviving sons\nof Edward the Third, John would probably have been elected without any\nthought of the claims of young Richard.(37) In Yorkist official language the three Lancastrian Kings were\nusurpers, and Duke Richard was _de jure_, though not _de facto_, King.Henry the Sixth is, in the Act of 1461, “Henry Usurpour, late called\nKyng Henry the sixt.” The claim of the House of York was through an\nintricate female descent from Lionel Duke of Clarence, a son of Edward\nthe Third older than John of Gaunt.A claim so purely technical had\nnever been set forth before; but we may be quite sure that it would not\nhave been thought to have much weight, if Duke Richard had not been, by\nanother branch, descended from Edward the Third in the male line, and\nif he had not moreover been the ablest and most popular nobleman in the\ncountry.(38) A prospective election before the vacancy of course hindered\nany interregnum.In this case the formula “Le Roi est mort; vive le\nRoi,” was perfectly true.The new King was already chosen and crowned,\nand he had nothing to do but to go on reigning singly instead of in\npartnership with his father, just as William went on reigning alone\nafter the death of Mary.In Germany this took place whenever a King\nof the Romans was chosen in the lifetime of the reigning Emperor.In\nFrance, under the early Kings of the Parisian dynasty, the practice\nwas specially common, and the fact that there seldom or never was an\ninterregnum doubtless helped much to make the French Crown become, as\nit did, the most strictly hereditary crown in Christendom.In England,\nthe only distinct case of a coronation of a son during the lifetime of\nhis father was that of Henry, the son of Henry the Second, known as the\nyounger King, and sometimes as Henry the Third.In earlier times we get\nsomething like it in the settlement of the Crown by Æthelwulf, with the\nconsent of his Witan (see Old-English History, 105, 106), but it does\nnot seem clear whether there was in this case any actual coronation\nduring the father’s lifetime.If there was not, this would be the case\nmost like that of Duke Richard.The compromise placed the Duke in the\nsame position as if he had been Prince of Wales, or rather in a better\nposition, for it might be held to shut out the need of even a formal\nelection on the King’s death.(39) See note 59 on Chapter II.(41) See Hallam’s Constitutional History, i.It is to be noticed\nthat the settlement enacts that “the inheritance of the Crown, &c.,\nshould remain in Henry the Seventh and the heirs of his body for ever,\nand in none other.” This would seem to bar a great number of contingent\nclaims in various descendants of earlier Kings.As it happens, this Act\nhas been literally carried out, for every later Sovereign of England\nhas been a descendant of the body of Henry the Seventh.(42) The will of Henry the Eighth is fully discussed by Hallam, i.34,\n288, 294; Lingard, vi.There are two Acts of Henry’s reign bearing\non the matter.7, the Crown is\nentailed on the King’s sons by Jane Seymour or any other wife; then\non the King’s legitimate daughters, no names being mentioned; the Act\nthen goes on to say, “your Highnes shall have full and plenar power\nand auctorite to geve despose appoynte assigne declare and lymytt by\nyour letters patentes under your great seale or ells by your laste Will\nmade in wrytynge and signed with your moste gracious hande, at your\nonely pleasure from tyme to tyme herafter, the imperiall Crowne of this\nRealme and all other the premisses thereunto belongyng, to be remayne\nsuccede and come after your decease and for lack of lawfull heires of\nyour body to be procreated and begoten as is afore lymytted by this\nActe, to such person or persones in possession and remaynder as shall\nplease your Highnes and according to such estate and after such maner\nforme facion ordre and condicion as shalbe expressed declared named and\nlymytted in your said letters patentes or by your said laste will.”\nThe later Act, 35 Henry VIII.1, puts Henry’s two daughters, Mary\nand Elizabeth, into the entail, but in a very remarkable way.The Acts\ndeclaring their illegitimacy are not repealed, nor is the legitimacy of\neither of them in any way asserted; in fact it is rather denied when\nthe preamble rehearses that “The king’s Majesty hath only issue of his\nbody lawfully begotten betwixt his Highness and his said late wife\nQueen Jane the noble and excellent Prince Edward.” The Act then goes\non to enact that, although the King had been enabled to “dispose” the\nCrown “to any person or persons of such estate therein as should please\nhis Highness to limit and appoint,” yet that, in failure of heirs of\nthe body of either the King or his son, “the said imperial Crown and\nall other the premises shall be to the Lady Mary the King’s Highness\ndaughter, and to the heirs of the body of the same Lady Mary lawfully\nbegotten, with such conditions as by his Highness shall be limited by\nhis letters patents under his great seal, or by his Majesty’s last will\nin writing signed with his gracious hand.” Failing Mary and her issue,\nthe same conditional entail is extended to Elizabeth and her issue.The\npower of creating a remainder after the issue of Elizabeth of course\nremained with Henry, and he exercised it in favour of the issue of his\nyounger sister Mary.Mary and Elizabeth therefore really reigned, not\nby virtue of any royal descent, but by virtue of a particular entail by\nwhich the Crown was settled on the King’s illegitimate daughters, as it\nmight have been settled on a perfect stranger.It was an attempt on the\npart of Edward the Sixth to do without parliamentary authority what his\nfather had done by parliamentary authority which led to the momentary\noccupation of the throne by Lady Jane Grey.Mary, on her accession,\nraked up the whole story of her mother’s marriage and divorce, and the\nAct of the first year of her reign recognized her as inheriting by\nlegitimate succession.The Act passed on the accession of Elizabeth,\n1 Eliz.It enacts “that your majestie our sayd\nSovereigne Ladye ys and in verye dede and of most meere right ought\nto bee by the Lawes of God and the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme\nour most rightfull and lawfull Sovereigne liege Ladie and Quene; and\nthat your Highness ys rightlye lynyallye and lawfully discended and\ncome of the bloodd royall of this Realme of Englande in and to whose\nprincely person and theires of your bodye lawfully to bee begotten\nafter youe without all doubte ambiguitee scruple or question the\nimperiall and Royall estate place crowne and dignitie of this Reallme\nwithe all honnours stiles titles dignities Regalities Jurisdiccons and\npreheminences to the same nowe belonging & apperteyning arre & shalbee\nmost fully rightfully really & entierly invested & incorporated united\n& annexed as rightfully & lawfully to all intentes construccons &\npurposes as the same were in the said late Henrye theight or in the\nlate King Edwarde the Syxte your Highnes Brother, or in the late Quen\nMarye your Highnes syster at anye tyme since thacte of parliament made\nin the xxxvth yere of the reigne of your said most noble father king\nHenrye theight.”\n\nIt should be remembered that Sir Thomas More, though he refused to\nswear to the preamble of the oath prescribed by the Act of Supremacy,\nwas ready to swear to the order of succession which entailed the Crown\non the issue of Anne Boleyn.On his principles the issue of Anne Boleyn\nwould be illegitimate; but he also held that Parliament could settle\nthe Crown upon anybody, on an illegitimate child of the King or on an\nutter stranger; to the succession therefore he had no objection to\nswear.For a parallel to the extraordinary power thus granted to Henry we have\nto go back to the days of Æthelwulf.(43) The position of the daughters of Henry the Eighth was of course\npractically affected by the fact that each was the child of a mother\nwho was acknowledged as a lawful wife at the time of her daughter’s\nbirth.There was manifest harshness in ranking children so born with\nordinary illegitimate children; but, in strictness of Law, as Henry\nmarried Anne Boleyn while Katharine of Aragon was alive, the daughter\nof Katharine and the daughter of Anne could not both be legitimate.It should also be\nremembered that the marriage of Anne Boleyn was declared void, and her\ndaughter declared illegitimate, on grounds—whatever they were—which had\nnothing to do with the earlier question of the marriage and divorce of\nKatharine.1, declares it to be treason “yf any person shall in any wyse holde\nand affyrme or mayntayne that the Common Lawes of this Realme not\naltred by Parlyament, ought not to dyrecte the Ryght of the crowne\nof England, or that our said sovrayne Ladye Elizabeth the Quenes\nMajestie that nowe is, with and by the aucthoritye of the Parlyament\nof Englande is not able to make Lawes and Statutes of suffycyent force\nand valyditie to lymit and bynd the Crowne of this Realme, and the\nDescent Lymitacion Inheritaunce and Government thereof.” The like is\nthe crime of “whosoever shall hereafter duryng the Lyef of our said\nSoveraigne Ladye, by any Booke or Worke prynted or written, dyrectly\nand expresly declare and affyrme at any tyme before the same be by Acte\nof Parlyament of this Realme established and affyrmed, that any one\nparticular person whosover it be, is or ought to be the ryght Heire\nand Successor to the Queenes Majestie that nowe is (whome God longe\npreserve) except the same be the naturall yssue of her Majesties bodye.”\n\nThis statute may possibly be taken as setting aside the claims of the\nHouse of Suffolk; but, if so, it sets aside the claims of the House of\nStewart along with them.(45) James’s right was acknowledged by his own first Parliament, just\nas the claims of other Kings who entered in an irregular way had\nbeen.It should be marked however that he was crowned before he was\nacknowledged.1, declares that “immediatelie upon\nthe Dissolution and Decease of Elizabeth late Queene of England, the\nImperiall Crowne of the Realme of England, and of all the Kingdomes\nDominions and Rights belonging to the same, did by inherent Birthright\nand lawfull undoubted Succession, descend and come to your moste\nexcellent Majestie, as beinge lineallie justly and lawfullie next and\nsole Heire of the Blood Royall of this Realme as is aforesaid.” It is\nworth noticing that in this Act we get the following definition of\nParliament; “this high Court of Parliament, where all the whole Body of\nthe Realm and every particular member thereof, either in Person or by\nRepresentation (upon their own free elections), are by the Laws of this\nRealm deemed to be personally present.”\n\n(46) The fact that James the First, a King who came in with no title\nwhatever but what was given him by an Act of Parliament passed after\nhis coronation, was acknowledged without the faintest opposition is\none of the most remarkable things in our history.294)\nremarks that “there is much reason to believe that the consciousness of\nthis defect in his parliamentary title put James on magnifying, still\nmore than from his natural temper he was prone to do, the inherent\nrights of primogenitory succession, as something indefeasible by the\nlegislature; a doctrine which, however it might suit the schools of\ndivinity, was in diametrical opposition to our statutes.” Certainly no\nopposition can be more strongly marked than that between the language\nof James’s own Parliament and the words quoted above from 13 Eliz.But see the remarks of Hallam a few pages before (i.288) on the\nkind of tacit election by which it might be said that James reigned.“What renders it absurd to call him and his children usurpers?He had\nthat which the flatterers of his family most affected to disdain—the\nwill of the people; not certainly expressed in regular suffrage or\ndeclared election, but unanimously and voluntarily ratifying that which\nin itself could surely give no right, the determination of the late\nQueen’s Council to proclaim his accession to the throne.”\n\n(47) Whitelocke’s Memorials, 367.“The heads of the charge against the\nKing were published by leave, in this form: That Charles Stuart, being\nadmitted King of England, & therein trusted with a limited power, to\ngovern by, & according to the Laws of the Land, & not otherwise, &\nby his trust being obliged, as also by his Oath, & office to use the\npower committed to him, for the good & benefit of the people, & for the\npreservation of their Rights and Privileges,” etc.At an earlier stage (365) the President had told the King that the\nCourt “sat here by the Authority of the Commons of England: & all your\npredecessours, & you are responsible to them.” The King answered “I\ndeny that, shew me one Precedent.” The President, instead of quoting\nthe precedents which were at least plausible, told the prisoner that\nhe was not to interrupt the Court.Earlier still the King had objected\nto the authority of the Court that “he saw no Lords there which should\nmake a Parliament, including the King, & urged that the Kingdom\nof England was hereditary, & not successive.” The strong point of\nCharles’s argument undoubtedly was the want of concurrence on the part\nof the Lords.Both Houses of Parliament had agreed in the proceedings\nagainst Edward the Second and Richard the Second.It is a small point, but it is well to notice that the description of\nthe King as Charles Stewart was perfectly accurate.Charles, the son\nof James, the son of Henry Stewart Lord Darnley, really had a surname,\nthough it might not be according to Court etiquette to call him by\nit.The helpless French imitators in 1793 summoned their King by the\nname of “Louis Capet,” as if Charles had been summoned by the name of\n“Unready,” “Bastard,” “Lackland,” “Longshanks,” or any other nickname\nof an earlier King and forefather.I believe that many people fancy that Guelph or Welf is a surname of\nthe present, or rather late, royal family.(48) The Act 1 William and Mary (Revised Statutes, ii.11) entailed the\nCrown “after their deceases,” “to the heires of the body of the said\nprincesse & for default of such issue to the Princesse Anne of Denmarke\n& the heires of her body & for default of such issue to the heires of\nthe body of the said Prince of Orange.” It was only after the death of\n“the most hopeful Prince William Duke of Gloucester” that the Crown\nwas settled (12 and 13 Will.94) on\n“the most excellent Princess Sophia Electress and Dutchess Dowager of\nHannover, daughter of the most excellent Princess Elizabeth, late Queen\nof Bohemia, daughter of our late sovereign lord King James the First of\nhappy memory,” “and the heirs of her body being protestants.”\n\n(49) We hardly need assurance of the fact, but if it were needed,\nsomething like an assurance to that effect was given by an official\nmember of the House during the session of 1872.At all events we\nread in Sir T. E. May (ii.83); “The increased power of the House\nof Commons, under an improved representation, has been patent and\nindisputable.Responsible to the people, it has, at the same time,\nwielded the people’s strength.No longer subservient to the crown, the\nministers, and the peerage, it has become the predominant authority\nin the state.” But the following strange remark follows: “But it is\ncharacteristic of the British constitution, and _a proof of its\nfreedom from the spirit of democracy_, that the more dominant the power\nof the House of Commons,—the greater has been its respect for the law,\nand the more carefully have its acts been restrained within the proper\nlimits of its own jurisdiction.”\n\n  ὦ δημοκρατία, ταῦτα δῆτ\' ἀνασχετά;\n\nHas Mr.Grote lived and written so utterly in vain that a writer widely\nindeed removed from the vulgar herd of oligarchic babblers looks on\n“the spirit of democracy” as something inconsistent with “respect for\nthe law”?(50) The story is told (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 7), that King Theopompos,\nhaving submitted to the lessening of the kingly power by that of the\nEphors, was rebuked by his wife, because the power which he handed on\nto those who came after him would be less than what he had received\nfrom those who went before him.ὃν καί φασιν ὑπὸ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ γυναικὸς\nὀνειδιζόμενον ὡς ἐλάττω παραδώσοντα τοῖς παισὶ τὴν βασιλείαν, ἢ\nπαρέλαβε, μείζω μὲν οὖν, εἰπεῖν, ὅσῳ χρονιωτέραν· τῷ γὰρ ὄντι τὸ\nἄγαν ἀποβαλοῦσα μετὰ τοῦ φθόνου διέφυγε τὸν κίνδυνον.11) tells the story to the same effect, bringing it in with\nthe comment, ὅσῳ γὰρ ἂν ἐλαττόνων ὦσι κύριοι, πλείω χρόνον ἀναγκαῖον\nμένειν πᾶσαν τὴν ἀρχήν· αὐτοί τε γὰρ ἧττον γίνονται δεσποτικοὶ καὶ\nτοῖς ἤθεσιν ἴσοι μᾶλλον, καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ἀρχομένων φθονοῦνται ἧττον.διὰ γὰρ τοῦτο καὶ ἡ περὶ Μολοττοὺς πολὺν χρόνον βασιλεία διέμεινεν,\nκαὶ ἡ Λακεδαιμονίων διὰ τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς τε εἰς δύο μέρη διαιρεθῆναι τὴν\nἀρχήν, καὶ πάλιν Θεοπόμπου μετριάσαντος τοῖς τε ἄλλοις καὶ τὴν τῶν\nἐφόρων ἀρχὴν ἐπικαταστήσαντος· τῆς γὰρ δυνάμεως ἀφελὼν ηὔξησε τῷ χρόνῳ\nτὴν βασιλείαν, ὥστε τρόπον τινὰ ἐποίησεν οὐκ ἐλάττονα ἀλλὰ μείζονα\nαὐτήν.The kingdom of the Molossians, referred to in the extract from\nAristotle, is one of those states of antiquity of which we should\nbe well pleased to hear more.Like the Macedonian kingdom, it was an\ninstance of the heroic kingship surviving into the historical ages of\nGreece.But the Molossian kingship seems to have been more regular and\npopular than that of Macedonia, and to have better deserved the name\nof a constitutional monarchy.The Molossian people and the Molossian\nKing exchanged oaths not unlike those of the Landesgemeinde and the\nLandammann of Appenzell-Ausserrhoden, the King swearing to rule\naccording to the laws, and the people swearing to maintain the kingdom\naccording to the laws.In the end the kingdom changed into a Federal\nRepublic.(51) It is simply frivolous in the present state of England to discuss\nthe comparative merits of commonwealths and constitutional monarchies\nwith any practical object.Constitutional monarchy is not only firmly\nfixed in the hearts of the people, but it has some distinct advantages\nover republican forms of government, just as republican forms of\ngovernment have some advantages over it.It may be doubted whether\nthe people have not a more real control over the Executive, when the\nHouse of Commons, or, in the last resort, the people itself in the\npolling-booths (as in 1868), can displace a Government at any moment,\nthan they have in constitutions in which an Executive, however much\nit may have disappointed the hopes of those who chose it, cannot be\nremoved before the end of its term of office, except on the legal\nproof of some definite crime.But in itself, there really seems no\nreason why the form of the Executive Government should not be held\nto be as lawful a subject for discussion as the House of Lords, the\nEstablished Church, the standing army, or anything else.It shows\nsimple ignorance, if it does not show something worse, when the word\n“republican” is used as synonymous with cut-throat or pickpocket.I do\nnot find that in republican countries this kind of language is applied\nto the admirers of monarchy; but the people who talk in this way are\njust those who have no knowledge of republics either in past history or\nin present times.They may very likely have climbed a Swiss mountain,\nbut they have taken care not to ask what was the constitution of the\ncountry at its foot.They may even have learned to write Greek iambics\nand to discuss Greek particles;

to take\n     a bad brake, and Captain Tyler and Mr.Westinghouse be able\n     to make their fortunes by floating a limited company for its\n     introduction.They had heard of Emma mines and Lisbon tramways,\n     and such like, and he felt it would not be well to stand by and\n     allow this to be done."All of which was not only to the point, but finely calculated to\nshow the American inventors and agents who were present the nice and\nmutually respectful manner in which such discussions were carried on\nby all Englishmen.Though the avowed adhesion of Sir Henry Tyler to the Westinghouse\nwas a most important move in the war of the brakes, it did not\nprove a decisive one.The complete control of the field was too\nvaluable a property to be yielded in deference to that, or any other\nname without a struggle; and, so to speak, there were altogether\ntoo many ins and outs to the conflict.Back door influences had\neverywhere to be encountered.The North Western, for instance, is\nthe most important of the railway companies of the United Kingdom.The locomotive superintendent of that company was the part inventor\nand proprietor of an emergency brake which had been extensively\nadopted by it on its rolling stock, but which wholly failed to meet\nthe requirements laid down in its circular by the Board of Trade.Immediately after issuing that circular the Board of Trade called\nthe attention of the company to this fact in connection with an\naccident which had recently occurred, and in very emphatic language\npointed out that the brakes in question could not "in any reasonable\nsense of the word be called continuous brakes," and that it was\nclear that the circular requirements were "not complied with by the\nbrake-system of the London & North Western Railway Company;" in case\nthat company persisted in the use of that brake, the secretary of\nthe Board went on to say, "in the event of a casualty occurring,\nwhich an efficient system of brakes might have prevented, a heavy\npersonal responsibility will rest upon those who are answerable for\nsuch neglect."This was certainly language tolerably direct in its\nimport.As such it was calculated to cause those to whom it was\naddressed to pause in their action.The company, however, treated it\nwith a superb disregard, all the more contemptuous because veiled\nin language of deferential civility.Sandra journeyed to the office.They then quietly went on\napplying their locomotive superintendent\'s emergency brake to their\nequipment, until on the 30th of June, 1879, they returned no less\nthan 2,052 carriages fitted with it; that being by far the largest\nnumber returned by any one company in the United Kingdom.A more direct challenge to the Board of Trade and to Parliament\ncould not easily have been devised.To appreciate how direct it\nwas, it is necessary to bear in mind that in its circular of August\n30, 1877, in which the requirements of a satisfactory train-brake\nwere laid down, the Board of Trade threw out to the companies\nthe very significant hint, that they "would do well to reflect\nthat if a doubt should arise that from a conflict of interest or\nopinion, or from any other cause, they [the companies] are not\nexerting themselves, it is obvious that they will call down upon\nthemselves an interference which the Board of Trade, no less than\nthe companies, desire to avoid."In his general report on the\naccidents of the year 1877, the successor of Captain Tyler expressed\nthe opinion that "sufficient information and experience would now\nappear to be available, and the time is approaching when the railway\ncompanies may fairly be expected to come to a decision as to which\nof the systems of continuous brakes is best calculated to fulfil the\nrequisite conditions, and is most worthy of general adoption."At\nthe close of another year, however, the official returns seemed to\nindicate that, while but a sixth part of the passenger locomotives\nand a fifth part of the carriages in use on the railroads of the\nUnited Kingdom were yet equipped with continuous brakes at all, a\nconcurrence of opinion in favor of any one system was more remote\nthan ever.During the six months ending December 31, 1878, but 127\nadditional locomotives out of about 4000, and 1,200 additional\ncarriages out of some 32,000 were equipped; of which 70 locomotives\nand 530 carriages had been equipped with the Smith vacuum, which in\nthree most important respects failed to comply with the Board of\nTrade requirements.Under these circumstances the Board of Trade\nwas obviously called upon either to withdraw from the position it\nhad taken, or to invite that "interference" in its support to which\nin its circular of August, 1877 it had so portentously referred.It\ndecided to do the latter, and in March, 1879 the government gave an\nintimation in the House of Lords that early Parliamentary action was\ncontemplated.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.As it is expressed, the railway companies are to "be\nrelieved of their indecision."In Great Britain, therefore, the long battle of the brakes would\nseem to be drawing to its close.The final struggle, however,\nwill be a spirited one, and one which Americans will watch with\nconsiderable interest,--for it is in fact a struggle between two\nAmerican brakes, the Westinghouse and the Smith vacuum.Of the\n907 locomotives hitherto equipped with the continuous brakes no\nless than 819 are equipped with one or the other of these American\npatents, besides over 4,464 of the 9,919 passenger carriages.The\nremaining 3,857 locomotives and 30,000 carriages are the prize of\nvictory.As the score now stands the vacuum brake is in almost\nexactly twice the use of its more scientific rival.The weight\nof authority and experience, and the requirements of the Board of\nTrade, are, however, on the opposite side.As deduced from the European scientific tests and the official\nreturns, the balance of advantages would seem to be as follows:--In\nfavor of the vacuum are its superficial simplicity, and possible\neconomy in first cost:--In favor of the Westinghouse automatic are\nits superior quickness in application, the greater rapidity in\nits stopping power, the more durable nature of its materials, the\nsmaller cost in renewal, its less liability to derangement, and\nabove all its self-acting adjustment.The last is the point upon\nwhich the final issue of the struggle must probably turn.The use\nof any train-brake which is not automatic in its action, as has\nalready been pointed out, involves in the long run disaster,--and\nultimate serious disaster.The mere fact that the brake is generally\nso reliable,--that ninety-nine times out of the hundred it works\nperfectly,--simply makes disaster certain by the fatal confidence\nit inspires.Ninety-nine times in a hundred the brake proves\nreliable;--nine times in the remaining ten of the thousand, in which\nit fails, a lucky chance averts disaster;--but the thousandth time\nwill assuredly come, as it did at Communipaw and on the New York\nElevated railway, and, much the worst of all yet, at Wollaston.Soon or late the use of non-automatic continuous brakes will most\nassuredly, if they are not sooner abandoned, be put an end to\nby the occurrence of some not-to-be forgotten catastrophe of the\nfirst magnitude, distinctly traceable to that cause.Meanwhile that\nautomatic brakes are complicated and sometimes cause inconvenience\nin their operation is most indisputable.This is an objection, also,\nto which they are open in common with most of the riper results of\nhuman ingenuity;--but, though sun-dials are charmingly simple, we do\nnot, therefore, discard chronometers in their favor; neither do we\ninsist on cutting our harvests with the scythe, because every man\nwho may be called upon to drive a mowing machine may not know how\nto put one together.But what Sir Henry Tyler has said in respect\nto this oldest and most fallacious, as well as most wearisome, of\nobjections covers the whole ground and cannot be improved upon.After referring to the fact that simplicity in construction and\nsimplicity in working were two different things, and that, almost\ninvariably, a certain degree of complication in construction is\nnecessary to secure simplicity in working,--after pointing this out\nhe went on to add that,--\n\n     "Simplicity as regards the application of railway brakes is\n     not obtained by the system now more commonly employed of\n     brake-handles to be turned by different men in different\n     parts of the train; but is obtained when, by more complicated\n     construction an engine-driver is able easily in an instant to\n     apply ample brake-power at pleasure with more or less force\n     to every wheel of his train; is obtained when, every time an\n     engine-driver starts, or attempts to start his train, the brake\n     itself informs him if it is out of order; and is still more\n     obtained when, on the occasion of an accident and the separation\n     of a coupling, the brakes will unfailingly apply themselves on\n     every wheel of the train without the action of the engine-driver\n     or guards, [brakemen], and before even they have time to realize\n     the necessity for it.This is true simplicity in such a case,\n     and that system of continuous brakes which best accomplishes\n     such results in the shortest space of time is so far preferable\n     to all others."THE RAILROAD JOURNEY RESULTING IN DEATH.One day in May, 1847, as the Queen of Belgium was going from\nVerviers to Brussels by rail, the train in which she was journeying\ncame into collision with another train going in the opposite\ndirection.There was naturally something of a panic, and, as\nroyalty was not then accustomed to being knocked about with\nrailroad equality, some of her suite urged the queen to leave the\ntrain and to finish her journey by carriage.The contemporaneous\ncourt reporter then went on to say, in that language which is\nso peculiarly his own,--"But her Majesty, as courageously as\ndiscreetly, declined to set that example of timidity, and she\nproceeded to Brussels by the railway."In those days a very\nexaggerated idea was universally entertained of the great danger\nincident to travel by rail.Even then, however, had her Majesty, who\nwas doubtless a very sensible woman, happened to be familiar with\nthe statistics of injuries received by those traveling respectively\nby rail and by carriage, she certainly never on any plea of danger\nwould have been induced to abandon her railroad train in order to\ntrust herself behind horse-flesh.By pursuing the course urged\nupon her, the queen would have multiplied her chances of accident\nsome sixty fold.Strange as the statement sounds even now, such\nwould seem to have been the fact.In proportion to the whole number\ncarried, the accidents to passengers in "the good old days of\nstage-coaches" were, as compared to the present time of the railroad\ndispensation, about as sixty to one.This result, it is true, cannot\nbe verified in the experience either of England or of this country,\nfor neither the English nor we possess any statistics in relation\nto the earlier period; but they have such statistics in France,\nstretching over the space of more than forty years, and as reliable\nas statistics ever are.If these French statistics hold true in New\nEngland,--and considering the character of our roads, conveyances,\nand climate, their showing is more likely to be in our favor than\nagainst us,--if they simply hold true, leaving us to assume that\nstage-coach traveling was no less safe in Massachusetts than in\nFrance, then it would follow that to make the dangers of the rail\nof the present day equal to those of the highway of half a century\nback, some eighty passengers should annually be killed and some\neleven hundred injured within the limits of Massachusetts alone.These figures, however, represent rather more than fifty times the\nactual average, and from them it would seem to be not unfair to\nconclude that, notwithstanding the great increase of population and\nthe yet greater increase in travel during the last half-century,\nthere were literally more persons killed and injured each year in\nMassachusetts fifty years ago through accidents to stage-coaches\nthan there are now through accidents to railroad trains.The first impression of nine out of ten persons in no way connected\nwith the operations of railroads would probably be found to be\nthe exact opposite to this.A vague but deeply rooted conviction\ncommonly prevails that the railroad has created a new danger;\nthat because of it the average human being\'s hold on life is more\nprecarious than it was.The first point-blank, bald statement to the\ncontrary would accordingly strike people in the light not only of a\nparadox, but of a somewhat foolish one.Investigation, nevertheless,\nbears it out.The fact is that when a railroad accident comes, it is\napt to come in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever in relation\nto it.It is heralded like a battle or an earthquake; it fills\ncolumns of the daily press with the largest capitals and the most\nharrowing details, and thus it makes a deep and lasting impression\non the minds of many people.When a multitude of persons, traveling\nas almost every man now daily travels himself, meet death in such\nsudden and such awful shape, the event smites the imagination.People seeing it and thinking of it, and hearing and reading of\nit, and of it only, forget of how infrequent occurrence it is.It\nwas not so in the olden time.Every one rode behind horses,--if not\nin public then in private conveyances,--and when disaster came it\ninvolved but few persons and was rarely accompanied by circumstances\nwhich either struck the imagination or attracted any great public\nnotice.In the first place, the modern newspaper, with its perfect\nmachinery for sensational exaggeration, did not then exist,--having\nitself only recently come in the train of the locomotive;--and, in\nthe next place, the circle of those included in the consequences of\nany disaster was necessarily small.For\nweeks and months the vast machinery moves along, doing its work\nquickly, swiftly, safely; no one pays any attention to it, while\nmillions daily make use of it.It is as much a necessity of their\nlives as the food they eat and the air they breathe.Suddenly,\nsomehow, and somewhere,--at Versailles, at Norwalk, at Abergele, at\nNew Hamburg, or at Revere,--at some hitherto unfamiliar point upon\nan insignificant thread of the intricate iron web, an obstruction is\nencountered, a jar, as it were, is felt, and instantly, with time\nfor hardly an ejaculation or a thought, a multitude of human beings\nare hurled into eternity.It is no cause for surprise that such an\nevent makes the community in which it happens catch its breadth;\nneither is it unnatural that people should think more of the few who\nare killed, of whom they hear so much, than of the myriads who are\ncarried in safety and of whom they hear nothing.Yet it is well to\nbear in mind that there are two sides to that question also, and in\nno way could this fact be more forcibly brought to our notice than\nby the assertion, borne out by all the statistics we possess, that,\nirrespective of the vast increase in the number of those who travel,\na greater number of passengers in stage-coaches were formerly\neach year killed or injured by accidents to which they in no way\ncontributed through their own carelessness, than are now killed\nunder the same conditions in our railroad cars.In other words, the\nintroduction of the modern railroad, so far from proportionately\nincreasing the dangers of traveling, has absolutely diminished them.It is not, after all, the dangers but the safety of the modern\nrailroad which should excite our special wonder.What is the average length of the railroad journey resulting in\ndeath by accident to a prudent traveler?--What is the average length\nof one resulting in some personal injury to him?--These are two\nquestions which interest every one.Few persons, probably, start\nupon any considerable journey, implying days and nights on the\nrail, without almost unconsciously taking into some consideration\nthe risks of accident.Visions of collision, derailment, plunging\nthrough bridges, will rise unbidden.Even the old traveler who\nhas enjoyed a long immunity is apt at times, with some little\napprehension, to call to mind the musty adage of the pitcher and\nthe well, and to ask himself how much longer it will be safe for\nhim to rely on his good luck.A hundred thousand miles, perhaps,\nand no accident yet!--Surely, on every doctrine of chances, he\nnow owes to fate an arm or a leg;--perhaps a life.The statistics\nof a long series of years enable us, however, to approximate with\na tolerable degree of precision to an answer to these questions,\nand the answer is simply astounding;--so astounding, in fact,\nthat, before undertaking to give it, the question itself ought to\nbe stated with all possible precision.It is this:--Taking all\npersons who as passengers travel by rail,--and this includes all\ndwellers in civilized countries,--what number of journeys of the\naverage length are safely accomplished, to each one which results\nin the death or injury of a passenger from some cause over which he\nhad no control?--The cases of death or injury must be confined to\npassengers, and to those of them only who expose themselves to no\nunnecessary risk.When approaching a question of this sort, statisticians are apt to\nassume for their answers an appearance of mathematical accuracy.It is needless to say that this is a mere affectation.The best\nresults which can be arrived at are, after all, mere approximations,\nand they also vary greatly year by year.The body of facts from\nwhich conclusions are to be deduced must cover not only a definite\narea of space, but also a considerable lapse of time.Even Great\nBritain, with its 17,000 miles of track and its hundreds of millions\nof annual passenger journeys, shows results which, one year with\nanother, vary strangely.For instance, during the four years\nanterior to 1874, but one passenger was killed, upon an average, to\neach 11,000,000 carried; while in 1874 the proportion, under the\ninfluence of a succession of disasters, suddenly doubled, rising to\none in every 5,500,000; and then again in 1877, a year of peculiar\nexemption, it fell off to one in every 50,000,000.The percentage of\nfatal casualties to the whole number carried was in 1847-9 five fold\nwhat it was in 1878.If such fluctuations reveal themselves in the\nstatistics of Great Britain, those met with in the narrower field of\na single state in this country might well seem at first glance to\nset all computation at defiance.During the ten years, for example,\nbetween 1861 and 1870, about 200,000,000 passengers were returned\nas carried on the Massachusetts roads, with 135 cases of injury to\nindividuals.Then came the year of the Revere disaster, and out of\n26,000,000 carried, no less than 115 were killed or injured.Seven\nyears of comparative immunity then ensued, during which, out of\n240,000,000 carried, but two were killed and forty-five injured.In other words, through a period of ten years the casualties were\napproximately as one to 1,500,000; then during a single year they\nrose to one in 250,000, or a seven-fold increase; and then through\na period of seven years they diminished to one in 3,400,000, a\ndecrease of about ninety per cent.Taking, however, the very worst of years,--the year of the\nRevere disaster, which stands unparalleled in the history of\nMassachusetts,--it will yet be found that the answer to the question\nas to the length of the average railroad journey resulting in death\nor in injury will be expressed, not in thousands nor in hundreds\nof thousands of miles, but in millions.During that year some\n26,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the limits of the\nstate, and each journey averaged a distance of about 13 miles.It\nwould seem, therefore, that, even in that year, the average journey\nresulting in death was 11,000,000 miles, while that resulting either\nin death or personal injury was not less than 3,300,000.The year 1871, however, represented by no means a fair average.On the contrary, it indicated what may fairly be considered an\nexcessive degree of danger, exciting nervous apprehensions in the\nbreasts of those even who were not constitutionally timid.To reach\nwhat may be considered a normal average, therefore, it would be\nmore proper to include a longer period in the computation.Take,\nfor instance, the nine years, 1871-79, during which alone has\nany effort been made to reach statistical accuracy in respect to\nMassachusetts railroad accidents.During those nine years, speaking\nin round numbers and making no pretence at anything beyond a\ngeneral approximation, some 303,000,000 passenger journeys of 13\nmiles each have been made on the railroads and within the state.Of these 51 have resulted in death and 308 in injuries to persons\nfrom causes over which they had no control.The average distance,\ntherefore, traveled by all, before death happened to any one, was\nabout 80,000,000 miles, and that travelled before any one was either\ninjured or killed was about 10,800,000.The Revere disaster of 1871, however, as has been seen, brought\nabout important changes in the methods of operating the railroads\nof Massachusetts.Consequently the danger incident to railroad\ntraveling was materially reduced; and in the next eight years\n(1872-9) some 274,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the\nlimits of the state.The Wollaston disaster of October, 1878, was\nincluded in this period, during which 223 persons were injured and\n21 were killed.The average journey for these years resulting in any\ninjury to a passenger was close upon 15,000,000 miles, while that\nresulting in death was 170,000,000.But it may fairly be asked,--What, after all, do these figures\nmean?--They are, indeed, so large as to exceed comprehension; for,\nafter certain comparatively narrow limits are passed the practical\ninfinite is approached, and the mere adding of a few more ciphers\nafter a numeral conveys no new idea.On the contrary, the piling up\nof figures rather tends to weaken than to strengthen a statement,\nfor to many it suggests an idea of ridiculous exaggeration.Indeed,\nwhen a few years ago a somewhat similar statement to that just made\nwas advanced in an official report, a critic undertook to expose\nthe fallacy of it in the columns of a daily paper by referring to a\ncase within the writer\'s own observation in which a family of three\npersons had been killed on their very first journey in a railroad\ncar.It is not, of course, necessary to waste time over such a\ncriticism as this.Railroad accidents continually take place, and\nin consequence of them people are killed and injured, and of these\nthere may well be some who are then making their first journey by\nrail; but in estimating the dangers of railroad traveling the much\nlarger number who are not killed or injured at all must likewise be\ntaken into consideration.Any person as he may be reading this page\nin a railroad car may be killed or injured through some accident,\neven while his eye is glancing over the figures which show how\ninfinitesimal his danger is; but the chances are none the less as a\nmillion to one that any particular reader will go down to his grave\nuninjured by any accident on the rail, unless it be occasioned by\nhis or her own carelessness.Admitting, therefore, that ill luck or hard fortune must fall to\nthe lot of certain unascertainable persons, yet the chances of\nincurring that ill fortune are so small that they are not materially\nincreased by any amount of traveling which can be accomplished\nwithin the limits of a human life.So far from exhausting a fair\naverage immunity from accident by constant traveling, the statistics\nof Massachusetts during the last eight years would seem to indicate\nthat if any given person were born upon a railroad car, and remained\nupon it traveling 500 miles a day all his life, he would, with\naverage good fortune, be somewhat over 80 years of age before he\nwould be involved in any accident resulting in his death or personal\ninjury, while he would attain the highly respectable age of 930\nyears before being killed.Even supposing that the most exceptional\naverage of the Revere year became usual, a man who was killed by\nan accident at 70 years of age should, unless he were fairly to be\naccounted unlucky, have accomplished a journey of some 440 miles\nevery day of his life, Sundays included, from the time of his birth\nto that of his death; while even to have brought him within the\nfair liability of any injury at all, his daily journey should have\nbeen some 120 miles.Under the conditions of the last eight years\nhis average daily journey through the three score years and ten to\nentitle him to be killed in an accident at the end of them would be\nabout 600 miles.THE RAILROAD DEATH RATE.In connection with the statistics of railroad casualties it is not\nwithout interest to examine the general vital statistics of some\nconsiderable city, for they show clearly enough what a large degree\nof literal truth there was in the half jocose proposition attributed\nto John Bright, that the safest place in which a man could put\nhimself was inside a first-class railroad carriage of a train in\nfull motion.Take the statistics of Boston, for instance, for the\nyear 1878.During the four years 1875-8, it will be remembered, a\nsingle passenger only was killed on the railroads of Massachusetts\nin consequence of an accident to which he by his own carelessness\nin no way contributed.[27] The average number of persons annually\ninjured, not fatally, during those years was about five.[27] This period did not include the Wollaston disaster, as the\n  Massachusetts railroad year closes on the last day of September.The\n  Wollaston disaster occurred on the 8th of October, 1878, and was\n  accordingly included in the next railroad year.Yet during the year 1878, excluding all cases of mere injury of\nwhich no account was made, no less than 53 persons came to their\ndeaths in Boston from falling down stairs, and 37 more from falling\nout of windows; seven were scalded to death in 1878 alone.In the\nyear 1874 seventeen were killed by being run over by teams in\nthe streets, while the pastime of coasting was carried on at a\ncost of ten lives more.During the five years 1874-8 there were\nmore persons murdered in the city of Boston alone than lost their\nlives as passengers through the negligence of all the railroad\ncorporations in the whole state of Massachusetts during the nine\nyears 1871-8; though in those nine years were included both the\nRevere and the Wollaston disasters, the former of which resulted\nin the death of 29, and the latter of 21 persons.Neither are the\ncomparative results here stated in any respect novel or peculiar\nto Massachusetts.Years ago it was officially announced in France\nthat people were less safe in their own houses than while traveling\non the railroads; and, in support of this somewhat startling\nproposition, statistics were produced showing fourteen cases of\ndeath of persons remaining at home and there falling over carpets,\nor, in the case of females, having their garments catch fire, to ten\ndeaths on the rail.Even the game of cricket counted eight victims\nto the railroad\'s ten.It will not, of course, be inferred that the cases of death or\ninjury to passengers from causes beyond their control include\nby any means all the casualties involved in the operation of the\nrailroad system.On the contrary, they include but a very small\nportion of them.The experience of the Massachusetts roads during\nthe seven years between September 30, 1871, and September 30,\n1878, may again be cited in reference to this point.During that\ntime there were but 52 cases of injury to passengers from causes\nover which they had no control, but in connection with the entire\nworking of the railroad system no less than 1,900 cases of injury\nwere reported, of which 1,008 were fatal; an average of 144 deaths a\nyear.Of these cases, naturally, a large proportion were employés,\nwhose occupation not only involves much necessary risk, but whose\nfamiliarity with risk causes them always to incur it even in the\nmost unnecessary and foolhardy manner.During the seven years 293\nof them were killed and 375 were reported as injured.Nor is it\nsupposed that the list included by any means all the cases of injury\nwhich occurred.About one half of the accidents to employés are\noccasioned by their falling from the trains when in motion, usually\nfrom freight trains and in cold weather, and from being crushed\nbetween cars while engaged in coupling them together.From this last\ncause alone an average of 27 casualties are annually reported.One\nfact, however, will sufficiently illustrate how very difficult it is\nto protect this class of men from danger, or rather from themselves.As is well known, on freight trains they are obliged to ride on the\ntops of the cars; but these are built so high that their roofs come\ndangerously near the bottoms of the highway bridges, which cross\nthe track sometimes in close proximity to each other.Accordingly\nmany unfortunate brakemen were killed by being knocked off the\ntrains as they passed under these bridges.With a view to affording\nthe utmost possible protection against this form of accident, a\nstatute was passed by the Massachusetts legislature compelling the\ncorporations to erect guards at a suitable distance from every\noverhead bridge which was less than eighteen feet in the clear\nabove the track.These guards were so arranged as to swing lightly\nacross the tops of the cars, giving any one standing upon them a\nsharp rap, warning him of the danger he was in.This warning rap,\nhowever, so annoyed the brakemen that the guards were on a number of\nthe roads systematically destroyed as often as they were put up; so\nthat at last another law had to be passed, making their destruction\na criminal offense.The brakemen themselves resisted the attempt\nto divest their perilous occupation of one of its most insidious\ndangers.In this respect, however, brakemen differ in no degree from the\nrest of the community.On all hands railroad accidents seem to\nbe systematically encouraged, and the wonder is that the list of\ncasualties is not larger.In Massachusetts, for instance, even in\nthe most crowded portions of the largest cities and towns, not\nonly do the railroads cross the highways at grade, but whenever new\nthoroughfares are laid out the people of the neighborhood almost\ninvariably insist upon their crossing the railroads at a grade\nand not otherwise.Not but that, upon theory and in the abstract,\nevery one is opposed to grade-crossings; but those most directly\nconcerned always claim that their particular crossing is exceptional\nin character.In vain do corporations protest and public officials\nargue; when the concrete case arises all neighborhoods become alike\nand strenuously insist on their right to incur everlasting danger\nrather than to have the level of their street broken.During the\nlast seven years to September 30, 1878, 191 persons have been\ninjured, and 98 of them fatally injured, at these crossings in\nMassachusetts, and it is certain as fate that the number is destined\nto annually increase.What the result in a remote future will be, it\nis not now easy to forecast.Daniel travelled to the garden.One thing only would seem certain: the\ntime will come when the two classes of traffic thus recklessly made\nto cross each other will at many points have to be separated, no\nmatter at what cost to the community which now challenges the danger\nit will then find itself compelled to avoid.The heaviest and most regular cause of death and injury involved\nin the operation of the railroad system yet remains to be referred\nto; and again it is recklessness which is at the root of it, and\nthis time recklessness in direct violation of law.John moved to the hallway.The railroad\ntracks are everywhere favorite promenades, and apparently even\nresting-places, especially for those who are more or less drunk.In Great Britain physical demolition by a railroad train is also a\nsomewhat favorite method of committing suicide, and that, too, in\nthe most deliberate and cool-blooded manner.Cases have not been\nuncommon in which persons have been seen to coolly lay themselves\ndown in front of an advancing train, and very neatly effect their\nown decapitation by placing their necks across the rail.In England\nalone, during the last seven years, there have been no less than 280\ncases of death reported under the head of suicides, or an average\nof 40 each year, the number in 1878 rising to 60.In America these\ncases are not returned in a class by themselves.Under the general\nhead of accidents to trespassers, however, that is, accidents to\nmen, women and children, especially the latter, illegally lying,\nwalking, or playing on the tracks or riding upon the cars,--under\nthis head are regularly classified more than one third of all\nthe casualties incident to working the Massachusetts railroads.During the last seven years these have amounted to an aggregate\nof 724 cases of injury, no less than 494 of which were fatal.Of\ncourse, very many other cases of this description, which were not\nfatal, were never reported.And here again the recklessness of the\npublic has received further illustration, and this time in a very\nunpleasant way.Certain corporations operating roads terminating\nin Boston endeavored at one time to diminish this slaughter by\nenforcing the laws against walking on railroad tracks.A few\ntrespassers were arrested and fined, and then the resentment of\nthose whose wonted privileges were thus interfered with began to\nmake itself felt.Obstructions were found placed in the way of night\ntrains.The mere attempt to keep people from risking their lives\nby getting in the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of\npassengers in imminent jeopardy.Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective means of keeping\nrailroad tracks from becoming foot-paths, and thus at once putting\nan end to the largest item in the grand total of the expenditure\nof life incident to the operation of railroads, is that secured\nby the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional corollary to its\nmethod of ballasting.That superb organization, every detail of\nwhose wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all interested\nin the operation of railroads, has a roadway peculiar to itself.A principal feature in this is a surface of broken stone ballast,\ncovering not only the space between the rails, but also the interval\nbetween the tracks as well as the road-bed on the outside of each\ntrack for a distance of some three feet.It resembles nothing so\nmuch as a newly macadamized highway.That, too, is its permanent\ncondition.To walk on the sharp and uneven edges of this broken\nstone is possible, with a sufficient expenditure of patience and\nshoe-leather; but certainly no human being would ever walk there\nfrom preference, or if any other path could be found.Not only is\nit in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked upon as better than\nany other, but it confounds the tramp.Its systematic adoption in\ncrowded, suburban neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a double\npurpose.It would secure to the corporations permanent road-beds\nexclusively for their own use, and obviate the necessity of arrests\nor futile threats to enforce the penalties of the law against\ntrespassers.It seems singular that this most obvious and effective\nway of putting a stop to what is both a nuisance and a danger has\nnot yet been resorted to by men familiar with the use of spikes and\nbroken glass on the tops of fences and walls.Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate, the loss of life\nincident to the working of the railroad system is not excessive, nor\nis it out of proportion to what might reasonably be expected.It is\nto be constantly borne in mind, not only that the railroad performs\na great function in modern life, but that it also and of necessity\nperforms it in a very dangerous way.A practically irresistible\nforce crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a\nwild rate of speed, going hither and thither, across highways and\nby-ways and along a path which is in itself a thoroughfare,--such an\nagency cannot be expected to work incessantly and yet never to come\nin contact with the human frame.Naturally, however, it might be a\nvery car of Juggernaut.Is it so in fact?--To demonstrate that it\nis not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison between\nthe statistics of railroad accidents and those which necessarily\noccur in the experience of all considerable cities.Take again those\nof Boston and of the railroad system of Massachusetts.These for the\npurpose of illustration are as good as any, and in their results\nwould only be confirmed in the experience of Paris as compared with\nthe railroad system of France, or in that of London as compared with\nthe railroad system of Great Britain.During the eight years between\nSeptember 30, 1870, and September 30, 1878, the entire railroad\nsystem of Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives, apart\nfrom all cases of injury which did not prove fatal.The returns in\nthis respect also may be accepted as reasonably accurate, as the\ndeaths were all returned, though the cases of merely personal injury\nprobably were not.During the ten\nyears, 1868-78, 2,587 cases of death from accidental causes, or 259\na year, were recorded as having taken place in the city of Boston.In other words, the annual average of deaths by accident in the city\nof Boston alone exceeds that consequent on running all the railroads\nof the state by eighty per cent.Unless, therefore, the railroad\nsystem is to be considered as an exception to all other functions of\nmodern life, and as such is to be expected to do its work without\ninjury to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a very\nheavy indictment against it.AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.Up to this point, the statistics and experience of Massachusetts\nonly have been referred to.This is owing to the fact that the\nrailroad returns of that state are more carefully prepared and\ntabulated than are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,\nmore satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.The\nterritorial area from which the statistics are in this case derived\nis very limited, and it yet remains to compare the results deduced\nfrom them with those derived from the similar experience of other\ncommunities.This, however, is not an easy thing to do; and, while\nit is difficult enough as respects Europe, it is even more difficult\nas respects America taken as a whole.This last fact is especially\nunfortunate in view of the circumstance that, in regard to railway\naccidents, the United States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a\nmost undesirable reputation.Foreign authorities have a way of\nreferring to our "well-known national disregard of human life," with\na sort of complacency, at once patronizing and contemptuous, which\nis the reverse of pleasing.Judging by the tone of their comments,\nthe natural inference would be that railroad disasters of the worst\ndescription were in America matters of such frequent occurrence\nas to excite scarcely any remark.As will presently be made very\napparent, this impression, for it is only an impression, can, so\nfar as the country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved nor\ndisproved, from the absence of sufficient data from which to argue.As respects Massachusetts, however, and the same statement may\nperhaps be made of the whole belt of states north of the Potomac and\nthe Ohio, there is no basis for it.There is no reason to suppose\nthat railroad traveling is throughout that region accompanied by any\npeculiar or unusual degree of danger.The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing the results\ndeduced from equally complete statistics of different countries,\nlies in the variety of the arbitrary rules under which the\ncomputations in making them up are effected.As an example in\npoint, take the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of\nMassachusetts.They are in each case prepared with a great deal\nof care, and the results deduced from them may fairly be accepted\nas approximately correct.As respects accidents, the number of\ncases of death and of personal injury are annually reported, and\nwith tolerable completeness, though in the latter respect there is\nprobably in both cases room for improvement.The whole comparison\nturns, however, on the way in which the entire number of passengers\nannually carried is computed.In Great Britain, for instance, in\n1878, these were returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,\nand in Massachusetts at 34,000,000.By dividing these totals by\nthe number of cases of death and injury reported as occurring\nto passengers from causes beyond their control, we shall arrive\napparently at a fair comparative showing as to the relative safety\nof railroad traveling in the two communities.The result for that\nparticular year would have been that while in Great Britain one\npassenger in each 23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600\ninjured from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts none\nwere killed and only one in each 14,000,000 was in any way injured.Unfortunately, however, a closer examination reveals a very great\nerror in the computation, affecting every comparative result drawn\nfrom it.In the English returns no allowance whatever is made\nfor the very large number of journeys made by season-ticket or\ncommutation passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the contrary,\neach person of this class enters into the grand total as making two\ntrips each day, 156 trips on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on\neach annual.Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of season tickets\nwere returned by the railway companies of Great Britain.How many\nof these were quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does not\nappear.If they were all annual travelers, no less than 261,000,000\njourneys should be added to the 565,000,000 in the returns, in order\nto arrive at an equal basis for a comparison between the foreign\nand the American roads: this method, however, would be manifestly\ninaccurate, so it only remains, in the absence of all reliable data,\nand for the purpose of comparison solely, to strike out from the\nMassachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket passages, which at\nonce reduces by over 3,000,000 the number of journeys to each case\nof injury.As season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed to\ndanger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers, no result is\napproximately accurate which leaves them out of the computation.At\npresent, however, the question relates not to the positive danger or\nsafety of traveling by rail, but to its relative danger in different\ncommunities.Allowance for this discrepancy can, however, be made by adding to\nthe English official results an additional nineteen per cent., that,\naccording to the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion\nof the season-ticket to other passengers on the roads of Great\nBritain.Taking then the Board of Trade returns for the eight\nyears 1870-7, it will be found that during this period about one\npassenger in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been killed\nin railroad accidents, and about one in each 436,000 injured.This may be assumed as a fair average for purpose of comparison,\nthough it ought to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of\ncasualties to passengers shows a decided tendency to decrease, and\nduring the years 1877-8 the percentages of killed fell from one in\n15,000,000 to one in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in\n436,000 to one in 766,000.The aggregates from which these results\nare deduced are so enormous, rising into the thousands of millions,\nthat a certain degree of reliance can be placed on them.In the\ncase of Massachusetts, however, the entire period during which the\nstatistics are entitled to the slightest weight includes only eight\nyears, 1872-9, and offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys,\nor but about forty per cent.of those included in the British\nreturns of the single year 1878.During these years the killed in\nMassachusetts were one in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in\neach 1,230,000;--or, while the killed in the two cases were very\nnearly in the same proportion,--respectively one in 14.5, and one in\n13, speaking in millions,--the British injured were really three to\none of the Massachusetts.The equality as respects the killed in this comparison, and the\nmarked discrepancy as respects the injured is calculated at first\nsight to throw doubts on the fullness of the Massachusetts returns.There seems no good reason why the injured should in the one case\nbe so much more numerous than in the other.This, however, is\nsusceptible on closer examination of a very simple and satisfactory\nexplanation.In case of accident the danger of sustaining slight\npersonal injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in Great\nBritain.This is due to the heavier and more solid construction\nof the American passenger coaches, and their different interior\narrangement.This fact, and the real cause of the large number of\nslightly injured,--"shaken" they call it,--in the English railroad\naccidents is made very apparent in the following extract from Mr.Calcroft\'s report for 1877;--\n\n     "It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents to\n     railway trains are attended with less serious consequences\n     in proportion to the solidity of construction of passenger\n     carriages.The accomodation and internal arrangements of\n     third-class carriages, however, especially those used in\n     ordinary trains, are defective as regards safety and comfort,\n     as compared with many carriages of the same class on foreign\n     railways.The first-class passenger, except when thrown against\n     his opposite companion, or when some luggage falls upon him, is\n     generally saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or\n     padded linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and\n     third-class passenger is generally thrown with violence against\n     the hard wood-work.If the second and third-class carriages\n     had a high padded back lining, extending above the head of the\n     passenger, it would probably tend to lesson the danger to life\n     and limb which, as the returns of accidents show, passengers\n     in carriages of this class are much exposed to in train\n     accidents."[28]\n\n [28] _General Report to the Board of Trade upon the accidents which\n  have occurred on the Railways of the United Kingdom during the year\n  1877, p.37._\n\nIn 1878 the passenger journeys made in the second and third class\ncarriages of the United Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made\nin first class carriages;--or, expressed in millions, there were\nbut 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.There can be very little\nquestion indeed that if, during the last ten years, thirteen out\nof fourteen of the passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been\ncarried in narrow compartments with wooden seats and unlined sides\nthe number of those returned as slightly injured in the numerous\naccidents which occurred would have been at least three-fold larger\nthan it was.If it had not been ten-fold larger it would have been\nsurprising.The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply to passengers\nkilled in accidents for which they are in no degree responsible.When, however, the question reverts to the general cost in life\nand limb at which the railroad systems are worked and the railroad\ntraffic is carried on to the entire communities served, the\ncomparison is less favorable to Massachusetts.Taking the eight\nyears of 1871-8, the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,\nand 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for the same\nyears included 1,165 deaths, with only 1,044 cases of injury; in\nthe one case a total of 39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209\nthe other.It will, however be noticed that while in the British\nreturns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold those of death, in\nthe Massachusetts returns the deaths exceed the cases of injury.This fact in the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion\non the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.As a matter of\npractical experience it is well known that cases of injury almost\ninvariably exceed those of death, and the returns in which the\ndisproportion is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents\nitself, are probably the most full and reliable.Taking, therefore,\nthe deaths in the two cases as the better basis for comparison, it\nwill be found that the roads of Great Britain in the grand result\naccomplished seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts with\nless than eight times as many casualties; had the proportion between\nthe results accomplished and the fatal injuries inflicted been\nmaintained, but 536 deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in\nthe Massachusetts returns.The reason of this difference in result\nis worth looking for, and fortunately the statistical tables are\nin both cases carried sufficiently into detail to make an analysis\npossible; and this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very\nclearly that while, for those directly connected with the railroads,\neither as passengers or as employés, the Massachusetts system\nin its working involves relatively a less degree of danger than\nthat of Great Britain, yet for the outside community it involves\nvery much more.Take, for instance, the two heads of accidents\nat grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers, which have been\nalready referred to.In Great Britain highway grade-crossings\nare discouraged.The results of the policy pursued may in each case be read\nwith sufficient distinctness in the bills of mortality.During the\nyears 1872-7, of 1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of\nMassachusetts, no less than 200 occurred at highway grade crossings.Had the accidents of this description in Great Britain been equally\nnumerous in proportion to the larger volume of the traffic of that\ncountry, they would have resulted in over 3,000 cases of death or\npersonal injury; they did in fact result in 586 such cases.In\nMassachusetts, again, to walk at will on any part of a railroad\ntrack is looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable\nright of every member of the community, irrespective of age, sex,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.Accordingly, during the\nsix years referred to, this right was exercised at the cost of life\nor limb to 591 persons,--one in four of all the casualties which\noccurred in connection with the railroad system.In Great Britain\nthe custom of using the tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to\nexist, but, so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced\nin perpetual terror of the law.Accordingly, instead of some 9,000\ncases of death or injury from this cause during these six years,\nwhich would have been the proportion under like conditions in\nMassachusetts, the returns showed only 2,379.These two are among\nthe most constant and fruitful causes of accident in connection with\nthe railroad system of America.In great Britain their proportion\nto the whole number of casualties which take place is scarcely a\nseventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.Here they constitute\nvery nearly fifty per cent.of all the accidents which occur; there\nthey constitute but a little over seven.There is in this comparison\na good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if American\nlegislators would but take it in; for this is one matter the public\npolicy in regard to which can only be fixed by law.When we pass from Great Britain to the continental countries of\nEurope, the difficulties in the way of any fair comparison of\nresults become greater and greater.The statistics do not enter\nsufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation apparent.It is generally conceded that, where a due degree of caution is\nexercised by the passenger, railroad traveling in continental\ncountries is attended with a much less degree of danger than in\nEngland.When we come to the returns, they hardly bear out this\nconclusion; at least to the degree commonly supposed.Nowhere is human life more carefully guarded than in\nthat country; yet their returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers\ntransported on the French railroads during the eleven years 1859-69,\nno less than 65 were killed and 1,285 injured from causes beyond\ntheir control; or one in each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one\nin 10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every 674,000 injured\nas compared with one in each 330,000 in the other country.During\nthe single year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried\non the French lines, at a general cost to the community of 2,416\ncasualties, of which 295 were fatal.In Massachusetts, during the\nfour years 1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried, at\na reported cost of 1,158 casualties.This showing might well be\nconsidered favorable to Massachusetts did not the single fact that\nher returns included more than twice as many deaths as the French,\nwith only a quarter as many injuries, make it at once apparent that\nthe statistics were at fault.Under these circumstances comparison\ncould only be made between the numbers of deaths reported; which\nwould indicate that, in proportion to the work done, the railroad\noperations of Massachusetts involved about twice and a half more\ncases of injury to life and limb than those of the French service.As respects Great Britain the comparison is much more favorable, the\nreturns showing an almost exactly equal general death-rate in the\ntwo countries in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume\nof Great Britain being about four times that of France, while its\ndeath-rate by railroad accidents was as 1,100 to 295.With the exception of Belgium, however, in which country the\nreturns cover only the lines operated by the state, the basis\nhardly exists for a useful comparison between the dangers of injury\nfrom accident on the continental railroads and on those of Great\nBritain and America.The several systems are operated on wholly\ndifferent principles, to meet the needs of communities between\nwhose modes of life and thought little similarity exists.The\ncontinental trains are far less crowded than either the English or\nthe American, and, when accidents occur, fewer persons are involved\nin them.The movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation\nand at lower rates of speed, so that there is a grain of truth in\nthe English sarcasm that on a German railway "it almost seems as\nif beer-drinking at the stations were the principal business, and\ntraveling a mere accessory."Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads of Great\nBritain, it remains to be seen whether the evil reputation of the\nAmerican roads as respects accidents is wholly deserved.Is it\nindeed true that the danger to a passenger\'s life and limbs is so\nmuch greater in this country than elsewhere?--Locally, and so far\nas Massachusetts at least is concerned, it certainly is not.How\nis it with the country taken as a whole?--The lack of all reliable\nstatistics as respects this wide field of inquiry has already been\nreferred to.We do not know with\naccuracy even the number of miles of road operated; much less the\nnumber of passengers annually carried.As respects accidents, and\nthe deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some information may be\ngathered from a careful and very valuable, because the only record\nwhich has been preserved during the last six years in the columns of\nthe _Railroad Gazette_.It makes, of course, no pretence at either\nofficial accuracy or fullness, but it is as complete probably as\ncircumstances will permit of its being made.During the five years\n1874-8 there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,\nresulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of injury;--being an\naverage of 969 accidents a year, resulting in 232 deaths and 930\ncases of injury.These it will be remembered are casualties directly\nresulting either to passengers or employés from train accidents.No account is taken of injuries sustained by employés in the\nordinary operation of the roads, or by members of the community\nnot passengers.In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and\nemployés constitute one-half of the whole, but a very small portion\nof the injuries reported as sustained by either passengers or\nemployés are the consequence of train accidents,--not one in three\nin the case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.In\nfact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons reported in Massachusetts\nin the nine years 1870-8, but 271, or less than twelve per cent.,\nbelonged to the class alone included in the reports of the _Railroad\nGazette_.In England during the four years 1874-7 the proportion\nwas larger, being about twenty-five instead of twelve per cent.For\nAmerica at large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly the\nmost nearly correct, and the probabilities would seem to be that\nthe annual average of injuries to persons incident to operating the\nrailroads of the United States is not less than 10,000, of which at\nleast 1,200 are due to train accidents.Of these about two-thirds\nmay be set down as sustained by passengers, or, approximately, 800 a\nyear.It remains to be ascertained what proportion this number bears to\nthe whole number carried.There are no reliable statistics on this\nhead any more than on the other.Nothing but an approximation of\nthe most general character is possible.The number of passengers\nannually carried on the roads of a few of the states is reported\nwith more or less accuracy, and averaging these the result would\nseem to indicate that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000\npassengers annually carried on the roads of all the states.There\nis something barbarous about such an approximation, and it is\ndisgraceful that at this late day we should in America be forced\nto estimate the passenger movement on our railroads in much the\nsame way that we guess at the population of Africa.We are in this respect far in the rear of civilized\ncommunities.Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation\nto our present annual passenger movement, it will be observed that\nit is as nearly as may be half that of Great Britain.In Great\nBritain, in 1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from\naccidents to trains, and 675 in 1877.The average of the last eight\nyears has been 1,226.If, therefore, the approximation of 800 a\nyear for America is at all near the truth, the percentage would seem\nto be considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics\nof Great Britain.Meanwhile it is to be noted that while in Great\nBritain about 25 cases of injury are reported to each one of death,\nin America but four cases are reported to each death--a discrepancy\nwhich is extremely suggestive.Perhaps, however, the most valuable\nconclusion to be drawn from these figures is that in America we as\nyet are absolutely without any reliable railroad statistics on this\nsubject at all.Taken as a whole, however, and under the most favorable showing,\nit would seem to be a matter of fair inference that the dangers\nincident to railroad traveling are materially greater in the United\nStates than in any country of Europe.How much greater is a question\nwholly impossible to answer.So that when a statistical writer\nundertakes to show, as one eminent European authority has done, that\nin a given year on the American roads one passenger in every 286,179\nwas killed, and one in every 90,737 was injured, it is charitable\nto suppose that in regard to America only is he indebted to his\nimagination for his figures.Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory degree of\nprecision the nature of the accidents in the two countries, with\na view to drawing inferences from them.Without attempting to do\nso it maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports for the\nlast five years, 1874-8, include inquiries into 755 out of 11,585\naccidents, the total number of every description reported as having\ntaken place.Meanwhile the _Railroad Gazette_ contains mention of\n4,846 reported train accidents which occurred in America during\nthe same five years.Of these accidents, 1,310 in America and 81\nin Great Britain were due to causes which were either unexplained\nor of a miscellaneous character, or are not common to the systems\nof the two countries.In so far as the remainder admitted of\nclassification, it was somewhat as follows:--\n\n                                   GREAT BRITAIN.Accidents due to\n\n    Defects in permanent way        13 per cent.24 per cent.\n\n     ""

[29] During these five years there were in Great Britain four cases\n  of collision between locomotives or trains at level crossings of one\n  railroad by another; in America there were 79.The probable cause of\n  this discrepancy has already been referred to (_ante pp.The above record, though almost valueless for any purpose of exact\ncomparison, reveals, it will be noticed, one salient fact.Out of\n755 English accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of\ncollisions--whether head collisions, rear collisions, or collisions\non sidings or at junctions.In other words, to collisions of some\nsort between trains were due considerably more than half (54 per\ncent.)of the accidents which took place in Great Britain, while\nonly 88, or less than 13 per cent.of the whole, were due to\nderailments from all causes.In America on the other hand, while\nof the 3,763 accidents recorded, 1,324, or but one-third part (35\nper cent.)were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per\ncent., were classed under the head of derailments, due to defects\nin the permanent way.During the the six years 1873-8 there were\nin all 1698 cases of collision of every description between trains\nreported as occurring in America to 1495 in the United Kingdom; but\nwhile in America the derailments amounted to no less than 4016, or\nmore than twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they were\nbut 817, or a little more than half their number.It has already\nbeen noticed that the most disastrous accidents in America are apt\nto occur on bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest\nthemselves.Under the heading\nof "Failures of Tunnels, Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there\nwere returned in that country during the six years 1873-8 only 29\naccidents in all; while during the same time in America, under the\nheads of broken bridges or tressels and open draws, the _Gazette_\nrecorded no less than 165.These figures curiously illustrate the\ndifferent manner in which the railroads of the two countries have\nbeen constructed, and the different circumstances under which they\nare operated.The English collisions are distinctly traceable to\nconstant overcrowding; the American derailments and bridge accidents\nto inferior construction of our road-beds.Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish the dangers\nof the rail?--What more can be done?--Few persons realize what a\ntremendous pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down upon\nthose whose business it is to operate railroads.A great accident is\nnot only a terrible blow to the pride and prestige of a corporation,\nnot only does it practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved\nin it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.Juries\nproverbially have little mercy for railroad corporations, and, when\na disaster comes, these have practically no choice but to follow the\nscriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries quickly.The\nRevere catastrophe, for instance, cost the railroad company liable\non account of it over half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula\naccident over $600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000.A few years ago\nin England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for damages sustained\nthrough the death of a single individual.During the five years,\n1867-71, the railroad corporations of Great Britain paid out over\n$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned by accidents.In\nview, merely, of such money consequences of disaster, it would be\nmost unnatural did not each new accident lead to the adoption of\nbetter appliances to prevent its recurrence.[30]\n\n  [30] The other side of this proposition has been argued with\n  much force by Mr.William Galt in his report as one of the Royal\n  Commission of 1874 on Railway Accidents.Galt\'s individual\n  report bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as\n  a matter of actual experience, the principle of self-interest on\n  the part of the railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient\n  safeguard against accidents.However it may be in theory, he\n  contends that, taking into consideration the great cost of the\n  appliances necessary to insure safety to the public on the one side,\n  and the amount of damages incident to a certain degree of risk on\n  the other side, the possible saving in expenditure to the companies\n  by assuming the risk far exceeds the loss incurred by an occasional\n  accident.The companies become, in a word, insurers of their\n  passengers,--the premium being found in the economies effected by\n  not adopting improved appliances of recognized value, and the losses\n  being the damages incurred in case of accident.He treats the whole\n  subject at great length and with much knowledge and ability.His\n  report is a most valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a\n  closer government supervision over railroads as a means of securing\n  an increased safety from accident.To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents, and the\nfinal conclusion to be drawn from the statistics which have been\npresented.That conclusion briefly stated is that the charges of\nrecklessness and indifference so generally and so widely advanced\nagainst those managing the railroads cannot for an instant be\nsustained.After all, as was said in the beginning of the present\nvolume, it is not the danger but the safety of the railroad which\nshould excite our special wonder.If any one doubts this, it is\nvery easy to satisfy himself of the fact,--that is, if by nature\nhe is gifted with the slightest spark of imagination.It is but\nnecessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station and to\nlook at an express train dashing by.There are few sights finer;\nfew better calculated to quicken the pulse.The glare of the head-light, the rush and throb of the\nlocomotive,--the connecting rod and driving-wheels of which seem\ninstinct with nervous life,--the flashing lamps in the cars, and\nthe final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish almost\nas soon as they are seen,--all this is well calculated to excite\nour admiration; but the special and unending cause for wonder is\nhow, in case of accident, anything whatever is left of the train.As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable\nthat something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must\nnecessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter\nand irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the\nneighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth\nat a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two\nslender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how\nwhen, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like\nthis was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned\nfor himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should\nas soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon\none of Congreve\'s _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the\nmercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham\nexclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen\nmiles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they\nwrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer\nand correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the\nfirst nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of\nimagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into\nan immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the\nless a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the\nday and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement\nis going on.Daniel went back to the bedroom.It depends for its even action\non every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance\nof thousands of employés to the condition of the atmosphere, the\nheat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in\nconstant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of\nconditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of\nmovement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,\nof the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their\nlives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing\nat once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the\nintricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more\ncreditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight\nthan the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele, accident at, 72.Accidents, railroad, about stations, 166.\n    at highway crossings, 165.\n      level railroad crossings, 94,165, 245, 258.\n    aggravated by English car

you must feed the body if you expect it to be built up."One says drinking floods of water is a cure-all.Another says the water is\nall right, but you must use it for the "internal bath."Still another\nagrees that water is the thing, but it must be used in hot and cold\napplications.One faker says _he_ has found that most diseases are caused by defective\neyes, and proposes to cure anything from consumption to ingrown toe-nails\nwith glasses.Another agrees that the predisposing cause of diseases is\neye strain, but the first fellow is irrational in his treatment.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.Glasses\nare unnatural and therefore all wrong.To cure the eyes use his wonderful\nnature-assisting ointment; that goes right to the optic nerve and makes\nold eyes young, weak eyes strong, relieves nerve strain and thereby makes\nsick people well.Another has found that "infused" blood is the real elixir of life.of twenty cases of tuberculosis cured by his\nbeneficent discovery.I wonder why we have a "Great White Plague" at all;\nor why we have international conventions to discuss means of staying the\nravages of this terrible disease; or why State medical boards are devoting\nso much space in their bulletins to warn and educate the people against\nthe awful fatality of consumption, when to cure it is so easy if doctors\nwill only use blood?Even if the hemotherapist does claim a little too much, there is yet no\ncause for terror.A leading Osteopathic journal proclaims in large\nletters that the Osteopath can remove the obstruction so that nature will\ncure consumption.Christian Scientists and Magnetic Healers have not yet admitted their\ndefeat, and there are many regulars who have not surrendered to the\nplague.So the poor consumptive may hope on (while his money lasts).Our\nmost conscientious physicians not only admit limitations in curing\ntuberculosis, but try to teach the people that they must not rely on being\n"cured" if they are attacked, but must work with the physician to prevent\nits contagion.The intelligent layman can say "Amen" to that doctrine.The question may be fairly put: "Why not have more of such frankness from\nthe physician?"The manner in which the admissions of doctors that they\nare unable to control tuberculosis with medicine or surgery alone has been\nreceived by intelligent people should encourage the profession.It would\nseem more fair to take the stand of Professor Osler when he says that\nsound hygienic advice for the prevention of diseases must largely take the\nplace of present medication and pretence of cure.As a member of the American Medical Association recently said, "The\nplacebo will not fool intelligent people always."And when it is generally\nknown that most of a physician\'s medicines are given as placebos, do you\nwonder that the claims of "drugless healers" receive such serious\nconsideration?The absurd, conflicting claims of quack pretenders are bad enough to\nmuddle the situation and add to the turbidity of therapeutics; but all\nthis is not doing the medical profession nearly as much harm, nor driving\nas many people into the ranks of fad followers, as the inconsistencies and\ncontradictions among the so-called regulars.This was my opinion before I made any special study of therapeutics, and\nwhile studying I found numbers of prominent medical men who agree with me.One of them says that the "criticisms," quarrels, contradictions, and\ninconsistencies of medical men are doing more to lower the profession in\nthe estimation of the intelligent laity and to cause people to follow the\nfads of "new schools" than all else combined.Think for a moment of some of these inconsistencies and contradictions.One doctor in a town tells the people that he "breaks up" typhoid fever.His rival, perhaps from the same college, tells the people that typhoid\nmust "run its course" and cannot be broken up, and that any man who claims\nthe contrary is a liar and a shyster.One surgeon makes a portion of the\npeople believe he has saved dozens of lives in that community by surgical\noperations; the other physicians of the town tell the people openly, or at\nleast hint, that there has been a great deal of needless butchery\nperformed in that community in the name of surgery.And then the people\nsee editorials in the daily press about the fad of having operations\nperformed, and read in their health culture or Osteopathic journals from\narticles by the greatest M.D.s, in which it is admitted that surgery is\npracticed too largely as a graft.Professor Osler is quoted as saying:\n\n    "Surgeons are finding altogether too many cases of appendicitis these\n    days.Appendicitis is becoming so common and so easily detected that\n    the physician\'s wife can diagnose a case of it over the telephone."One leading physician says medical treatment has little beneficial effect\non pneumonia; another claims to be able to cure it, and lets the friends\nof his patient rely entirely on his medicine in the most desperate cases.Another says, "All those clay preparations\nare frauds, and the only safe way to treat pneumonia is by blood letting."Thus it goes, and this is only a sample of contradictions that arise in\nthe treatment of diseases.Most of it was from the journal of\nthe editor who said he refused to send it to a layman who had sent his\nmoney in advance.But all that same stuff has been hashed and rehashed to\nthe people through the sources I have already mentioned.There are not\nonly these evidences of inconsistencies to edify (?)the people, but\nconstantly recurring examples of incompetency and pretensions.There is no doubt a middle ground in all this, but it is not evident to\nthe casual observer.If the true physician would honestly admit his\nlimitations to the intelligent laity, much of this muddle would be\navoided.While by such a course he may occasionally temporarily lose a\npatient, in the end both the public and profession would gain.The time\nhas gone by to "assume an air of infallibility toward the public."CHAPTER V.\n\nTHE EXPERT WITNESS AND PROPRIETARY MEDICINES.The "Great Nerve Specialist"--The Professional Witness a Jonah--The\n    "Railway Spine"--Is it Lack of Fairness and Honesty or Lack of Skill\n    and Learning?--Destruction of Fine Herds of Cattle Without\n    Compensation--Koch\'s Dictum and Denial--Koch\'s Tuberculin--The Serum\n    Tribe--Stupendous Sale of Nostrums--Druggist\'s Arguments--Use of\n    Proprietary Medicines Stimulates Sale of Nostrums.I wonder what the patrons of the sanitarium of the "great nerve\nspecialist" thought of his display of knowledge of the nervous system when\nhe was on the witness stand in a recent notorious case?A lawyer tangled\nhim up completely, and showed that the doctor had no accurate knowledge of\nthe anatomy of the nervous system.When asked the origin of the\nall-important pneumogastric nerve, he _thought_ it originated in a certain\nsegment of the spinal cord!This noted "specialist" was made perfectly\ncontemptible, and the whole profession must have blushed in shame at the\nspectacle presented.And that spectacle was not unnoticed by the\nintelligent laity.The professional witness has in most cases been a Jonah to the profession.It is about as easy to get the kind of testimony you want from a\nprofessional witness in a suit for damages for personal injuries as it is\nto get a doctor\'s certificate to get out of working your poll-tax, or a\ncertificate of physical soundness to carry fraternal life insurance.Let me recall the substance of a paper read a few years ago by perhaps the\ngreatest lawyer in Iowa (afterward governor of that State).He told of a\ntrial in which he had examined and cross-examined ten physicians.It was a\ntrial in which suit was brought to recover damages for personal injury, a\ngood illustration of the "railway spine."One physician testified that the\npatient was afflicted with sclerosis of the spinal cord; another said it\nwas a plain case of congestion of the cord; another diagnosed degeneration\nof the cord; yet another said it was a true combination of all the\nconditions named by the first three.They all said there was atrophy of\nthe muscles of the left leg, and predicted that complete paralysis would\nsurely supervene.On the other side five noted physicians testified as positively that\nneither the spinal cord nor any nerve was injured; that there was no sign\nof atrophy or loss of power in the leg; and they seemed to think the\ndisease afflicting the patient was due to a fixed desire to secure a\nverdict for large damages from the railway company.One eminent specialist\nmade oath that the electrical test showed the partial reaction of\ndegeneration; another as famous challenged him to make the test again in\nthe presence of both.After it was made this second specialist went before\nthe jury and positively declared that there was no trace whatever of the\nreaction of degeneration, and that the muscles responded to the current\nprecisely as healthy muscles should.Then this eminent attorney adds: "If the instances of such diversity were\nrare they might pass unnoticed, but they occur and re-occur as often as\nphysicians are called to the temple of justice for the expression of\nopinions."The lay mind imputes this clash of opinions either to lack of fairness and\nhonesty or lack of skill and learning.In either case the profession\nsuffers great injury in the estimation of those who should have for it\nonly the profoundest admiration and the most implicit faith.Again I ask,\nIs it any wonder people have lost implicit faith when they read many\nreports of similar cases rehashed in the various yellow journals put into\ntheir hands?Farmers submitted with all possible grace to the decrees of science when,\nby the authority of such a great man as Koch, their fine herds of cattle\nwere condemned as breeders and disseminators of the great white plague and\ndestroyed without compensation.But how do you think these same farmers\nfeel when they read in yellow journals that Koch has changed his mind\nabout bovine and human tuberculosis being identical, and has serious\ndoubts about the one contracting in any way the disease of the other.People read with renewed hope the glowing accounts of the wonderful\nachievements of Dr.Koch in finding a destroyer for the germ of\nconsumption.Somehow time has slipped by since that renowned discovery,\nwith consumption still claiming its victims, and many physicians are\nsaying "Koch\'s great discovery is proving only a great disappointment."Drugless therapy journals are continually pouring out the vials of their\nwrath upon vaccination, antitoxin and all the serum tribe, and their\nvituperation is even excelled by vindictive denunciations of the same\nthings by the individual boomer journals that flood the land.Another bitter contention that is confusing some, and disgusting others,\nis the acrimonious strife between users and non-users of proprietary\nmedicines.This usually develops into a sort of "rough house" affair, the\ndruggist mixing up as savagely as the doctors before the fight is\nfinished.I know nothing of the rights or wrongs of the case nor of the\nmerits or demerits of proprietary medicines, but I do know this, however:\nThe stupendous sale of nostrums that in 1907 represented a sum of money\nsufficient to have provided every practitioner of medicine in the United\nStates with a two thousand dollar salary, has been helped by the use of\nproprietary medicines.I am aware that my position is likely to be called\nin question by many physicians.But they should hear druggists arguing\nwith people who hesitate about buying patent medicines because their\nphysicians tell them they should seldom take medicine unless prescribed by\na doctor.They']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['And fills the spaces of the night\n       With furious and frantic thought,\n       One would not dare to think by day.Ah, if you came to me to-night\n       These visions would be turned to naught,\n       These hateful dreams be held at bay!But you are far, and Loneliness\n       My only lover through the night;\n       And not for any word or prayer\n   Would you console my loneliness\n       Or lend yourself, serene and slight,\n       And the cool clusters of your hair.All through the night I long for you,\n       As shipwrecked men in tropics yearn\n       For the fresh flow of streams and springs.My fevered fancies follow you\n       As dying men in deserts turn\n       Their thoughts to clear and chilly things.Such dreams are mine, and such my thirst,\n       Unceasing and unsatisfied,\n       Until the night is burnt away\n   Among these dreams and fevered thirst,\n       And, through the open doorways, glide\n       The white feet of the coming day.The Regret of the Ranee in the Hall of Peacocks\n\n   This man has taken my Husband\'s life\n     And laid my Brethren low,\n   No sister indeed, were I, no wife,\n     To pardon and let him go.Yet why does he look so young and slim\n     As he weak and wounded lies?How hard for me to be harsh to him\n     With his soft, appealing eyes.His hair is ruffled upon the stone\n     And the slender wrists are bound,\n   So young!and yet he has overthrown\n     His scores on the battle ground.Would I were only a slave to-day,\n     To whom it were right and meet\n   To wash the stains of the War away,\n     The dust from the weary feet.Were I but one of my serving girls\n     To solace his pain to rest!Shake out the sand from the soft loose curls,\n     And hold him against my breast!Would God that I were the senseless stone\n     To support his slender length!I hate those wounds that trouble my sight,\n     Unknown!how I wish you lay,\n   Alone in my silken tent to-night\n     While I charmed the pain away.I would lay you down on the Royal bed,\n     I would bathe your wounds with wine,\n   And setting your feet against my head\n     Dream you were lover of mine.My Crown is heavy upon my hair,\n     The Jewels weigh on my breast,\n   All I would leave, with delight, to share\n     Your pale and passionate rest!But hands grow restless about their swords,\n     Lips murmur below their breath,\n   "The Queen is silent too long!""My Lords,\n     --Take him away to death!"Protest: By Zahir-u-Din\n\n   Alas!this wasted Night\n   With all its Jasmin-scented air,\n   Its thousand stars, serenely bright!I lie alone, and long for you,\n   Long for your Champa-scented hair,\n   Your tranquil eyes of twilight hue;\n\n   Long for the close-curved, delicate lips\n   --Their sinuous sweetness laid on mine--\n   Here, where the slender fountain drips,\n   Here, where the yellow roses glow,\n   Pale in the tender silver shine\n   The stars across the garden throw.The poets hardly speak the truth,--\n   Despite their praiseful litany,\n   His season is not all delights\n   Nor every night an ecstasy!The very power and passion that make--\n   _Might_ make--his days one golden dream,\n   How he must suffer for their sake!Till, in their fierce and futile rage,\n   The baffled senses almost deem\n   They might be happier in old age.Age that can find red roses sweet,\n   And yet not crave a rose-red mouth;\n   Hear Bulbuls, with no wish that feet\n   Of sweeter singers went his way;\n   Inhale warm breezes from the South,\n   Yet never fed his fancy stray.From some near Village I can hear\n   The cadenced throbbing of a drum,\n   Now softly distant, now more near;\n   And in an almost human fashion,\n   It, plaintive, wistful, seems to come\n   Laden with sighs of fitful passion,\n\n   To mock me, lying here alone\n   Among the thousand useless flowers\n   Upon the fountain\'s border-stone--\n   Cold stone, that chills me as I lie\n   Counting the slowly passing hours\n   By the white spangles in the sky.Some feast the Tom-toms celebrate,\n   Where, close together, side by side,\n   Gay in their gauze and tinsel state\n   With lips serene and downcast eyes,\n   Sit the young bridegroom and his bride,\n   While round them songs and laughter rise.They are together; Why are we\n   So hopelessly, so far apart?Oh, I implore you, come to me!Come to me, Solace of mine eyes!A little, languid, mocking breeze\n   That rustles through the Jasmin flowers\n   And stirs among the Tamarind trees;\n   A little gurgle of the spray\n   That drips, unheard, though silent hours,\n   Then breaks in sudden bubbling play.Why, therefore, mock at my repose?Is it my fault I am alone\n   Beneath the feathery Tamarind tree\n   Whose shadows over me are thrown?Nay, I am mad indeed, with thirst\n   For all to me this night denied\n   And drunk with longing, and accurst\n   Beyond all chance of sleep or rest,\n   With love, unslaked, unsatisfied,\n   And dreams of beauty unpossessed.Hating the hour that brings you not,\n   Mad at the space betwixt us twain,\n   Sad for my empty arms, so hot\n   And fevered, even the chilly stone\n   Can scarcely cool their burning pain,--\n   And oh, this sense of being alone!Take hence, O Night, your wasted hours,\n   You bring me not my Life\'s Delight,\n   My Star of Stars, my Flower of Flowers!You leave me loveless and forlorn,\n   Pass on, most false and futile night,\n   Pass on, and perish in the Dawn!Famine Song\n\n   Death and Famine on every side\n       And never a sign of rain,\n   The bones of those who have starved and died\n       Unburied upon the plain.What care have I that the bones bleach white?To-morrow they may be mine,\n   But I shall sleep in your arms to-night\n       And drink your lips like wine!Cholera, Riot, and Sudden Death,\n       And the brave red blood set free,\n   The glazing eye and the failing breath,--\n       But what are these things to me?Your breath is quick and your eyes are bright\n       And your blood is red like wine,\n   And I shall sleep in your arms to-night\n       And hold your lips with mine!I hear the sound of a thousand tears,\n       Like softly pattering rain,\n   I see the fever, folly, and fears\n       Fulfilling man\'s tale of pain.But for the moment your star is bright,\n       I revel beneath its shine,\n   For I shall sleep in your arms to-night\n       And feel your lips on mine!And you need not deem me over cold,\n       That I do not stop to think\n   For all the pleasure this Life may hold\n       Is on the Precipice brink.Thought could but lessen my soul\'s delight,\n       And to-day she may not pine.For I shall lie in your arms to-night\n       And close your lips with mine!I trust what sorrow the Fates may send\n       I may carry quietly through,\n   And pray for grace when I reach the end,\n       To die as a man should do.To-day, at least, must be clear and bright,\n       Without a sorrowful sign,\n   Because I sleep in your arms to-night\n       And feel your lips on mine!So on I work, in the blazing sun,\n       To bury what dead we may,\n   But glad, oh, glad, when the day is done\n       And the night falls round us grey.Would those we covered away from sight\n       Had a rest as sweet as mine!For I shall sleep in your arms to-night\n       And drink your lips like wine!The Window Overlooking the Harbour\n\n   Sad is the Evening: all the level sand\n     Lies left and lonely, while the restless sea,\n   Tired of the green caresses of the land,\n     Withdraws into its own infinity.But still more sad this white and chilly Dawn\n     Filling the vacant spaces of the sky,\n   While little winds blow here and there forlorn\n     And all the stars, weary of shining, die.And more than desolate, to wake, to rise,\n     Leaving the couch, where softly sleeping still,\n   What through the past night made my heaven, lies;\n     And looking out across the window sill\n\n   See, from the upper window\'s vantage ground,\n     Mankind slip into harness once again,\n   And wearily resume his daily round\n     Of love and labour, toil and strife and pain.How the sad thoughts slip back across the night:\n     The whole thing seems so aimless and so vain.What use the raptures, passion and delight,\n     Burnt out; as though they could not wake again.The worn-out nerves and weary brain repeat\n     The question: Whither all these passions tend;--\n   This curious thirst, so painful and so sweet,\n     So fierce, so very short-lived, to what end?Even, if seeking for ourselves, the Race,\n     The only immortality we know,--\n   Even if from the flower of our embrace\n     Some spark should kindle, or some fruit should grow,\n\n   What were the use?the gain, to us or it,\n     That we should cause another You or Me,--\n   Another life, from our light passion lit,\n     To suffer like ourselves awhile and die.Our being runs\n     In a closed circle.All we know or see\n   Tends to assure us that a thousand Suns,\n     Teeming perchance with life, have ceased to be.Ah, the grey Dawn seems more than desolate,\n     And the past night of passion worse than waste,\n   Love but a useless flower, that soon or late,\n     Turns to a fruit with bitter aftertaste.Youth, even Youth, seems futile and forlorn\n     While the new day grows slowly white above.Pale and reproachful comes the chilly Dawn\n     After the fervour of a night of love.Back to the Border\n\n   The tremulous morning is breaking\n     Against the white waste of the sky,\n   And hundreds of birds are awaking\n     In tamarisk bushes hard by.I, waiting alone in the station,\n     Can hear in the distance, grey-blue,\n   The sound of that iron desolation,\n     The train that will bear me from you.\'T will carry me under your casement,\n     You\'ll feel in your dreams as you lie\n   The quiver, from gable to basement,\n     The rush of my train sweeping by.And I shall look out as I pass it,--\n     Your dear, unforgettable door,\n   \'T was _ours_ till last night, but alas!it\n     Will never be mine any more.Through twilight blue-grey and uncertain,\n     Where frost leaves the window-pane free,\n   I\'ll look at the tinsel-edged curtain\n     That hid so much pleasure for me.I go to my long undone duty\n     Alone in the chill and the gloom,\n   My eyes are still full of the beauty\n     I leave in your rose-scented room.Lie still in your dreams; for your tresses\n     Are free of my lingering kiss.I keep you awake with caresses\n     No longer; be happy in this!From passion you told me you hated\n     You\'re now and for ever set free,\n   I pass in my train, sorrow-weighted,\n     Your house that was Heaven to me.You won\'t find a trace, when you waken,\n     Of me or my love of the past,\n   Rise up and rejoice!I have taken\n     My longed-for departure at last.My fervent and useless persistence\n     You never need suffer again,\n   Nor even perceive in the distance\n     The smoke of my vanishing train!Reverie: Zahir-u-Din\n\n   Alone, I wait, till her twilight gate\n                        The Night slips quietly through,\n   With shadow and gloom, and purple bloom,\n                        Flung over the Zenith blue.Her stars that tremble, would fain dissemble\n                        Light over lovers thrown,--\n   Her hush and mystery know no history\n                        Such as day may own.Day has record of pleasure and pain,\n   But things that are done by Night remain\n                        For ever and ever unknown.For a thousand years, \'neath a thousand skies,\n                        Night has brought men love;\n   Therefore the old, old longings rise\n                        As the light grows dim above.Therefore, now that the shadows close,\n                        And the mists weird and white,\n   While Time is scented with musk and rose;\n                        Magic with silver light.I long for love; will you grant me some?as lovers have always come,\n                        Through the evenings of the Past.Swiftly, as lovers have always come,\n   Softly, as lovers have always come\n                        Through the long-forgotten Past.Sea Song\n\n   Against the planks of the cabin side,\n       (So slight a thing between them and me,)\n   The great

all that is sad and strange at sea.And you were white as the foam is white,\n       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled.had we but sailed and reached that night,\n       The sea\'s last edge,

fetters\' load\n     Beneath the scorching, azure skies.Serene and tall, with brows unbent,\n     Without a hope, without a friend,\n   He, under escort, onward went,\n     With death to meet him at the end.The Poppy fields were pink and gay\n     On either side, and in the heat\n   Their drowsy scent exhaled all day\n     A dream-like fragrance almost sweet.And when the cool of evening fell\n     And tender colours touched the sky,\n   He still felt youth within him dwell\n     And half forgot he had to die.Sometimes at night, the Camp-fires lit\n     And casting fitful light around,\n   His guard would, friend-like, let him sit\n     And talk awhile with them, unbound.Thus they, the night before the last,\n     Were resting, when a group of girls\n   Across the small encampment passed,\n     With laughing lips and scented curls.Then in the Prisoner\'s weary eyes\n     A sudden light lit up once more,\n   The women saw him with surprise,\n     And pity for the chains he bore.For little women reck of Crime\n     If young and fair the criminal be\n   Here in this tropic, amorous clime\n     Where love is still untamed and free.And one there was, she walked less fast,\n     Behind the rest, perhaps beguiled\n   By his lithe form, who, as she passed,\n     Waited a little while, and smiled.The guard, in kindly Eastern fashion,\n     Smiled to themselves, and let her stay.So tolerant of human passion,\n     "To love he has but one more day."Yet when (the soft and scented gloom\n     Scarce lighted by the dying fire)\n   His arms caressed her youth and bloom,\n     With him it was not all desire."For me," he whispered, as he lay,\n     "But little life remains to live.One thing I crave to take away:\n     You have the gift; but will you give?"If I could know some child of mine\n     Would live his life, and see the sun\n   Across these fields of poppies shine,\n     What should I care that mine is done?"To die would not be dying quite,\n     Leaving a little life behind,\n   You, were you kind to me to-night,\n     Could grant me this; but--are you kind?"See, I have something here for you\n     For you and It, if It there be."Soft in the gloom her glances grew,\n     With gentle tears he could not see.He took the chain from off his neck,\n     Hid in the silver chain there lay\n   Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.He drew her close; the moonless skies\n     Shed little light; the fire was dead.Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,\n     And many tender things she said.Throughout the hot and silent night\n     All that he asked of her she gave.And, left alone ere morning light,\n     He went serenely to the grave,\n\n   Happy; for even when the rope\n     Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,\n   And centered round his Secret Hope\n     The little life that was to be.When Poppies bloomed again, she bore\n     His child who gaily laughed and crowed,\n   While round his tiny neck he wore\n     The rubies given on the road.For his small sake she wished to wait,\n     But vainly to forget she tried,\n   And grieving for the Prisoner\'s fate,\n     She broke her gentle heart and died.Song of Taj Mahomed\n\n   Dear is my inlaid sword; across the Border\n   It brought me much reward; dear is my Mistress,\n   The jewelled treasure of an amorous hour.Dear beyond measure are my dreams and Fancies.These I adore; for these I live and labour,\n   Holding them more than sword or jewelled Mistress,\n   For this indeed may rust, and that prove faithless,\n   But, till my limbs are dust, I have my Fancies.The Garden of Kama:\n\n   Kama the Indian Eros\n\n   The daylight is dying,\n   The Flying fox flying,\n         Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.See, the sun throws a late,\n   Lingering, roseate\n         Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.Oh, come, unresisting,\n         Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.Shadow shall cover us,\n   Roses bend over us,\n         Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.We know not life\'s reason,\n   The length of its season,\n         Know not if they know, the great Ones above.We none of us sought it,\n   And few could support it,\n         Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.But much is forgiven\n   To Gods who have given,\n         If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.You do not yet know it,\n   But Kama shall show it,\n         Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.The Fireflies shall light you,\n   And naught shall afright you,\n         Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.Come, for I wait for you,\n   Night is too late for you,\n         Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.Every breeze still is,\n   And, scented with lilies,\n         Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,\n   The garden lies breathless,\n   Where Kama, the Deathless,\n         In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you.Camp Follower\'s Song, Gomal River\n\n   We have left Gul Kach behind us,\n      Are marching on Apozai,--\n   Where pleasure and rest are waiting\n      To welcome us by and by.We\'re falling back from the Gomal,\n      Across the Gir-dao plain,\n   The camping ground is deserted,\n      We\'ll never come back again.Along the rocks and the defiles,\n      The mules and the camels wind.Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,\n      The man who is left behind.For some we lost in the skirmish,\n      And some were killed in the fight,\n   But he was captured by fever,\n      In the sentry pit, at night.A rifle shot had been swifter,\n      Less trouble a sabre thrust,\n   But his Fate decided fever,\n      And each man dies as he must.The wavering flames rise high,\n   The flames of our burning grass-huts,\n      Against the black of the sky.We hear the sound of the river,\n      An ever-lessening moan,\n   The hearts of us all turn backwards\n      To where he is left alone.We sing up a little louder,\n      We know that we feel bereft,\n   We\'re leaving the camp together,\n      And only one of us left.The only one, out of many,\n      And each must come to his end,\n   I wish I could stop this singing,\n      He happened to be my friend.We\'re falling back from the Gomal\n      We\'re marching on Apozai,\n   And pleasure and rest are waiting\n      To welcome us by and by.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,\n      The lips of the girls less kind,--\n   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,\n      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed\n\n   _Rose-colour_\n   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows\n     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors\n   By which, in time of love, love\'s essence flows\n     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours\n     Out of the East, when day\'s white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden\'s downier cheek\n     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,\n   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak\n     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_\n   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,\n     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs\' wings,\n   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,\n     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,\n     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,\n   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,\n     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,\n     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,\n   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn\n     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,\n     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,\n   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,\n     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,\n     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,\n   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,\n     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,\n     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,\n     The two red cards in Life\'s unequal game._Green_\n   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,\n     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,\n   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,\n     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,\n     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,\n     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever\n     Something is wanting, something falls behind;\n   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never\n     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_\n   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)\n         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"\n         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,\n         So reticent, rare,\n   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,\n         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,\n         With its edges curled;\n   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell\n         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky\n         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty\n         To the robes of kings._Yellow_\n   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,\n     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,\n     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden\'s hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,\n     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,\n     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover\n\n   Why above others was I so blessed\n      And honoured?to be chosen one\n   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,\n      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;\n   Have I done well, for that past delight,\n      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,\n      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved\n      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart\n      Turned suddenly to the living joy,\n   And knew that your life and mine had part\n      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,\n      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,\n   I held myself as a sacred shrine\n      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,\n\n   That all unworthy I might not be\n      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell\n   Hidden away in the heart of me,\n      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid\n      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,\n      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew\n      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,\n   But this is a small and lovely you\n      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,\n      And given your only child to me,\n   My life devoted to yours and his,\n      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,\n      (Which, I think, must surely keep love\'s laws,)\n   I, should you chance to have need of me,\n      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall\n\n   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,\n   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,\n   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,\n   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,\n   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,\n   All the force of Nature\'s laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,\n   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th\' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,\n   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;\n\n   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,\n   But time o\' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_\n   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_\n\n\n\n\n\n"Love Lightly"\n\n   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,\n   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,\n   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,\n   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,\n   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;\n   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,\n     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,\n     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--\n   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,\n   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,\n   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,\n     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;\n     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past\n\n   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,\n     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find\n   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,\n     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--\n\n   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth\n     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,\n   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,\n     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed\n\n   When first I loved, I gave my very soul\n   Utterly unreserved to Love\'s control,\n   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away\n   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain\n   With any other Joy to stifle pain;\n   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,\n   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,\n   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed\n\n   This passion is but an ember\n     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;\n   I could not live and remember,\n     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,\n     That my mourning days were few,\n   You call me over forgetful--\n     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love\n\n   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above\n     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,\n   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,\n     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,\n     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,\n   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew\n     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,\n     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,\n   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,\n     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear\n     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,\n   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,\n     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,\n   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head\n     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,\n     And love has done his utmost \'twixt us twain,\n   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be\n     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,\n     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above\n   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,\n     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,\n     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,\n   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be\n     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes\n     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;\n   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,\n     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,\n     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,\n   It is as though some White Star stooped to be\n     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,\n     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,\n   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,\n     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,\n     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,\n   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,\n     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink\n     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice\n   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think\n     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,\n   Whether it please you to caress or slay,\n     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;\n     I envy that young maiden who was slain,\n   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,\n     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--\n\n   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet\n   As is the pain endured for one adored;\n     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet\n\n   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,\n     See how the stars grow large and white above,\n   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,\n     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song\n\n   The Stars await, serene and white,\n     The unarisen moon;\n   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,\n     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,\n     You see the lighted shore,\n   And hear the rippling water sigh\n     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,\n     My room is poor and bare:\n   But all the silver sea is ours,\n     And all the scented air\n\n   Blown from the mainland, where there grows\n     Th\' "Intriguer of the Night,"\n   The flower that you have named Tube rose,\n     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still\n     And no land breezes blow,\n   From its pale petals can distil\n     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;\n     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow\'s tide,\n     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land\n     My words are poor and few,\n   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,\n     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl\n\n   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,\n     Falling as softly on the careless street\n   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,\n     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple\'s little links and laws\n     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,\n     Nature\'s great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay\n     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,\n   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),\n     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine\n     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,\n   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine\n     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,\n     That curious paleness which enchants me so,\n   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,\n     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,\n     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;\n   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,\n     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,\n     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know\n   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:\n     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense\n     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,\n   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,\n     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share\n     That human passion Beauty makes divine,\n   I, over worn, should find you over fair,\n     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,\n     Falling as lightly on the careless street\n   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,\n     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh\'s Farewell to Burmah\n\n   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,\n   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:\n   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,\n   Our lips may close on each other\'s lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,\n   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,\n   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,\n   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;\n   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free\n   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,\n   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,\n   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,\n   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;\n   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,\n   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,\n   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,\n   Well we may know one another\'s speech, but never each other\'s souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,\n   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,\n   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight\n\n   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go\n     Hither and thither, in search of love,\n   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow\n     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,\n     There is a place where I fear to go,\n   Since the charm and glory of life to me\n     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,\n     With aimless haste and wearying fret;\n   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,\n     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song\n\n   A little breeze blew over the sea,\n       And it came from far away,\n   Across the fields of millet and rice,\n   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,\n   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,\n       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,\n       Awake and with sleep have done,\n   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,\n   And come with me to the rice fields now,\n   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,\n       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave\n\n   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power\n   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,\n   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,\n   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,\n                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels\n   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,\n   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,\n   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate\n   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,\n                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,\n   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,\n   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,\n   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,\n                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,\n   Kings\' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,\n   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted\n   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace\n   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,\n   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--\n   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,\n                   Had I the power.The Singer\n\n   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,\n     For all too well, alas!the singer knew\n   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,\n     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,\n     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:\n   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give\n     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,\n     But each man in his early season loves;\n   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,\n     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,\n     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly\n     Throughout life\'s grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,\n     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,\n   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,\n     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,\n     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--\n     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria\n\n   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,\n     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,\n   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,\n     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,\n     And from their filmy, iridescent scum\n   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,\n     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint\n     On spangled wings aloft and far away,\n   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,\n     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th\' incessant whine\n     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest\n   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,\n     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,\n     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,\n   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,\n     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float\n     Over the water, weird and white and chill,\n   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,\n     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,\n     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,\n   Only increase the frenzy of His greed\n     To add more victims to th\' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,\n     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,\n   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,\n     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;\n\n   Dreams that bestow on them their heart\'s desire,\n     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,\n   To sink, forgetful of the fever\'s fire,\n     Softly, as in a lover\'s arms, to rest.Fancy\n\n   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman\n       Fashioned this fancy for the West\'s delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly\n       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles\n       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,\n   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,\n       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something\n       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,\n       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,\n       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,\n   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,\n       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;\n\n   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure\n       Traced in the Dragon\'s form upon the white\n   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,\n       Where would\'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza\n\n   The evening sky was as green as Jade,\n      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,\n   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,\n      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air\n      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,\n   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,\n      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,\n      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,\n   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,\n      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,\n      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,\n   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,\n      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,\n      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,\n   Were surely meet for a Lover\'s prize,\n      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,\n      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar\n\n   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,\n     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,\n   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,\n     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,\n     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--\n     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,\n     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,\n   But kindness is a burden on my mind,\n     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir\'s bullet holds me here,\n     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,\n   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,\n     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,\n     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,\n   But since they fettered him I have no care\n     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,\n     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,\n   Meantime, my Heart\'s Delight may safely wait\n     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,\n     But I won, what I so desired, by night,\n   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth\n     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,\n   To raze thy very Memory from the North,\n     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_\n\n   Aha!it is Duty\n     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,\n   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam\'s beauty,\n     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,\n     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;\n     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure\n     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,\n   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,\n     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,\n     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;\n   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,\n     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,\n     Give here the Hakim\'s powder if thou wilt,\n   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,\n     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind\n     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know\'st, my Heart is left behind,\n     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India\'s Love Lyrics, by \nAdela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al."So Ben ordered you out, Mammy?"think I\'se skeered o\' him, honey?Reckon I\'d frail\n\'em good ef he cotched hole of me with his black hands.Jes\' let him try\nto come upstairs once, honey, an\' see what I say to\'m."Nevertheless Ben had, on one never-to-be-forgotten occasion, ordered\nMammy Easter out, and she had gone.And now, as she was working the beat\nbiscuits to be baked that evening, Uncle Ben\'s eye rested on her with\nsuspicion.What mere man may write with any confidence of the delicacies which\nwere prepared in Uncle\'s kitchen that morning?No need in those days of\ncooking schools.What Southern lady, to the manner born, is not a cook\nfrom the cradle?Even Ben noted with approval Miss Virginia\'s scorn for\npecks and pints, and grunted with satisfaction over the accurate pinches\nof spices and flavors which she used.And he did Miss Eugenie the honor\nto eat one of her praleens.That night came Captain Lige Brent, the figure of an eager and\ndetermined man swinging up the street, and pulling out his watch under\nevery lamp-post.And in his haste, in the darkness of a midblock, he\nran into another solid body clad in high boots and an old army overcoat,\nbeside a wood wagon."Howdy, Captain," said he of the high boots."Well, I just thought as much," was the energetic reply; "minute I seen\nthe rig I knew Captain Grant was behind it."He held out a big hand, which Captain Grant clasped, just looking at\nhis own with a smile.The stranger was Captain Elijah Brent of the\n\'Louisiana\'."Now," said Brent, "I\'ll just bet a full cargo that you\'re off to the\nPlanters\' House, and smoke an El Sol with the boys.""You\'re keen, Captain," said he."I\'ve got something here that\'ll outlast an El Sol a whole day,"\ncontinued Captain Breast, tugging at his pocket and pulling out a\nsix-inch cigar as black as the night.The Captain instantly struck a match on his boot and was puffing in a\nsilent enjoyment which delighted his friend."Reckon he don\'t bring out cigars when you make him a call," said the\nsteamboat captain, jerking his thumb up at the house.Captain Grant did not reply to that, nor did Captain Lige expect him to,\nas it was the custom of this strange and silent man to speak ill of no\none.He turned rather to put the stakes back into his wagon."Where are you off to, Lige?""Lord bless my soul," said Captain Lige, "to think that I could forget!""Grant, did you ever see my\nlittle sweetheart, Jinny Carvel?""She ain\'t little\nany more, and she eighteen to-day."Captain Grant clapped his hand to his forehead."Say, Lige," said he, "that reminds me.A month or so ago I pulled a\nfellow out of Renault\'s area across from there.After he got away I saw the Colonel and his daughter in the\nwindow."Instantly Captain Lige became excited, and seized Captain Grant by the\ncape of his overcoat."Say, Grant, what kind of appearing fellow was he?""Short, thick-set, blocky face.""I reckon I know," said Breast, bringing down his fist on the wagon\nboard; "I\'ve had my eye on him for some little time."He walked around the block twice after Captain Grant had driven down the\nmuddy street, before he composed himself to enter the Carvel mansion.He\npaid no attention to the salutations of Jackson, the butler, who saw him\ncoming and opened the door, but climbed the stairs to the sitting-room."Why, Captain Lige, you must have put wings on the Louisiana," said\nVirginia, rising joyfully from the arm of her father\'s chair to meet\nhim.What, give me up when I never missed a birthday,--and this the best of\nall of \'em."If your pa had got sight of me shovin\' in wood and cussin\' the pilot\nfor slowin\' at the crossin\'s, he\'d never let you ride in my boat again.Bill Jenks said: \'Are you plum crazy, Brent?\'Five dollars\'\' says I; \'wouldn\'t go in for five hundred.To-morrow\'s\nJinny Carvel\'s birthday, and I\'ve just got to be there.\'I reckon the\ntime\'s come when I\'ve got to say Miss Jinny," he added ruefully.The Colonel rose, laughing, and hit the Captain on the back."Drat you, Lige, why don\'t you kiss the girl?Can\'t you see she\'s\nwaiting?"The honest Captain stole one glance at Virginia, and turned red copper\ncolor."Shucks, Colonel, I can\'t be kissing her always."We\'ll not talk of husbands yet awhile, Lige."Virginia went up to Captain Lige, deftly twisted into shape his black\ntie, and kissed him on the check.How his face burned when she touched\nhim.said she, "and don\'t you ever dare to treat me as a young lady.Why, Pa, he\'s blushing like a girl.He\'s going to be married at last to that Creole girl in New Orleans."The Colonel slapped his knee, winked slyly at Lige, while Virginia began\nto sing:\n\n       "I built me a house on the mountain so high,\n        To gaze at my true love as she do go by.""There\'s only one I\'d ever marry, Jinny," protested the Captain,\nsoberly, "and I\'m a heap too old for her.But I\'ve seen a youngster\nthat might mate with her, Colonel," he added mischievously."If he just\nwasn\'t a Yankee.Jinny, what\'s the story I hear about Judge Whipple\'s\nyoung man buying Hester?"It was Virginia\'s turn to blush, and she grew\nred as a peony."He\'s a tall, hateful, Black Republican Yankee!""There you do him wrong, honey," the Colonel put in."I hear he took Hester to Miss Crane\'s," the Captain continued, filling\nthe room with his hearty laughter."That boy has sand enough, Jinny; I\'d\nlike to know him.""You\'ll have that priceless opportunity to-night," retorted Miss\nVirginia, as she flung herself out of the room."Pa has made me invite\nhim to my party."Whereupon the Captain hastily\nripped open the bundle under his arm and produced a very handsome India\nshawl.With a cry of delight Virginia threw it over her shoulders and\nran to the long glass between the high windows."Her father, I reckon," was the prompt reply."Captain Lige," said she, turning to him."If you had only kept the\npresents you have brought me from New Orleans, you might sell out your\nsteamboat and be a rich man.""He is a rich man," said the Colonel, promptly."Did you ever miss\nbringing her a present, Lige?""When the Cora Anderson burnt," answered the Captain."Why," cried Virginia, "you brought me a piece of her wheel, with the\nchar on it.It was when the\nFrench dress, with the furbelows, which Madame Pitou had gotten me from\nParis for you, was lost.""And I think I liked the piece of wheel better," says Virginia."It was\nbrought me by a brave man, the last to leave his boat.""And who should be the last to leave, but the captain?I saw the thing\nin the water; and I just thought we ought to have a relic.""Lige," said the Colonel, putting up his feet, "do you remember the\nFrench toys you used to bring up here from New Orleans?""Colonel," replied Brent, "do you recall the rough and uncouth young\ncitizen who came over here from Cincinnati, as clerk on the Vicksburg?""I remember, sir, that he was so promising that they made him\nprovisional captain the next trip, and he was not yet twenty-four years\nof age.""And do you remember buying the Vicksburg at the sheriff\'s sale for\ntwenty thousand dollars, and handing her over to young Brent, and\nsaying, \'There, my son, she\'s your boat, and you can pay for her when\nyou like\'?"Carvel, sternly, "your memory\'s too good.But\nI proved myself a good business man, Jinny; he paid for her in a year.""You don\'t mean that you made him pay you for the boat?""Why, Pa, I didn\'t think you were that mean!""I was a heap meaner," said her father.Virginia drew in her breath, and looked at the Colonel in amazement."He\'s the meanest man I know," said Captain Lige."He made me pay\ninterest, and a mint julep.""Upon my word, Pa," said Miss Virginia, soberly, "I shouldn\'t have\nbelieved it of you."Just then Jackson, in his white jacket; came to announce that supper was\nready, and they met Ned at the dining-room door, fairly staggering under\na load of roses."Marse Clarence done send \'em in, des picked out\'n de hothouse dis\nafternoon, Miss Jinny.She took the flowers from Ned, one by one, and to\nthe wonderment of Captain Lige and her--father strewed them hither and\nthither upon the table until the white cloth was hid by the red flowers.The Colonel stroked his goatee and nudged Captain Lige."Look-a-there, now," said he."Any other woman would have spent two\nmortal hours stickin\' \'em in china."Virginia, having critically surveyed her work, amid exclamations from\nNed and Jackson, had gone around to her place.And there upon her plate\nlay a pearl necklace.For an instant she clapped her palms together,\nstaring at it in bewilderment.And once more the little childish cry of\ndelight, long sweet to the Colonel\'s ears, escaped her."Pa," she said, "is it--?"And there she stopped, for fear that it might\nnot be."Your Uncle Daniel sent it, as he\npromised.And when you go upstairs, if Easter has done as I told her,\nyou will see a primrose dress with blue coin-flowers on your bed.Daniel\nthought you might like that, too, for a keepsake.Dorothy Manners wore\nit in London, when she was a girl."And so Virginia ran and threw her arms about her father\'s neck, and\nkissed him again and again.And lest the Captain feel badly, she laid\nhis India shawl beside her; and the necklace upon it.What a joyful supper they had,--just the three of them!And as the fresh\nroses filled the room with fragrance, Virginia filled it with youth and\nspirits, and Mr.Carvel and the Captain with honest, manly merriment.And Jackson plied Captain Brent (who was a prime favorite in that house)\nwith broiled chicken and hot beat biscuits and with waffles, until at\nlength he lay back in his chair and heaved a sigh of content, lighting a\ncigar.And then Virginia, with a little curtsey to both of them, ran off\nto dress for the party."Well," said Captain Brent, "I reckon there\'ll be gay goings-on here\nto-night.I wouldn\'t miss the sight of \'em, Colonel, for all the cargoes\non the Mississippi."No, thank you, Lige," Mr."Do you remember, one\nmorning some five years ago, when I took in at the store a Yankee named\nHopper?Captain Brent jumped, and the ashes of his cigar fell on his coat.He\nhad forgotten his conversation with Captain Grant."I reckon I do," he said dryly.For a moment he was on the point of telling the affair.He could not be sure of Eliphalet from Grant\'s description.So\nhe decided to await a better time.Captain Brent was one to make sure of\nhis channel before going ahead."Well," continued the Colonel, "I have been rather pushed the last week,\nand Hopper managed things for this dance.He got the music, and saw the\nconfectioner.But he made such a close bargain with both of \'em that\nthey came around to me afterward," he added, laughing."Lige," replied the Colonel, "you never do get over a prejudice.Yes,\nhe\'s coming, just to oversee things.He seems to have mighty little\npleasure, and he\'s got the best business head I ever did see.Carvel, meditatively, as he put on his hat, "a Yankee, when he\nwill work, works like all possessed.Hood don\'t like him any more than\nyou do, but he allows Hopper is a natural-born business man.Last month\nSamuels got tight, and Wright & Company were going to place the largest\norder in years.I I\'m\ntoo old to solicit business, Hood,\' said I.\'Then there\'s only one man\nto send,\' says he, \'young Hopper.He\'ll get the order, or I\'ll give up\nthis place I\'ve had for twenty years.\'Hopper \'callated\' to get it, and\nanother small one pitched in.And you\'d die laughing, Lige, to hear how\nhe did it.""Some slickness, I\'ll gamble," grunted Captain Lige."Well, I reckon \'twas slick," said the Colonel, thoughtfully."You know\nold man Wright hates a solicitor like poison.And\nmaybe you\'ve noticed signs stuck up all over his store, \'No Solicitors\nnor Travelling Men Allowed Here\'.""But Hopper--Hopper walks in, sir, bold as you please, right past the\nsigns till he comes to the old man\'s cage.Wright,\'\nsays he to the clerk.shouts old Wright,\nflying \'round in his chair, \'what the devil does this mean?\'And you dare to come in\nhere?bellowed the\nold man; \'I reckon you\'re a damned Yankee.I reckon I\'ll upset your\n"callations" for once.And if I catch you in here again, I\'ll wring your\nneck like a roostah\'s."Wright himself,--afterward," replied Mr.The old man lives at the Planters\' House, you know.Hopper do but go \'round there that very night and give a <DW65> two bits\nto put him at the old man\'s table.When Wright comes and sees him, he\nnearly has one of his apoplectic fits.But in marches Hopper the next\nmorning with twice the order."He\'s dangerous," said the Captain, emphatically."The Yankees are changing business in this town," was the Colonel\'s\nanswer."We\'ve got to keep the pace, Lige."THE PARTY\n\nTo gentle Miss Anne Brinsmade, to Puss Russell of the mischievous eyes,\nand even to timid Eugenie Renault, the question that burned was: Would\nhe come, or would he not?And, secondarily, how would Virginia treat him\nif he came?Put our friend Stephen for the subjective, and Miss Carvers\nparty for the objective in the above, and we have the clew.For very\nyoung girls are given to making much out of a very little in such\nmatters.If Virginia had not gotten angry when she had been teased a\nfortnight before, all would have been well.Even Puss, who walked where angels feared to tread, did not dare to go\ntoo far with Virginia.She had taken care before the day of the party to\nbeg forgiveness with considerable humility.It had been granted with a\nqueenly generosity.And after that none of the bevy had dared to broach\nthe subject to Virginia.He told Puss afterward that\nwhen Virginia got through with him, he felt as if he had taken a rapid\ntrip through the wheel-house of a large steamer.Puss tried, by\nvarious ingenious devices, to learn whether Mr.These things added a zest to a party long looked forward to amongst\nVirginia\'s intimates.In those days young ladies did not "come out" so\nfrankly as they do now.Mothers did not announce to the world that they\npossessed marriageable daughters.And then the matrimonial market was feverishly active.Young\nmen proposed as naturally as they now ask a young girl to go for a\nwalk,--and were refused quite as naturally.An offer of marriage was not\nthe fearful and wonderful thing--to be dealt with gingerly--which it has\nsince become.Seventeen was often the age at which they began.And one\nof the big Catherwood boys had a habit of laying his heart and hand at\nVirginia\'s feet once a month.Nor did his vanity suffer greatly when she\nlaughed at him.It was with a flutter of excitement, therefore, that Miss Carvel\'s\nguests flitted past Jackson, who held the door open obsequiously.The\nboldest of them took a rapid survey of the big parlor, before they put\nfoot on the stairs to see whether Mr.And if\ntheir curiosity held them too long, they were usually kissed by the\nColonel.Carvel shook hands heartily with the young mean and called them by\ntheir first names, for he knew most of their fathers and grandfathers.And if an older gentleman arrived, perhaps the two might be seen going\ndown the hall together, arm in arm.So came his beloved enemy, Judge\nWhipple, who did not make an excursion to the rear regions of the house\nwith the Colonel; but they stood and discussed Mr.President Buchanan\'s\nresponsibility for the recent panic, until the band, which Mr.Hopper\nhad stationed under the stairs, drowned their voices.As we enter the room, there stands Virginia under the rainbowed prisms\nof the great chandelier, receiving.But here was suddenly a woman of\ntwenty-eight, where only this evening we knew a slip of a girl.It was\na trick she had, to become majestic in a ball-gown.She held her head\nhigh, as a woman should, and at her slender throat glowed the pearls of\nDorothy Manners.The result of all this was to strike a little awe into the souls of many\nof her playmates.Little Eugenie nearly dropped a curtsey.Belle Cluyme\nwas so impressed that she forgot for a whole hour to be spiteful.But\nPuss Russell kissed her on both cheeks, and asked her if she really\nwasn\'t nervous.But she said\nnothing to her hostess, for fear of marring an otherwise happy occasion.She retired with Jack Brim made to a corner, where she recited:--\n\n     "Oh young Lochinvar is come out of the East;\n     Of millions of Yankees I love him the least."Clarence Colfax, resplendent in new evening clothes just\narrived from New York, was pressing his claim for the first dance with\nhis cousin in opposition to numerous other claims, the chatter of the\nguests died away.Virginia turned her head, and for an instant the\npearls trembled on her neck.There was a young man cordially and\nunconcernedly shaking hands with her father and Captain Lige.Her memory\nof that moment is, strangely, not of his face (she did not deign to\nlook at that), but of the muscle of his shoulder half revealed as he\nstretched forth his arm."Virginia," he whispered earnestly, almost fiercely, "Virginia, who\ninvited him here?""I did," said Virginia, calmly, "of course.cried Clarence, "do you know who he is?""Yes," she answered, "I know.And is that any reason why he should not\ncome here as a guest?Would you bar any gentleman from your house on\naccount of his convictions?"Ah, Virginia, who had thought to hear that argument from your lips?What\nwould frank Captain Lige say of the consistency of women, if he heard\nyou now?And how give an account of yourself to Anne Brinsmade?What\ncontrariness has set you so intense against your own argument?Clarence can recover from his\nastonishment and remind her of her vehement words on the subject at\nBellegarde, Mr.Stephen is making thither with the air of one who\nconquers.Has he no shame that he should hold his head so high?She feels her color mounting, even as her resentment rises at his\nself-possession, and yet she would have despised him had he shown\nself-consciousness in gait or manner in the sight of her assembled\nguests.Nearly as tall as the Colonel himself, he is plainly seen, and\nMiss Puss in her corner does not have to stand on tiptoe.Carvel\ndoes the honors of the introduction.But a daughter of the Carvels was not to fail before such a paltry\nsituation as this.Shall it be confessed that curiosity stepped into the\nbreach?As she gave him her hand she was wondering how he would act.As a matter of fact he acted detestably.He said nothing whatever, but\nstood regarding her with a clear eye and a face by far too severe.The thought that he was meditating on the incident of the auction sale\ncrossed through her mind, and made her blood simmer.An evil spirit took\npossession of Virginia.Brice, do you know my cousin, Mr.To this new phase his sense of humor\ndid not rise.Brice was a Yankee and no gentleman, inasmuch as he\nhad overbid a lady for Hester."Have you come here to live, Mr."Yes," he said, "if I can presently make enough to keep me alive."Then\nturning to Virginia, he said, "Will you dance, Miss Carvel?"The effrontery of this demand quite drew the breath from the impatient\nyoung gentlemen who had been waiting their turn.Several of them spoke\nup in remonstrance.And for the moment (let one confess it who knows),\nVirginia was almost tempted to lay her arm in his.Then she made a bow\nthat would have been quite as effective the length of the room.Brice," she said, "but I am engaged to Mr.Abstractedly he watched her glide away in her cousin\'s arms.Stephen had\na way of being preoccupied at such times.When he grew older he\nwould walk the length of Olive Street, look into face after face\nof acquaintances, not a quiver of recognition in his eyes.But most\nprobably the next week he would win a brilliant case in the Supreme\nCourt.And so now, indifferent to the amusement of some about him, he\nstood staring after Virginia and Clarence.Where had he seen Colfax\'s\nface before he came West?Many, many years before he\nhad stood with his father in the mellow light of the long gallery at\nHollingdean, Kent, before a portrait of the Stuarts\' time.The face was\nthat of one of Lord Northwell\'s ancestors, a sporting nobleman of the\ntime of the second Charles.It was a head which compelled one to pause\nbefore it.Strangely enough,--it was the head likewise of Clarence\nColfax.The image of it Stephen had carried undimmed in the eye of his memory.White-haired Northwell\'s story, also.Brice\nhad expected his small son to grasp.As a matter of fact Stephen had not\ngrasped it then--but years afterward.It was not a pleasant story,--and\nyet there was much of credit in it to the young rake its subject,--of\ndash and courage and princely generosity beside the profligacy and\nincontinence.The face had impressed him, with its story.He had often dreamed of it,\nand of the lace collar over the dull-gold velvet that became it so well.And here it was at last, in a city west of the Mississippi River.Here\nwere the same delicately chiselled features, with their pallor, and\nsatiety engraved there at one and twenty.Here was the same lazy scorn\nin the eyes, and the look which sleeplessness gives to the lids: the\nhair, straight and fine and black; the wilful indulgence--not of one\nlife, but of generations--about the mouth; the pointed chin.And yet it\nwas a fact to dare anything, and to do anything.One thing more ere we have done with that which no man may explain.Had\nhe dreamed, too, of the girl?Stephen might not tell, but\nthrice had the Colonel spoken to him before he answered."You must meet some of these young ladies, sir."It was little wonder that Puss Russell thought him dull on that first\noccasion.Out of whom condescension is to flow is a matter of which\nHeaven takes no cognizance.To use her own words, Puss thought him\n"stuck up," when he should have been grateful.We know that Stephen\nwas not stuck up, and later Miss Russell learned that likewise.Very\nnaturally she took preoccupation for indifference.It is a matter worth\nrecording, however, that she did not tease him, because she did not\ndare.He did not ask her to dance, which was rude.Carvel, who introduced him to Miss Renault and Miss Saint\nCyr, and other young ladies of the best French families.And finally,\ndrifting hither and thither with his eyes on Virginia, in an evil moment\nhe was presented to Mrs.Colfax was a very great lady indeed, albeit the daughter of an overseer.She bore Addison Colfax\'s name, spent his fortune, and retained her good\nlooks.On this particular occasion she was enjoying herself quite as\nmuch as any young girl in the room, and, while resting from a waltz, was\nregaling a number of gentlemen with a humorous account of a scandal at\nthe Virginia Spring\'s.None but a great lady could have meted out the punishment administered\nto poor Stephen.None but a great lady could have concerned it.And he,\nwho had never been snubbed before, fell headlong into her trap.How\nwas the boy to know that there was no heart in the smile with which she\ngreeted him?She continued to talk about\nVirginia Springs, "Oh, Mr.Brice, of course you have been there.Charles, you look\nas if you were just dying to waltz.Let\'s have a turn before the music\nstops."And so she whirled away, leaving Stephen forlorn, a little too angry to\nbe amused just then.In that state he spied a gentleman coming towards\nhim--a gentleman the sight of whom he soon came to associate with all\nthat is good and kindly in this world, Mr.And now he put his\nhand on Stephen\'s shoulder.Whether he had seen the incident just past,\nwho can tell?"My son," said he, "I am delighted to see you here.Now that we are such\nnear neighbors, we must be nearer friends.You must know my wife, and my\nson Jack, and my daughter Anne."Brinsmade was a pleasant little body, but plainly not a fit mate\nfor her husband.Jack gave Stephen a warm grasp of the hand, and\nan amused look.As for Anne, she was more like her father; she was\nStephen\'s friend from that hour."I have seen you quite often, going in at your gate, Mr.And\nI have seen your mother, too."She has such a\nwonderful face."And the girl raised her truthful blue eyes to his."My mother would be delighted to know you," he ventured, not knowing\nwhat else to say.It was an effort for him to reflect upon their new\nsituation as poor tenants to a wealthy family."I shall call on her to-morrow, with\nmother.Brice," she continued, "do you know that your\nmother is just the person I should go to if I were in trouble, whether I\nknew her or not?""I have found her a good person in trouble," said Stephen, simply.He\nmight have said the same of Anne.She had thought him cold, but these words belied\nthat.She had wrapped him in that diaphanous substance with which young\nladies (and sometimes older ones) are wont to deck their heroes.She had\napproached a mystery--to find it human, as are many mysteries.But thank\nheaven that she found a dignity, a seriousness,--and these more than\nsatisfied her.Likewise, she discovered something she had not looked\nfor, an occasional way of saying things that made her laugh.She danced\nwith him, and passed him back to Miss Puss Russell, who was better\npleased this time; she passed him on to her sister, who also danced with\nhim, and sent him upstairs for her handkerchief.As the evening wore on, he was more\nand more aware of an uncompromising attitude in his young hostess, whom\nhe had seen whispering to various young ladies from behind her fan as\nthey passed her.He had not felt equal to asking her to dance a second\ntime.Honest Captain Lige Breast, who seemed to have taken a fancy to\nhim, bandied him on his lack of courage with humor that was a little\nrough.And, to Stephen\'s amazement, even Judge Whipple had pricked him\non.It was on his way upstairs after Emily Russell\'s handkerchief that\nhe ran across another acquaintance.Eliphalet Hopper, in Sunday\nbroadcloth, was seated on the landing, his head lowered to the level of\nthe top of the high door of the parlor.Stephen caught a glimpse of the\npicture whereon his eyes were fixed.Perhaps it is needless to add that\nMiss Virginia Carvel formed the central figure of it.Hopper, and added darkly: "I ain\'t in no hurry.Just\nnow they callate I\'m about good enough to manage the business end of\nan affair like this here.But some day," said he,\nsuddenly barring Stephen\'s way, "some day I\'ll give a party.And hark to\nme when I tell you that these here aristocrats \'ll be glad enough to get\ninvitations."The\nincident was all that was needed to dishearten and disgust him.Kindly\nas he had been treated by others, far back in his soul was a thing that\nrankled.Shall it be told crudely why he went that night?Stephen\nBrice, who would not lie to others, lied to himself.And when he came\ndownstairs again and presented Miss Emily with her handkerchief,\nhis next move was in his mind.And that was to say good-night to the\nColonel, and more frigidly to Miss Carvel herself.But music has upset\nmany a man\'s calculations.The strains of the Jenny Lind waltz were beginning to float through the\nrooms.There was Miss Virginia in a corner of the big parlor, for the\nmoment alone with her cousin.Not a\nsign did she give of being aware of his presence until he stood before\nher.But she said: "So you have\ncome at last to try again, Mr.Brice said: "If you will do me the honor, Miss Carvel."Clarence Colfax got to his feet.Then she\nlooked up at the two men as they stood side by side, and perhaps swept\nthem both in an instant\'s comparison.The New Englander\'s face must have reminded her more of her own father,\nColonel Carvel.It possessed, from generations known, the power to\ncontrol itself.She afterwards admitted that she accepted him to tease\nClarence.Miss Russell, whose intuitions are usually correct, does not\nbelieve this."I will dance with you," said Virginia.But, once in his arms, she seemed like a wild thing, resisting.Although\nher gown brushed his coat, the space between them was infinite, and her\nhand lay limp in his, unresponsive of his own pressure.Not so her feet;\nthey caught the step and moved with the rhythm of the music, and round\nthe room they swung.More than one pair paused in the dance to watch\nthem.Then, as they glided past the door, Stephen was disagreeably\nconscious of some one gazing down from above, and he recalled Eliphalet\nHopper and his position.The sneer from Eliphalet\'s seemed to penetrate\nlike a chilly draught.All at once, Virginia felt her partner gathering up his strength, and\nby some compelling force, more of wild than of muscle, draw her nearer.Unwillingly her hand tightened under his, and her blood beat faster\nand her color came and went as they two moved as one.Anger--helpless\nanger--took possession of her as she saw the smiles on the faces of her\nfriends, and Puss Russell mockingly throwing a kiss as she passed her.And then, strange in the telling, a thrill as of power rose within her\nwhich she strove against in vain.A knowledge of him who guided her so\nswiftly, so unerringly, which she had felt with no other man.Faster and\nfaster they stepped, each forgetful of self and place, until the waltz\ncame suddenly to a stop.said Captain Lige to Judge Whipple, "you can whollop me on my\nown forecastle if they ain\'t the handsomest couple I ever did see."CHAPTER I. RAW MATERIAL\n\nSummer, intolerable summer, was upon the city at last.The families of\nits richest citizens had fled.Even at that early day some braved the\nlong railroad journey to the Atlantic coast.Amongst these were our\nfriends the Cluymes, who come not strongly into this history.But many, like the Brinsmades and the Russells,\nthe Tiptons and the Hollingsworths, retired to the local paradise of\ntheir country places on the Bellefontaine road, on the cool heights\nabove the river.Thither, as a respite from the hot office, Stephen was\noften invited by kind Mr.Brinsmade, who sometimes drove him out in his\nown buggy.But Miss Virginia\nCarvel he had never seen since the night he had danced with her.This was because, after her return from the young ladies\' school at\nMonticello, she had gone to Glencoe, Glencoe, magic spot, perched high\non wooded highlands.And under these the Meramec, crystal pure, ran\nlightly on sand and pebble to her bridal with that turbid tyrant, the\nFather of Waters.To reach Glencoe you spent two dirty hours on that railroad which\n(it was fondly hoped) would one day stretch to the Pacific Ocean.You\ngenerally spied one of the big Catherwood boys in the train, or their\ntall sister Maude.The Catherwoods likewise lived at Glencoe in the\nsummer.And on some Saturday afternoons a grim figure in a linen duster\nand a silk skull-cap took a seat in the forward car.That was Judge\nWhipple, on his way to spend a quiet Sunday with Colonel Carvel.To the surprise of many good people, the Judge had recently formed\nanother habit.At least once a week he would drop in at the little house\non Olive Street next to Mr.Brinsmade\'s big one, which was shut up, and\ntake tea with Mrs.Afterward he would sit on the little porch\nover the garden in the rear, or on the front steps, and watch the\nbob-tailed horse-cars go by.His conversation was chiefly addressed to\nthe widow.Rarely to Stephen; whose wholesome respect for his employer\nhad in no wise abated.Through the stifling heat of these summer days Stephen sat in the outer\noffice, straining at the law.Had it not been for the fact that Mr.Whipple went to his mother\'s house, despair would have seized him long\nsince.Apparently his goings-out and his comings-in were noted only by\nMr.Truly the Judge\'s methods were not Harvard methods.And if\nthere were pride in the young Bostonian, Mr.Whipple thought he knew the\ncure for it.It was to Richter Stephen owed a debt of gratitude in these days.He\nwould often take his midday meal in the down-town beer garden with the\nquiet German.Then there came a Sunday afternoon (to be marked with a\nred letter) when Richter transported him into Germany itself.The Rhine was\nMarket Street, and south of that street was a country of which polite\nAmerican society took no cognizance.Here was an epic movement indeed, for South St.Louis was a great sod\nuprooted from the Fatherland and set down in all its vigorous crudity in\nthe warm black mud of the Mississippi Valley.Here lager beer took the\nplace of Bourbon, and black bread and sausages of hot rolls and fried\nchicken.Here were quaint market houses squatting in the middle of wide\nstreets; Lutheran churches, square and uncompromising, and bulky Turner\nHalls, where German children were taught the German tongue.Here, in a\nshady grove of mulberry and locust, two hundred families were spread out\nat their ease.For a while Richter sat in silence, puffing at a meerschaum with a huge\nbrown bowl.A trick of the mind opened for Stephen one of the histories\nin his father\'s library in Beacon Street, across the pages of which had\nflitted the ancestors of this blue-eyed and great-chested Saxon.He saw\nthem in cathedral forests, with the red hair long upon their bodies.He saw terrifying battles with the Roman Empire surging back and forth\nthrough the low countries.He saw a lad of twenty at the head of rugged\nlegions clad in wild skins, sweeping Rome out of Gaul.Back in the dim\nages Richter\'s fathers must have defended grim Eresburg.And it seemed\nto him that in the end the new Republic must profit by this rugged\nstock, which had good women for wives and mothers, and for fathers men\nin whose blood dwelt a fierce patriotism and contempt for cowardice.He thought of the forefathers of\nthose whom he knew, who dwelt north of Market Street.Many, though this\ngeneration of the French might know it not, had bled at Calais and at\nAgincourt, had followed the court of France in clumsy coaches to Blois\nand Amboise, or lived in hovels under the castle walls.Others had\ncharged after the Black Prince at Poitiers, and fought as serf or noble.in the war of the Roses; had been hatters or tailors in Cromwell\'s\narmies, or else had sacrificed lands and fortunes for Charles Stuart.These English had toiled, slow but resistless, over the misty Blue\nRidge after Boone and Harrod to this old St.Louis of the French, their\nenemies, whose fur traders and missionaries had long followed the veins\nof the vast western wilderness.And now, on to the structure builded by\nthese two, comes Germany to be welded, to strengthen or to weaken.Richter put down his pipe on the table."Stephen," he said suddenly, "you do not share the prejudice against us\nhere?"He thought of some vigorous words that Miss Puss\nRussell had used on the subject of the Dutch."I am glad," answered Richter, with a note of sadness, in his voice."Do not despise us before you know more of us.We are still feudal in\nGermany--of the Middle Ages.He is compelled to\nserve the lord of the land every year with so much labor of his hands.The small farmers, the \'Gross\' and \'Mittel Bauern\', we call them, are\nalso mortgaged to the nobles who tyrannize our Vaterland.Our merchants\nare little merchants--shopkeepers, you would say.My poor father, an\neducated man, was such."And now," said Stephen, "why do they not keep their hold?""We were unused to ruling," he answered."We knew not how to act--what\nto do.You must remember that we were not trained to govern ourselves,\nas are you of the English race, from children.Those who have been for\ncenturies ground under heel do not make practical parliamentarians.No;\nyour heritage is liberty--you Americans and English; and we Germans must\ndesert our native land to partake of it."The eyes of the German filled at the recollection, nor did he seem\nashamed of his tears."I had a poor old father whose life was broken to save the Vaterland,\nbut not his spirit," he cried, "no, not that.God directed my grandfather to send him to the Kolnisches\ngymnasium, where the great Jahn taught.Jahn was our Washington, the\nfather of Germany that is to be.Our women wore Parisian clothes, and\nspoke the language; French immorality and atheism had spread like a\nplague among us Napoleon the vile had taken the sword of our Frederick\nfrom Berlin.It was Father Jahn (so we love to call him), it was Father\nJahn who founded the \'Turnschulen\', that the generations to come might\nreturn to simple German ways,--plain fare, high principles, our native\ntongue; and the development of the body.The downfall of the fiend\nNapoleon and the Vaterland united--these two his scholars must have\nwritten in their hearts.All summer long, in their black caps and linen\npantaloons, they would trudge after him, begging a crust here and a\ncheese there, to spread his teachings far and wide under the thatched\nroofs.I have heard my father tell how in the heat of that\nyear a great red comet burned in the sky, even as that we now see, my\nfriend.But in the coming spring\nthe French conscripts filled our sacred land like a swarm of locusts,\ndevouring as they went.And at their head, with the pomp of Darius, rode\nthat destroyer of nations and homes, Napoleon.But the red embers were beneath, fanned by Father Jahn.Napoleon\nat Dresden made our princes weep.Never, even in the days of the\nFrankish kings, had we been so humbled.He dragged our young men with\nhim to Russia, and left them to die moaning on the frozen wastes, while\nhe drove off in his sledge."It was the next year that Germany rose.High and low, rich and poor,\nJaeger and Landwehr, came flocking into the army, and even the old men,\nthe Landsturm.Russia was an ally, and later, Austria.My father, a last\nof sixteen, was in the Landwehr, under the noble Blucher in Silesia,\nwhen they drove the French into the Katzbach and the Neisse, swollen by\nthe rains into torrents.It had rained until the forests were marshes.But Blucher, ah, there was a man!He whipped his\ngreat sabre from under his cloak, crying \'Vorwarts!And the\nLandwehr with one great shout slew their enemies with the butts of their\nmuskets until their arms were weary and the bodies were tossed like logs\nin the foaming waters.They called Blucher Marachall Vorwarts!But the victors quarrelled amongst\nthemselves, while Talleyrand and Metternich tore our Vaterland into\nstrips, and set brother against brother.And our blood, and the grief\nfor the widows and the fatherless, went for nothing.""After a while," he continued presently, "came the German Confederation,\nwith Austria at the head.Rid of Napoleon, we had another despot in\nMetternich.But the tree which Jahn had planted grew, and its branches\nspread.My father had gone to\nJena University, when he joined the Burschenschaft, or Students\' League,\nof which I will tell you later.It was pledged to the rescue of the\nVaterland.He was sent to prison for dipping his handkerchief in the\nblood of Sand, beheaded for liberty at Mannheim.Afterwards he was\nliberated, and went to Berlin and married my mother, who died when I\nwas young.Twice again he was in prison because the societies met at his\nhouse.You in America know not the meaning\nof that word.His health broke, and when \'48 came, he was an old man.His hair was white, and he walked the streets with a crutch.But he had\nsaved a little money to send me to Jena.I was big-boned and fair, like my mother.And when\nI came home at the end of a Semester I can see him now, as he\nwould hobble to the door, wearing the red and black and gold of the\nBurschenschaft.And he would keep me up half the night-telling him of\nour \'Schlager\' fights with the aristocrats.My father had been a noted\nswordsman in his day."For Stephen was staring at the jagged\nscar, He had never summoned the courage to ask Richter how he came by\nit."Broadswords," answered the German, hastily."Some day I will tell you\nof them, and of the struggle with the troops in the \'Breite Strasse\' in\nMarch.We lost, as I told you because we knew not how to hold what we\nhad gained."I left Germany, hoping to make a home here for my poor father.How sad\nhis face as he kissed me farewell!And he said to me: \'Carl, if ever\nyour new Vaterland, the good Republic, be in danger, sacrifice all.I have spent my years in bondage, and I say to you that life without\nliberty is not worth the living.\'Three months I was gone, and he was\ndead, without that for which he had striven so bravely.He never knew\nwhat it is to have an abundance of meat.He never knew from one day to\nthe other when he would have to embrace me, all he owned, and march away\nto prison, because he was a patriot."Richter\'s voice had fallen low,\nbut now he raised it."Do you think, my friend," he cried, "do you think\nthat I would not die willingly for this new country if the time should\ncome.Yes, and there are a million like me, once German, now American,\nwho will give their lives to preserve this Union.For without it the\nworld is not fit to live in."Stephen had food for thought as he walked northward through the strange\nstreets on that summer evening.Here indeed was a force not to be\nreckoned, and which few had taken into account.ABRAHAM LINCOLN\n\nIt is sometimes instructive to look back and see hour Destiny gave us a\nkick here, and Fate a shove there, that sent us in the right direction\nat the proper time.And when Stephen Brice looks backward now, he laughs\nto think that he did not suspect the Judge of being an ally of the\ntwo who are mentioned above.Whipple\'s words and\nadvices to him that summer had been these.Stephen was dressed more\ncarefully than usual, in view of a visit to Bellefontaine Road.Whereupon the Judge demanded whether he were contemplating marriage.Without waiting for a reply he pointed to a rope and a slab of limestone\non the pavement below, and waved his hand unmistakably toward the\nMississippi.Whipple had once been crossed\nin love.But we are to speak more particularly of a put-up job, although Stephen\ndid not know this at the time.Towards five o\'clock of a certain afternoon in August of that year,\n1858, Mr.Instead of turning to the right,\nhe strode straight to Stephen\'s table.His communications were always a\ntrifle startling.Brice," said he, "you are to take the six forty-five train on the\nSt.Louis, Alton, and Chicago road tomorrow morning for Springfield,\nIllinois.""Arriving at Springfield, you are to deliver this envelope into the\nhands of Mr.Abraham Lincoln, of the law firm of Lincoln & Herndon."cried Stephen, rising and straddling his chair."But,\nsir--"\n\n"Abraham Lincoln," interrupted the Judge, forcibly "I try to speak\nplainly, sir.If he\nis not in Springfield, find out where he is and follow him up.And he knew better than to argue the matter with Mr.He had read in the Missouri Democrat of this man Lincoln,\na country lawyer who had once been to Congress, and who was even now\ndisputing the senatorship of his state with the renowned Douglas.In\nspite of their complacent amusement, he had won a little admiration\nfrom conservative citizens who did not believe in the efficacy of Judge\nDouglas\'s Squatter Sovereignty.Lincoln, who had once\nbeen a rail-sputter, was uproariously derided by Northern Democrats\nbecause he had challenged Mr.Douglas to seven debates, to be held at\ndifferent towns in the state of Illinois.David with his sling and\nhis smooth round pebble must have had much of the same sympathy and\nridicule.Douglas, Senator and Judge, was a national character, mighty in\npolitics, invulnerable in the armor of his oratory.And he was known\nfar and wide as the Little Giant.Those whom he did not conquer with his\nlogic were impressed by his person.Stephen remembered with a thrill that these debates were going on now.One, indeed, had been held, and had appeared in fine print in a corner\nof the Democrat.Perhaps this Lincoln might not be in; Springfield;\nperhaps he, Stephen Brice, might, by chance, hit upon a debate, and see\nand hear the tower of the Democracy, the Honorable Stephen A. Douglas.But it is greatly to be feared that our friend Stephen was bored\nwith his errand before he arrived at the little wooden station of the\nIllinois capital.Standing on the platform after the train pulled out,\nhe summoned up courage to ask a citizen with no mustache and a beard,\nwhich he swept away when he spat, where was the office of Lincoln &\nHerndon.Brice pityingly,\nand finally led him in silence past the picket fence and the New\nEngland-looking meeting-house opposite until they came to the great\nsquare on which the State House squatted.The State House was a building\nwith much pretension to beauty, built in the classical style, of a\nyellow stone, with sold white blinds in the high windows and mighty\ncolumns capped at the gently slanting roof.But on top of it was reared\na crude wooden dome, like a clay head on a marble statue."That there," said the stranger, "is whar we watches for the County\nDelegations when they come in to a meetin\'."And with this remark,\npointing with a stubby thumb up a well-worn stair, he departed before\nStephen could thank him.Stephen paused under the awning, of which there\nwere many shading the brick pavement, to regard the straggling line of\nstores and houses which surrounded and did homage to the yellow pile.Lincoln\'s office was had decorations above\nthe windows.Mounting the stair, Stephen found a room bare enough, save\nfor a few chairs and law books, and not a soul in attendance.After\nsitting awhile by the window, mopping his brow with a handkerchief, he\nwent out on the landing to make inquiries.There he met another citizen\nin shirt sleeves, like unto the first, in the very act of sweeping his\nbeard out of the way of a dexterous expectoration."Wal, young man," said he, "who be you lookin\' for here?"At this the gentleman sat down on the dirty top step; and gave vent to\nquiet but annoying laughter."I reckon you come to the wrong place.""I was told this was his office," said Stephen, with some heat."I don\'t see what that has to do with it," answered our friend."Wal," said the citizen, critically, "if you was from Philadelphy or\nBoston, you might stand acquitted."Stephen was on the point of claiming Boston, but wisely hesitated."Ye talk like y e was from down East," said the citizens who seemed in\nthe humor for conversation."I reckon old Abe\'s\' too busy to see you.Say, young man, did you ever hear of Stephen Arnold Douglas, alias the\nLittle Giant, alias the Idol of our State, sir?"This was too much for Stephen, who left the citizen without the\ncompliment of a farewell.Continuing around the square, inquiring for\nMr.Lincoln\'s house, he presently got beyond the stores and burning\npavements on to a plank walk, under great shade trees, and past old\nbrick mansions set well back from the street.At length he paused in\nfront of a wooden house of a dirty grayish brown, too high for its\nlength and breadth, with tall shutters of the same color, and a picket\nfence on top of the retaining wall which lifted the yard above the plank\nwalk.But an ugly house may look beautiful\nwhen surrounded by such heavy trees as this was.Their shade was\nthe most inviting thing Stephen had seen.A boy of sixteen or so was\nswinging on the gate, plainly a very mischievous boy, with a round,\nlaughing, sunburned face and bright eyes.In front of the gate was a\nshabby carriage with top and side curtains, hitched to a big bay horse."Well, I guess," said the boy."I\'m his son, and he lives right here\nwhen he\'s at home.asked Stephen, beginning to realize the purport of his\nconversations with citizens.Lincoln mentioned the name of a small town in the northern\npart of the state, where he said his father would stop that night.He\ntold Stephen that he looked wilted, invited him into the house to have\na glass of lemonade, and to join him and another boy in a fishing\nexcursion with the big bay horse.Lincoln that he\nshould have to take the first train after his father.exclaimed the other, enviously, "then you\'ll hear the Freeport\ndebate."Now it has been said that the day was scorching hot.And when Stephen\nhad got back to the wooden station, and had waited an hour for the\nBloomington express, his anxiety to hear the Freeport debate was not\nas keen as it might have been.Late in the afternoon he changed at\nBloomington to the Illinois Central Railroad: The sun fell down behind\nthe cardboard edge of the prairie, the train rattled on into the north,\nwrapped in its dust and Smoke, and presently became a long comet,\nroaring red, to match that other comet which flashed in the sky.By this time it may be said that our friend was heartily sick of his\nmission, He tried to doze; but two men, a farmer and a clerk, got in\nat a way station, and sat behind him.They began to talk about this man\nLincoln."Shucks," said the clerk, "think of him opposing the Little Giant.""He\'s right smart, Sam," said the farmer."He\'s got a way of sayin\'\nthings that\'s clear.But Steve Douglas, he only\nmixes you up.""Because you ain\'t had no education: What\ndoes a rail-sputter like Abe know about this government?Let the territories take care of\nthemselves.The fust of this week I\nseen him side-tracked down the road here in a caboose, while Doug went\nby in a special.""Abe is a plain man, Sam," the farmer answered solemnly.It was ten o\'clock when Stephen descended at his destination.Merciful\nnight hid from his view the forlorn station and the ragged town.The\nbaggage man told him that Mr.Will words describe the impression it made on a certain\nyoung man from Boston!It was long and low and ramshackly and hot that\nnight as the inside of a brick-kiln.As he drew near it on the single\nplant walk over the black prairie-mud, he saw countrymen and politicians\nswarming its narrow porch and narrower hall.Discussions in all keys\nwere in progress, and it, was with vast difficulty that our distracted\nyoung man pushed through and found the landlord, This personage was the\ncoolest of the lot.Confusion was but food for his smiles, importunity\nbut increased his suavity.And of the seeming hundreds that pressed him,\nhe knew and utilized the Christian name of all.From behind a corner of\nthe bar he held them all at bay, and sent them to quarters like the old\ncampaigner he was."Now, Ben, tain\'t no use gettin\' mad.You, and Josh way, an\' Will, an\'\nSam, an\' the Cap\'n, an\' the four Beaver brothers, will all sleep in\nnumber ten.No, sirree, the Honerable Abe, and\nMister Hill, and Jedge Oglesby is sleepin\' in seven."The smell of\nperspiration was stifling as Stephen pushed up to the master of the\nsituation.Gosh, I reckon if you can fight your way to the dinin\' room, the gals\'ll\ngive you some pork and a cup of coffee."After a preliminary scuffle with a drunken countryman in mud-caked\nboots, Mr.Brice presently reached the long table in the dining-room.A sense of humor not quite extinct made him smile as he devoured pork\nchops and greasy potatoes and heavy apple pie.As he was finishing the\npie, he became aware of the tavern keeper standing over him."Are you one of them flip Chicagy reporters?"asked that worthy, with a\nsuspicious eye on Stephen\'s clothes."You didn\'t talk jest like \'em.Guess you\'ll be here, tonight--"\n\n"Yes," said Stephen, wearily.And he added, outs of force of habit, "Can\nyou give me a room?""Number ten, There ain\'t nobody in\nthere but Ben Billings, and the four Beaver brothers, an\' three more.I\'ll have a shake-down for ye next the north window."Stephen\'s thanks for the hospitality perhaps lacked heartiness.But\nperceiving his host still contemplating him, he was emboldened to say:\n\n"Has Mr.Stephen\'s reflections here on the dignity of the Senatorial candidate of\nthe Republican Party in Illinois were novel, at any rate.He thought of\ncertain senators he had seen in Massachusetts."The only reason he ain\'t down here swappin\' yarns with the boys, is\nbecause he\'s havin\' some sort of confab with the Jedge and Joe Medill of\nthe \'Chicagy Press\' and \'Tribune\'."He was\nemboldened by the apparent lack of ceremony of the candidate.The\nlandlord looked at him in some surprise.Jest go up an\' knock at the door number seven, and say\nTom Wright sent ye.""Pick out the ugliest man in the room.There ain\'t nobody I kin think of\nuglier than Abe."Bearing in mind this succinct description of the candidate, Stephen\nclimbed the rickety stairs to the low second story.All the bedroom\ndoors were flung open except one, on which the number 7 was inscribed.From within came bursts of uproarious laughter, and a summons to enter.He pushed open the door, and as soon as his eyes became, accustomed to\nthe tobacco smoke, he surveyed the room.There was a bowl on the\nfloor, the chair where it belonged being occupied.There was a very\ninhospitable looking bed, two shake-downs, and four Windsor chairs in\nmore or less state of dilapidation--all occupied likewise.A country\nglass lamp was balanced on a rough shelf, and under it a young man sat\nabsorbed in making notes, and apparently oblivious to the noise around\nhim.Every gentleman in the room was collarless, coatless, tieless,\nand vestless.Some were engaged in fighting gnats and June bugs, while\nothers battled with mosquitoes--all save the young man who wrote, he\nbeing wholly indifferent.Stephen picked out the homeliest man in the room.And, instead of a discussion of the campaign with the other\ngentlemen, Mr.Lincoln was\ndefending an occasional and judicious use of swear words."Judge," said he, "you do an almighty lot of cussing in your speeches,\nand perhaps it ain\'t a bad way to keep things stirred up.""Well," said the Judge, "a fellow will rip out something once in a while\nbefore he has time to shut it off."Lincoln passed his fingers through his tousled hair.His thick\nlower lip crept over in front of the upper one, A gleam stirred in the\ndeep-set gray eyes."Boys," he asked, "did I ever tell you about Sam\'l, the old Quaker\'s\napprentice?"There was a chorus of "No\'s" and "Go ahead, Abe?"The young man who was\nwriting dropped his pencil.As for Stephen, this long, uncouth man\nof the plains was beginning to puzzle him.The face, with its crude\nfeatures and deep furrows, relaxed into intense soberness.Lincoln began his story with a slow earnestness that was truly\nstartling, considering the subject."This apprentice, Judge, was just such an incurable as you."John moved to the office."And Sam\'l, when he wanted to, could get out as many cusses in a second\nas his anvil shot sparks.And the old man used to wrastle with him\nnights and speak about punishment, and pray for him in meeting.When anything went wrong, Sam\'l had an appropriate\nword for the occasion.One day the old man got an inspiration when he\nwas scratching around in the dirt for an odd-sized iron."\'Sam\'l,\' says he, \'I want thee.\'"Sam\'l went, and found the old man standing over a big rat hole, where\nthe rats came out to feed on the scraps."\'Sam\'l,\' says he, \'fetch the tongs.\'"Sam\'l fetched the tongs."\'Now, Sam\'l,\' says the old man, \'thou wilt sit here until thou hast\na rat.And when thou hast him, if I hear thee\nswear, thou wilt sit here until thou hast another.Lincoln seized two cotton umbrellas, rasped his chair over the\nbare boor into a corner of the room, and sat hunched over an imaginary\nrat hole, for all the world like a gawky Quaker apprentice.And this was\na candidate for the Senate of the United States, who on the morrow was\nto meet in debate the renowned and polished Douglas!Lincoln continued, "that was on a Monday, I reckon, and the\nboys a-shouting to have their horses shod.Maybe you think they didn\'t\nhave some fun with Sam\'l.But Sam\'l sat there, and sat there, and sat\nthere, and after a while the old man pulled out his dinner-pail.First thing you know, snip went the tongs.""What do you reckon Sam\'l said, Judge?"The Judge, at random, summoned up a good one, to the delight of the\naudience.Lincoln, with solemnity, "I reckon that\'s what you\'d\nhave said.Sam\'l never said a word, and the old man kept on eating his\ndinner.One o\'clock came, and the folks began to drop in again, but\nSam\'l, he sat there.\'Long towards night the boys collected \'round the\ndoor.Lincoln bent forward a little, and his voice fell to a loud,\ndrawling whisper."First thing you know, here come the whiskers peeping\nup, then the pink eyes a--blinking at the forge, then--!""Suddenly he brought the umbrellas together with whack."\'By God,\' yells Sam\'l, \'I have thee at last!\'"Lincoln stood up, his long body swaying to and fro\nas he lifted high the improvised tongs.They heard a terrified squeal,\nand there was the rat squirming and wriggling,--it seemed before\ntheir very eyes.And Stephen forgot the country tavern, the country\npolitician, and was transported straightway into the Quaker\'s smithy.IN WHICH STEPHEN LEARNS SOMETHING\n\nIt was Mr.The astonishing candidate for\nthe Senate had sunk into his chair, his face relaxed into sadness save\nfor the sparkle lurking in the eyes.So he sat, immobile, until the\nlaughter had died down to silence."Sonny," he said, "did you want to see me?"Stephen was determined to be affable and kind, and (shall we say it?)Lincoln uncomfortable either by a superiority of\nEnglish or the certain frigidity of manner which people in the West said\nhe had.But he tried to imagine a Massachusetts senator, Mr.Sumner,\nfor instance, going through the rat story, and couldn\'t.Somehow,\nMassachusetts senators hadn\'t this gift.And yet he was not quite sure\nthat it wasn\'t a fetching gift.Stephen did not quite like to be\ncalled "Sonny."But he looked into two gray eyes, and at the face, and\nsomething curious happened to him.How was he to know that thousands of\nhis countrymen were to experience the same sensation?Lincoln again, "did you want to see me?"He\ndrew from his inner pocket the envelope which the Judge had given him.He put\nthe document in his tall hat, which was upside down on the floor.As he\ngot deeper into the letter, he pursed his mouth, and the lines of his\nface deepened in a smile."Judge Whipple told you to run till you found me, did he, Mr."Is the Judge the same old criss-cross, contrary, violent fool that he\nalways was?"Providence put an answer in Stephen\'s mouth."He\'s been very good to me, Mr."Why, he\'s the biggest-hearted man I know.You know him, Oglesby,--Silas\nWhipple.But a man has to be a Daniel or a General Putnam to venture\ninto that den of his.There\'s only one man in the world who can beard\nSilas, and he\'s the finest states-right Southern gentleman you ever saw.You\'ve heard of him, Oglesby.Don\'t they quarrel\nonce in a while, Mr."They do have occasional arguments," said Stephen, amused.Lincoln; "well, I couldn\'t come as near to\nfighting every day and stand it.If my dog and Bill\'s dog across the\nstreet walked around each other and growled for half a day, and then\nlay down together, as Carvel and Whipple do, by Jing, I\'d put pepper on\ntheir noses--"\n\n"I reckon Colonel Carvel isn\'t a fighting man," said some one, at\nrandom.Strangely enough, Stephen was seized with a desire to vindicate the\nColonel\'s courage.Lincoln and Judge Oglesby forestalled him."Why, the other day--"\n\n"Now, Oglesby," put in Mr.Lincoln, "I wanted to tell that story."Stephen had heard it, and so have we.Lincoln\'s imitation of the\nColonel\'s drawl brought him a pang like homesickness."\'No, suh, I didn\'t intend to shoot.But he wriggled and twisted like a rattlesnake, and I just couldn\'t\nresist, suh.Then I sent m\'<DW65> Ephum to tell him not to let me catch\nsight of him \'round the Planters\' House.Yes, suh, that\'s what he was.One of these damned Yankees who come South and go into <DW65>-deals and\npolitics."\'Lincoln glanced at Stephen, and then again at the Judge\'s letter.He\ntook up his silk hat and thrust that, too, into the worn lining, which\nwas already filled with papers.He clapped the hat on his head, and\nbuttoned on his collar."I reckon I\'ll go for a walk, boys," he said, "and clear my head, so as\nto be ready for the Little Giant to-morrow at Freeport.Brice, do\nyou feel like walking?"Stephen, taken aback, said that he did."Now, Abe, this is just durned foolishness," one of the gentlemen\nexpostulated."We want to know if you\'re going to ask Douglas that\nquestion.""If you do, you kill yourself, Lincoln," said another, who Stephen\nafterwards learned was Mr.Medill, proprietor of the great \'Press and\nTribune\'."I guess I\'ll risk it, Joe," said Mr.Suddenly comes\nthe quiver about the corners of his mouth and the gray eyes respond."Boys," said he, "did you ever hear the story of farmer Bell, down in\nEgypt?I\'ll tell it to you, boys, and then perhaps you\'ll know why I\'ll\nask Judge Douglas that question.Farmer Bell had the prize Bartlett pear\ntree, and the prettiest gal in that section.And he thought about the\nsame of each of \'em.But there\nwas only one who had any chance of getting her, and his name was Jim\nRickets.Jim was the handsomest man in that section.But Jim had a good deal out of life,--all the appetites, and some\nof the gratifications.He liked Sue, and he liked a luscious Bartlett.And it just so happened that that prize\npear tree had a whopper on that year, and old man Bell couldn\'t talk of\nanything else."Now there was an ugly galoot whose name isn\'t worth mentioning.He knew\nhe wasn\'t in any way fit for Sue, and he liked pears about as well as\nJim Rickets.Well, one night here comes Jim along the road, whistling;\nto court Susan, and there was the ugly galoot a-yearning on the bank\nunder the pear tree.Jim was all fixed up, and he says to the galoot,\n\'Let\'s have a throw.\'Now the galoot knew old Bell was looking over\nthe fence So he says, \'All right,\' and he gives Jim the first shot--Jim\nfetched down the big pear, got his teeth in it, and strolled off to the\nhouse, kind of pitiful of the galoot for a, half-witted ass.When he got\nto the door, there was the old man.\'Why,\' says Rickets, in his off-hand way, for he always had great\nconfidence, \'to fetch Sue.\'""The old man used to wear brass toes to keep his boots from wearing\nout," said Mr.Lincoln, "you see the galoot knew that Jim\nRickets wasn\'t to be trusted with Susan Bell."Some of the gentlemen appeared to see the point of this political\nparable, for they laughed uproariously.Then\nthey slapped their knees, looked at Mr.Lincoln\'s face, which was\nperfectly sober, and laughed again, a little fainter.Then the Judge\nlooked as solemn as his title."It won\'t do, Abe," said he."You\'d better stick to the pear, Abe," said Mr.Medill, "and fight\nStephen A. Douglas here and now."Why, yes, Joe," said Mr."He\'s a man with tens of\nthousands of blind followers.It\'s my business to make some of those\nblind followers see."By this time Stephen was burning to know the question that Mr.Lincoln\nwished to ask the Little Giant, and why the other gentlemen were against\nit.Lincoln surprised him still further in taking him by the\narm.Hill, who had finished his\nwriting, he said:\n\n"Bob, a little air will do you good.I\'ve had enough of the old boys for\na while, and I\'m going to talk to somebody any own age."Stephen was halfway down the corridor when he discovered that he had\nforgotten his hat.As he returned he heard somebody say:\n\n"If that ain\'t just like Abe.He stopped to pull a flea out of his\nstocking when he was going to fight that duel with Shields, and now he\'s\nwalking with boys before a debate with the smartest man in this country.And there\'s heaps of things he ought to discuss with us.""Reckon we haven\'t got much to do with it," said another, half laughing,\nhalf rueful."There\'s some things Abe won\'t stand."Lincoln threading his way through the\ncrowd below, laughing at one, pausing to lay his hand on the shoulder\nof another, and replying to a rough sally of a third to make the place a\ntumult of guffaws.But none had the temerity to follow him.When\nStephen caught up with him in the little country street, he was talking\nearnestly to Mr.Hill, the young reporter of the Press and Tribune.And\nwhat do you think was the subject?Lincoln\'s strides, another\nshock in store for him.This rail-splitter, this postmaster, this\nflat-boatman, whom he had not credited with a knowledge of the New Code,\nwas talking Astronomy.Lincoln, "can you elucidate the problem of the three\nbodies?"The talk then fell upon novels and stories, a few of which Mr.He spoke, among others, of the "Gold Bug.""The\nstory is grand," said he, "but it might as well have been written of\nRobinson Crusoe\'s island.What a fellow wants in a book is to know where\nhe is.There are not many novels, or ancient works for that matter, that\nput you down anywhere.""There is that genuine fragment which Cicero has preserved from a last\nwork of Aristotle," said Mr."\'If there were beings who\nlived in the depths of the earth, and could emerge through the open\nfissures, and could suddenly behold the earth, the sea, and the--vault\nof heaven--\'"\n\n"But you--you impostor," cried Mr.Lincoln, interrupting, "you\'re giving\nus Humboldt\'s Cosmos."It is remarkable how soon we accustom ourselves to a strange situation.And to Stephen it was no less strange to be walking over a muddy road of\nthe prairie with this most singular man and a newspaper correspondent,\nthan it might have been to the sub-terrestrial inhabitant to emerge on\nthe earth\'s surface.Stephen\'s mind was in the process of a chemical\nchange: Suddenly it seemed to him as if he had known this tall\nIllinoisan always.The whim of the senatorial candidate in choosing him\nfor a companion he did not then try to account for.Lincoln, presently, "where do you hail\nfrom?""And how does it happen that you\ncome to me with a message from a rank Abolitionist lawyer in St."Is the Judge a friend of yours, sir?"Lincoln, "didn\'t he tell you he was?""He said nothing at all, sir, except to tell me to travel until I found\nyou.""I call the Judge a friend of mine," said Mr."He may not claim\nme because I do not believe in putting all slave-owners to the sword.""I do not think that Judge Whipple is precisely an Abolitionist, sir."It was rare with him, and he must have\ncaught it from Mr."I am not for ripping out the dam suddenly, sir, that would drown the\nnation.I believe that the water can be drained off in some other way."Lincoln\'s direct answer to this was to give Stephen stinging slap\nbetween the shoulder-blades.Bob, take that\ndown for the Press and Tribune as coming from a rising young politician\nof St."Why," Stephen blurted out, "I--I thought you were an Abolitionist, Mr.Lincoln, "I have as much use for the Boston\nLiberator as I have for the Charleston Courier.John went back to the garden.The question is not whether we shall or shall not have slavery,\nbut whether slavery shall stay where it is, or be extended according to\nJudge Douglas\'s ingenious plan.I am\nfor cauterizing the sore so that it shall not spread.Brice, that this nation cannot exist half slave and half free."Was it the slap on the back that opened Stephen\'s eyes?It was certain\nthat as they returned to the tavern the man at his side was changed.He\nneed not have felt chagrined.Men in high places underestimated Lincoln,\nor did not estimate him at all.The great warm\nheart had claimed Stephen as it claimed all who']
