without band or promenade,\nwithout even a Christy Minstrel or a Punch and Judy, our sole amusement\nbeing the vain attempt to catch a tiny fish, the Robinson Crusoe of\na small pool in the rock above high-water mark, where by some ill\nchance he found himself.But he looked extremely contented with his\nsea hermitage, and evaded so cleverly all our efforts to get hold of\nhim, that after a while we left him to his solitude--where possibly he\nresides still.[Illustration: THE LIZARD LIGHTS BY DAY.]How delicious it is for hard-worked people to do nothing, absolutely\nnothing!Of course only for a little while--a few days, a few hours.The love of work and the necessity for it soon revive.But just for\nthose few harmless hours to let the world and its duties and cares\nalike slip by, to be absolutely idle, to fold one\'s hands and look\nat the sea and the sky, thinking of nothing at all, except perhaps\nto count and watch for every ninth wave--said to be the biggest\nalways--and wonder how big it will be, and whether it will reach that\nstone with the little colony of limpets and two red anemones beside\nthem, or stop short at the rock where we sit placidly dangling our\nfeet, waiting, Canute-like, for the supreme moment when the will of\nhumanity sinks conquered by the immutable powers of nature.Then,\ngreatest crisis of all, the sea will attack that magnificent castle and\nmoat, which we grown-up babies have constructed with such pride.Well,\nhave we not all built our sand-castles and seen them swept away?happy\nif by no unkinder force than the remorseless wave of Time, which will\nsoon flow over us all.But how foolish is moralising--making my narrative halt like that horse\nwhom we amused ourselves with half the afternoon.He was tied by the\nleg, poor beast, the fore leg fastened to the hind one, as seemed to be\nthe ordinary Cornish fashion with all animals--horses, cows, and sheep.It certainly saves a deal of trouble, preventing them from climbing the\n"hedges" which form the sole boundary of property, but it makes the\ncreatures go limping about in rather a melancholy fashion.However,\nas it is their normal condition, probably they communicate it to one\nanother, and each generation accepts its lot.He was a handsome animal, who came and peered at\nthe sketch which one of us was doing, after the solemn fashion of\nquadrupedal connoisseurship, and kept us company all the afternoon.We\nsat in a row on the top of the "hedge," enjoying the golden afternoon,\nand scarcely believing it possible that yesterday had been yesterday.Of the wild storm and deluge of rain there was not a single trace;\neverything looked as lovely as if it had been, and was going to be,\nsummer all the year.We were so contented, and were making such progress in our sketch and\ndistant view of Kynance over the now dry and smiling cornfield, that we\nhad nigh forgotten the duties of civilisation, until some one brought\nthe news that all the household was apparently dressing itself in its\nvery best, to attend the rectory tea.We determined to do the same,\nthough small were our possibilities of toilette."Nobody knows us, and we know\nnobody."A position rather rare to those who "dwell among their own people,"\nwho take a kindly interest in everybody, and believe with a pardonable\ncredulity that everybody takes a kindly interest in them.But human nature is the same all the world over.And here we saw it in\nits pleasantest phase; rich and poor meeting together, not for charity,\nbut courtesy--a courtesy that was given with a kindliness and accepted\nwith a quiet independence which seemed characteristic of these Cornish\nfolk.Among the little crowd, gentle and simple, we, of course, did not know\na single soul.Nevertheless, delivering up our tickets to the gardener\nat the gate, we entered, and wandered at ease through the pretty\ngarden, gorgeous with asters, marigolds, carnations, and all sorts of\nrich- and rich-scented autumn flowers; where the hydrangeas\ngrew in enormous bushes, and the fuchsias had stems as thick and solid\nas trees.In front of the open hall door']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Grand\nCommander, "Let it be recorded, he will lie and steal," and then an\nimmense gong at the far end of the hall would be sounded and the\ncandidate would imagine that the day of judgment had come.The scheme\nof bouncing candidates into the air from a rubber blanket, so popular\nduring the days of the recent ice carnivals was said to have been\noriginal with the Sons of Malta, and was one of the mildest of the\nmany atrocities perpetrated by this most noble order.Some time during the summer a large excursion party of members of the\norder from Cincinnati, Chicago and Milwaukee visited St.Among the number was the celebrated elocutionist, Alf.Burnett of\nCincinnati, and Gov.They arrived at\nthe lower levee about midnight and marched up Third street to the hall\nof the order, where a grand banquet was awaiting them.The visitors\nwere arrayed in long, black robes, with a black hood over their heads,\nand looked more like the prisoners in the play of "Lucretia Borgia"\nthan members of modern civilization.On the following day there was an immense barbecue at Minnehaha\nFalls, when the visitors were feasted with an ox roasted whole.This\norganization kept on increasing in membership, until in an evil hour\none of the members had succeeded in inducing the Rev.John Penman\nto consent to become one of its members.Penman was so highly\nIndignant at the manner in which he had been handled during the\ninitiation that he immediately wrote an expose of the secret work,\nwith numerous illustrations, and had it published in Harper\'s Weekly.The exposition acted like a bombshell in the camp of the Philistines,\nand ever after Empire hall, the headquarters of the order, presented\na dark and gloomy appearance.The reverend gentleman was judge of\nprobate of Ramsey county at the time, but his popularity suddenly\ndiminished and when his term of office expired he found it to his\nadvantage to locate in a more congenial atmosphere.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Minnesotian and Times, although both Republican papers, never\ncherished much love for each other.The ravings of the Eatanswill\nGazette were mild in comparison to the epithets used by these little\npapers in describing the shortcomings of their "vile and reptile\ncontemporary."After the election in 1859, as soon as it was known\nthat the Republicans had secured a majority in the legislature, the\nmanagers of these rival Republican offices instituted a very lively\ncampaign for the office of state printer.Both papers had worked hard\nfor the success of the Republican ticket and they had equal claims\non the party for recognition.Both offices were badly in need of\nfinancial assistance, and had the Republican party not been successful\none of them, and perhaps both, would have been compelled to suspend.How to divide the patronage satisfactorily to both papers was the\nproblem that confronted the legislature about to assemble.The war of\nwords between Foster and Newson continued with unabated ferocity.The\neditor of the Minnesotian would refer to the editor of the Times\nas "Mr.Timothy Muggins Newson"--his right name being Thomas M.\nNewson--and the Times would frequently mention Dr.Foster as the\n"red-nosed, goggle-eyed editor of the Minnesotian."To effect a\nreconciliation between these two editors required the best diplomatic\ntalent of the party leaders.After frequent consultations between the\nleading men of the party and the managers of the two offices, it was\narranged that the papers should be consolidated and the name of the\npaper should be the Minnesotian and Times.It can readily be seen\nthat a marriage contracted under these peculiar circumstances was\nnot likely to produce a prolonged state of connubial felicity.The\nrelations between Foster and Newson were no more cordial under one\nmanagement than had hitherto existed when the offices were separate.This unhappy situation continued until about the time the legislature\nadjourned, when the partnership was dissolved.Foster assumed\nentire control of the Minnesotian and Maj.Foster in the\npublication of the Minnesotian prior to the consolidation, but when\nthe offices separated it was stipulated that Mr.Moore should have the\nprinting of the Journals of the two houses of the legislature as part\npayment of his share of the business of the late firm of Newson,\nMoore, Foster & Co., thus entirely severing his relations with the\npaper he helped to found.After the arrangement was made it was with\nthe greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville\nBrown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state\nprinter and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that\nvillage.Newson until\nthe first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R.Marshall\nand Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St.The Press proved to be too much of a competitor for the\nMinnesotian, and in a short time Dr.Foster was compelled to surrender\nto its enterprising projectors, they having purchased the entire\nplant.This ended the rivalry between the two Republican dailies.Newson, some time afterward, received commissions in\nthe volunteer service of the army during the Civil war, and George W.\nMoore was appointed collector of the port of St.Paul, a position he\nheld for more than twenty years.*       *       *       *       *\n\nDoes any one remember that St.Paul had a paper called the Daily North\nStar?Paul and Ramsey county do not seem to ever\nhave chronicled the existence of this sprightly little sheet.During\nthe presidential campaign of 1860 we had two kinds of Democrats--the\nDouglas and the Breckinridge or administration Democrats.There\nwere only two papers in the state that espoused the cause of\nMr.Breckinridge--the Chatfield Democrat and the Henderson\nIndependent--and as they had been designated by the president to\npublish such portion of the acts of congress as it was customary\nto print at that time, it was quite natural that they carried the\nadministration colors at the head of their columns.They were called\n"bread and butter papers."Breckinridge thought\ntheir cause would present a more respectable appearance if they had an\norgan at the capital of the state.Young,\nthe editor of the Henderson Independent, was brought down from that\nvillage and the Daily North Star soon made its appearance.It was not\nnecessary at that time to procure the Associated Press dispatches, a\nperfecting press and linotype machines before embarking in a daily\nnewspaper enterprise, as a Washington hand press and five or six\ncases of type were all that were necessary.This paper was published\nregularly until after election, and as the returns indicated that the\nofficeholders would not much longer contribute toward its support it\nsoon collapsed.Paul had another paper that is very seldom mentioned in newspaper\nhistory.Paul Weekly Journal, and was edited by\nDr.Massey, formerly of the Ohio Statesman and private secretary to\nGov.This paper was started in 1862, but on account of its\nviolent opposition to the prosecution of the war did not meet with\nmuch favor, and only existed about eight months.*       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time during the year 1858 the Minnesotian office received about\nhalf a dozen cases of very bad whisky in payment of a very bad debt.They could not sell it--they could not even give it to any one.Occasionally the thirst of an old-time compositor would get the\nbetter of him and he would uncork a bottle.Think of half a dozen cases of whisky remaining unmolested\nin a printing office for more than two years.During the campaign\nof 1860 the Wide Awakes and the Little Giants were the uniformed\npolitical organizations intended to attract the attention of voters.One dreary night one of the attaches of the Minnesotian office, and an\nactive member of the Wide Awakes, met the Little Giants near Bridge\nSquare as they were returning to their hall after a long march.In order to establish a sort of entente cordiale between the two\norganisations the Little Giants were invited over to the Minnesotian\noffice in hopes they would be able to reduce the supply of this\nnauseating beverage.The invitation was\nreadily accepted, and in a short time fifty ardent followers of the\nadvocate of squatter sovereignty were lined up in front of a black\nRepublican office, thirsting for black Republican whisky.Bottle after\nbottle, was passed down the line, and as it gurgled down the throats\nof these enthusiastic marchers they smacked their lips with as much\ngusto as did Rip Van Winkle when partaking of the soporific potation\nthat produced his twenty years\' sleep.One of the cardinal principles\nof the Democracy, at that time was to "love rum and hate <DW65>s."As\nthe entire stock was disposed of before the club resumed its line of\nmarch, the host of the occasion concluded that at least one plank of\ntheir platform was rigidly adhered to.THE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862.NARRATION OF SOME OF THE EXCITING EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE\nGREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862--FORT RIDGELY, NEW ULM AND BIRCH\nCOULIE--OTHER DAY AND WABASHA--GREAT EXCITEMENT IN ST.In July and August, 1862, President Lincoln issued proclamations\ncalling for the enlistment of 600,000 volunteers for the purpose of\nreinforcing the army, then vainly endeavoring to suppress the Southern\nrebellion.It was probably one of the most gloomy periods in the\nhistory of the Civil war.McClellan had been compelled to make a\nprecipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond;\nthe army of Northern Virginia under Pope had met with several severe\nreverses; the armies in the West under Grant, Buell and Curtis had not\nbeen able to make any progress toward the heart of the Confederacy;\nrebel marauders under Morgan were spreading desolation and ruin in\nKentucky and Ohio; rebel privateers were daily eluding the vigilant\nwatch of the navy and escaping to Europe with loads of cotton, which\nthey readily disposed of and returned with arms and ammunition to aid\nin the prosecution of their cause.France was preparing to invade\nMexico with a large army for the purpose of forcing the establishment\nof a monarchical form of government upon the people of our sister\nrepublic; the sympathies of all the great powers of Europe, save\nRussia, were plainly manifested by outspoken utterances favorable to\nthe success of the Confederate cause; rumors of foreign intervention\nin behalf of the South were daily circulated; the enemies of the\ngovernment in the North were especially active in their efforts\nto prevent the enlistment of men under the call of the president;\nconspiracies for burning Northern cities had been unearthed by\ngovernment detectives, and emissaries from the South were endeavoring\nto spread disease and pestilence throughout the loyal North.It was\nduring this critical period in the great struggle for the suppression\nof the Rebellion that one of the most fiendish atrocities in the\nhistory of Indian warfare was enacted on the western boundaries of\nMinnesota.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt can readily be seen that the government was illy prepared to cope\nwith an outbreak of such magnitude as this soon proved to be.By the\nterms of the treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 the\nSioux sold all their lands in Minnesota, except a strip ten miles wide\non each side of the Minnesota river from near Fort Ridgely to Big\nStone lake.In 1858 ten miles of the strip lying north of the river\nwas sold, mainly through the influence of Little Crow.The selling of\nthis strip caused great dissatisfaction among the Indians and Little\nCrow was severely denounced for the part he took in the transaction.The sale rendered it necessary for all the Indians to locate on the\nsouth side of the Minnesota, where game was scarce and trapping poor.There was nothing for them to live upon unless they adopted the habits\nof civilization and worked like white men.This was very distasteful\nto many of them, as they wanted to live the same as they did before\nthe treaty--go where they pleased, when they pleased, and hunt game\nand sell fur to traders.The government built houses for those who\ndesired to occupy them, furnished tools, seed, etc., and taught them\nhow to farm.At two of the agencies during the summer of the outbreak\nthey had several hundred acres of land under cultivation.The\ndisinclination of many of the Indians to work gradually produced\ndissension among themselves and they formed into two parties--the\nwhite man\'s party, those that believed in cultivating the soil; and\nthe Indian party, a sort of young-man-afraid-of-work association, who\nbelieved it beneath the dignity of the noble Dakotan to perform\nmanual labor.The white man\'s, or farmer\'s party, was favored by the\ngovernment, some of them having fine houses built for them.The other\nIndians did not like this, and became envious of them because they\ndiscontinued the customs of the tribe.There was even said to have\nbeen a secret organization among the tepee Indians whose object it was\nto declare war upon the whites.The Indians also claimed that they\nwere not fairly dealt with by the traders; that they had to rely\nentirely upon their word for their indebtedness to them; that they\nwere ignorant of any method of keeping accounts, and that when the\npaymaster came the traders generally took all that was coming, and\noften leaving many of them in debt.They protested against permitting\nthe traders to sit at the pay table of the government paymaster and\ndeduct from their small annuities the amount due them.They had at\nleast one white man\'s idea--they wanted to pay their debts when they\ngot ready.*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor several weeks previous to the outbreak the Indians came to the\nagencies to get their money.Day after day and week after week passed\nand there was no sign of paymasters.The year 1862 was the the second\nyear of the great Rebellion, and as the government officers had been\ntaxed to their utmost to provide funds for the prosecution of the war,\nit looked as though they had neglected their wards in Minnesota.Many\nof the Indians who had gathered about the agencies were out of money\nand their families were suffering.The Indians were told that on\naccount of the great war in which the government was engaged the\npayment would never be made.Their annuities were payable in gold and\nthey were told that the great father had no gold to pay them with.Galbraith, the agent of the Sioux, had organized a company to go\nSouth, composed mostly of half-breeds, and this led the Indians to\nbelieve that now would be the time to go to war with the whites and\nget their land back.It was believed that the men who had enlisted\nlast had all left the state and that before, help could be sent they\ncould clear the country of the whites, and that the Winnebagos and\nChippewas would come to their assistance.It is known that the Sioux\nhad been in communication with Hole-in-the-Day, the Chippewa chief,\nbut the outbreak was probably precipitated before they came to an\nunderstanding.It was even said at the time that the Confederate\ngovernment had emissaries among them, but the Indians deny this report\nand no evidence has ever been collected proving its truthfulness.*       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder the call of the president for 600,000 men Minnesota was called\nupon to furnish five regiments--the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth\nand Tenth--and the requisition had been partially filled and the men\nmustered in when the news reached St.Paul that open hostilities had\ncommenced at the upper agency, and an indiscriminate massacre of the\nwhites was taking place.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe people of Minnesota had been congratulating themselves that\nthey were far removed from the horrors of the Civil war, and their\nindignation knew no bounds when compelled to realize that these\ntreacherous redskins, who had been nursed and petted by officers\nof the government, and by missionaries and traders for years, had,\nwithout a moment\'s warning, commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of\nmen, women and children.It was a singular fact that farmer Indians,\nwhom the government officers and missionaries had tried so hard\nto civilize, were guilty of the most terrible butcheries after\nhostilities had actually commenced.*       *       *       *       *\n\nA few days previous to the attack upon the whites at the upper agency\na portion of the band of Little Six appeared at Action, Meeker county.There they murdered several people and then fled to Redwood.It was\nthe first step in the great massacre that soon followed.On the\nmorning of the 18th of August, without a word of warning, an\nindiscriminate massacre was inaugurated.A detachment of Company B of\nthe Fifth regiment, under command of Capt.Marsh, went to the scene\nof the revolt, but they were ambushed and about twenty-five of their\nnumber, including the captain, killed.The horrible work of murder,\npillage and destruction was spread throughout the entire Sioux\nreservation, and whole families, especially those in isolated portions\nof the country, were an easy prey to these fiendish warriors.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Wyoming massacre during the Revolution and the Black Hawk and\nSeminole wars at a later period, pale into insignificance when\ncompared to the great outrages committed by these demons during this\nterrible outbreak.In less than one week 1,000 people had been killed,\nseveral million dollars\' worth of property destroyed and 30,000 people\nrendered homeless.The entire country from Fort Ripley to the southern\nboundary of the state, reaching almost to the mouth of the Minnesota\nriver, had been in a twinkling depopulated.How to repel these\ninvaders and drive them back to their reservations and out of the\nstate as they had forfeited all rights to the land they had occupied,\nwas the problem that suddenly confronted both the state and national\nauthorities.*       *       *       *       *\n\nShortly after the news of the outbreak at Redwood had been received,\nword was sent from Fort Ripley to the effect that the Chippewas were\nassuming a warlike attitude, and it was feared that the Sioux and\nChippewas--hereditary enemies--had buried the hatchet, or had been\ninfluenced by other causes, and were ready to co-operate in an\nindiscriminate massacre of the whites.Indian Agent Walker undertook\nto arrest the famous chief Hole-in-the-day, but that wily warrior had\nscented danger and suddenly disappeared, with his entire band, which\ncaused grave apprehension among the settlers in that locality, and\nthey were in daily dread of an attack from these hitherto peaceable\ntribes.*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe suddenness with which the outbreak had occurred and the\nextraordinary rapidity with which it spread, driving the defenseless\nsettlers from their homes and causing desolation and ruin on every\nside, rendered it necessary for the governor to call an extra session\nof the legislature for the purpose of devising means to arm and equip\nvolunteers, and assist the homeless refugees in procuring places of\nshelter where they would be safe from molestation by these dusky\nwarriors.Ramsey\'s picture\nof the ravages of these outlaws in his message to the legislature?"Nothing which the brutal lust and wanton cruelty of these savages\ncould wreak upon their helpless and innocent victims was omitted from\nthe category of their crimes," said the governor."Helplessness and\ninnocence, indeed, which would inspire pity in any heart but theirs,\nseemed to inspire them only with a more fiendish rage.Infants hewn\ninto bloody chips of flesh or torn untimely from the womb of the\nmurdered mother, and in cruel mockery cast in fragments on her\npulseless and bleeding breast; rape joined to murder in one awful\ntragedy; young girls, even children of tender years, outraged by\nthese brutal ravishers till death ended their shame; women held into\ncaptivity to undergo the horrors of a living death; whole families\nburned alive; and, as if their devilish fancy could not glut itself\nwith outrages on the living, the last efforts exhausted in mutilating\nthe bodies of the dead.Such are the spectacles, and a thousand\nnameless horrors besides which this first experience of Indian\nwarfare has burned into the minds and hearts of our frontier people;\nand such the enemy with whom we have to deal."*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old saying that the only good Indians are dead ones had a noble\nexception in the person of Other Day, who piloted sixty-two men,\nwomen and children across the country from below Yellow Medicine to\nKandiyohi, and from there to Hutchinson, Glencoe and Carver.Other Day\nwas an educated Indian and had been rather wild in his younger days,\nbut experienced a change of heart about four years before the outbreak\nand had adopted the habits of civilization.Paul a few days after he had piloted his party in safety to Carver,\nand in the course of a few remarks to a large audience at Ingersoll\nhall, which had assembled for the purpose of organizing a company of\nhome guards, he said: "I am a Dakota Indian, born and reared in the\nmidst of evil.I grew up without the knowledge of any good thing.I\nhave been instructed by Americans and taught to read and write.I became acquainted with the Sacred Writings, and\nthus learned my vileness.At the present time I have fallen into great\nevil and affliction, but have escaped from it, and with sixty-two men,\nwomen and children, without moccasins, without food and without a\nblanket, I have arrived in the midst of a great people, and now my\nheart is glad.I attribute it to the mercy of the Great Spirit."Other\nDay had been a member of the church for several years and his religion\ntaught him that the Great Spirit approved his conduct.*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was apparent that the Indian war was on in earnest.Sibley,\non account of his long familiarity with Indian character, was placed\nin command of the troops ordered to assemble at St.Peter, and in\na few days, with detachments of the regiments then forming,\nhalf-uniformed, poorly armed and with a scant supply of ammunition,\ncommenced offensive operations against the murderous redskins.The\nnewspapers and the people were crying "On to Ridgely!"which was then\nbeleaguered, with the same persistency as did Horace Greeyley howl "On\nto Richmond!"*       *       *       *       *\n\nAny one who has seen the thrilling realistic Indian play of "The Girl\nI Left Behind Me" can form some idea of the terrible suspense of the\nlittle garrison at Port Ridgely previous to being relieved by the\nforces under command of Gen.Fort Ridgely was a fort only\nin name, and consisted of two or three stone and several wooden\nbuildings, surrounded by a fence, which did not afford much protection\nwhen attacked by a large force.The garrison was under the command of\nLieut.His force consisted of about 150 men from the\nFifth regiment, fifty men of the Renville Rangers, and a number of\ncivilians.He was surrounded by 700 or 800 Sioux, fully armed and\nequipped.Although there were only two attempts made to capture the\ngarrison by assault, yet the siege was kept up for several days.In\naddition to about 300 refugees who had gathered there for support\nand protection, the $72,000 of annuity money, which had been so long\nexpected, arrived there the day before the outbreak.After bravely\ndefending the fort for more than a week, the little garrison was\nrelieved by the arrival of about 200 mounted volunteers under command\nof Col.McPhail, being the advance of Gen.During\nthe siege many of the men became short of musketry ammunition, and\nspherical case shot were opened in the barracks and women worked with\nbusy hands making cartridges, while men cut nail rods in short pieces\nand used them as bullets, their dismal whistling producing terror\namong the redskins.Almost simultaneously with the attack on Fort Ridgely the Indians in\nlarge numbers appeared in the vicinity of New Ulm, with the evident\nintention of burning and pillaging the village.Judge Charles E.\nFlandrau of this city, who was then residing at St.Peter, organized a\ncompany of volunteers and marched across the country to the relief of\nthat place.The judge received several acquisitions to his force while\nen route, and when he arrived at New Ulm found himself in command of\nabout 300 men, poorly armed and wholly without military experience.They arrived at New Ulm just in time to assist the inhabitants in\ndriving the Indians from the upper part of the village, several\ncitizens having been killed and a number of houses burned.Two or\nthree days afterward the Indians appeared in large force, surrounded\nthe town and commenced burning the buildings on its outskirts.After\na desperate encounter, in which the force under command of Judge\nFlandrau lost ten killed and about forty wounded, the Indians retired.There were in the village at the time of the attack about 1,200 or\n1,500 noncombatants, and every one of them would have been killed had\nthe Indian attack been successful.Provisions and ammunition becoming\nscarce, the judge decided to evacuate the town and march across the\ncountry to Mankato.They made up a train of about 150 wagons, loaded\nthem with women and children and the men who had been wounded in the\nfight, and arrived safely in Mankato without being molested.Nearly\ntwo hundred houses were burned before the town was evacuated, leaving\nnothing standing but a few houses inside the hastily constructed\nbarricade.The long procession of families leaving their desolated\nhomes, many of them never to return, formed one of the saddest scenes\nin the history of the outbreak, and will ever be remembered by the\ngallant force under the command of Judge Flandrau, who led them to a\nplace of safety.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as Gen.Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely a detail of Company A\nof the Sixth regiment, under command of Capt.Paul,\nand seventy members of the Cullen Guards, under the command of Capt.Paul, and several citizen volunteers,\nall under the command of Maj.Joseph R. Brown, was sent out with\ninstructions to bury the dead and rescue the wounded, if any could\nbe found, from their perilous surroundings.Paul\norganizations and most all of their members were St.They\nnever had had an opportunity to drill and most of them were not\nfamiliar with the use of firearms.After marching for two days, during\nwhich time they interred a large number of victims of the savage\nSioux, they went into camp at Birch Coulie, about fifteen miles from\nFort Ridgely.The encampment was on the prairie near a fringe of\ntimber and the coulie on one side and an elevation of about ten feet\non the other.It was a beautiful but very unfortunate location for the\ncommand to camp, and would probably not have been selected had it been\nknown that they were surrounded by 400 or 500 hostile warriors.Brown had about one hundred and fifty men under his command.About 4\no\'clock on the following morning the Indians, to the number of 500 or\n600, well armed and most of them mounted, commenced an indiscriminate\nfire upon the almost helpless little command.For two days they\nbravely defended themselves, and when relief finally arrived it was\nfound that about half their number had been killed or wounded.When\nthe news of the disaster reached St.Relatives and friends of the dead and wounded were outspoken in\ntheir denunciation of the civil and military authorities who were\nresponsible for this great sacrifice of the lives of our citizens.It\nwas feared that the city itself was in danger of an attack from the\nsavages.Home guards were organized and the bluffs commanding a view\nof the city were nightly patrolled by citizen volunteers.There was no\ntelegraph at that time and rumors of all sorts were flying thick\nand fast.Every courier reaching the city would bring news of fresh\noutrages, and our panic-stricken citizens had hardly time to recover\nfrom the effect of one disaster before the news of another would be\nreceived.Settlers fleeing from their homes for places of safety were\narriving by the score, leaving crops to perish in the field and their\nhouses to be destroyed.The situation was appalling, and many of our\ncitizens were predicting the most direful results should the army fail\nto check the savage hordes in their work of devastation and ruin.Every boat from the Minnesota river would be crowded with refugees,\nand the people of St.Paul were often called upon to assist in\nforwarding them to their place of destination.Home guards were organized in almost every village of the threatened\nportion of the state, but the authorities could not furnish arms\nor ammunition and their services would have been of little account\nagainst the well-armed savages in case they had been attacked.Paul newspapers offering rewards of\n$25 a piece for Sioux scalps.*       *       *       *       *\n\nGov.Ramsey endeavored to allay the apprehensions of the people and\npublished in the papers a statement to the effect that the residents\nof the Capital City need not be alarmed, as the nearest approach of\nthe Indians was at Acton, Meeker county, 80 miles away; Fort Ripley,\n150 miles away, and the scenes of the tragedy in Yellow Medicine\ncounty, 210 miles distant.This may have been gratifying to the\nresidents of the Capital City, but was far from reassuring to the\nfrontiersmen who were compelled to abandon their homes and were\nseeking the protection of the slowly advancing militia.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout 12 o\'clock one night during the latter part of August a report\nwas circulated over the northern and western portion of St.Paul that\nthe savages were near the city, and many women and children were\naroused from their slumber and hastily dressed and sought the\nprotection of the city authorities.It was an exciting but rather\namusing episode in the great tragedy then taking place on the\nfrontier.Rumors of this character were often circulated, and it was\nnot until after the battle of Wood Lake that the people of St.Paul\nfelt that they were perfectly safe from raids by the hostile Sioux.*       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as Gen.Sibley had collected a sufficient force to enable\nhim to move with safety he decided upon offensive operations.He had\ncollected about 2,000 men from the regiments then forming, including\nthe Third regiment, recently paroled, and a battery under command of\nCapt.Daniel travelled to the garden.The expedition marched for two or three days\nwithout encountering opposition, but on the morning of the 23d of\nSeptember several foraging parties belonging to the Third regiment\nwere fired upon in the vicinity of Wood Lake.About 800 of the command\nwere engaged in the encounter and were opposed by about an equal\nnumber of Indians.Marshall, with\nabout 400 men, made a double-quick charge upon the Sioux and succeeded\nin utterly routing them.Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty\nwounded.This was the only real battle of the war.Other Day was with\nthe whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter.Pope, who was in command of the department of the\nNorthwest, telegraphed the war department that the Indian war was\nover and asked what disposition to make of the troops then under his\ncommand.Daniel went to the bathroom.Pope was met with a decided remonstrance\nby the people of Minnesota, and they succeeded in preventing the\nremoval of any of the troops until they had made two long marches\nthrough the Dakotas and to Montana.Sibley\'s command reached Camp\nRelease on the 26th of September, in the vicinity of which was\nlocated a large camp of Indians, most of whom had been engaged in the\nmassacres.They had with them about two hundred and fifty mixed bloods\nand white women and children, and the soldiers were very anxious to\nprecede at once to their rescue.Sibley was of the opinion that\nany hostile demonstration would mean the annihilation of all the\nprisoners, and therefore proceeded with the utmost caution.After a\nfew preliminary consultations the entire camp surrendered and the\ncaptives were released.Sibley made inquiries\nas to the participation of these Indians in the terrible crimes\nrecently perpetrated, and it soon developed that a large number of\nthem had been guilty of the grossest atrocities.The general decided\nto form a military tribunal and try the offenders.After a series of\nsittings, lasting from the 30th of September to the 5th of November,\n321 of the fiends were found guilty of the offenses charged, 303 of\nwhom were sentenced to death and the']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["Lord Monmouth having been informed that all was calm, and that Madame\nColonna, attended by Mr.Rigby, had gone to Richmond, ordered his\ncarriage, and accompanied by Lucretia and Lucian Gay, departed\nimmediately for Blackwall, where, in whitebait, a quiet bottle of\nclaret, the society of his agreeable friends, and the contemplation of\nthe passing steamers, he found a mild distraction and an amusing repose.Rigby reported that evening to the Marquess on his return, that all\nwas arranged and tranquil.Perhaps he exaggerated the difficulties,\nto increase the service; but according to his account they were\nconsiderable.It required some time to make Madame Colonna comprehend\nthe nature of his communication.All Rigby's diplomatic skill was\nexpended in the gradual development.When it was once fairly put before\nher, the effect was appalling.That was the first great ringing of\nbells.Rigby softened a little what he had personally endured; but\nhe confessed she sprang at him like a tigress balked of her prey, and\npoured forth on him a volume of epithets, many of which Rigby\nreally deserved.But after all, in the present instance, he was not\ntreacherous, only base, which he always was.Then she fell into a\npassion of tears, and vowed frequently that she was not weeping for\nherself, but only for that dear Mr.Coningsby, who had been treated so\ninfamously and robbed of Lucretia, and whose heart she knew must break.It seemed that Rigby stemmed the first violence of her emotion by\nmysterious intimations of an important communication that he had to\nmake; and piquing her curiosity, he calmed her passion.But really\nhaving nothing to say, he was nearly involved in fresh dangers.He took\nrefuge in the affectation of great agitation which prevented exposition.The lady then insisted on her travelling carriage being ordered and\npacked, as she was determined to set out for Rome that afternoon.This\nlittle occurrence gave Rigby some few minutes to collect himself, at\nthe end of which he made the Princess several announcements of intended\narrangements, all of which pleased her mightily, though they were so\ninconsistent with each other, that if she had not been a woman in a\npassion, she must have detected that Rigby was lying.He assured her\nalmost in the same breath, that she was never to be separated from them,\nand that she was to have any establishment in any country she liked.He\ntalked wildly of equipages, diamonds, shawls, opera-boxes; and while\nher mind was bewildered with these dazzling objects, he, with intrepid\ngravity, consulted her as to the exact amount she would like to have\napportioned, independent of her general revenue, for the purposes of\ncharity.At the end of two hours, exhausted by her rage and soothed by these\nvisions, Madame Colonna having grown calm and reasonable, sighed and\nmurmured a complaint, that Lord Monmouth ought to have communicated this\nimportant intelligence in person.Upon this Rigby instantly assured\nher, that Lord Monmouth had been for some time waiting to do so, but\nin consequence of her lengthened interview with Rigby, his Lordship had\ndeparted for Richmond with Lucretia, where he hoped that Madame Colonna\nand Mr.So it ended, with a morning drive and\nsuburban dinner; Rigby, after what he had gone through, finding no\ndifficulty in accounting for the other guests not being present, and\nbringing home Madame Colonna in the evening, at times almost as gay and\ngood-tempered as usual, and almost oblivious of her disappointment.When the Marquess met Madame Colonna he embraced her with great\ncourtliness, and from that time consulted her on every arrangement.He\ntook a very early occasion of presenting her with a diamond necklace of\ngreat value.The Marquess was fond of making presents to persons to whom\nhe thought he had not behaved very well, and who yet spared him scenes.The marriage speedily followed, by special license, at the villa of the\nRight Hon.Nicholas Rigby, who gave away the bride.The wedding was very\nselect, but brilliant as the diamond necklace: a royal Duke and Duchess,\nLady St.Ormsby presented the bride with\na bouquet of precious stones, and Lord Eskdale with a French fan in\na diamond frame.It was a fine day; Lord Monmouth, calm as if he were\nwinning the St.Leger; Lucretia, universally recognised as a beauty; all\nthe guests gay, the Princess Colonna especially.The travelling carriage is at the door which is to bear away the happy\npair.Madame Colonna embraces Lucretia; the Marquess gives a grand bow:\nthey are gone.A Prince of the blood will\npropose a toast; there is another glass of champagne quaffed, another\nortolan devoured; and then they rise and disperse.Madame Colonna leaves\nwith Lady St.Julians, whose guest for a while she is to become.And in\na few minutes their host is alone.Rigby retired into his library: the repose of the chamber must\nhave been grateful to his feelings after all this distraction.It was\nspacious, well-stored, classically adorned, and opened on a beautiful\nlawn.Rigby threw himself into an ample chair, crossed his legs, and\nresting his head on his arm, apparently fell into deep contemplation.He had some cause for reflection, and though we did once venture to\naffirm that Rigby never either thought or felt, this perhaps may be the\nexception that proves the rule.He could scarcely refrain from pondering over the strange event which he\nhad witnessed, and at which he had assisted.It was an incident that might exercise considerable influence over his\nfortunes.His patron married, and married to one who certainly did\nnot offer to Mr.Rigby such a prospect of easy management as her\nstep-mother!Here were new influences arising; new characters, new\nsituations, new contingencies.He suddenly\njumps up, hurries to a shelf and takes down a volume.It is his\ninterleaved peerage, of which for twenty years he had been threatening\nan edition.Turning to the Marquisate of Monmouth, he took up his pen\nand thus made the necessary entry:\n\n'_Married, second time, August 3rd, 1837, The Princess Lucretia Colonna,\ndaughter of Prince Paul Colonna, born at Rome, February 16th, 1819._'\n\nThat was what Mr.There was not a\npeerage-compiler in England who had that date save himself.Before we close this slight narrative of the domestic incidents that\noccurred in the family of his grandfather since Coningsby quitted the\nCastle, we must not forget to mention what happened to Villebecque and\nFlora.Lord Monmouth took a great liking to the manager.He found him\nvery clever in many things independently of his profession; he was\nuseful to Lord Monmouth, and did his work in an agreeable manner.And\nthe future Lady Monmouth was accustomed to Flora, and found her useful\ntoo, and did not like to lose her.And so the Marquess, turning all the\ncircumstances in his mind, and being convinced that Villebecque could\nnever succeed to any extent in England in his profession, and probably\nnowhere else, appointed him, to Villebecque's infinite satisfaction,\nintendant of his household, with a considerable salary, while Flora\nstill lived with her kind step-father.Another year elapsed; not so fruitful in incidents to Coningsby as the\npreceding ones, and yet not unprofitably passed.It had been spent in\nthe almost unremitting cultivation of his intelligence.He had read\ndeeply and extensively, digested his acquisitions, and had practised\nhimself in surveying them, free from those conventional conclusions\nand those traditionary inferences that surrounded him.Although he had\nrenounced his once cherished purpose of trying for University honours,\nan aim which he found discordant with the investigations on which his\nmind was bent, he had rarely quitted Cambridge.The society of his\nfriends, the great convenience of public libraries, and the general\ntone of studious life around, rendered an University for him a genial\nresidence.There is a moment in life, when the pride and thirst of\nknowledge seem to absorb our being, and so it happened now to Coningsby,\nwho felt each day stronger in his intellectual resources, and each day\nmore anxious and avid to increase them.The habits of public\ndiscussion fostered by the Debating Society were also for Coningsby no\nInconsiderable tie to the University.This was the arena in which he\nfelt himself at home.The promise of his Eton days was here fulfilled.And while his friends listened to his sustained argument or his\nimpassioned declamation, the prompt reply or the apt retort, they looked\nforward with pride through the vista of years to the time when the hero\nof the youthful Club should convince or dazzle in the senate.It is\nprobable then that he would have remained at Cambridge with slight\nintervals until he had taken his degree, had not circumstances occurred\nwhich gave altogether a new turn to his thoughts.When Lord Monmouth had fixed his wedding-day he had written himself\nto Coningsby to announce his intended marriage, and to request his\ngrandson's presence at the ceremony.The letter was more than kind; it\nwas warm and generous.He assured his grandson that this alliance\nshould make no difference in the very ample provision which he had\nlong intended for him; that he should ever esteem Coningsby his\nnearest relative; and that, while his death would bring to Coningsby as\nconsiderable an independence as an English gentleman need desire, so\nin his lifetime Coningsby should ever be supported as became his birth,\nbreeding, and future prospects.Lord Monmouth had mentioned to Lucretia,\nthat he was about to invite his grandson to their wedding, and the lady\nhad received the intimation with satisfaction.It so happened that a\nfew hours after, Lucretia, who now entered the private rooms of Lord\nMonmouth without previously announcing her arrival, met Villebecque with\nthe letter to Coningsby in his hand.Lucretia took it away from him,\nand said it should be posted with her own letters.Our friend learnt the marriage from the newspapers, which\nsomewhat astounded him; but Coningsby was fond of his grandfather, and\nhe wrote Lord Monmouth a letter of congratulation, full of feeling and\ningenuousness, and which, while it much pleased the person to whom it\nwas addressed, unintentionally convinced him that Coningsby had never\nreceived his original communication.Lord Monmouth spoke to Villebecque,\nwho could throw sufficient light upon the subject, but it was never\nmentioned to Lady Monmouth.The Marquess was a man who always found out\neverything, and enjoyed the secret.Rather more than a year after the marriage, when Coningsby had completed\nhis twenty-first year, the year which he had passed so quietly at\nCambridge, he received a letter from his grandfather, informing him that\nafter a variety of movements Lady Monmouth and himself were established\nin Paris for the season, and desiring that he would not fail to come\nover as soon as practicable, and pay them as long a visit as the\nregulations of the University would permit.So, at the close of the\nDecember term, Coningsby quitted Cambridge for Paris.Passing through London, he made his first visit to his banker at Charing\nCross, on whom he had periodically drawn since he commenced his college\nlife.John journeyed to the bathroom.He was in the outer counting-house, making some inquiries about a\nletter of credit, when one of the partners came out from an inner room,\nand invited him to enter.This firm had been for generations the bankers\nof the Coningsby family; and it appeared that there was a sealed box\nin their possession, which had belonged to the father of Coningsby, and\nthey wished to take this opportunity of delivering it to his son.This\ncommunication deeply interested him; and as he was alone in London, at\nan hotel, and on the wing for a foreign country, he requested permission\nat once to examine it, in order that he might again deposit it with\nthem: so he was shown into a private room for that purpose.The seal was\nbroken; the box was full of papers, chiefly correspondence: among them\nwas a packet described as letters from'my dear Helen,' the mother of\nConingsby.In the interior of this packet there was a miniature of that\nmother.He looked at it; put it down; looked at it again and again.There was the same blue fillet in the bright\nhair.It was an exact copy of that portrait which had so greatly excited\nhis attention when at Millbank!This was a mysterious and singularly\nperplexing incident.He was alone in the room\nwhen he made the discovery.When he had recovered himself, he sealed up\nthe contents of the box, with the exception of his mother's letters and\nthe miniature, which he took away with him, and then re-delivered it to\nhis banker for custody until his return.Coningsby found Lord and Lady Monmouth in a splendid hotel in the\nFaubourg St.His grandfather looked at\nhim with marked attention, and received him with evident satisfaction.Indeed, Lord Monmouth was greatly pleased that Harry had come to Paris;\nit was the University of the World, where everybody should graduate.Paris and London ought to be the great objects of all travellers; the\nrest was mere landscape.It cannot be denied that between Lucretia and Coningsby there existed\nfrom the first a certain antipathy; and though circumstances for a short\ntime had apparently removed or modified the aversion, the manner of the\nlady when Coningsby was ushered into her boudoir, resplendent with all\nthat Parisian taste and luxury could devise, was characterised by that\nfrigid politeness which had preceded the days of their more genial\nacquaintance.If the manner of Lucretia were the same as before her\nmarriage, a considerable change might however be observed in her\nappearance.Her fine form had become more developed; while her dress,\nthat she once neglected, was elaborate and gorgeous, and of the last\nmode.Lucretia was the fashion of Paris; a great lady, greatly admired.A guest under such a roof, however, Coningsby was at once launched\ninto the most brilliant circles of Parisian society, which he found\nfascinating.The art of society is, without doubt, perfectly comprehended and\ncompletely practised in the bright metropolis of France.An Englishman\ncannot enter a saloon without instantly feeling he is among a race more\nsocial than his compatriots.What, for example, is more consummate\nthan the manner in which a French lady receives her guests!She unites\ngraceful repose and unaffected dignity, with the most amiable regard for\nothers.She sees every one; she speaks to every one; she sees them at\nthe right moment; she says the right thing; it is utterly impossible\nto detect any difference in the position of her guests by the spirit in\nwhich she welcomes them.There is, indeed, throughout every circle of\nParisian society, from the chateau to the cabaret, a sincere homage to\nintellect; and this without any maudlin sentiment.None sooner than\nthe Parisians can draw the line between factitious notoriety and honest\nfame; or sooner distinguished between the counterfeit celebrity and\nthe standard reputation.In England, we too often alternate between a\nsupercilious neglect of genius and a rhapsodical pursuit of quacks.In\nEngland when a new character appears in our circles, the first question\nalways is, 'Who is he?'In France it is, 'What is he?'In England, 'How\nmuch a-year?'About a week after Coningsby's arrival in Paris, as he was sauntering on\nthe soft and sunny Boulevards, soft and sunny though Christmas, he met\nSidonia.'Turn now with me, for I see you are\nonly lounging, and tell me when you came, where you are, and what you\nhave done since we parted.I have been here myself but a few days.'And when Coningsby had rapidly related all that\nhad passed, they talked of Paris.Sidonia had offered him hospitality,\nuntil he learned that Lord Monmouth was in Paris, and that Coningsby was\nhis guest.'I am sorry you cannot come to me,' he remarked; 'I would have shown you\neverybody and everything.'I have already seen many remarkable things,' said Coningsby; 'and met\nmany celebrated persons.Nothing strikes me more in this brilliant\ncity than the tone of its society, so much higher than our own.How much conversation, and how little\ngossip!Here all women are as\nagreeable as is the remarkable privilege in London of some half-dozen.Men too, and great men, develop their minds.A great man in England,\non the contrary, is generally the dullest dog in company.And yet, how\npiteous to think that so fair a civilisation should be in such imminent\nperil!'that is a common opinion: and yet I am somewhat sceptical of\nits truth,' replied Sidonia.'I am inclined to believe that the social\nsystem of England is in infinitely greater danger than that of France.We must not be misled by the agitated surface of this country.The\nfoundations of its order are deep and sure.France is a kingdom with a Republic for its capital.It has been always\nso, for centuries.From the days of the League to the days of the\nSections, to the days of 1830.It is still France, little changed; and\nonly more national, for it is less Frank and more Gallic; as England has\nbecome less Norman and more Saxon.''And it is your opinion, then, that the present King may maintain\nhimself?''Every movement in this country, however apparently discordant, seems to\ntend to that inevitable end.He would not be on the throne if the nature\nof things had not demanded his presence.The Kingdom of France required\na Monarch; the Republic of Paris required a Dictator.He comprised in\nhis person both qualifications; lineage and intellect; blood for the\nprovinces, brains for the city.''Tell me,'\nhe added, eagerly, 'what is he?This Prince of whom one hears in all\ncountries at all hours; on whose existence we are told the tranquillity,\nalmost the civilisation, of Europe depends, yet of whom we receive\naccounts so conflicting, so contradictory; tell me, you who can tell me,\ntell me what he is.''I have a creed of mine own,' he\nremarked, 'that the great characters of antiquity are at rare epochs\nreproduced for our wonder, or our guidance.Nature, wearied\nwith mediocrity, pours the warm metal into an heroic mould.When\ncircumstances at length placed me in the presence of the King of France,\nI recognised, ULYSSES!''But is there no danger,' resumed Coningsby, after the pause of a few\nmoments, 'that the Republic of Paris may absorb the Kingdom of France?''I suspect the reverse,' replied Sidonia.'The tendency of advanced\ncivilisation is in truth to pure Monarchy.Monarchy is indeed a\ngovernment which requires a high degree of civilisation for its full\ndevelopment.It needs the support of free laws and manners, and of\na widely-diffused intelligence.Political compromises are not to be\ntolerated except at periods of rude transition.An educated nation\nrecoils from the imperfect vicariate of what is called a representative\ngovernment.Your House of Commons, that has absorbed all other powers\nin the State, will in all probability fall more rapidly than it rose.Public opinion has a more direct, a more comprehensive, a more efficient\norgan for its utterance, than a body of men sectionally chosen.The\nPrinting-press is a political element unknown to classic or feudal\ntimes.It absorbs in a great degree the duties of the Sovereign, the\nPriest, the Parliament; it controls, it educates, it discusses.That\npublic opinion, when it acts, would appear in the form of one who has no\nclass interests.In an enlightened age the Monarch on the throne, free\nfrom the vulgar prejudices and the corrupt interests of the subject,\nbecomes again divine!'At this moment they reached that part of the Boulevards which leads into\nthe Place of the Madeleine, whither Sidonia was bound; and Coningsby was\nabout to quit his companion, when Sidonia said:\n\n'I am only going a step over to the Rue Tronchet to say a few words to a\nfriend of mine, M. P----s. I shall not detain you five minutes; and you\nshould know him, for he has some capital pictures, and a collection of\nLimoges ware that is the despair of the dilettanti.'So saying they turned down by the Place of the Madeleine, and soon\nentered the court of the hotel of M. P----s. That gentleman received\nthem in his gallery.After some general conversation, Coningsby turned\ntowards the pictures, and left Sidonia with their host.The collection\nwas rare, and interested Coningsby, though unacquainted with art.He\nsauntered on from picture to picture until he reached the end of the\ngallery, where an open door invited him into a suite of rooms also\nfull of pictures and objects of curiosity and art.As he was entering\na second chamber, he observed a lady leaning back in a cushioned\nchair, and looking earnestly on a picture.His entrance was unheard and\nunnoticed, for the lady's back was to the door; yet Coningsby, advancing\nin an angular direction, obtained nearly a complete view of her\ncountenance.It was upraised, gazing on the picture with an expression\nof delight; the bonnet thrown back, while the large sable cloak of the\ngazer had fallen partly off.The countenance was more beautiful than the\nbeautiful picture.Those glowing shades of the gallery to which love,\nand genius, and devotion had lent their inspiration, seemed without\nlife and lustre by the radiant expression and expressive presence which\nConingsby now beheld.The finely-arched brow was a little elevated, the soft dark eyes were\nfully opened, the nostril of the delicate nose slightly dilated, the\nsmall, yet rich, full lips just parted; and over the clear, transparent\nvisage, there played a vivid glance of gratified intelligence.The lady rose, advanced towards the picture, looked at it earnestly for\na few moments, and then, turning in a direction opposite to Coningsby,\nwalked away.She was somewhat above the middle stature, and yet could\nscarcely be called tall; a quality so rare, that even skilful dancers\ndo not often possess it, was hers; that elastic gait that is so winning,\nand so often denotes the gaiety and quickness of the spirit.The fair object of his observation had advanced into other chambers,\nand as soon as it was becoming, Coningsby followed her.She had joined a\nlady and gentleman, who were examining an ancient carving in ivory.The\ngentleman was middle-aged and portly; the elder lady tall and elegant,\nand with traces of interesting beauty.Coningsby heard her speak; the\nwords were English, but the accent not of a native.In the remotest part of the room, Coningsby, apparently engaged in\nexamining some of that famous Limoges ware of which Sidonia had spoken,\nwatched with interest and intentness the beautiful being whom he had\nfollowed, and whom he concluded to be the child of her companions.After\nsome little time, they quitted the apartment on their return to the\ngallery; Coningsby remained behind, caring for none of the rare and\nfanciful objects that surrounded him, yet compelled, from the fear of\nseeming obtrusive, for some minutes to remain.Then he too returned\nto the gallery, and just as he had gained its end, he saw the portly\ngentleman in the distance shaking hands with Sidonia, the ladies\napparently expressing their thanks and gratification to M. P----s, and\nthen all vanishing by the door through which Coningsby had originally\nentered.said M. P----s, as Coningsby\napproached him.I am glad to hear it; I have been admiring\nher,' he replied.'Yes,' said M. P----s, 'it is Sir Wallinger: one of your deputies; don't\nyou know him?'said Coningsby, 'no, I have not that honour.''Sir Joseph Wallinger,' said Sidonia, 'one of the new Whig baronets,\nand member for ----.That is not his\ndaughter, but his niece; the child of his wife's sister.It is not easy\nto find any one more beautiful.'END OF BOOK V.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI.CHAPTER I.\n\n\nThe knowledge that Sidonia was in Paris greatly agitated Lady Monmouth.She received the intimation indeed from Coningsby at dinner with\nsufficient art to conceal her emotion.Lord Monmouth himself was quite\npleased at the announcement.Sidonia was his especial favourite; he knew\nso much, had such an excellent judgment, and was so rich.He had always\nsomething to tell you, was the best man in the world to bet on, and\nnever wanted anything.A perfect character according to the Monmouth\nethics.In the evening of the day that Coningsby met Sidonia, Lady Monmouth made\na little visit to the charming Duchess de G----t who was 'at home'\nevery other night in her pretty hotel, with its embroidered white satin\ndraperies, its fine old cabinets, and ancestral portraits of famous\nname, brave marshals and bright princesses of the olden time, on its\nwalls.These receptions without form, yet full of elegance, are what\nEnglish 'at homes' were before the Continental war, though now, by a\ncurious perversion of terms, the easy domestic title distinguishes in\nEngland a formally-prepared and elaborately-collected assembly, in which\neverything and every person are careful to be as little 'homely' as\npossible.In France, on the contrary, 'tis on these occasions, and in\nthis manner, that society carries on that degree and kind of intercourse\nwhich in England we attempt awkwardly to maintain by the medium of\nthat unpopular species of visitation styled a morning call; which all\ncomplain that they have either to make or to endure.Nowhere was this species of reception more happily conducted than at\nthe Duchess de G----t's.Sandra went back to the garden.The rooms, though small, decorated with taste,\nbrightly illumined; a handsome and gracious hostess, the Duke the very\npearl of gentlemen, and sons and daughters worthy of such parents.Every\nmoment some one came in, and some one went away.In your way from a\ndinner to a ball, you stopped to exchange agreeable _on dits_.It seemed\nthat every woman was pretty, every man a wit.Sure you were to find\nyourself surrounded by celebrities, and men were welcomed there, if they\nwere clever, before they were famous, which showed it was a house that\nregarded intellect, and did not seek merely to gratify its vanity by\nbeing surrounded by the distinguished.Enveloped in a rich Indian shawl, and leaning back on a sofa, Lady\nMonmouth was engaged in conversation with the courtly and classic Count\nM----e, when, on casually turning her head, she observed entering the\nsaloon, Sidonia.She just caught his form bowing to the Duchess, and\ninstantly turned her head and replunged into her conversation with\nincreased interest.Lady Monmouth was a person who had the power of\nseeing all about her, everything and everybody, without appearing to\nlook.She was conscious that Sidonia was approaching her neighbourhood.Her heart beat in tumult; she dreaded to catch the eye of that very\nindividual whom she was so anxious to meet.Instinctively, Lady Monmouth turned from the Count, and began\nspeaking earnestly to her other neighbour, a young daughter of the\nhouse, innocent and beautiful, not yet quite fledged, trying her wings\nin society under the maternal eye.She was surprised by the extreme\ninterest which her grand neighbour suddenly took in all her pursuits,\nher studies, her daily walks in the Bois de Boulogne.Sidonia, as the\nMarchioness had anticipated, had now reached the sofa.But no, it was to\nthe Count, and not to Lady Monmouth that he was advancing; and they were\nimmediately engaged in conversation.After some little time, when she\nhad become accustomed to his voice, and found her own heart throbbing\nwith less violence, Lucretia turned again, as if by accident, to the\nCount, and met the glance of Sidonia.She meant to have received him\nwith haughtiness, but her self-command deserted her; and slightly rising\nfrom the sofa, she welcomed him with a countenance of extreme pallor and\nwith some awkwardness.His manner was such as might have assisted her, even had she been more\ntroubled.It was marked by a degree of respectful friendliness.He\nexpressed without reserve his pleasure at meeting her again; inquired\nmuch how she had passed her time since they last parted; asked more than\nonce after the Marquess.The Count moved away; Sidonia took his seat.She expressed to\nhim how kind her Lord would consider his society, for the Marquess had\nsuffered in health since Sidonia last saw him.His periodical gout had\nleft him, which made him ill and nervous.The Marquess received his\nfriends at dinner every day.Sidonia, particularly amiable, offered\nhimself as a guest for the following one.'And do you go to the great ball to-morrow?'inquired Lucretia,\ndelighted with all that had occurred.'I always go to their balls,' said Sidonia, 'I have promised.'There was a momentary pause; Lucretia happier than she had been for a\nlong time, her face a little flushed, and truly in a secret tumult of\nsweet thoughts, remembered she had been long there, and offering her\nhand to Sidonia, bade him adieu until to-morrow, while he, as was his\ncustom, soon repaired to the refined circle of the Countess de C-s-l-ne,\na lady whose manners he always mentioned as his fair ideal, and whose\nhouse was his favourite haunt.Before to-morrow comes, a word or two respecting two other characters\nof this history connected with the family of Lord Monmouth.La Petite was neither very well nor very happy.Her hereditary\ndisease developed itself; gradually, but in a manner alarming to those\nwho loved her.She was very delicate, and suffered so much from the\nweakness of her chest, that she was obliged to relinquish singing.This\nwas really the only tie between her and the Marchioness, who, without\nbeing a petty tyrant, treated her often with unfeeling haughtiness.She\nwas, therefore, now rarely seen in the chambers of the great.In her own\napartments she found, indeed, some distraction in music, for which she\nhad a natural predisposition, but this was a pursuit that only fed\nthe morbid passion of her tender soul.Alone, listening only to sweet\nsounds, or indulging in soft dreams that never could be realised, her\nexistence glided away like a vision, and she seemed to become every day\nmore fair and fragile.hers was the sad and mystic destiny to love\none whom she never met, and by whom, if she met him, she would scarcely,\nperhaps, be recognised.Yet in that passion, fanciful, almost ideal,\nher life was absorbed; nor for her did the world contain an existence,\na thought, a sensation, beyond those that sprang from the image of\nthe noble youth who had sympathised with her in her sorrows, and had\nsoftened the hard fortunes of dependence by his generous sensibility.Happy that, with many mortifications, it was still her lot to live under\nthe roof of one who bore his name, and in whose veins flowed the same\nblood!She felt indeed for the Marquess, whom she so rarely saw, and\nfrom whom she had never received much notice, prompted, it would seem,\nby her fantastic passion, a degree of reverence, almost of affection,\nwhich seemed occasionally, even to herself, as something inexplicable\nand without reason.As for her fond step-father, M. Villebecque, the world fared very\ndifferently with him.His lively and enterprising genius, his ready and\nmultiform talents, and his temper which defied disturbance, had made\ntheir way.He had become the very right hand of Lord Monmouth; his only\ncounsellor, his only confidant; his secret agent; the minister of his\nwill.And well did Villebecque deserve this trust, and ably did he\nmaintain himself in the difficult position which he achieved.There was\nnothing which Villebecque did not know, nothing which he could not do,\nespecially at Paris.He was master of his subject; in all things the\nsecret of success, and without which, however they may from accident\ndazzle the world, the statesman, the orator, the author, all alike feel\nthe damning consciousness of being charlatans.Coningsby had made a visit to M. Villebecque and Flora the day after\nhis arrival.It was a recollection and a courtesy that evidently greatly\ngratified them.John went to the bedroom.Villebecque talked very much and amusingly; and Flora,\nwhom Coningsby frequently addressed, very little, though she listened\nwith great earnestness.Coningsby told her that he thought, from all he\nheard, she was too much alone, and counselled her to gaiety.But nature,\nthat had made her mild, had denied her that constitutional liveliness of\nbeing which is the graceful property of French women.She was a lily of\nthe valley, that loved seclusion and the tranquillity of virgin glades.Almost every day, as he passed their _entresol_, Coningsby would look\ninto Villebecque's apartments for a moment, to ask after Flora.Sidonia was to dine at Lord Monmouth's the day after he met Lucretia,\nand afterwards they were all to meet at a ball much talked of, and\nto which invitations were much sought; and which was to be given that\nevening by the Baroness S. de R----Sandra moved to the bathroom."]

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The girl evidently did not understand him then--though she did a moment\nlater!For without attempting to catch hold of the mustang\'s mane, Grey\nin a single leap threw himself across its back.The animal, utterly\nunprepared, was at first stupefied.But by this time her rider had his\nseat.He felt her sensitive spine arch like a cat\'s beneath him as she\nsprang rocket-wise into the air.Instead of clinging tightly to her flanks\nwith the inner side of his calves, after the old vaquero fashion to\nwhich she was accustomed, he dropped his spurred heels into her sides\nand allowed his body to rise with her spring, and the cruel spur to cut\nits track upward from her belly almost to her back.She dropped like a shot, he dexterously withdrawing his spurs, and\nregaining his seat, jarred but not discomfited.Again she essayed a\nleap; the spurs again marked its height in a scarifying track along her\nsmooth barrel.She tried a third leap, but this time dropped halfway as\nshe felt the steel scraping her side, and then stood still, trembling.There was a sound of applause from the innkeeper and his wife, assisted\nby a lounging vaquero in the corridor.Ashamed of his victory, Grey\nturned apologetically to Cota.To his surprise she glanced indifferently\nat the trickling sides of her favorite, and only regarded him curiously."Ah," she said, drawing in her breath, "you are strong--and you\ncomprehend!""It was only a trick for a trick, senorita," he replied, reddening;\n"let me look after those scratches in the stable," he added, as she was\nturning away, leading the agitated and excited animal toward a shed in\nthe rear.He would have taken the riata which she was still holding, but she\nmotioned him to precede her.He did so by a few feet, but he had\nscarcely reached the stable door before she suddenly caught him roughly\nby the shoulders, and, shoving him into the entrance, slammed the door\nupon him.Amazed and a little indignant, he turned in time to hear a slight sound\nof scuffling outside, and to see Cota re-enter with a flushed face."Pardon, senor," she said quickly, "but I feared she might have kicked\nyou.Rest tranquil, however, for the servant he has taken her away."She pointed to a slouching peon with a malevolent face, who was angrily\ndriving the mustang toward the corral.I almost threw you, too;\nbut," she added, with a dazzling smile, "you must not punish me as you\nhave her!For you are very strong--and you comprehend."But Grey did not comprehend, and with a few hurried apologies he managed\nto escape his fair but uncanny tormentor.Besides, this unlooked-for\nincident had driven from his mind the more important object of his\nvisit,--the discovery of the assailants of Richards and Colonel\nStarbottle.His inquiries of the Ramierez produced no result.Senor Ramierez was not\naware of any suspicious loiterers among the frequenters of the fonda,\nand except from some drunken American or Irish revelers he had been free\nof disturbance.the peon--an old vaquero--was not an angel, truly, but he was\ndangerous only to the bull and the wild horses--and he was afraid even\nof Cota!Grey was fain to ride home empty of information.Daniel travelled to the garden.He was still more concerned a week later, on returning unexpectedly\none afternoon to his sanctum, to hear a musical, childish voice in the\ncomposing-room.She was there, as Richards explained, on his invitation, to\nview the marvels and mysteries of printing at a time when they would\nnot be likely to "disturb Mr.But the beaming face of\nRichards and the simple tenderness of his blue eyes plainly revealed\nthe sudden growth of an evidently sincere passion, and the unwonted\nsplendors of his best clothes showed how carefully he had prepared for\nthe occasion.Grey was worried and perplexed, believing the girl a malicious flirt.Yet nothing could be more captivating than her simple and childish\ncuriosity, as she watched Richards swing the lever of the press,\nor stood by his side as he marshaled the type into files on his\n"composing-stick."He had even printed a card with her name, "Senorita\nCota Ramierez," the type of which had been set up, to the accompaniment\nof ripples of musical laughter, by her little brown fingers.The editor might have become quite sentimental and poetical had he not\nnoticed that the gray eyes which often rested tentatively and meaningly\non himself, even while apparently listening to Richards, were more than\never like the eyes of the mustang on whose scarred flanks her glance had\nwandered so coldly.He withdrew presently so as not to interrupt his foreman\'s innocent\ntete-a-tete, but it was not very long after that Cota passed him on the\nhighroad with the pinto horse in a gallop, and blew him an audacious\nkiss from the tips of her fingers.For several days afterwards Richards\'s manner was tinged with a certain\nreserve on the subject of Cota which the editor attributed to the\ndelicacy of a serious affection, but he was surprised also to find that\nhis foreman\'s eagerness to discuss his unknown assailant had somewhat\nabated.Further discussion regarding it naturally dropped, and the\neditor was beginning to lose his curiosity when it was suddenly awakened\nby a chance incident.An intimate friend and old companion of his--one Enriquez Saltillo--had\ndiverged from a mountain trip especially to call upon him.Enriquez\nwas a scion of one of the oldest Spanish-California families, and in\naddition to his friendship for the editor it pleased him also to affect\nan intense admiration of American ways and habits, and even to combine\nthe current California slang with his native precision of speech--and a\ncertain ironical levity still more his own.It seemed, therefore, quite natural to Mr.Grey to find him seated with\nhis feet on the editorial desk, his hat cocked on the back of his head,\nreading the "Clarion" exchanges.But he was up in a moment, and had\nembraced Grey with characteristic effusion."I find myself, my leetle brother, but an hour ago two leagues from this\nspot!It is the home of Don Pancho--my friend!I shall find him composing the magnificent editorial leader, collecting\nthe subscription of the big pumpkin and the great gooseberry, or gouging\nout the eye of the rival editor, at which I shall assist!\'I hesitate no\nlonger; I fly on the instant, and I am here."Saltillo knew the Spanish population thoroughly--his\nown superior race and their Mexican and Indian allies.If any one could\nsolve the mystery of the Ramierez fonda, and discover Richards\'s unknown\nassailant, it was HE!But Grey contented himself, at first, with a\nfew brief inquiries concerning the beautiful Cota and her anonymous\nassociation with the Ramierez."Of your suspicions, my leetle brother, you are right--on the half!That\nleetle angel of a Cota is, without doubt, the daughter of the adorable\nSenora Ramierez, but not of the admirable senor--her husband.We are a simple, patriarchal race; thees Ramierez, he was the\nMexican tenant of the old Spanish landlord--such as my father--and we\nare ever the fathers of the poor, and sometimes of their children.It\nis possible, therefore, that the exquisite Cota resemble the Spanish\nlandlord.I remember," he went on, suddenly\nstriking his forehead with a dramatic gesture, "the old owner of thees\nranch was my cousin Tiburcio.Of a consequence, my friend, thees angel\nis my second cousin!I shall\nembrace my long-lost relation.I shall introduce my best friend, Don\nPancho, who lofe her.I shall say, \'Bless you, my children,\' and it is\nfeenish!He started up and clapped on his hat, but Grey caught him by the arm."For Heaven\'s sake, Enriquez, be serious for once," he said, forcing him\nback into the chair.The foreman in the other\nroom is an enthusiastic admirer of the girl.In fact, it is on his\naccount that I am making these inquiries.""Ah, the gentleman of the pantuflos, whose trousers will not remain!Sandra moved to the garden.Truly he has the ambition excessif to arrive\nfrom the bed to go to the work without the dress or the wash.But," in\nrecognition of Grey\'s half serious impatience, "remain tranquil.The friend of my friend is ever the\nsame as my friend!He is truly not seducing to the eye, but without\ndoubt he will arrive a governor or a senator in good time.I shall gif\nto him my second cousin.He attempted to rise, but was held down and vigorously shaken by Grey."I\'ve half a mind to let you do it, and get chucked through the window\nfor your pains," said the editor, with a half laugh.This\nis a more serious matter than you suppose."And Grey briefly recounted the incident of the mysterious attacks on\nStarbottle and Richards.Daniel went to the bathroom.As he proceeded he noticed, however, that\nthe ironical light died out of Enriquez\'s eyes, and a singular\nthoughtfulness, yet unlike his usual precise gravity, came over his\nface.He twirled the ends of his penciled mustache--an unfailing sign of\nEnriquez\'s emotion."The same accident that arrive to two men that shall be as opposite as\nthe gallant Starbottle and the excellent Richards shall not prove that\nit come from Ramierez, though they both were at the fonda," he said\ngravely."The cause of it have not come to-day, nor yesterday, nor\nlast week.The cause of it have arrive before there was any gallant\nStarbottle or excellent Richards; before there was any American in\nCalifornia--before you and I, my leetle brother, have lif!The cause\nhappen first--TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO!"The editor\'s start of impatient incredulity was checked by the\nunmistakable sincerity of Enriquez\'s face."It is so," he went on\ngravely; "it is an old story--it is a long story.I shall make him\nshort--and new."He stopped and lit a cigarette without changing his odd expression."It was when the padres first have the mission, and take the heathen and\nconvert him--and save his soul.It was their business, you comprehend,\nmy Pancho?The more heathen they convert, the more soul they save, the\nbetter business for their mission shop.But the heathen do not always\nwish to be \'convert;\' the heathen fly, the heathen skidaddle, the\nheathen will not remain, or will backslide.So the\nholy fathers make a little game.You do not of a possibility comprehend\nhow the holy fathers make a convert, my leetle brother?"They take from the presidio five or six\ndragons--you comprehend--the cavalry soldiers, and they pursue the\nheathen from his little hut.When they cannot surround him and he fly,\nthey catch him with the lasso, like the wild hoss.The lasso catch\nhim around the neck; he is obliged to remain.Sometime he is dead, but the soul is save!I\nsee you wrinkle the brow--you flash the eye; you like it not?Believe\nme, I like it not, neither, but it is so!"He shrugged his shoulders, threw away his half smoked cigarette, and\nwent on."One time a padre who have the zeal excessif for the saving of soul,\nwhen he find the heathen, who is a young girl, have escape the soldiers,\nhe of himself have seize the lasso and flung it!He is lucky; he catch\nher--but look you!She not only fly, but of\na surety she drag the good padre with her!He cannot loose himself, for\nhis riata is fast to the saddle; the dragons cannot help, for he is drag\nso fast.On the instant she have gone--and so have the padre.It is not a young girl he have lasso, but the devil!You comprehend--it\nis a punishment--a retribution--he is feenish!"For every year he must come back a spirit--on a spirit hoss--and swing\nthe lasso, and make as if to catch the heathen.He is condemn ever to\nplay his little game; now there is no heathen more to convert, he catch\nwhat he can.My grandfather have once seen him--it is night and a storm,\nand he pass by like a flash!My grandfather like it not--he is much\ndissatisfied!My uncle have seen him, too, but he make the sign of\nthe cross, and the lasso have fall to the side, and my uncle have much\ngratification.A vaquero of my father and a peon of my cousin have both\nbeen picked up, lassoed, and dragged dead."Many peoples have died of him in the strangling.Sometime he is seen,\nsometime it is the woman only that one sees--sometime it is but the\nhoss.Of a truth, my friend, the\ngallant Starbottle and the ambitious Richards have just escaped!"There was not the slightest\nsuggestion of mischief or irony in his tone or manner; nothing, indeed,\nbut a sincerity and anxiety usually rare with his temperament.It struck\nhim also that his speech had but little of the odd California slang\nwhich was always a part of his imitative levity."Do you mean to say that this superstition is well known?"It is not more difficult to comprehend than your story."With it he seemed to have put on his old\nlevity."Come, behold, it is a long time between drinks!Let us to the\nhotel and the barkeep, who shall give up the smash of brandy and the\njulep of mints before the lasso of Friar Pedro shall prevent us the\nswallow!Grey returned to the "Clarion" office in a much more satisfied\ncondition of mind.Whatever faith he held in Enriquez\'s sincerity, for\nthe first time since the attack on Colonel Starbottle he believed he had\nfound a really legitimate journalistic opportunity in the incident.The\nlegend and its singular coincidence with the outrages would make capital\n"copy."No names would be mentioned, yet even if Colonel Starbottle recognized\nhis own adventure, he could not possibly object to this interpretation\nof it.The editor had found that few people objected to be the hero of\na ghost story, or the favored witness of a spiritual manifestation.Nor\ncould Richards find fault with this view of his own experience, hitherto\nkept a secret, so long as it did not refer to his relations with the\nfair Cota.Summoning him at once to his sanctum, he briefly repeated the\nstory he had just heard, and his purpose of using it.To his surprise,\nRichards\'s face assumed a seriousness and anxiety equal to Enriquez\'s\nown.Grey," he said awkwardly, "and I ain\'t sayin\'\nit ain\'t mighty good newspaper stuff, but it won\'t do NOW, for the whole\nmystery\'s up and the assailant found.""I didn\'t reckon ye were so keen on it," said Richards embarrassedly,\n"and--and--it wasn\'t my own secret altogether.""Go on," said the editor impatiently."Well," said Richards slowly and doggedly, "ye see there was a fool that\nwas sweet on Cota, and he allowed himself to be bedeviled by her to ride\nher cursed pink and yaller mustang.Naturally the beast bolted at once,\nbut he managed to hang on by the mane for half a mile or so, when it\ntook to buck-jumpin\'.The first \'buck\' threw him clean into the road,\nbut didn\'t stun him, yet when he tried to rise, the first thing he\nknowed he was grabbed from behind and half choked by somebody.He was\nheld so tight that he couldn\'t turn, but he managed to get out his\nrevolver and fire two shots under his arm.The grip held on for a\nminute, and then loosened, and the somethin\' slumped down on top o\' him,\nbut he managed to work himself around.And then--what do you think he\nsaw?--why, that thar hoss!with two bullet holes in his neck, lyin\'\nbeside him, but still grippin\' his coat collar and neck-handkercher in\nhis teeth!the rough that attacked Colonel Starbottle, the\nvillain that took me behind when I was leanin\' agin that cursed fence,\nwas that same God-forsaken, hell-invented pinto hoss!"In a flash of recollection the editor remembered his own experience, and\nthe singular scuffle outside the stable door of the fonda.Undoubtedly\nCota had saved him from a similar attack."But why not tell this story with the other?"said the editor, returning\nto his first idea."It won\'t do," said Richards, with dogged resolution."Yes," said Richards, with a darkening face."Again attacked, and by the\nsame hoss!Whether Cota was or was not knowin\' its tricks,\nshe was actually furious at me for killin\' it--and it\'s all over \'twixt\nme and her.""Nonsense," said the editor impulsively; "she will forgive you!You\ndidn\'t know your assailant was a horse WHEN YOU FIRED.Look at the\nattack on you in the road!"Richards shook his head with dogged hopelessness.I oughter guessed it was a hoss then--thar was nothin\' else in\nthat corral.Cota\'s already gone away back to San Jose, and I reckon\nthe Ramierez has got scared of her and packed her off.So, on account\nof its bein\' HER hoss, and what happened betwixt me and her, you see my\nmouth is shut.""And the columns of the \'Clarion\' too," said the editor, with a sigh."I know it\'s hard, sir, but it\'s better so.I\'ve reckoned mebbe she was\na little crazy, and since you\'ve told me that Spanish yarn, it mout\nbe that she was sort o\' playin\' she was that priest, and trained that\nmustang ez she did."After a pause, something of his old self came back into his blue eyes as\nhe sadly hitched up his braces and passed them over his broad shoulders."Yes, sir, I was a fool, for we\'ve lost the only bit of real sensation\nnews that ever came in the way of the \'Clarion.\'"A JACK AND JILL OF THE SIERRAS\n\n\nIt was four o\'clock in the afternoon, and the hottest hour of the day\non that Sierran foothill.The western sun, streaming down the mile-long\n<DW72> of close-set pine crests, had been caught on an outlying ledge of\nglaring white quartz, covered with mining tools and debris, and\nseemed to have been thrown into an incandescent rage.The air above it\nshimmered and became visible.A white canvas tent on it was an object\nnot to be borne; the steel-tipped picks and shovels, intolerable to\ntouch and eyesight, and a tilted tin prospecting pan, falling over,\nflashed out as another sun of insufferable effulgence.At such moments\nthe five members of the "Eureka Mining Company" prudently withdrew to\nthe nearest pine-tree, which cast a shadow so sharply defined on the\nglistening sand that the impingement of a hand or finger beyond that\nline cut like a knife.The men lay, or squatted, in this shadow,\nfeverishly puffing their pipes and waiting for the sun to slip beyond\nthe burning ledge.Yet so irritating was the dry air, fragrant with the\naroma of the heated pines, that occasionally one would start up and walk\nabout until he had brought on that profuse perspiration which gave\na momentary relief, and, as he believed, saved him from sunstroke.Suddenly a voice exclaimed querulously:--\n\n"Derned if the blasted bucket ain\'t empty ag\'in!Not a drop left, by\nJimminy!"A stare of helpless disgust was exchanged by the momentarily uplifted\nheads; then every man lay down again, as if trying to erase himself."I did," said a reflective voice coming from a partner lying comfortably\non his back, "and if anybody reckons I\'m going to face Tophet ag\'in\ndown that <DW72>, he\'s mistaken!"The speaker was thirsty--but he had\nprinciples."We must throw round for it," said the foreman, taking the dice from his\npocket.He cast; the lowest number fell to Parkhurst, a florid, full-blooded\nTexan."All right, gentlemen," he said, wiping his forehead, and lifting\nthe tin pail with a resigned air, "only EF anything comes to me on that\nbare stretch o\' stage road,--and I\'m kinder seein\' things spotty and\nblack now, remember you ain\'t anywhar NEARER the water than you were!I\nain\'t sayin\' it for myself--but it mout be rough on YOU--and"--\n\n"Give ME the pail," interrupted a tall young fellow, rising.Cries of "Good old Ned," and "Hunky boy!"greeted him as he took the\npail from the perspiring Parkhurst, who at once lay down again."You\nmayn\'t be a professin\' Christian, in good standin\', Ned Bray," continued\nParkhurst from the ground, "but you\'re about as white as they make \'em,\nand you\'re goin\' to do a Heavenly Act!I repeat it, gents--a Heavenly\nAct!"Without a reply Bray walked off with the pail, stopping only in the\nunderbrush to pluck a few soft fronds of fern, part of which he put\nwithin the crown of his hat, and stuck the rest in its band around\nthe outer brim, making a parasol-like shade above his shoulders.Thus\nequipped he passed through the outer fringe of pines to a rocky trail\nwhich began to descend towards the stage road.Here he was in the\nfull glare of the sun and its reflection from the heated rocks, which\nscorched his feet and pricked his bent face into a rash.The descent was\nsteep and necessarily slow from the slipperiness of the desiccated pine\nneedles that had fallen from above.Nor were his troubles over when,\na few rods further, he came upon the stage road, which here swept in\na sharp curve round the flank of the mountain, its red dust, ground by\nheavy wagons and pack-trains into a fine powder, was nevertheless so\nheavy with some metallic substance that it scarcely lifted with the\nfoot, and he was obliged to literally wade through it.Yet there were\ntwo hundred yards of this road to be passed before he could reach\nthat point of its bank where a narrow and precipitous trail dropped\ndiagonally from it, to creep along the mountain side to the spring he\nwas seeking.When he reached the trail, he paused to take breath and wipe the\nblinding beads of sweat from his eyes before he cautiously swung\nhimself over the bank into it.A single misstep here would have sent him\nheadlong to the tops of pine-trees a thousand feet below.Holding his\npail in one hand, with the other he steadied himself by clutching the\nferns and brambles at his side, and at last reached the spring--a niche\nin the mountain side with a ledge scarcely four feet wide.He had merely\naccomplished the ordinary gymnastic feat performed by the members of the\nEureka Company four or five times a day!He held his wrists to cool their throbbing pulses in the clear,\ncold stream that gurgled into its rocky basin; he threw the water over\nhis head and shoulders; he swung his legs over the ledge and let the\noverflow fall on his dusty shoes and ankles.Gentle and delicious rigors\ncame over him.He sat with half closed eyes looking across the dark\nolive depths of the canyon between him and the opposite mountain.A hawk\nwas swinging lazily above it, apparently within a stone\'s throw of him;\nhe knew it was at least a mile away.Thirty feet above him ran the stage\nroad; he could hear quite distinctly the slow thud of hoofs, the dull\njar of harness, and the labored creaking of the Pioneer Coach as it\ncrawled up the long ascent, part of which he had just passed.He thought\nof it,--a slow drifting cloud of dust and heat, as he had often seen\nit, abandoned by even its passengers, who sought shelter in the wayside\npines as they toiled behind it to the summit,--and hugged himself in\nthe grateful shadows of the spring.It had passed out of hearing and\nthought, he had turned to fill his pail, when he was startled by a\nshower of dust and gravel from the road above, and the next moment he\nwas thrown violently down, blinded and pinned against the ledge by the\nfall of some heavy body on his back and shoulders.His last flash of\nconsciousness was that he had been struck by a sack of flour slipped\nfrom the pack of some passing mule.It was probably\nnot long, for his chilled hands and arms, thrust by the blow on his\nshoulders into the pool of water, assisted in restoring him.He came\nto with a sense of suffocating pressure on his back, but his head and\nshoulders were swathed in utter darkness by the folds of some soft\nfabrics and draperies, which, to his connecting consciousness, seemed as\nif the contents of a broken bale or trunk had also fallen from the pack.With a tremendous effort he succeeded in getting his arm out of the\npool, and attempted to free his head from its blinding enwrappings.In\ndoing so his hand suddenly touched human flesh--a soft, bared arm!With\nthe same astounding discovery came one more terrible: that arm belonged\nto the weight that was pressing him down; and now, assisted by his\nstruggles, it was slowly slipping toward the brink of the ledge and the\nabyss below!With a desperate effort he turned on his side, caught the\nbody,--as such it was,--dragged it back on the ledge, at the same\nmoment that, freeing his head from its covering,--a feminine skirt,--he\ndiscovered it was a woman!John travelled to the bathroom.She had been also unconscious, although the touch of his cold, wet hand\non her skin had probably given her a shock that was now showing itself\nin a convulsive shudder of her shoulders and a half opening of her eyes.Suddenly she began to stare at him, to draw in her knees and feet toward\nher, sideways, with a feminine movement, as she smoothed out her skirt,\nand kept it down with a hand on which she leaned.She was a tall,\nhandsome girl, from what he could judge of her half-sitting figure in\nher torn silk dust-cloak, which, although its cape and one sleeve were\nsplit into ribbons, had still protected her delicate, well-fitting gown\nbeneath."What--is it?--what has happened?"she said faintly, yet with a slight\ntouch of formality in her manner."You must have fallen--from the road above," said Bray hesitatingly.she repeated, with a slight frown, as if to\nconcentrate her thought.She glanced upward, then at the ledge before\nher, and then, for the first time, at the darkening abyss below.The\ncolor, which had begun to return, suddenly left her face here, and\nshe drew instinctively back against the mountain side."Yes," she half\nmurmured to herself, rather than to him, "it must be so.I was walking\ntoo near the bank--and--I fell!"Then turning to him, she said, "And you\nfound me lying here when you came.""I think," stammered Bray, "that I was here when you fell, and I--I\nbroke the fall."She lifted her handsome gray eyes to him, saw the dust, dirt, and leaves\non his back and shoulders, the collar of his shirt torn open, and a\nfew spots of blood from a bruise on his forehead.Her black eyebrows\nstraightened again as she said coldly, "Dear me!I am very sorry; I\ncouldn\'t help it, you know."But you, are you sure you are not injured?"I\'m not hurt," she said, helping herself to her feet by the aid of the\nmountain-side bushes, and ignoring his proffered hand."But," she\nadded quickly and impressively, glancing upward toward the stage road\noverhead, "why don\'t they come?I must have\nbeen here a long time; it\'s too bad!"Mary journeyed to the hallway."Yes," she said impatiently, "of course!I got out of the coach to walk uphill on the bank under\nthe trees.My foot must have slipped up\nthere--and--I--slid--down.Bray did not like to say he had only just recovered consciousness.But on turning around in her\nimpatience, she caught sight of the chasm again, and lapsed quite white\nagainst the mountain side."Let me give you some water from the spring," he said eagerly, as she\nsank again to a sitting posture; "it will refresh you."Sandra went to the kitchen.He looked hesitatingly around him; he had neither cup nor flask, but he\nfilled the pail and held it with great dexterity to her lips.She drank\na little, extracted a lace handkerchief from some hidden pocket, dipped\nits point in the water, and wiped her face delicately, after a certain\nfeline fashion.Then, catching sight of some small object in the fork of\na bush above her, she quickly pounced upon it, and with a swift sweep\nof her hand under her skirt, put on HER FALLEN SLIPPER, and stood on her\nfeet again."How does one get out of such a place?"she asked fretfully, and then,\nglancing at him half indignantly, "why don\'t you shout?""I was going to tell you," he said gently, "that when you are a little\nstronger, we can get out by the way I came in,--along the trail."He pointed to the narrow pathway along the perilous incline.Somehow,\nwith this tall, beautiful creature beside him, it looked more perilous\nthan before.She may have thought so too, for she drew in her breath\nsharply and sank down again.she asked suddenly, opening her\ngray eyes upon him.she went on, almost\nimpertinently.He stopped, and then it suddenly occurred\nto him that after all there was no reason for his being bullied by this\ntall, good-looking girl, even if he HAD saved her.He gave a little\nlaugh, and added mischievously, "Just like Jack and Jill, you know."she said sharply, bending her black brows at him."Jack and Jill," he returned carelessly; "I broke my crown, you know,\nand YOU,"--he did not finish.She stared at him, trying to keep her face and her composure; but a\nsmile, that on her imperious lips he thought perfectly adorable, here\nlifted the corners of her mouth, and she turned her face aside.But\nthe smile, and the line of dazzling little teeth it revealed, were\nunfortunately on the side toward him.Emboldened by this, he went on,\n"I couldn\'t think what had happened.At first I had a sort of idea that\npart of a mule\'s pack had fallen on top of me,--blankets, flour, and all\nthat sort of thing, you know, until"--\n\nHer smile had vanished."Well," she said impatiently, "until?"I\'m afraid I gave you a shock; my hand was\ndripping from the spring."She  so quickly that he knew she must have been conscious at the\ntime, and he noticed now that the sleeve of her cloak, which had been\nhalf torn off her bare arm, was pinned together over it.When and how\nhad she managed to do it without his detecting the act?"At all events," she said coldly, "I\'m glad you have not received\ngreater injury from--your mule pack.""I think we\'ve both been very lucky," he said simply.She did not reply, but remained looking furtively at the narrow trail."I thought I heard voices," she said, half rising.You say there\'s no use--there\'s only this way out of it!""I might go up first, and perhaps get assistance--a rope or chair," he\nsuggested.she cried, with a horrified glance at the\nabyss.I should be over that ledge before you came back!There\'s a dreadful fascination in it even now.Sandra moved to the office.I think I\'d rather\ngo--at once!I never shall be stronger as long as I stay near it; I may\nbe weaker."She gave a petulant little shiver, and then, though paler and evidently\nagitated, composed her tattered and dusty outer garments in a deft,\nladylike way, and leaned back against the mountain side, He saw her also\nglance at his loosened shirt front and hanging neckerchief, and with a\nheightened color he quickly re-knotted it around his throat.They moved\nfrom the ledge toward the trail."But it\'s only wide enough for ONE, and I never--NEVER--could even stand\non it a minute alone!""We will go together, side by side," he\nsaid quietly, "but you will have to take the outside.""I shall keep hold of you," he explained; "you need not fear that.He untied the large bandanna silk handkerchief\nwhich he wore around his shoulders, knotted one end of it firmly to his\nbelt, and handed her the other."Do you think you can hold on to that?""I--don\'t know,"--she hesitated.Daniel journeyed to the garden.He pointed']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"I have the honor to be your affectionate Servant,\n\n"ALESSANDRA GAVAZZI.""The Roman parliament decreed the erection of a pillar opposite the\npalace of the Inquisition, to perpetuate the memory of the destruction\nof that nest of abominations; but before that or any other monument\ncould be raised, the French army besieged and took the city, restored\nthe Pope, and with him the tribunal of the faith.Achilli thrown into one of its old prisons, on the 29th of July 1849,\nbut the violence of the people having made the building less adequate\nto the purpose of safe keeping, he was transferred to the castle of\nSt.Angelo, which had often been employed for the custody of similar\ndelinquents, and there he lay in close confinement until the 9th of\nJanuary, 1850, when the French authorities, yielding to influential\nrepresentations from this country assisted him to escape in disguise as\na soldier, thus removing an occasion of scandal, but carefully leaving\nthe authority of the congregation of cardinals undisputed.Indeed\nthey first obtained the verbal sanction of the commissary, who saw it\nexpedient to let his victim go, and hush an outcry."Yet some have the hardihood to affirm that there is no longer any\nInquisition; and as the Inquisitors were instructed to suppress the\ntruth, to deny their knowledge of cases actually passing through their\nhands, and to fabricate falsehoods for the sake of preserving the\nSECRET, because the secret was absolutely necessary to the preservation\nof their office, so do the Inquisitors in partibus falsify and illude\nwithout the least scruple of conscience, in order to put the people of\nthis country off their guard."That the Inquisition really exists, is placed beyond a doubt by its\ndaily action as a visible institution at Rome.But if any one should\nfancy that it was abolished after the release of Dr.Achilli, let him\nhear a sentence contradictory, from a bull of the Pope himself, Pius IX,\na document that was dated at Rome, August 22, 1851, where the pontiff,\ncondemning the works of Professor Nuytz, of Turin, says, "after having\ntaken the advice of the doctors in theology and canon law, AFTER HAVING\nCOLLECTED THE SUFFRAGES OF OUR VENERABLE BROTHERS THE CARDINALS OF THE\nCONGREGATION OF THE SUPREME AND UNIVERSAL INQUISITION."And so recently\nas March, 1852, by letters of the Secretariate of State, he appointed\nfour cardinals to be "members of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy\nRoman and Universal Inquisition;" giving incontrovertible evidence that\nprovision is made for attending to communications of Inquisitors in\npartibus from all parts of the world.As the old cardinals die off,\ntheir vacant seats are filled by others.The \'immortal legion\' is\npunctually recruited."After all, have we in Great Britain, Ireland and the colonies, and our\nbrethren of the foreign mission stations, any reason to apprehend harm\nto, ourselves from the Inquisition as it is?In reply to this question,\nlet it be observed;\n\n"1.That there are Inquisitors in partibus is not to be denied.That\nletters of these Inquisitors are laid before the Roman Inquisition is\nequally certain.Even in the time of Leo XII, when the church of\nRome was far less active in the British empire than it is now, some\nparticular case was always decided on Thursday, when the Pope, in his\ncharacter of universal Inquisitor, presided in the congregation.It\ncannot be thought that now, in the height of its exultation, daring and\naggression, this congregation has fewer emissaries, or that they are\nless active, or less communicative than they were at that time.We\nalso see that the number is constantly replenished.The cardinals Della\nGenga-Sermattei; De Azevedo; Fornari; and Lucciardi have just been added\nto it.Besides a cardinal in England, and a delegate in Ireland, there is\nboth in England and Ireland, a body of bishops, \'natural Inquisitors,\'\nas they are always acknowledged, and have often claimed to be; and these\nnatural Inquisitors are all sworn to keep the secret--the soul of the\nInquisition.Since, then, there are Inquisitors in partibus, appointed\nto supply the lack of an avowed and stationary Inquisition, and since\nthe bishops are the very persons whom the court of Rome can best\ncommand, as pledged for such a service, it is reasonable to suppose they\nact in that capacity.Some of the proceedings of these bishops confirm the assurance that\nthere is now an Inquisition in activity in England.* * * The vigilance\nexercised over families, also the intermeddling of priests with\neducation, both in families and schools, and with the innumerable\nrelations of civil society, can only be traced back to the Inquisitors\nin partibus, whose peculiar duty, whether by help of confessors or\nfamiliars, is to worm out every secret of affairs, private or public,\nand to organize and conduct measures of repression or of punishment.Where the secular arm cannot be borrowed, and where offenders lie beyond\nthe reach of excommunication, irregular methods must be resorted to,\nnot rejecting any as too crafty or too violent.Discontented mobs, or\nindividual zealots are to be found or bought.What part the Inquisitors\nin partibus play in Irish assassinations, or in the general mass of\nmurderous assaults that is perpetrated in the lower haunts of crime,\nit is impossible to say.Under cover of confessional and Inquisitorial\nsecrets, spreads a broad field of action--a region of mystery--only\nvisible to the eye of God, and to those\'most reverend and most eminent\'\nguardians of the papacy, who sit thrice every week, in the Minerva\nand Vatican, and there manage the hidden springs of Inquisition on the\nheretics, schismatics, and rebels, no less than on \'the faithful\'\nof realms.Who can calculate the extent of their power over those\n\'religious houses,\' where so many of the inmates are but neophytes,\nunfitted by British education for the intellectual and moral abnegation,\nthe surrender of mind and conscience, which monastic discipline\nexacts?Yet they must be coerced into submission, and kept under penal\ndiscipline.Who can tell how many of their own clergy are withdrawn\nto Rome, and there delated, imprisoned, and left to perish, if not\n\'relaxed\' to death, in punishment of heretical opinions or liberal\npractices?We have heard of laymen, too, taken to Rome by force, or\ndecoyed thither under false pretences there to be punished by the\nuniversal Inquisition; and whatever of incredibility may appear in some\ntales of Inquisitorial abduction, the general fact that such abductions\nhave taken place, seems to be incontrovertible.And now that the\nInquisitors in partibus are distributed over Christendom, and that they\nprovide the Roman Inquisition with daily work from year\'s end to year\'s\nend, is among the things most certain,--even the most careless of\nEnglishmen must acknowledge that we have all reason to apprehend much\nevil from the Inquisition as it is.And no Christian can be aware of\nthis fact, without feeling himself more than ever bound to uphold\nthe cause of christianity, both at home and abroad, as the only\ncounteractive of so dire a curse, and the only remedy of so vast an\nevil."E. A. Lawrence, writing of "Romanism at Rome," gives us the\nfollowing vivid description of the present state of the Roman Church."Next is seen at Rome the PROPAGANDA, the great missionary heart of the\nwhole masterly system.Noiselessly, by the multiform orders of monks and\nnuns, as through so many veins and arteries, it sends out and receives\nback its vital fluid.In its halls, the whole world is distinctly\nmapped out, and the chief points of influence minutely marked.A kind of\ntelegraphic communication is established with the remotest stations in\nSouth Africa and Siberia, and with almost every nook in our own land,\nto which the myrmidons of Papal power look with the most of fear.It\nis through means of this moral galvanic battery, set up in the Vatican,\nthat the Church of Rome has gained its power of UBIQUITY--has so well\nnigh made itself OMNIPOTENT, as well as omnipresent."It is no mean or puny antagonist that strides across the path of a\nfree, spiritual and advancing Protestantism.And yet, with a simple\nshepherd\'s sling, and the smooth stones gathered from Siloa\'s brook, God\nwill give it the victory."Once more let us look, and we shall find at Rome, still working in its\ndark, malignant efficiency, the INQUISITION.Men are still made to pass\nthrough fires of this Moloch.This is the grand defensive expedient of\nthe Papacy, and is the chief tribunal of the States.Its processes are\nall as secret as the grave.Its cells are full of dead men\'s bones.They\ncall it the Asylum for the poor--a retreat for doubting and distressed\npilgrims, where they may have experience of the parental kindness of\ntheir father the Pope, and their mother the church.Achilli had a trial of this beneficient discipline, when thrown\ninto the deep dungeon of St.And how many other poor victims of\nthis diabolical institution are at this moment pining in agony, heaven\nknows."In America, we talk about Rome as having ceased to persecute.She holds to the principle as tenaciously as ever.Of the evil spirit of Protestantism she says, "This\nkind goeth not out, but by fire."Hence she must hold both the principle and the power of persecution, of\ncompelling men to believe, or, if they doubt, of putting them to death\nfor their own good.Take from her this power and she bites the dust."It may perchance be said that the remarks of the Rev.William Rule,\nquoted above, refer exclusively to the existing state of things is\nEngland, Ireland, and the colonies.But who will dare to say, after a\ncareful investigation of the subject, that they do not apply with equal\nforce to these United States?Has America nothing to fear from the inquisitors--from the Jesuits?Is\nit true that the "Inquisition still exists in Rome--that its code is\nunchanged--that its emissaries are sent over all the world--that every\nnuncio and bishop is an Inquisitor," and is it improbable that, even\nnow, torture rooms like those described in the foregoing story, may be\nfound in Roman Catholic establishments in this country?Yes, even here,\nin Protestant, enlightened America!Have WE then nothing to fear from\nRomanism?But a few days since a gentleman of learning and intelligence\nwhen speaking of this subject, exclaimed, "What have we to do with the\nJesuits?The idea that we have aught\nto fear from Romanism, is simply ridiculous!"In reply to this, allow\nme to quote the language of the Rev.Manuel J. Gonsalves, leader of the\nMadeira Exiles."The time will come when the American people will arise as one man, and\nnot only abolish the confessional, but will follow the example of many\nof the European nations, who had no peace, or rest, till they banished\nthe Jesuits.These are the men, who bask in the sunbeams of popery, to\nwhom the pope has entrusted the vast interests of the king of Rome, in\nthis great Republic.Nine tenths of the Romish priests, now working hard\nfor their Master the pope, in this country, are full blooded Jesuits.The man of sin who is the head of the mystery of iniquity--through\nthe advice of the popish bishops now in this country, has selected\nthe Jesuitical order of priests, to carry on his great and gigantic\noperations in the United States of America.Those Jesuits who\ndistinguish themselves the most in the destruction of Protestant Bible\nreligion, and who gain the largest number of protestant scholars for\npopish schools and seminaries; who win most American converts to their\nsect are offered great rewards in the shape of high offices in the\nchurch.John Hughes, the Jesuit Bishop of the New York Romanists, was\nrewarded by Pope Pius 9th, with an Archbishop\'s mitre, for his great,\nzeal and success, in removing God\'s Holy Bible from thirty-eight public\nschools in New York, and for procuring a papal school committee, to\nexamine every book in the hands of American children in the public\nschools, that every passage of truth, in those books of history\nunpalatable to the pope might be blotted out."Has America then nothing\nto do with Romanism?But another gentleman exclaims, "What if Romanism be on the increase in\nthe United States!Is not their religion as dear to them, as ours is\nto us?"Mary went to the garden.M. J. Gonsalves would reply as follows.Daniel moved to the bathroom."The\nAmerican people have been deceived, in believing THAT POPERY WAS A\nRELIGION, not a very good one to be sure, but some kind of one.We might as well call the Archbishop of the\nfallen angels, and his crew, a religious body of intelligent beings,\nbecause they believe in an Almighty God, and tremble, as to call the man\nof sin and his Jesuits, a body of religious saints.Sandra went to the bedroom.The tree is known\nby its fruit, such as \'love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness,\ngoodness, meekness, faith, temperance, brotherly kindness;\' and where\nthe spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, Christian liberty, giving\nto God and man their due unasked.Now we ask, what kind of fruit does\nthe tree of Popery bear, in any country, that it should claim homage,\nand respect, as a good religion?"Such is the language of one who knew so well what popery was, that he\nfled from it as from a hell upon earth.In his further remarks upon the horrors of convent life in the United\nStates, he fully confirms the statements in the foregoing narrative.He\nsays, "It is time that American gentlemen, who are so much occupied\nin business, should think of the dangers of the confessional, and the\nmiseries endured by innocent, duped, American, imprisoned females in\nthis free country; and remember that these American ladies who have been\nduped and enticed by Jesuitical intrigue and craft, into their female\nconvents, have no means of deliverance; they cannot write a letter to a\nfriend without the consent and inspection of the Mother Abbess, who\nis always and invariably a female tyrant, a creature in the pay of the\nBishop, and dependent upon the Bishop for her despotic office of power.The poor, unfortunate, imprisoned American female has no means of\nredress in her power.She cannot communicate her story of wrong and\nsuffering to any living being beyond the walls of her prison.She may\nhave a father, a mother, a dear brother, or a sister, who, if they knew\none-sixteenth part of her wrongs and sufferings, would fly at once to\nsee her and sympathize with her in her anguish.But the Jesuit confessor\nattached to the prison is ever on the alert.Those ladies who appear the\nmost unhappy, and unreconciled to their prison, are compelled to attend\nthe confessional every day; and thus the artful Jesuit, by a thousand\ncross questions, is made to understand perfectly the state of their\nminds.The Lady Porter, or door-keeper and jailor, is always a creature\nof the priest\'s, and a great favorite with the Mother Abbess.Should any\nfriends call to see an unhappy nun who is utterly unreconciled to her\nfate, the Lady Porter is instructed to inform those relatives that the\ndear nun they want to see so much, is so perfectly happy, and given up\nto heavenly meditations, that she cannot be persuaded to see an earthly\nrelative.At the same time the Mother Abbess dismisses the relatives\nwith a very sorrowful countenance, and regrets very much, in appearance,\ntheir disappointment.But the unhappy nun is never informed that her\nfriends or relatives have called to inquire after her welfare.How\namazing, that government should allow such prisons in the name of\nreligion!"CONVENT OF THE CAPUCHINS IN SANTIAGO\n\nIn a late number of "The American and Foreign Christian Union," we find\nthe following account of conventual life from a report of a Missionary\nin Chile, South America.Mary went back to the kitchen."Now, my brother, let me give you an account related to me by a most\nworthy English family, most of the members of which have grown up in the\ncountry, confirmed also by common report, of the Convent of Capuchins,\nin Santiago."The number of inmates is limited to thirty-two young ladies.The\nadmittance fee is $2000.When the nun enters she is dressed like a\nbride, in the most costly material that wealth can command.There,\nbeside the altar of consecration, she devotes herself in the most\nsolemn, manner to a life of celibacy and mortification of the flesh\nand spirit, with the deluded hope that her works will merit a brighter\nmansion in the realms above."The forms of consecration being completed, she begins to cast off\nher rich veil, costly vestments, all her splendid diamonds and\nbrilliants--which, in many instances, have cost, perhaps, from ten to\nfifteen, or even twenty thousand dollars.Then her beautiful locks are\nsubmitted to the tonsure; and to signify her deadness forever to the\nworld, she is clothed in a dress of coarse grey cloth, called serge, in\nwhich she is to pass the miserable remnant of her days.The dark sombre\nwalls of her prison she can sever pass, and its iron-bound doors are\nshut forever upon their new, youthful, and sensitive occupant.Rarely,\nif ever, is she permitted to speak, and NEVER, NEVER, to see her friends\nor The loved ones of home--to enjoy the embraces of a fond mother, or\ndevoted father, or the smiles of fraternal or sisterly affection.If\never allowed to speak at all, it is through iron bars where she cannot\nbe seen, and in the presence of the abbess, to see that no complaint\nescapes her lips.However much her bosom may swell with anxiety at the\nsound of voices which were once music to her soul, and she may long to\npour out her cries and tears to those who once soothed every sorrow of\nher heart; yet not a murmur must be uttered.The soul must suffer\nits own sorrows solitary and alone, with none to sympathize, or grant\nrelief, and none to listen to its moans but the cold gloomy walls of her\ntomb.No, no, not even the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that great alleviator\nof all the sorrows of the heart, is allowed an entrance there.Besides being condemned to a meagre, insufficient\nand unwholesome diet which they themselves must cook, the nuns are\nnot allowed to speak much with each other, except to say, \'Que morir\ntenemos, \'we are to die,\' or \'we must die,\' and to reply, \'Ya los\nsabemos,\' \'we know it,\' or \'already we know it\'\n\n"They pass most of their time in small lonely cells, where they sleep in\na narrow place dug out in the ground, in the shape of a coffin, without\nbed of any kind, except a piece of coarse serge spread down; and their\ndaily dress is their only covering.\'Tired\nnature\'s sweet restorer, balmy sleep, no more with his downy pinions\nlights on his unsullied with a tear:\' FOR EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY-FOUR\nthey are aroused by the bell to perform their \'Ave Maria\'s,\' count their\nrosaries, and such other blind devotions as may be imposed.Thus they\ndrag out a miserable existence, and when death calls the spirit to its\nlast account, the other nuns dig the grave with their own hands, within\nthe walls of the convent, and so perform the obsequies of their departed\nsister."Thus, I have briefly given you not fiction!but a faithful narrative\nof facts in regard to conventual life, and an establishment marked by\nalmost every form of sin, and yet making pretence of \'perfecting the\nsaints,\' by the free and gentle influences of the gospel of Christ.What is done with the rich vestments and jewels?Where do the priests get all their brilliants to perform high mass\nand adorn their processions?Where does all the hair of the saints come from, which is sold in\nlockets for high prices as sure preventives of evil?Whose grave has been plundered to obtain RELICS to sell to the\nignorant.Where does the Romish Church obtain her SURPLUS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO\nSELL TO THE needy, and not give it like our blessed Lord, \'without money\nand without price?\'Who is responsible for the FANATICISM that induces a young female\nto incarcerate herself?Where is the authority in reason, in revelation, for such a life?"A young lady lately cast herself from the tower, and was dashed in\npieces, being led to do it, doubtless, in desperation.The convents of\nthis city, of the same order, require the same entrance fee, $2000.Of\ncourse, none but the comparatively rich can avail themselves of this\nperfection of godliness."Who will say that this mode of life has not been invented in order to\ncut short life as rapidly as possible, that the $2000, with all the rich\ndiamonds upon initiation, may be repeated as frequently as possible?how true it is, that Romanism is the same merciless, cruel,\ndiabolical organisation, wherever it can fully develop itself, in\nall lands.Sandra went to the bathroom.How truly is it denominated by the pen of inspiration the\n\'MYSTERY OF INIQUITY,\' especially that part of it relating to these\nsecret institutions, and the whole order of the Jesuits."The editor of the "Christian Union", in his remarks on the above, says,\n"Already the fair face of our country is disfigured by the existence\nhere and there of conventual establishments.At present they do not\nshow the hideous features which they, at least in some cases, assume in\ncountries where papal influence and authority are supreme.The genius of\nour government and institutions necessarily exerts a restraining power,\nwhich holds them from excesses to which, otherwise, they might run.But\nthey constitute a part of a system which is strongly at variance with\nthe interests of humanity, and merely wait the occurrence of favorable\ncircumstances to visit upon our land all the horrors which they have\ninflicted elsewhere."How many conventual establishments there are now in the nation, few\nProtestants, it is believed, know.And how many young females, guilty of\nno crime against society, and condemned by no law of the land, are shut\nup in their walls and doomed to a life which they did not anticipate\nwhen entering them, a life which is more dreadful to them than death,\nvery few of the millions of our citizens conceive.The majority of our\npeople have slept over the whole subject, and the indifference thus\nmanifested has emboldened the priests to posh forward the extension\nof the system, and the workmen are now busy in various places in\nthe construction of additional establishments.But such facts as are\nrevealed in this article, from the pen of our missionary, in connection\nwith things that are occurring around us, show that no time should be\nlost in examining this whole subject of convents and monasteries, and in\nlegislating rightly about them."Again, when speaking of papal convents in the United States, the same\ntalented writer observes, "The time has fully come when Protestants\nshould lay aside their apathy and too long-cherished indifference in\nrespect to the movements of Rome in this land.It is time for them to\ncall to mind the testimony of their fathers, their bitter experiences\nfrom the papal See, and to take effective measures to protect the\ninheritance bequeathed to them, that they may hand it down to their\nchildren free from corruption, as pure and as valuable as when they\nreceived it.They should remember that Rome claims never to change, that\nwhat she was in Europe when in the zenith of her power, she will be here\nwhen fairly installed, and has ability to enforce her commands."Her numbers now on our soil, her nearly two thousand priests moving\nabout everywhere, her colleges and printing-presses, her schools and\nconvents, and enormous amounts of property held by her bishops, have\nserved as an occasion to draw out something of her spirit, and to show\nthat she is ARROGANT AND ABUSIVE TO THE EXTENT OF HER POWER."Scarcely a newspaper issues from her press, but is loaded with abuse of\nProtestants and of their religion, and at every available point assaults\nare made upon their institutions and laws; and Rome and her institutions\nand interests are crowded into notice, and special privileges are loudly\nclamored for."All Protestants, therefore, of every name, and of every religious and\npolitical creed, we repeat it, who do not desire to ignore the past, and\nto renounce all care or concern for the future, as to their children and\nchildren\'s children, should lose no time in informing themselves of\nthe state of things around them in regard to the papacy and its\ninstitutions.They should without delay devote their efforts and\ninfluence to the protection of the country against those Popish\nestablishments and their usages which have been set up among us without\nthe authority of law, and under whose crushing weight some of the\nnations of Europe have staggered and reeled for centuries, and have now\nbut little of their former power and glory remaining, and under which\nMexico, just upon our borders, has sunk manifestly beyond the power of\nrecovery."Let each individual seek to awaken an interest in this matter in\nthe mind of his neighbor.And if there be papal establishments in\nthe neighborhood under the names of\'schools,\'\'retreats\',\'religions\ncommunities,\' or any other designation, which are at variance with, or\nare not conformed to, the laws of the commonwealth in which they are\nsituated, let memorials be prepared and signed by the citizens, and\nforwarded immediately to the legislature, praying that they may be\nsubjected to examination, and required to conform to the laws by which\nall Protestant institutions of a public nature are governed."Let us exclude from our national territory all irresponsible\ninstitutions.Let us seek to maintain a government of law, and insist\nupon the equality of all classes before it."In closing these extracts, we beg leave to express ourselves in the\nwords of the Rev.Sunderland, of Washington city, in a sermon\ndelivered before the American and Foreign Christian Union, at its\nanniversary in May, 1856.Mary moved to the bathroom."But new it is asked, \'Why all this tirade against Roman Catholics?\'It is not against the unhappy millions that are\nground down under the iron heel of that enormous despotism.They are of\nthe common humanity, our brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh.They need the same light instruction and salvation that we need.Like\nourselves they need the one God, the one mediator between God and man,\nthe man Christ Jesus; and from the heart we love and pity them.We would\ngrant them all the privileges which we claim to ourselves.Daniel moved to the kitchen.We can have\nno animosity towards them as men and candidates with ourselves for the\ncoming judgment.But it is the system under which they are born, and\nlive, and die, I repeat, which we denounce, and when we shall cease to\noppose it, then let our right hand forget her cunning, and our tongue\ncleave to the roof of our mouth.What is it but a dark and terrible\npower on earth before which so many horrible memories start up?Why,\nsir, look at it!We drag the bones of the grim behemoth out to view, for\nwe would not have the world forget his ugliness nor the terror he has\ninspired.\'A tirade against Romanism,\' is it?O sir, we remember\nthe persecutions of Justinian; we remember the days of the Spanish\nInquisition; we remember the reign of \'the Bloody Mary;\' we remember\nthe revocation of the Edict of Nantes; we remember St.Bartholomew;\nwe remember the murdered Covenanters, Huguenots, and Piedmontese; we\nremember the noble martyrs dying for the testimony of the faith along\nthe ancient Rhine; we remember the later wrath which pursued the\nislanders of Madeira, till some of them sought refuge upon these\nshores; we remember the Madiai, and we know how the beast ever seeks to\npropagate his power, by force where he can, by deception where he must.And when we remember these things, we must protest against the further\nvigor and prosperity of this grand Babylon of all.Take it, then, tirade\nand all, for so ye must, ye ministers of Rome, sodden with the fumes of\nthat great deep of abominations!The voice of the Protestant shall never\nbe hushed; the spirit of Reformation shall never sleep.O, lands of\nFarel and of Calvin, of Zwingle and of Luther!O countries where the\ntrumpet first sounded, marshalling the people to this fearful contest!We have heard the blast rolling still louder down the path of three\nhundred years, and in our solid muster-march we come, the children\nof the tenth generation.We come a growing phalanx, not with carnal\nweapons, but with the armor of the gospel, and wielding the sword of\ntruth on the right hand and on the left, we say that ANTICHRIST MUST\nFALL.Hear it, ye witnesses, and mark the word; by the majesty of the\ncoming kingdom of Jesus, and by the eternal purpose of Jehovah, THIS\nANTICHRIST MUST FALL."But as they neared a building high,\n    Surprise was shown in every eye.They heard the strains of music sweet,\n    And tripping of the dancers\' feet;\n    While o\'er the tap of heel and toe,\n    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,\n    Arose the clear and ringing call\n    Of those who had control of all.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,\n    Then gathered closely round the place,\n            To study out some way to win\n            A peep or two at those within.Said one: "In matters of this kind\n            Opinions differ, you will find.And some might say, with sober thought,\n            That children should not thus be taught\n            To hop around on toe and heel\n            So actively to fiddle\'s squeal,\n                For fear \'twould turn their minds away\n                From graver duties of the day."Another said: "The dancing art\n                Doth ease to every move impart.It gives alike to city-bred\n                And country-born a graceful tread,\n            And helps them bear themselves along\n            Without offense in greatest throng.The nimble step, the springing knee,\n    And balanced body all agree.The feet, my friends, may glide with grace\n    As well as trudge from place to place.And in the parlor or without\n    They best can stand or walk about\n    Who found in early life a chance\n    To mingle in the sprightly dance."[Illustration]\n\n    The Brownies need no ladders long,\n    No hoists, nor elevators strong,\n    To lift them to an upper flight,\n    A window-sill, or transom light.The weather-vane upon the spire,\n    That overlooks the town entire,\n    Is not too high above the base\n    If fancy leads them to the place.\'Tis said the very fleecy clouds\n    They can bestride in eager crowds,\n    Around the world their way to find,\n    And leave the lagging winds behind.Said one: "We\'ve scaled the dizzy heights\n    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,\n    And crossed the stream from shore to shore\n    Where but the string-piece stretched before;\n    And cunning Brownies, never fear,\n    Will find some way to enter here."[Illustration]\n\n    When once the Brownies\' plans were laid,\n    No formal, tiresome speech was made.In mystic ways, to Brownies known,\n    They clambered up the walls of stone.They clung to this and that, like briers,\n    They climbed the smooth electric wires;\n    Some members lending ready aid\n    To those who weaker nerves displayed.And in five minutes at the most,\n    By vine, by bracket, and by post,\n    By every scroll, and carving bold,\n    That toes could touch or fingers hold\n    They made their way, and gained a chance\n    To view, unnoticed, every danceMary travelled to the bedroom.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Said one: "How pleasant is the sight\n    To see those children young and bright\n    While skipping blithely to and fro,\n    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,\n    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,\n    And lightly moving at command--\n\n[Illustration]\n\n        Like butterflies through balmy air\n        When summer spreads attractions fair,\n    And blends with every whispering breeze\n    The drowsy hum of working bees."[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    Another said: "When this is o\'er\n    The Brownie Band will take the floor.John went back to the office.We\'ll bide our time and not be slow\n            To take possession when they go.Then up and down the spacious hall\n              We\'ll imitate the steps of all.We\'ll show that not in Frenchmen\'s bones\n              Lies all the grace that nature owns;\n              That others at the waltz can shine\n              As well as Germans from the Rhine;\n            That we some capers can enjoy\n            As well as natives of Savoy."[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n            While thus they talked, the moments flew,\n            And soon the master\'s task was through.When children\'s cloaks were wrapped around,\n    And heavier shoes their feet had found\n    They hastened home; but while they slept\n    The Brownies in that building crept\n    To take their turn at lively reel,\n            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,\n            Till all the dances people know,\n              From Cuba\'s palms to Russia\'s snow\n              Were tried, and soon in every case\n              Were mastered with surprising grace.Imagine how they skipped about,\n              And how they danced, with laugh and shout![Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    No sooner had the Brownies run\n    Into the hall than \'twas begun.Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,\n    The music in the strings awoke.The violins to others fell,\n    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,\n    Until the sweet and stirring air\n    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.Mary moved to the bathroom.Like people in the spring of life,\n    Of joys and countless blessings rife,\n    Who yield themselves to Pleasure\'s hand--\n    So danced that night the Brownie Band.First one would take his place to show\n    The special step for heel or toe,\n    Just how to edge about with care,\n    And help around the partner fair,\n    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--\n    To cause confusion and distress.John journeyed to the hallway.Then more would play the master\'s part,\n    And give some lessons in the art:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n        Would show the rest some figures new\n        From Turkey, China, or Peru.Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,\n    Then bob around, as if on springs,\n    Until the sprightly steps would call\n    Loud acclamations from them all.They danced in twos with skip and bound,\n    They danced in circles, round and round;\n    They danced in lines that coiled about\n    As runs the serpent in and out,\n    Some moving slow, some standing still--\n    More cutting capers with a will.At length, by joining hand in hand,\n    The set included all the band.A happier crowd was never seen\n    On ball-room floor or village green.By turns they danced, by turns would go\n    And try their skill at string and bow--\n    They almost sawed the fiddle through,\n    So fast the bow across it flew.And louder still the harp would ring,\n    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.John went to the bathroom.Alike they seemed a skillful band\n    Upon the floor or music-stand.The night wore on, from hour to hour,\n    And still they danced with vim and power;\n    For supple-kneed and light of toe\n    The Brownies are, as well you know,\n    And such a thing as tiring out\n    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.As long as darkness hung her pall\n    In heavy folds around the hall,\n    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,\n    Until the very break of day.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    To dance the figures o\'er and o\'er,\n    They lingered on the polished floor;\n    No sooner was one party done\n    Than others the position won.They chose their partners for the set,\n    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    As night advanced, and morning gray\n    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,\n    The lively Brownies faster flew,\n    Across and back, around and through;\n    Now down the center, up the side,\n    Then back to place with graceful glide--\n                  Until it seemed that even day\n                  Would hardly drive the band away.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                  At length some, more upon their guard\n                  Against surprises, labored hard\n    To urge their comrades from the place\n    Before the sun would show his face.They pulled and hauled with all their might\n    At those half crazy with delight,\n                  Who still would struggle for a chance\n                  To have, at least, another dance--\n                  Some figure that was quite forgot,\n                          Although "the finest of the lot."Another wished to linger still--\n                          In spite of warning words--until\n                          Each member present on the floor\n                          Had been his partner twice or more.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes\n                Of morn began to paint the skies,\n                And, one by one, the stars of night\n                Grew pale before the morning\'s light.Alone, bright Venus, in the west,\n                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;\n                While from the hedge the piping note\n                Of waking birds began to float;\n    And crows upon the wooded hills\n    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,\n    When Brownies scampered from the place,\n    And undertook the homeward race.Nor made a halt in street or square,\n    Or verdant park, however fair;\n    But farther from the sight of man\n    And light of day, they quickly ran.They traveled at their highest speed,\n    And swiftly must they go, indeed;\n    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,\n    The rays of light began to steal\n    Still higher up the eastern sky,\n    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BROWNIES\' CANDY-PULL.[Illustration]\n\n    One evening, while the Brownies sat\n    Enjoying free and friendly chat,\n    Some on the trees, some on the ground,\n    And others perched on fences round--\n    One Brownie, rising in his place,\n    Addressed the band with beaming face.The listeners gathered with delight\n    Around the member, bold and bright,\n    To hear him tell of scenes he\'d spied\n    While roaming through the country wide."Last eve," said he, "to shun the blast,\n    Behind a cottage fence I passed.While there, I heard a merry rout,\n    And as the yard was dark without,\n    I crawled along through weeds and grass,\n    Through melon-vines and broken glass,\n    Until I might, unnoticed, win\n    A glimpse of all the sport within.At length, below the window-pane,\n                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;\n                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind\n                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find\n    The facts I can relate in full\n    About that lively candy-pull.Sandra went to the garden.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    "An hour or more, I well believe,\n    I stood, their actions to perceive,\n    With elbows resting on the sill,\n    And nose against the window still.I watched them closely at their fun,\n    And learned how everything was done.Sandra went back to the office.The younger members took the lead,\n    And carried on the work with speed.With nimble feet they ran about\n    From place to place, with laugh and shout;\n    But older heads looked on the while,\n    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,\n    And gave advice in manner kind\n    To guide the inexperienced mind.They placed the sugar in a pot,\n    And stirred it round till boiling hot;\n    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,\n    And stretched it out in shining bands,\n    Until it reached across the floor,\n    From mantel-piece to kitchen door."These eyes of mine for many a night\n    Have not beheld a finer sight.To pull the candy was the part\n    Of some who seemed to know the art.The moon had slipped behind the hill,\n    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;\n    But still, with nose against the pane,\n    I kept my place through wind and rain.There, perched upon the shaky pile,\n    With bated breath I gazed the while.I watched them with the sharpest sight\n    That I might tell the tale aright;\n    For all the active youngsters there\n    Appeared to have of work their share.Some put fresh sugar in the pot,\n    Some kept the fire blazing hot,\n    And worked away as best they could\n    To keep the stove well filled with wood.Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,\n    At moving here and there at will,\n    Would have to \'lively\' be and \'tear\n    Around\' to beat those children there!Some cut it up, more passed it round,\n    While others ate it by the pound!"[Illustration]\n\n    At this, a murmur of surprise\n    On every side began to rise;\n    Then smiles o\'er every visage flitted,\n    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,\n    That told what train of thought had sped\n    At once through every Brownie\'s head--\n    A thought of pleasure near at hand\n    That well would suit the cunning band.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n            The Brownies act without delay\n            When new ideas cross their way,\n            And soon one raised a finger small\n            And close attention gained from all.They crowded near with anxious glance\n            To learn what scheme he could advance--\n    What methods mention or employ\n    To bring about the promised joy.Said he: "A vacant house is near.The owner leaves it every year\n    For several months, and pleasure seeks\n    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.The range is there against the wall,\n            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,\n            While cans of syrup may be found\n            In every grocer\'s store around.The Brownie must be dull and tame,\n            And scarce deserves to bear the name,\n            Who will not join with heart and hand\n            To carry out a scheme so grand."[Illustration]\n\n    Another cried: "When to his bed\n    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,\n    Again we\'ll muster in full force\n    And to that building turn our course."[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n            Next eve they gained the street at last\n            That through the silent city passed;\n            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised\n            And on the vacant mansion gazed.In vain the miser hides his store,\n    In vain the merchant bars his door,\n    In vain the locksmith changes keys--\n    The Brownies enter where they please.Through iron doors, through gates of brass,\n    And walls of stone they safely pass,\n    And smile to think how soon they can\n    Upset the studied schemes of man.Within that house, without delay,\n    Behind the guide they worked their way,\n    More happy far and full of glee\n    Than was the owner, out at sea.The whale, the shark, or fish that flies\n    Had less attraction for his eyes\n    Than had the shining candy-balls\n    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.Soon coal was from the cellar brought\n    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;\n    Then pots and pans came rattling in\n    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.Just where the syrup had been found\n    It matters not.The cunning band was soon possessed\n    Of full supplies and of the best;\n    Next tablespoons of silver fine\n    In every hand appeared to shine,\n    And ladles long, of costly ware,\n    That had been laid away with care.No sooner was the syrup hot\n    Than some around the kettle got,\n    And dabbed away in eager haste\n    To be the first to get a taste.Then some were scalded when the spoon\n    Let fall its contents all too soon,\n            And gave the tongue too warm a mess\n            To carry without some distress.Then steps were into service brought\n            That dancing-masters never taught,\n            And smothered cries and swinging hand\n            Would wake the wonder of the band.And when the candy boiled until\n            It could be pulled and hauled at will,\n    Take every shape or twist, and seem\n    As free as fancy in a dream,\n    The busy, happy-hearted crew\n    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.The Brownies in the building stayed\n    And candy ate as fast as made.But when at length the brightening sky\n    Gave warning they must homeward fly,\n    They quickly sought the open air\n    And had but little time to spare.The shortest way, as often found,\n    Was o\'er the roughest piece of ground,\n    Where rocks as large as houses lay\n    All scattered round in wild array.Some covered o\'er with clinging vines,\n    Some bearing up gigantic pines,\n    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,\n    For centuries had stood the blast.But over all the rugged ground\n    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,\n    Now jumping clear from block to block,\n    Now sliding down the shelving rock,\n    Or cheering on the lagging kind\n    Who here and there would fall behind.[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTHE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                One night the Brownies found their way\n                To where some tracks and switches lay,\n                And buildings stood, such as are found\n    In every town on railroad ground.They moved about from place to place,\n    With prying eyes and cautious pace\n    They peeped in shops and gained a view,\n    Where cars were standing bright and new;\n    While others, that had service known,\n    And in some crash were overthrown,\n    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,\n    Were undergoing full repairs.The table that turns end for end\n            Its heavy load, without a bend,\n            Was next inspected through and through\n            And tested by the wondering crew.They scanned the signal-lights with care\n            That told the state of switches there,--\n            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,\n            Or simply to some siding led.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n                Then round a locomotive strong\n                They gathered in an earnest throng,\n                Commenting on the style it showed,\n                Its strength and speed upon the road.Said one: "That \'pilot\' placed before\n                Will toss a cow a block or more;\n            You\'d hardly find a bone intact\n            When such a thing her frame has racked--\n            Above the fence, and, if you please,\n            Above the smoke-stack and the trees\n            Will go the horns and heels in air,\n            When hoisted by that same affair.""Sometimes it saves," another cried,\n            "And throws an object far aside\n            That would to powder have been ground,\n            If rushing wheels a chance had found.I saw a goat tossed from the track\n            And landed on a farmer\'s stack,\n            And though surprised at fate so strange,\n            He seemed delighted at the change;\n            And lived content, on best of fare,\n            Until the farmer found him there."Another said: "We\'ll have some fun\n    And down the road this engine run.The steam is up, as gauges show;\n    She\'s puffing, ready now to go;\n    The fireman and the engineer\n    Are at their supper, in the rear\n    Of yonder shed.I took a peep,\n    And found the watchman fast asleep.So now\'s our time, if we but haste,\n    The joys of railway life to taste.I know the engine-driver\'s art,\n    Just how to stop, reverse, and start;\n    I\'ve watched them when they little knew\n    From every move I knowledge drew;\n    We\'ll not be seen till under way,\n    And then, my friends, here let me say,\n    The man or beast will something lack\n    Who strives to stop us on the track."Then some upon the engine stepped,\n    And some upon the pilot crept,\n    And more upon the tender found\n    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled\n    At speed \'twas fearful to behold;\n    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,\n    At least at mile-a-minute rate;\n    And even where the curves were short\n    The engine turned them with a snort\n    That made the Brownies\' hearts the while\n    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run\n    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out\n    To choke with dust that whirled about,\n    And so could neither growl nor bark\n    Till they had vanished in the dark;\n    Some pigs that wandered late at night,\n    And neither turned to left nor right,\n        But on the crossing held debate\n        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,\n        Were helped above the fence to rise\n        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,\n        And never after cared to stray\n        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n        But when a town was just in sight,\n        And speed was at its greatest height,--\n        Alas!that such a thing should be,--\n        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go\n                        Into the weeds and ditch below;\n                        But many on the engine stayed\n                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall\n                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,\n                        And brakes to every wheel applied;\n                        The locomotive forward flew,\n                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place\n                Where trouble met them face to face,\n    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,\n    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,\n    The automatic switch was closed,\n    A safety signal-light exposed,\n    And they were free to roll ahead,\n    And wait for those who\'d leaped in dread;\n    Although the end seemed near at hand\n    Of every Brownie in the band,\n    And darkest heads through horrid fright\n    Were in a moment changed to white,\n    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,\n    And some were sprained about the toes,\n    While more were scraped upon the nose;\n    But all were able to succeed\n    In climbing to a place with speed,\n    And there they stayed until once more\n    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side\n    The Brownies scampered off to hide;\n    And as they crossed the trestle high\n    The sun was creeping up the sky,\n    And urged them onward in their race\n    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTHE BROWNIES\' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]\n\n    It was the season of the year\n    When people, dressed in fancy gear,\n    From every quarter hurried down\n    And filled the largest halls in town;\n    And there to flute and fiddle sweet\n    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note\n    That fun indeed was now afloat;\n    And ere the season passed away,\n    Of longest night and shortest day,\n    They looked about to find a hall\n    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found\n    Where all the band can troop around;\n    But want of costumes, much I fear,\n    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--\n    Don\'t show a weak and hopeless mind\n    Because your knowledge is confined,--\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    For I\'m prepared to take the band\n    To costumes, ready to the hand,\n    Of every pattern, new or old:\n    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,\n    The cloak and plume of belted knight,\n    The pilgrim\'s hat and stockings white,\n    The dresses for the ladies fair,\n    The gems and artificial hair,\n    The soldier-suits in blue and red,\n    The turban for the Tartar\'s head,\n    All can be found where I will lead,\n    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]\n\n    Those knowing best the Brownie way\n    Will know there was no long delay,\n    Ere to the town he made a break\n    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,\n    That hills were high or winds were strong;\n    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,\n    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    The costumes, though a world too wide,\n    And long enough a pair to hide,\n    Were gathered in with skill and care,\n    That showed the tailor\'s art was there.Then out they started for the hall,\n    In fancy trappings one and all;\n    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;\n    And some like kings; and more like clowns;\n    And Highlanders, with naked knees;\n    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;\n    While many members in the line\n    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,\n    And swept along the polished floor\n    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]\n\n    By happy chance some laid their hand\n    Upon the outfit of a band;\n    The horns and trumpets took the lead,\n    Supported well by string and reed;\n    And violins, that would have made\n    A mansion for the rogues that played,\n    With flute and clarionet combined\n    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see\n    They passed the hours in greatest glee;\n    Familiar figures all were lost\n    In flowing robes that round them tossed;\n    And well-known faces hid behind\n    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,\n    Enjoyed a light fandango there;\n    While solemn monks of gentle heart,\n    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,\n                The bobbing up and down, like birds,\n                The lively skip, the stately glide,\n                The double turn, and twist aside\n                Were introduced in proper place\n                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,\n    Too long they tarried in the hall,\n    And morning caught them on the fly,\n    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,\n            By walls and stumps they made their way;\n            And not until the evening\'s shade\n            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTHE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]\n\n    While Brownies strayed along a pier\n    To view the shipping lying near,\n    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;\n    \'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red\n    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,\n    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she\'s on the go;\n    Now with a laden scow in tow,\n    And next with barges two or three,\n    Then taking out a ship to sea,\n    Or through the Narrows steaming round\n    In search of vessels homeward bound;\n    She\'s stanch and true']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["This is\nmentioned in Vasari, p.47; and though not expressly there said to be\nby Leonardo, is so placed as to make it doubtful whether it was or not._A Nun, half length_, by Leonardo, in the possession of Abbate\nNicolini[i183]._Two fine heads_, painted in oil by Leonardo, bought at Florence by\nSig.Bali di Breteuil, ambassador from Malta to Rome.One of these,\nrepresenting a woman, was in his first manner.The other, a Virgin, in\nhis last[i184]._A Leda_, which Lomazzo says was at Fontainebleau, and did not yield in\ncolouring to the portrait of Joconda in the Duke's gallery.Richardson\nsays it was in the palace Mattei[i185]._The head of a dead man_, with all its minute parts, painted by\nLeonardo, formerly in the Mattei palace, but no longer there[i186].A picture containing a study of _two most delicate female heads_, in\nthe Barberini palace at Rome[i187]._A portrait of a girl with a book in her hand_, in the Strozzi palace\nin Rome[i188]._The Dispute of Jesus with the Doctors_, half length, in the Panfili\npalace[i189].Five pictures in the Ambrosian library at Milan, the subjects not\nmentioned[i190].Some in the gallery of the archbishopric at Milan, the number and\nsubjects equally unnoticed[i191].One picture in the sacristy of Santa Maria, near St.Celsus at\nMilan[i192]._A small head of Christ_, while a youth, mentioned by Lomazzo.Probably\nthis may be the study for the picture of Jesus disputing with the\nDoctors, at the Panfili palace[i193].Michael with a man kneeling_, in the King of France's\ncollection[i194]._A Bacchus_, in the same collection[i195]._The fair Ferraia_, in the same collection[i196]._A portrait of a lady_, there also[i197]._A Christ with a globe in his hand_[i198].A very fine picture, half\nlength, now in the possession of Richard Troward, Esq.This was engraven by Hollar in 1650, in aqua fortis[i199]._The Fall of Phaeton_, in the gallery of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, of\nwhich Scannelli speaks, but it is mentioned by no one else[i200].Catherine with a palm-branch_, in the gallery of the Duke of\nModena[i201]._The head of a young man armed_, in the same collection, very graceful,\nbut inferior to the St._A portrait of the Queen of Naples_, which was in the Aldobrandini\ngallery, but afterwards to be found in a chamber of portraits in the\nPanfili palace.It is not equal in colouring to the Dispute of Jesus\nwith the Doctors[i203]._A portrait in profile of the Dutchess of Milan_, mentioned by\nRichardson as being in a chamber leading to the Ambrosian library[i204]._A beautiful figure of the Virgin, half length_, in the palace of\nVaprio.It is of a gigantic size, for the head of the Virgin is\nsix common palms in size, and that of the Divine Infant four in\ncircumference.Della Valle speaks of having seen this in the year 1791,\nand says he is not ignorant that tradition ascribes this Madonna to\nBramante, notwithstanding which he gives it to Leonardo[i205]._A laughing Pomona with three veils_, commended by Lomazzo.It was done\nfor Francis I. King of France[i206]._The portrait of Cecilia Gallarani_, mentioned by Bellincione in one of\nhis sonnets, as painted by Leonardo[i207]._Another of Lucrezia Cavelli_, a celebrated performer on the lute,\nascribed to him on the same authority.Copies of both this and the\nformer may be seen at Milan[i208]._Our Saviour before Pilate_, in the church of S. Florentino, at\nAmboise.It is thought that the carton only of this was Leonardo's, and\nthat the picture was painted by Andrea Salai, or Melzi[i209]._A portrait of Leonardo_ by himself, half length, in the Ambrosian\nlibrary at Milan[i210].Della Valle has inserted a copy of this before\nthe Supplement to Leonardo's Life, in his edition of Vasari, for\nwhich purpose Sig.Pagave transmitted him a drawing from the original\npicture.But Leonardo's own drawing for the picture itself, is in the\npossession of his Britannic Majesty, and from that Mr.Chamberlaine\nhas prefixed to his publication before mentioned, a plate engraven by\nBartolozzi.A\n\n                               TREATISE,\n\n                                 _&c._\n\n\n\n\n                               DRAWING.I./--_What the young Student in Painting ought in the first\nPlace to learn._\n\n\n/The/ young student should, in the first place, acquire a knowledge\nof perspective, to enable him to give to every object its proper\ndimensions: after which, it is requisite that he be under the care of\nan able master, to accustom him, by degrees, to a good style of drawing\nthe parts.Next, he must study Nature, in order to confirm and fix in\nhis mind the reason of those precepts which he has learnt.He must also\nbestow some time in viewing the works of various old masters, to form\nhis eye and judgment, in order that he may be able to put in practice\nall that he has been taught[1].II./--_Rule for a young Student in Painting._\n\n\n/The/ organ of sight is one of the quickest, and takes in at a single\nglance an infinite variety of forms; notwithstanding which, it cannot\nperfectly comprehend more than one object at a time.For example, the\nreader, at one look over this page, immediately perceives it full of\ndifferent characters; but he cannot at the same moment distinguish each\nletter, much less can he comprehend their meaning.He must consider it\nword by word, and line by line, if he be desirous of forming a just\nnotion of these characters.In like manner, if we wish to ascend to\nthe top of an edifice, we must be content to advance step by step,\notherwise we shall never be able to attain it.A young man, who has a natural inclination to the study of this art,\nI would advise to act thus: In order to acquire a true notion of the\nform of things, he must begin by studying the parts which compose\nthem, and not pass to a second till he has well stored his memory, and\nsufficiently practised the first; otherwise he loses his time, and will\nmost certainly protract his studies.And let him remember to acquire\naccuracy before he attempts quickness.III./--_How to discover a young Man's Disposition for Painting._\n\n\n/Many/ are very desirous of learning to draw, and are very fond of it,\nwho are, notwithstanding, void of a proper disposition for it.This may\nbe known by their want of perseverance; like boys, who draw every thing\nin a hurry, never finishing, or shadowing.John travelled to the kitchen.IV./--_Of Painting, and its Divisions._\n\n\n/Painting/ is divided into two principal parts.The first is the figure,\nthat is, the lines which distinguish the forms of bodies, and their\ncomponent parts.The second is the colour contained within those limits.V./--_Division of the Figure._\n\n\n/The/ form of bodies is divided into two parts; that is, the proportion\nof the members to each other, which must correspond with the whole; and\nthe motion, expressive of what passes in the mind of the living figure.VI./--_Proportion of Members._\n\n\n/The/ proportion of members is again divided into two parts, viz.By equality is meant (besides the measure\ncorresponding with the whole), that you do not confound the members\nof a young subject with those of old age, nor plump ones with those\nthat are lean; and that, moreover, you do not blend the robust and firm\nmuscles of man with feminine softness: that the attitudes and motions\nof old age be not expressed with the quickness and alacrity of youth;\nnor those of a female figure like those of a vigorous young man.The\nmotions and members of a strong man should be such as to express his\nperfect state of health.VII./--_Of Dimensions in general._\n\n\n/In/ general, the dimensions of the human body are to be considered\nin the length, and not in the breadth; because in the wonderful works\nof Nature, which we endeavour to imitate, we cannot in any species\nfind any one part in one model precisely similar to the same part in\nanother.Let us be attentive, therefore, to the variation of forms,\nand avoid all monstrosities of proportion; such as long legs united\nto short bodies, and narrow chests with long arms.Observe also\nattentively the measure of joints, in which Nature is apt to vary\nconsiderably; and imitate her example by doing the same.VIII./--_Motion, Changes, and Proportion of Members._\n\n\n/The/ measures of the human body vary in each member, according as it\nis more or less bent, or seen in different views, increasing on one\nside as much as they diminish on the other.IX./--_The Difference of Proportion between Children and grown\nMen._\n\n\n/In/ men and children I find a great difference between the joints of\nthe one and the other in the length of the bones.A man has the length\nof two heads from the extremity of one shoulder to the other, the same\nfrom the shoulder to the elbow, and from the elbow to the fingers; but\nthe child has only one, because Nature gives the proper size first to\nthe seat of the intellect, and afterwards to the other parts.X./--_The Alterations in the Proportion of the human Body from\nInfancy to full Age._\n\n\n/A man/, in his infancy, has the breadth of his shoulders equal to the\nlength of the face, and to the length of the arm from the shoulder\nto the elbow, when the arm is bent[2].It is the same again from the\nlower belly to the knee, and from the knee to the foot.But, when a\nman is arrived at the period of his full growth, every one of these\ndimensions becomes double in length, except the face, which, with\nthe top of the head, undergoes but very little alteration in length.A well-proportioned and full-grown man, therefore, is ten times the\nlength of his face; the breadth of his shoulders will be two faces, and\nin like manner all the above lengths will be double.The rest will be\nexplained in the general measurement of the human body[3].XI./--_Of the Proportion of Members._\n\n\n/All/ the parts of any animal whatever must be correspondent with\nthe whole.So that, if the body be short and thick, all the members\nbelonging to it must be the same.One that is long and thin must have\nits parts of the same kind; and so of the middle size.Something of the\nsame may be observed in plants, when uninjured by men or tempests; for\nwhen thus injured they bud and grow again, making young shoots from old\nplants, and by those means destroying their natural symmetry.XII./--_That every Part be proportioned to its Whole._\n\n\n/If/ a man be short and thick, be careful that all his members be\nof the same nature, viz.short arms and thick, large hands, short\nfingers, with broad joints; and so of the rest.XIII./--_Of the Proportion of the Members._\n\n\n/Measure/ upon yourself the proportion of the parts, and, if you find\nany of them defective, note it down, and be very careful to avoid it in\ndrawing your own compositions.For this is reckoned a common fault in\npainters, to delight in the imitation of themselves.XIV./--_The Danger of forming an erroneous Judgment in regard to\nthe Proportion and Beauty of the Parts._\n\n\n/If/ the painter has clumsy hands, he will be apt to introduce them\ninto his works, and so of any other part of his person, which may not\nhappen to be so beautiful as it ought to be.He must, therefore, guard\nparticularly against that self-love, or too good opinion of his own\nperson, and study by every means to acquire the knowledge of what is\nmost beautiful, and of his own defects, that he may adopt the one and\navoid the other.XV./--_Another Precept._\n\n\n/The/ young painter must, in the first instance, accustom his hand to\ncopying the drawings of good masters; and when his hand is thus formed,\nand ready, he should, with the advice of his director, use himself also\nto draw from relievos; according to the rules we shall point out in the\ntreatise on drawing from relievos[4].XVI./--_The Manner of drawing from Relievos, and rendering Paper\nfit for it._\n\n\n/When/ you draw from relievos, tinge your paper of some darkish\ndemi-tint.And after you have made your outline, put in the darkest\nshadows, and, last of all, the principal lights, but sparingly,\nespecially the smaller ones; because those are easily lost to the eye\nat a very moderate distance[5].XVII./--_Of drawing from Casts or Nature._\n\n\n/In/ drawing from relievo, the draftsman must place himself in such a\nmanner, as that the eye of the figure to be drawn be level with his\nown[6].XVIII./--_To draw Figures from Nature._\n\n\n/Accustom/ yourself to hold a plummet in your hand, that you may judge\nof the bearing of the parts.XIX./--_Of drawing from Nature._\n\n\n/When/ you draw from Nature, you must be at the distance of three times\nthe height of the object; and when you begin to draw, form in your own\nmind a certain principal line (suppose a perpendicular); observe well\nthe bearing of the parts towards that line; whether they intersect, are\nparallel to it, or oblique.XX./--_Of drawing Academy Figures._\n\n\n/When/ you draw from a naked model, always sketch in the whole of the\nfigure, suiting all the members well to each other; and though you\nfinish only that part which appears the best, have a regard to the\nrest, that, whenever you make use of such studies, all the parts may\nhang together.In composing your attitudes, take care not to turn the head on the same\nside as the breast, nor let the arm go in a line with the leg[7].If\nthe head turn towards the right shoulder, the parts must be lower on\nthe left side than on the other; but if the chest come forward, and the\nhead turn towards the left, the parts on the right side are to be the\nhighest.XXI./--_Of studying in the Dark, on first waking in the Morning,\nand before going to sleep._\n\n\n/I have/ experienced no small benefit, when in the dark and in bed, by\nretracing in my mind the outlines of those forms which I had previously\nstudied, particularly such as had appeared the most difficult to\ncomprehend and retain; by this method they will be confirmed and\ntreasured up in the memory.XXII./--_Observations on drawing Portraits._\n\n\n/The/ cartilage, which raises the nose in the middle of the face,\nvaries in eight different ways.It is equally straight, equally\nconcave, or equally convex, which is the first sort.Or, secondly,\nunequally straight, concave, or convex.Or, thirdly, straight in the\nupper part, and concave in the under.Or, fourthly, straight again\nin the upper part, and convex in those below.Or, fifthly, it may be\nconcave and straight beneath.Or, sixthly, concave above, and convex\nbelow.Or, seventhly, it may be convex in the upper part, and straight\nin the lower.And in the eighth and last place, convex above, and\nconcave beneath.The uniting of the nose with the brows is in two ways, either it is\nstraight or concave.It is\nstraight, concave, or round.The first is divided into two parts, viz.it is either convex in the upper part, or in the lower, sometimes both;\nor else flat above and below.XXIII./--_The Method of retaining in the Memory the Likeness of\na Man, so as to draw his Profile, after having seen him only once._\n\n\n/You/ must observe and remember well the variations of the four\nprincipal features in the profile; the nose, mouth, chin, and forehead.And first of the nose, of which there are three different sorts[8],\nstraight, concave, and convex.Of the straight there are but four\nvariations, short or long, high at the end, or low.Of the concave\nthere are three sorts; some have the concavity above, some in the\nmiddle, and some at the end.The convex noses also vary three ways;\nsome project in the upper part, some in the middle, and others at the\nbottom.Nature, which seems to delight in infinite variety, gives again\nthree changes to those noses which have a projection in the middle; for\nsome have it straight, some concave, and some convex.XXIV./--_How to remember the Form of a Face._\n\n\n/If/ you wish to retain with facility the general look of a face, you\nmust first learn how to draw well several faces, mouths, eyes, noses,\nchins, throats, necks, and shoulders; in short, all those principal\nparts which distinguish one man from another.For instance, noses are\noften different sorts[9].Straight, bunched, concave, some raised\nabove, some below the middle, aquiline, flat, round, and sharp.In the front view there are eleven different sorts.Even, thick in the middle, thin in the middle, thick at the tip, thin\nat the beginning, thin at the tip, and thick at the beginning.Broad,\nnarrow, high, and low nostrils; some with a large opening, and some\nmore shut towards the tip.The same variety will be found in the other parts of the face, which\nmust be drawn from Nature, and retained in the memory.Or else, when\nyou mean to draw a likeness from memory, take with you a pocket-book,\nin which you have marked all these variations of features, and after\nhaving given a look at the face you mean to draw, retire a little\naside, and note down in your book which of the features are similar to\nit; that you may put it all together at home.XXV./--_That a Painter should take Pleasure in the Opinion of\nevery body._\n\n\n/A painter/ ought not certainly to refuse listening to the opinion of\nany one; for we know that, although a man be not a painter, he may have\njust notions of the forms of men; whether a man has a hump on his back,\na thick leg, or a large hand; whether he be lame, or have any other\ndefect.Now, if we know that men are able to judge of the works of\nNature, should we not think them more able to detect our errors?XXVI./--_What is principally to be observed in Figures._\n\n\n/The/ principal and most important consideration required in drawing\nfigures, is to set the head well upon the shoulders, the chest upon the\nhips, the hips and shoulders upon the feet.XXVII./--_Mode of Studying._\n\n\n/Study/ the science first, and then follow the practice which results\nfrom that science.Pursue method in your study, and do not quit one\npart till it be perfectly engraven in the memory; and observe what\ndifference there is between the members of animals and their joints[10].XXVIII./--_Of being universal._\n\n\n/It/ is an easy matter for a man who is well versed in the principles\nof his art, to become universal in the practice of it, since all\nanimals have a similarity of members, that is, muscles, tendons, bones,\n&c. These only vary in length or thickness, as will be demonstrated\nin the Anatomy[11].As for aquatic animals, of which there is great\nvariety, I shall not persuade the painter to take them as a rule,\nhaving no connexion with our purpose.XXIX./--_A Precept for the Painter._\n\n\n/It/ reflects no great honour on a painter to be able to execute only\none thing well, such as a head, an academy figure, or draperies,\nanimals, landscape, or the like, confining himself to some particular\nobject of study; because there is scarcely a person so void of genius\nas to fail of success, if he apply earnestly to one branch of study,\nand practise it continually.XXX./--_Of the Measures of the human Body, and the bending of\nMembers._\n\n\n/It/ is very necessary that painters should have a knowledge of\nthe bones which support the flesh by which they are covered, but\nparticularly of the joints, which increase and diminish the length of\nthem in their appearance.As in the arm, which does not measure the\nsame when bent, as when extended; its difference between the greatest\nextension and bending, is about one eighth of its length.The increase\nand diminution of the arm is effected by the bone projecting out of\nits socket at the elbow; which, as is seen in figure A B, Plate I. is\nlengthened from the shoulder to the elbow; the angle it forms being\nless than a right angle.It will appear longer as that angle becomes\nmore acute, and will shorten in proportion as it becomes more open or\nobtuse._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.XXXI./--_Of the small Bones in several Joints of the human Body._\n\n\n/There/ are in the joints of the human body certain small bones, fixed\nin the middle of the tendons which connect several of the joints.Such\nare the patellas of the knees, and the joints of the shoulders, and\nthose of the feet.They are eight in number, one at each shoulder, one\nat each knee, and two at each foot under the first joint of the great\ntoe towards the heel.These grow extremely hard as a man advances in\nyears.XXXII./--_Memorandum to be observed by the Painter._\n\n\n/Note/ down which muscles and tendons are brought into action by the\nmotion of any member, and when they are hidden.Remember that these\nremarks are of the greatest importance to painters and sculptors, who\nprofess to study anatomy, and the science of the muscles.Do the same\nwith children, following the different gradations of age from their\nbirth even to decrepitude, describing the changes which the members,\nand particularly the joints, undergo; which of them grow fat, and which\nlean.XXXIII./--_The Shoulders._\n\n\n/The/ joints of the shoulders, and other parts which bend, shall be\nnoticed in their places in the Treatise on Anatomy, where the cause\nof the motions of all the parts which compose the human body shall be\nexplained[12].XXXIV./--_The Difference of Joints between Children and grown\nMen._\n\n\n/Young/ children have all their joints small, but they are thick and\nplump in the spaces between them; because there is nothing upon the\nbones at the joints, but some tendons to bind the bones together.The\nsoft flesh, which is full of fluids, is enclosed under the skin in the\nspace between the joints; and as the bones are bigger at the joints\nthan in the space between them, the skin throws off in the progress to\nmanhood that superfluity, and draws nearer to the bones, thinning the\nwhole part together.But upon the joints it does not lessen, as there\nis nothing but cartilages and tendons.For these reasons children are\nsmall in the joints, and plump in the space between, as may be observed\nin their fingers, arms, and narrow shoulders.Men, on the contrary, are\nlarge and full in the joints, in the arms and legs; and where children\nhave hollows, men are knotty and prominent.XXXV./--_Of the Joints of the Fingers._\n\n\n/The/ joints of the fingers appear larger on all sides when they\nbend; the more they bend the larger they appear.It is the same in the toes, and it will be more\nperceptible in proportion to their fleshiness.XXXVI./--_Of the Joint of the Wrist._\n\n\n/The/ wrist or joint between the hand and arm lessens on closing the\nhand, and grows larger when it opens.The contrary happens in the arm,\nin the space between the elbow and the hand, on all sides; because in\nopening the hand the muscles are extended and thinned in the arm, from\nthe elbow to the wrist; but when the hand is shut, the same muscles\nswell and shorten.The tendons alone start, being stretched by the\nclenching of the hand.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.XXXVII./--_Of the Joint of the Foot._\n\n\n/The/ increase and diminution in the joint of the foot is produced\non that side where the tendons are seen, as D E F, _Plate I._ which\nincreases when the angle is acute, and diminishes when it becomes\nobtuse.It must be understood of the joint in the front part of the\nfoot A B C.XXXVIII./--_Of the Knee._\n\n\n/Of/ all the members which have pliable joints, the knee is the only\none that lessens in the bending, and becomes larger by extension.XXXIX./--_Of the Joints._\n\n\n/All/ the joints of the human body become larger by bending, except\nthat of the leg.XL./--_Of the Naked._\n\n\n/When/ a figure is to appear nimble and delicate, its muscles must\nnever be too much marked, nor are any of them to be much swelled.Because such figures are expressive of activity and swiftness, and are\nnever loaded with much flesh upon the bones.They are made light by the\nwant of flesh, and where there is but little flesh there cannot be any\nthickness of muscles.XLI./--_Of the Thickness of the Muscles._\n\n\n/Muscular/ men have large bones, and are in general thick and short,\nwith very little fat; because the fleshy muscles in their growth\ncontract closer together, and the fat, which in other instances lodges\nbetween them, has no room.The muscles in such thin subjects, not being\nable to extend, grow in thickness, particularly towards their middle,\nin the parts most removed from the extremities.XLII./--_Fat Subjects have small Muscles._\n\n\n/Though/ fat people have this in common with muscular men, that they\nare frequently short and thick, they have thin muscles; but their skin\ncontains a great deal of spongy and soft flesh full of air; for that\nreason they are lighter upon the water, and swim better than muscular\npeople.XLIII./--_Which of the Muscles disappear in the different\nMotions of the Body._\n\n\n/In/ raising or lowering the arm, the pectoral muscles disappear, or\nacquire a greater relievo.A similar effect is produced by the hips,\nwhen they bend either inwards or outwards.It is to be observed, that\nthere is more variety of appearances in the shoulders, hips, and neck,\nthan in any other joint, because they are susceptible of the greatest\nvariety of motions.But of this subject I shall make a separate\ntreatise[13].XLIV./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscles are not to be scrupulously marked all the way, because it\nwould be disagreeable to the sight, and of very difficult execution.But on that side only where the members are in action, they should\nbe pronounced more strongly; for muscles that are at work naturally\ncollect all their parts together, to gain increase of strength, so\nthat some small parts of those muscles will appear, that were not seen\nbefore.XLV./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscles of young men are not to be marked strongly, nor too much\nswelled, because that would indicate full strength and vigour of age,\nwhich they have not yet attained.Nevertheless they must be more or\nless expressed, as they are more or less employed.For those which are\nin motion are always more swelled and thicker than those which remain\nat rest.The intrinsic and central line of the members which are bent,\nnever retains its natural length.XLVI./--_The Extension and Contraction of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscle at the back part of the thigh shows more variety in\nits extension and contraction, than any other in the human body; the\nsecond, in that respect, are those which compose the buttocks; the\nthird, those of the back; the fourth, those of the neck; the fifth,\nthose of the shoulders; and the sixth, those of the Abdomen, which,\ntaking their rise under the breast, terminate under the lower belly; as\nI shall explain when I speak of each.XLVII./--_Of the Muscle between the Chest and the lower Belly._\n\n\n/There/ is a muscle which begins under the breast at the Sternum, and\nis inserted into, or terminates at the Os pubis, under the lower belly.It is called the Rectus of the Abdomen; it is divided, lengthways,\ninto three principal portions, by transverse tendinous intersections\nor ligaments, viz.the superior part, and a ligament; the second part,\nwith its ligaments; and the third part, with the third ligament;\nwhich last unites by tendons to the Os pubis.These divisions and\nintersections of the same muscle are intended by nature to facilitate\nthe motion when the body is bent or distended.If it were made of one\npiece, it would produce too much variety when extended, or contracted,\nand also would be considerably weaker.When this muscle has but little\nvariety in the motion of the body, it is more beautiful[14].XLVIII./--_Of a Man's complex Strength, but first of the Arm._\n\n\n/The/ muscles which serve either to straighten or bend the arm, arise\nfrom the different processes of the Scapula; some of them from the\nprotuberances of the Humerus, and others about the middle of the Os\nhumeri.The extensors of the arm arise from behind, and the flexors\nfrom before.That a man has more power in pulling than in pushing, has been proved\nby the ninth proposition De Ponderibus[15], where it is said, that of\ntwo equal weights, that will have the greatest power which is farthest\nremoved from the pole or centre of its balance.It follows then of\ncourse, that the muscle N B, _Plate II._ and the muscle N C, being of\nequal power, the inner muscle N C, will nevertheless be stronger than\nthe outward one N B, because it is inserted into the arm at C, a point\nfarther removed from the centre of the elbow A, than B, which is on\nthe other side of such centre, so that that question is determined.But this is a simple power, and I thought it best to explain it before\nI mentioned the complex power of the muscles, of which I must now\ntake notice.The complex power, or strength, is, for instance, this,\nwhen the arm is going to act, a second power is added to it (such as\nthe weight of the body and the strength of the legs, in pulling or\npushing), consisting in the extension of the parts, as when two men\nattempt to throw down a column; the one by pushing, and the other by\npulling[16].XLIX./--_In which of the two Actions, Pulling or Pushing, a Man\nhas the greatest Power_, Plate II./A man/ has the greatest power in pulling, for in that action he has\nthe united exertion of all the muscles of the arm, while some of them\nmust be inactive when he is pushing; because when the arm is extended\nfor that purpose, the muscles which move the elbow cannot act, any\nmore than if he pushed with his shoulders against the column he means\nto throw down; in which case only the muscles that extend the back,\nthe legs under the thigh, and the calves of the legs, would be active.From which we conclude, that in pulling there is added to the power\nof extension the strength of the arms, of the legs, of the back, and\neven of the chest, if the oblique motion of the body require it.But\nin pushing, though all the parts were employed, yet the strength of\nthe muscles of the arms is wanting; for to push with an extended arm\nwithout motion does not help more than if a piece of wood were placed\nfrom the shoulder to the column meant to be pushed down._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.L./--_Of the bending of Members, and of the Flesh round the\nbending Joint._\n\n\n/The/ flesh which covers the bones near and at the joints, swells or\ndiminishes in thickness according to their bending or extension; that\nis, it increases at the inside of the angle formed by the bending, and\ngrows narrow and lengthened on the outward side of the"]

QUESTION: Where is Sandra? 
CRUCIAL ITEMS: {'Sandra': 3}
ASSOCIATED SUBGRAPH: []
EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Since, we had heard a good deal about it: how it had\nbeen inhabited by Jewish colonists, who bought tin from the early\nPh[oe]nician workers of the Cornish mines, and been called by them\nMara-Zion--bitter Zion--corrupted by the common people into Market-Jew.Michael\'s Mount opposite; and attracted\nus much more than genteel Penzance.So did a letter we got from the\nlandlord of its one hotel, promising to take us in, and make us\nthoroughly comfortable.Charles declared we could, and even see\na good deal on the road.Mary will be delighted to get another\npeep at you ladies, and while I rest the horse you can go in and look\nat the old church--it\'s very curious, they say.And then we\'ll go on\nto Gunwalloe,--there\'s another church there, close by the sea, built\nby somebody who was shipwrecked.But then it\'s so old and so small.However, we can stop and look at it if you like."His good common sense, and kindliness, when he might so easily have\ndone his mere duty and taken us the shortest and ugliest route, showing\nus nothing, decided us to leave all in Charles\'s hands, and start at\n10 A.M.for Penzance, _via_ Helstone, where we all wished to\nstay an hour or two, and find out a "friend," the only one we had in\nCornwall.So all was settled, with but a single regret, that several boating\nexcursions we had planned with John Curgenven had all fallen through,\nand we should never behold some wonderful sea-caves between the Lizard\nand Cadgwith, which we had set our hearts upon visiting.Charles fingered his cap with a thoughtful air."I don\'t see why you\nshouldn\'t, ladies.If I was to go direct and tell John Curgenven to\nhave a boat ready at Church Cove, and we was to start at nine instead\nof ten, and drive there, the carriage might wait while you rowed to\nthe caves and back; we should still reach Helstone by dinner-time, and\nMarazion before dark."And at this addition to his\nwork Charles looked actually pleased!So--all was soon over, our easy packing done, our bill paid--a very\nsmall one--our goodnights said to the kindly handmaid, Esther, who\nhoped we would come back again some time, and promised to keep the\nartistic mural decorations of our little parlour in memory of us.My\nyoung folks went to bed, and then, a little before midnight, when all\nthe house was quiet, I put a shawl over my head, unlatched the innocent\ndoor--no bolts or bars at the Lizard--and went out into the night.What a night it was!--mild as summer, clear as day: the full moon\nsailing aloft in an absolutely cloudless sky.Not a breath, not a\nsound--except the faint thud-thud of the in-coming waves, two miles\noff, at Kynance, the outline of which, and of the whole coast, was\ndistinctly visible.A silent earth, lying under a silent heaven.Looking up, one felt almost like a disembodied soul, free to cleave\nthrough infinite space and gain--what?Sandra moved to the bedroom.Is it human or divine, this ceaseless longing after something never\nattained, this craving after the eternal life, which, if fully believed\nin, fully understood, would take all the bitterness out of this life?But so much is given, and all given is so infinitely good, except where\nwe ourselves turn it into evil, that surely more, and better, will be\ngiven to us by and by.Those only truly enjoy life who fear not death:\nwho can say of the grave as if it were their bed: "I will lay me down\nin peace and take my rest, for it is Thou only, O God, who makest me to\ndwell in safety."DAY THE NINTH\n\n\nAnd our last at the Lizard, which a week ago had been to us a mere word\nor dot in a map; now we carried away from it a living human interest in\neverything and everybody.Esther bade us a cordial farewell: Mrs.Curgenven, standing at the\ndoor of her serpentine shop, repeated the good wishes, and informed\nus that John and his boat had already started for Church Cove.As we\ndrove through the bright little Lizard Town, and past the Church of\nLandewednack, wondering if we should ever see either again, we felt\nquite sad.Leaving the carriage and Charles at the nearest point to the Cove, we\nwent down the steep descent, and saw John rocking in his boat, and\nbeckoning to us with a bland and smiling countenance.But between us\nand him lay a sort of causeway, of the very roughest rocks, slippery\nwith sea-weed, and beat upon by waves--such waves!Yet clearly, if we\nmeant to get into the boat at all, we must seize our opportunity and\njump in between the flux and reflux of that advancing tide.I am not a coward: I love boats, and was well used to them in my youth,\nbut now--my heart misgave me.There were but two alternatives--to\nstop the pleasure of the whole party, and leave Cornwall with these\nwonderful sea-caves unseen, or to let my children go alone.Neither was\npossible; so I hailed a sturdy youth at work hard by, and asked him if\nhe would take charge of an old lady across the rocks.He grinned from\near to ear, but came forward, and did his duty manfully and kindly.My\nyoung folks, light as feathers, bounded after; and with the help of\nJohn Curgenven, chivalrous and careful as ever, we soon found ourselves\nsafely in the boat.[Illustration: JOHN CURGENVEN FISHING.]"Here we go up, up, up, and here we go down,\ndown, down," was the principle of our voyage, the most serious one we\never took in an open boat with a single pair of oars.Never did I see\nsuch waves,--at least, never did I float upon them, in a boat that went\ntossing like a bit of cork out into the open sea.John seemed not to mind them in the least.His strong arms swept the\nboat along, and he still found breath to talk to us, pointing out the\ngreat gloomy cliffs we were passing under, and telling us stories of\nwrecks, the favourite theme--and no wonder.This sunshiny morning that iron-bound coast looked awful enough; what\nmust it have looked like, on the winter night when the emigrant ship\n_Brest_ went down!"Yes, it was about ten o\'clock at night," said John."I was fast asleep\nin bed, but they knocked me up; I got on my clothes and was off in\nfive minutes.They are always glad enough to get us fishermen, the\ncoastguard are.Mine was the first boat-load we brought ashore; we\nwould only take women and children that time.They were all in their\nnight-gowns, and they couldn\'t speak a word of English, but we made\nthem understand somehow.One woman threw her three children down to me,\nand stayed behind on the wreck with two more.""Oh, no, they were very quiet, dazed like.Some of them seemed to be\nsaying their prayers.But they made no fuss at all, not even the little\nones.They lay down in the bottom of the boat, and we rowed ashore\nas fast as we could, to Cadgwith.Then we rowed back and fetched two\nboatloads more.We saved a lot of lives that wreck, but only their\nlives; they had scarcely a rag of clothes on, and some of the babies\nwere as naked as when they were born.""Everybody: we always do it," answered John, as if surprised at\nthe question."The fishermen\'s cottages were full, and so was the\nparsonage.We gave them clothes, and kept them till they could be sent\naway.Yes, it was an awful night; I got something to remember it by,\nhere."He held out his hand, from which we noticed half of one finger was\nmissing."It got squeezed off with a rope somehow.I didn\'t heed it much at\nthe time," said John carelessly."But look, we\'re at the first of the\ncaves.I\'ll row in close, ladies, and let you see it."So we had to turn our minds from the vision of the wreck of the\n_Brest_, which John\'s simple words made so terribly vivid, to examine\nRaven\'s Ugo, and Dolor Ugo; _ugo_ is Cornish for cave.Over the\nentrance of the first a pair of ravens have built from time immemorial.It is just accessible, the opening being above the sea-line, and hung\nwith quantities of sea-ferns.Here in smuggling days, many kegs of\nspirits used to be secreted: and many a wild drama no doubt has been\nacted there--daring encounters between smugglers and coastguard men,\nnot bloodless on either side.Dolor Ugo is now inaccessible and unusable.Its only floor is of\nheaving water, a deep olive green, and so clear that we could see the\nfishes swimming about pursuing a shoal of launce.Its high-vaulted roof\nand sides were tinted all colours--rose-pink, rich dark brown, and\npurple.The entrance was wide enough to admit a boat, but it gradually\nnarrowed into impenetrable darkness.How far inland it goes no one can\ntell, as it could only be investigated by swimming, a rather dangerous\nexperiment.Boats venture as far as the daylight goes; and it is a\nfavourite trick of the boatman suddenly to fire off a pistol, which\nreverberates like thunder through the mysterious gloom of the cave.A solemn place; an awful place, some of us thought, as we rowed in, and\nout again, into the sunshiny open sea.Which we had now got used to;\nand it was delicious to go dancing like a feather up and down, trusting\nto John Curgenven\'s stout arm and fearless, honest face.We felt sad to\nthink this would be our last sight of him and of the magnificent Lizard\ncoast.But the minutes were lessening, and we had some way still to\nrow.Also to land, which meant a leap between the waves upon slippery\nsea-weedy rocks.In silent dread I watched my children accomplish this\nfeat, and then--\n\nWell, it is over, and I sit here writing these details.But I would\nnot do it again, not even for the pleasure of revisiting Dolor Ugo and\nhaving a row with John Curgenven.he looked relieved when he saw "the old lady" safe on\n_terra firma_, and we left him waving adieux, as he "rocked in his\nboat in the bay."May his stout arms and kindly heart long remain to\nhim!May his summer tourists be many and his winter shipwrecks few!I am sure he will always do his duty, and see that other people do\ntheirs, or, like the proverbial Cornishmen, he "will know the reason\nwhy."Charles was ready; waiting patiently in front of a blacksmith\'s shop.fate had overtaken us in the shape of an innocent leak in\nJohn Curgenven\'s boat; nothing, doubtless, to him, who was in the habit\nof baling it out with his boots, and then calmly putting them on again,\nbut a little inconvenient to us.To drive thirty miles with one\'s\ngarments soaked up to the knees was not desirable.There was a cottage close by, whence came the gleam of a delicious fire\nand the odour of ironing clothes.We went in: the mistress, evidently\na laundress, advanced and offered to dry us--which she did, chattering\nall the while in the confidential manner of country folks.A hard working, decent body she was, and as for her house, it was a\nperfect picture of cleanliness and tidiness.Its two rooms, kitchen and\nbedroom, were absolutely speckless.When we noticed this, and said we\nfound the same in many Cornish cottages; she almost seemed offended at\nthe praise."Oh, that\'s nothing, ma\'am.We hereabouts all likes to have our places\ntidy.Mine\'s not over tidy to-day because of the washing.But if you was to come of a Sunday.Her eye\ncaught something in a dark corner, at which she flew, apron in hand."I\ndeclare, I\'m quite ashamed.I didn\'t think we had one in the house."Dried, warmed, and refreshed, but having found the greatest difficulty\nin inducing the good woman to receive any tangible thanks for her\nkindness, we proceeded on our journey; going over the same ground which\nwe had traversed already, and finding Pradenack Down as bleak and\nbeautiful as ever.Our first halt was at the door of Mary Mundy, who,\nwith her unappreciated brother, ran out to meet us, and looked much\ndisappointed when she found we had not come to stay."But you will come some time, ladies, and I\'ll make you so comfortable.And you\'ll give my duty to the professor"--it was vain to explain that\nfour hundred miles lay between our home and his.He was a very nice gentleman, please\'m.I shall be delighted to\nsee him again, please\'m," &c., &c.\n\nWe left the three--Mary, her brother, and Charles--chattering together\nin a dialect which I do not attempt to reproduce, and sometimes could\nhardly understand.Us, the natives indulged with their best English,\nbut among themselves they talked the broadest Cornish.It was a very old church, and a preternaturally old beadle showed it in\na passive manner, not recognising in the least its points of interest\nand beauty, except some rows of open benches with ancient oak backs,\nwonderfully carved."Our vicar dug them up from under the flooring and turned them into\npews.There was a gentleman here the other day who said there was\nnothing like them in all England."Most curious, in truth, they were, and suited well the fine old\nbuilding--a specimen of how carefully and lavishly our forefathers\nbuilt "for God."We, who build for ourselves, are rather surprised\nto find in out-of-the-way nooks like this, churches that in size and\nadornment must have cost years upon years of loving labour as well as\nmoney.It was pleasant to know that the present incumbent, a man of\narchaeological tastes, appreciated his blessings, and took the utmost\ncare of his beautiful old church.even though he cannot\nboast the power of his predecessor, the Reverend Thomas Flavel, who\ndied in 1682, and whose monument in the chancel really expresses the\nsentiments--in epitaph--of the period:\n\n  "Earth, take thine earth; my sin, let Satan have it;\n  The world my goods; my soul my God who gave it.For from these four, Earth, Satan, World, and God,\n  My flesh, my sin, my goods, my soul, I had."But it does not mention that the reverend gentleman was the best\n_ghost-layer_ in all England, and that when he died his ghost also\nrequired to be laid, by a brother clergyman, in a spot on the down\nstill pointed out by the people of Mullion, who, being noted for\nextreme longevity, have passed down this tradition from generation\nto generation, with an earnest credulity that we of more enlightened\ncounties can hardly understand.From Mullion we went on to Gunwalloe.Its church, "small and old," as\nCharles had depreciatingly said, had been so painfully "restored,"\nand looked so bran-new and uninteresting that we contented ourselves\nwith a distant look.It was close to the sea--probably built on the\nvery spot where its pious founder had been cast ashore.The one curious\npoint about it was the detached belfry, some yards distant from the\nchurch itself.It sat alone in a little cove, down which a sluggish\nriver crawled quietly seaward.A sweet quiet place, but haunted, as\nusual, by tales of cruel shipwrecks--of sailors huddled for hours on\na bit of rock just above the waves, till a boat could put out and\nsave the few survivors; of sea treasures continually washed ashore\nfrom lost ships--Indian corn, coffee, timber, dollars--many are still\nfound in the sand after a storm.And one treasure more, of which the\nrecollection is still kept at Gunwalloe, "a little dead baby in its cap\nand night-gown, with a necklace of coral beads."Our good horse, with the dogged\npersistency of Cornish horses and Cornish men, plodded on mile after\nmile.Sometimes for an hour or more we did not meet a living soul;\nthen we came upon a stray labourer, or passed through a village where\nhealthy-looking children, big-eyed, brown-faced, and dirty-handed,\npicturesque if not pretty, stared at us from cottage doors, or from the\ngates of cottage gardens full of flowers and apples.Hungry and thirsty, we could not\nresist them.After passing several trees, hung thickly with delicious\nfruit, we attacked the owner of one of them, a comely young woman, with\na baby in her arms and another at her gown."Oh yes, ma\'am, you may have as many apples as you like, if your young\nladies will go and get them."And while they did it, she stood talking by the carriage door, pouring\nout to me her whole domestic history with a simple frankness worthy of\nthe golden age."No, really I couldn\'t," putting back my payment--little enough-- for\nthe splendid basket of apples which the girls brought back in triumph."This is such a good apple year; the pigs would get them if the young\nladies didn\'t.Sandra went back to the garden.You\'re kindly welcome to them--well then, if you are\ndetermined, say sixpence."On which magnificent "sixpenn\'orth," we lived for days!Indeed I think\nwe brought some of it home as a specimen of Cornish fruit and Cornish\nliberality.[Illustration: THE ARMED KNIGHT AND THE LONG SHIP\'S LIGHTHOUSE.]Helstone was reached at last, and we were not sorry for rest and food\nin the old-fashioned inn, whence we could look out of window, and\ncontemplate the humours of the little town, which doubtless considered\nitself a very great one.It was market day, and the narrow street was\nthronged with beasts and men--the latter as sober as the former,\nwhich spoke well for Cornwall.Sober and civil too was every one we\naddressed in asking our way to the house of our unknown friend, whose\nonly address we had was Helstone.But he seemed well known in the town,\nthough neither a rich man, nor a great man, nor--No, I cannot say he\nwas not a clever man, for in his own line, mechanical engineering, he\nmust have been exceedingly clever.And he was what people call "a great\ncharacter;" would have made such an admirable study for a novelist,\nmanipulated into an unrecognisable ideal--the only way in which it is\nfair to put people in books.When I saw him I almost regretted that I\nwrite novels no more.We passed through the little garden--all ablaze with autumn colour,\nevery inch utilised for either flowers, vegetables, or fruit--went into\nthe parlour, sent our cards and waited the result.In two minutes our friend appeared, and gave us such a welcome!But to\nexplain it I must trench a little upon the sanctities of private life,\nand tell the story of this honest Cornishman.When still young he went to Brazil, and was employed by an English\ngold-mining company there, for some years.Afterwards he joined\nan engineering firm, and superintended dredging, the erection of\nsaw-mills, &c., finally building a lighthouse, of which latter work he\nhad the sole charge, and was exceedingly proud.His conscientiousness,\nprobity, and entire reliableness made him most valuable to the\nfirm; whom he served faithfully for many years.When they, as well\nas himself, returned to England, he still kept up a correspondence\nwith them, preserving towards every member of the family the most\nenthusiastic regard and devotion.He rushed into the parlour, a tall, gaunt, middle-aged man, with a\nshrewd, kindly face, which beamed all over with delight, as he began\nshaking hands indiscriminately, saying how kind it was of us to come,\nand how welcome we were.It was explained which of us he had specially to welcome, the others\nbeing only humble appendages, friends of the family, this well-beloved\nfamily, whose likenesses for two generations we saw everywhere about\nthe room."Yes, miss, there they all are, your dear grandfather" (alas, only a\nlikeness now!They were all so good to\nme, and I would do anything for them, or for any one of their name.If\nI got a message that they wanted me for anything, I\'d be off to London,\nor to Brazil, or anywhere, in half-an-hour."added the good man when the rapture and\nexcitement of the moment had a little subsided, and his various\nquestions as to the well-being of "the family" had been asked and\nanswered."You have dined, you say, but you\'ll have a cup of tea.My\nwife (that\'s the little maid I used to talk to your father about, miss;\nI always told him I wouldn\'t stay in Brazil, I must go back to England\nand marry my little maid), my wife makes the best cup of tea in all\nCornwall.And there entered, in afternoon gown and cap, probably just put on, a\nmiddle-aged, but still comely matron, who insisted that, even at this\nearly hour--3 P.M.--to get a cup of tea for us was "no trouble\nat all.""Indeed, she wouldn\'t think anything a trouble, no more than I should,\nmiss, if it was for your family.It was here suggested that they were not a "forgetting" family.Nor\nwas he a man likely to be soon forgotten.While the cup of tea, which\nproved to be a most sumptuous meal, was preparing, he took us all over\nhis house, which was full of foreign curiosities, and experimental\ninventions.One, I remember, being a musical instrument, a sort of\norgan, which he had begun making when a mere boy, and taken with him\nall the way to Brazil and back.It had now found refuge in the little\nroom he called his "workshop," which was filled with odds and ends that\nwould have been delightful to a mechanical mind.He expounded them with\nenthusiasm, and we tried not to betray an ignorance, which in some of\nus would have been a sort of hereditary degradation.they were clever--your father and your uncle!--and how proud we\nall were when we finished our lighthouse, and got the Emperor to light\nit up for the first time.Look here, ladies, what do you think this is?"He took out a small parcel, and solemnly unwrapped from it fold after\nfold of paper, till he came to the heart of it--a small wax candle!"This was the candle the Emperor used to light our lighthouse.I\'ve\nkept it for nearly thirty years, and I\'ll keep it as long as I live.Every year on the anniversary of the day I light it, drink his\nMajesty\'s health, and the health of all your family, miss, and then I\nput it out again.So"--carefully re-wrapping the relic in its numerous\nenvelopes--"so I hope it will last my time."Here the mistress came behind her good man, and they exchanged a\nsmile--the affectionate smile of two who had never been more than two,\nDarby and Joan, but all sufficient to each other.How we got through it I hardly know,\nbut travelling is hungry work, and the viands were delicious.The\nbeneficence of our kind hosts, however, was not nearly done."Come, ladies, I\'ll show you my garden, and--(give me a basket and the\ngrape-scissors,)" added he in a conjugal aside.Which resulted in our\ncarrying away with us the biggest bunches in the whole vinery, as well\nas a quantity of rosy apples, stuffed into every available pocket and\nbag."Nonsense, nonsense," was the answer to vain remonstrances."D\'ye\nthink I wouldn\'t give the best of everything I had to your family?How your father used to laugh at me about my\nlittle maid!Oh yes, I\'m glad I came\nhome.And now your father and your uncle are home too, and perhaps some\nday they\'ll come to see me down here--wouldn\'t it be a proud day for\nme!It was touching, and rare as touching, this passionate personal\nfidelity.It threw us back, at least such of us as were sentimentally\ninclined, upon that something in Cornish nature which found its\nexposition in Arthur and his faithful knights, down to "bold Sir\nBedevere," and apparently, is still not lost in Cornwall.With a sense of real regret, feeling that it would be long ere we\nmight meet his like--such shrewd simplicity, earnest enthusiasm, and\nexceeding faithfulness--we bade good-bye to the honest man; leaving him\nand his wife standing at their garden-gate, an elderly Adam and Eve,\ndesiring nothing outside their own little paradise.Which of us could\nsay more, or as much?Gratefully we "talked them over," as we drove on through the pretty\ncountry round Helstone--inland country; for we had no time to go and\nsee the Loe Pool, a small lake, divided from the sea by a bar of sand.This is supposed to be the work of the Cornwall man-demon, Tregeagle;\nand periodically cut through, with solemn ceremonial, by the Mayor of\nHelstone, when the "meeting of the waters," fresh and salt, is said to\nbe an extremely curious sight.But we did not see it, nor yet Nonsloe\nHouse, close by, which is held by the tenure of having to provide a\nboat and nets whenever the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Cornwall\nwishes to fish in the Loe Pool.A circumstance which has never happened\nyet, certainly!Other curiosities _en route_ we also missed, the stones of\nTremenkeverne, half a ton each, used as missiles in a notable fight\nbetween two saints, St.Just of the Land\'s End, and St.Keverne of the\nLizard, and still lying in a field to prove the verity of the legend.Also the rock of Goldsithney, where, when the "fair land of Lyonesse"\nwas engulfed by the sea, an ancestor of the Trevelyans saved himself by\nswimming his horse, and landing; and various other remarkable places,\nwith legends attached, needing much credulity, or imagination, to\nbelieve in.But, fearing to be benighted ere reaching Marazion, we passed them all,\nand saw nothing more interesting than the ruins of disused tin mines,\nwhich Charles showed us, mournfully explaining how the mining business\nhad of late years drifted away from Cornwall, and how hundreds of the\nonce thriving community had been compelled to emigrate or starve.As we\nneared Marazion, these melancholy wrecks with their little hillocks of\nmining debris rose up against the evening sky, the image of desolation.Michael\'s Mount, the picture in little of Mont St.Michel,\nin Normandy, appeared in the middle of Mount\'s Bay.Lastly, after\na gorgeous sunset, in a golden twilight and silvery moonlight, we\nentered Marazion;-and found it, despite its picturesque name, the most\ncommonplace little town imaginable!We should have regretted our rash decision, and gone on to Penzance,\nbut for the hearty welcome given us at a most comfortable and home-like\ninn, which determined us to keep to our first intention, and stay.So, after our habit of making the best of things, we walked down to the\nugly beach, and investigated the dirty-looking bay--in the lowest of\nall low tides, with a soppy, sea-weedy causeway running across to St.By advice of Charles, we made acquaintance with an old\nboatman he knew, a Norwegian who had drifted hither--shipwrecked, I\nbelieve--settled down and married an English woman, but whose English\nwas still of the feeblest kind.However, he had an honest face; so we\nengaged him to take us out bathing early to-morrow."Wouldn\'t you\nlike to row round the Mount?--When you\'ve had your tea, I\'ll come back\nfor you, and help you down to the shore--it\'s rather rough, but nothing\nlike what you have done, ma\'am," added he encouragingly."And it will\nbe bright moonlight, and the Mount will look so fine."So, the spirit of adventure conquering our weariness, we went.When\nI think how it looked next morning--the small, shallow bay, with its\ntoy-castle in the centre, I am glad our first vision of it was under\nthe glamour of moonlight, with the battlemented rock throwing dark\nshadows across the shimmering sea.In the mysterious beauty of that\nnight row round the Mount, we could imagine anything; its earliest\ninhabitant, the giant Cormoran, killed by that "valiant Cornishman,"\nthe illustrious Jack; the lovely St.Keyne, a king\'s daughter, who came\nthither on pilgrimage; and, passing down from legend to history, Henry\nde la Pomeroy, who, being taken prisoner, caused himself to be bled to\ndeath in the Castle; Sir John Arundel, slain on the sands, and buried\nin the Chapel; Perkin Warbeck\'s unfortunate wife, who took refuge at\nSt.And so on, and so on,\nthrough the centuries, to the family of St.Aubyn, who bought it in\n1660, and have inhabited it ever since."Very nice people," we heard\nthey were; who have received here the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and\nother royal personages.Yet, looking up as we rowed under the gloomy rock, we could fancy his\ngiant ghost sitting there, on the spot where he killed his wife, for\nbringing in her apron greenstone, instead of granite, to build the\nchapel with.Which being really built of greenstone the story must be\ntrue!What a pleasure it is to be able to believe anything!Some of us could have stayed out half the night, floating along in the\nmild soft air and dreamy moonlight, which made even the commonplace\nlittle town look like a fairy scene, and exalted St.Michael\'s Mount\ninto a grand fortress, fit for its centuries of legendary lore--but\nothers preferred going to bed.Not however without taking a long look out\nof the window upon the bay, which now, at high tide, was one sheet of\nrippling moon-lit water, with the grim old Mount, full of glimmering\nlights like eyes, sitting silent in the midst of the silent sea.[Illustration: CORNISH FISHERMAN.]DAY THE TENTH\n\n\nI cannot advise Marazion as a bathing place.What a down-come from the\npicturesque vision of last night, to a small ugly fishy-smelling beach,\nwhich seemed to form a part of the town and its business, and was\noverlooked from everywhere!Yet on it two or three family groups were\nevidently preparing for a dip, or rather a wade of about a quarter of a\nmile in exceedingly dirty sea water."This will never do," we said to our old Norwegian."You must row us to\nsome quiet cove along the shore, and away from the town."He nodded his head, solemn and mute as the dumb boatman of dead Elaine,\nrowed us out seaward for about half-a-mile, and then proceeded to\nfasten the boat to a big stone, and walk ashore.The water still did\nnot come much above his knees--he seemed quite indifferent to it.Well, we could but do at Rome as the Romans do.Toilette in an open\nboat was evidently the custom of the country.And the sun was warm, the\nsea safe and shallow.Indeed, so rapidly did it subside, that by the\ntime the bath was done, we were aground, and had to call at the top of\nour voices to our old man, who sat, with his back to us, dim in the\ndistance, on another big stone, calmly smoking the pipe of peace."We\'ll not try this again," was the unanimous resolve, as, after\npolitely declining a suggestion that "the ladies should walk ashore--"\ndid he think we were amphibious?--we got ourselves floated off at last,\nand rowed to the nearest landing point, the entrance to St.Probably nowhere in England is found the like of this place.Such\na curious mingling of a mediaeval fortress and modern residence; of\nantiquarian treasures and everyday business; for at the foot of the\nrock is a fishing village of about thirty cottages, which carries\non a thriving trade; and here also is a sort of station for the tiny\nunderground-railway, which worked by a continuous chain, fulfils the\nvery necessary purpose (failing Giant Cormoran, and wife) of carrying\nup coals, provisions, luggage, and all other domestic necessaries to\nthe hill top.Thither we climbed by a good many weary steps, and thought, delightful\nas it may be to dwell on the top of a rock in the midst of the sea,\nlike eagles in an eyrie, there are certain advantages in living on a\nlevel country road, or even in a town street.Aubyns manage when they go out to dinner?Two years afterwards,']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ["The middle between the convex and concave angle participates of this\nincrease or diminution, but in a greater or less degree as the parts\nare nearer to, or farther from, the angles of the bending joints.LI./--_Of the naked Body._\n\n\n/The/ members of naked men who work hard in different attitudes, will\nshew the muscles more strongly on that side where they act forcibly to\nbring the part into action; and the other muscles will be more or less\nmarked, in proportion as they co-operate in the same motion.LII./--_Of a Ligament without Muscles._\n\n\n/Where/ the arm joins with the hand, there is a ligament, the largest\nin the human body, which is without muscles, and is called the strong\nligament of the Carpus; it has a square shape, and serves to bind\nand keep close together the bones of the arm, and the tendons of the\nfingers, and prevent their dilating, or starting out.LIII./--_Of Creases._\n\n\n/In/ bending the joints the flesh will always form a crease on the\nopposite side to that where it is tight.LIV./--_How near behind the Back one Arm can be brought to the\nother_, Plate III.John moved to the kitchen./When/ the arms are carried behind the back, the elbows can never be\nbrought nearer than the length from the elbow to the end of the longest\nfinger; so that the fingers will not be seen beyond the elbows, and\nin that situation, the arms with the shoulders form a perfect square.The greatest extension of the arm across the chest is, when the elbow\ncomes over the pit of the stomach; the elbow and the shoulder in this\nposition, will form an equilateral triangle.LV./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/A naked/ figure being strongly marked, so as to give a distinct view\nof all the muscles, will not express any motion; because it cannot\nmove, if some of its muscles do not relax while the others are pulling.Those which relax cease to appear in proportion as the others pull\nstrongly and become apparent._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 24_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LVI./--_Of the Muscles._\n\n\n/The/ muscles of the human body are to be more or less marked according\nto their degree of action.Those only which act are to be shewn, and\nthe more forcibly they act, the stronger they should be pronounced.Those that do not act at all must remain soft and flat.LVII./--_Of the Bending of the Body._\n\n\n/The/ bodies of men diminish as much on the side which bends, as they\nincrease on the opposite side.That diminution may at last become\ndouble, in proportion to the extension on the other side.But of this I\nshall make a separate treatise[17].LVIII./--_The same Subject._\n\n\n/The/ body which bends, lengthens as much on one side as it shortens\non the other; but the central line between them will never lessen or\nincrease.LIX./--_The Necessity of anatomical Knowledge._\n\n\n/The/ painter who has obtained a perfect knowledge of the nature of the\ntendons and muscles, and of those parts which contain the most of them,\nwill know to a certainty, in giving a particular motion to any part of\nthe body, which, and how many of the muscles give rise and contribute\nto it; which of them, by swelling, occasion their shortening, and which\nof the cartilages they surround.He will not imitate those who, in all the different attitudes they\nadopt, or invent, make use of the same muscles, in the arms, back, or\nchest, or any other parts.MOTION AND EQUIPOISE OF FIGURES.LX./--_Of the Equipoise of a Figure standing still._\n\n\n/The/ non-existence of motion in any animal resting on its feet, is\nowing to the equality of weight distributed on each side of the line of\ngravity.LXI./--_Motion produced by the Loss of Equilibrium._\n\n\n/Motion/ is created by the loss of due equipoise, that is, by\ninequality of weight; for nothing can move of itself, without losing\nits centre of gravity, and the farther that is removed, the quicker and\nstronger will be the motion._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LXII./--_Of the Equipoise of Bodies_, Plate V./The/ balance or equipoise of parts in the human body is of two sorts,\nviz.Simple, when a man stands upon his feet\nwithout motion: in that situation, if he extends his arms at different\ndistances from the middle, or stoop, the centre of his weight will\nalways be in a perpendicular line upon the centre of that foot which\nsupports the body; and if he rests equally upon both feet, then the\nmiddle of the chest will be perpendicular to the middle of the line\nwhich measures the space between the centres of his feet.The complex balance is, when a man carries a weight not his own, which\nhe bears by different motions; as in the figure of Hercules stifling\nAnteus, by pressing him against his breast with his arms, after he has\nlifted him from the ground.He must have as much of his own weight\nthrown behind the central line of his feet, as the weight of Anteus\nadds before.LXIII./--_Of Positions._\n\n\n/The/ pit of the neck, between the two Clavicles, falls perpendicularly\nwith the foot which bears the weight of the body.If one of the arms be\nthrown forwards, this pit will quit that perpendicular; and if one of\nthe legs goes back, that pit is brought forwards, and so changes its\nsituation at every change of posture.LXIV./--_Of balancing the Weight round the Centre of Gravity in\nBodies._\n\n\n/A figure/ standing upon its feet without motion, will form an\nequipoise of all its members round the centre of its support.If this figure without motion, and resting upon its feet, happens to\nmove one of its arms forwards, it must necessarily throw as much of its\nweight on the opposite side, as is equal to that of the extended arm\nand the accidental weight.And the same I say of every part, which is\nbrought out beyond its usual balance.LXV./--_Of Figures that have to lift up, or carry any Weight._\n\n\n/A weight/ can never be lifted up or carried by any man, if he do not\nthrow more than an equal weight of his own on the opposite side.LXVI./--_The Equilibrium of a Man standing upon his Feet_, Plate\nVI./The/ weight of a man resting upon one leg will always be equally\ndivided on each side of the central or perpendicular line of gravity,\nwhich supports him.LXVII./--_Of Walking_, Plate VII./A man/ walking will always have the centre of gravity over the centre\nof the leg which rests upon the ground._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 28_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LXVIII./--_Of the Centre of Gravity in Men and Animals._\n\n\n/The/ legs, or centre of support, in men and animals, will approach\nnearer to the centre of gravity, in proportion to the slowness of their\nmotion; and, on the contrary, when the motion is quicker, they will be\nfarther removed from that perpendicular line.LXIX./--_Of the corresponding Thickness of Parts on each Side of\nthe Body._\n\n\n/The/ thickness or breadth of the parts in the human body will never be\nequal on each side, if the corresponding members do not move equally\nand alike.LXX./--_Of the Motions of Animals._\n\n\n/All/ bipeds in their motions lower the part immediately over the foot\nthat is raised, more than over that resting on the ground, and the\nhighest parts do just the contrary.This is observable in the hips and\nshoulders of a man when he walks; and also in birds in the head and\nrump.LXXI./--_Of Quadrupeds and their Motions._\n\n\n/The/ highest parts of quadrupeds are susceptible of more variation\nwhen they walk, than when they are still, in a greater or less degree,\nin proportion to their size.This proceeds from the oblique position of\ntheir legs when they touch the ground, which raise the animal when they\nbecome straight and perpendicular upon the ground.LXXII./--_Of the Quickness or Slowness of Motion._\n\n\n/The/ motion performed by a man, or any other animal whatever, in\nwalking, will have more or less velocity as the centre of their weight\nis more or less removed from the centre of that foot upon which they\nare supported.LXXIII./--_Of the Motion of Animals._\n\n\n/That/ figure will appear the swiftest in its course which leans the\nmost forwards.Any body, moving of itself, will do it with more or less velocity\nin proportion as the centre of its gravity is more or less removed\nfrom the centre of its support.This is mentioned chiefly in regard\nto the motion of birds, which, without any clapping of their wings,\nor assistance of wind, move themselves.This happens when the centre\nof their gravity is out of the centre of their support, viz.out of\nits usual residence, the middle between the two wings.Because, if\nthe middle of the wings be more backward than the centre of the whole\nweight, the bird will move forwards and downwards, in a greater or\nless degree as the centre of its weight is more or less removed from\nthe middle of its wings.From which it follows, that if the centre of\ngravity be far removed from the other centre, the descent of the bird\nwill be very oblique; but if that centre be near the middle of the\nwings, the descent will have very little obliquity._London, Published by J.

Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 33_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.John moved to the office.LXXIX./--_In what Manner extending one Arm alters the Balance._\n\n\n/The/ extending of the arm, which was bent, removes the weight of the\nfigure upon the foot which bears the weight of the whole body: as is\nobservable in rope-dancers, who dance upon the rope with their arms\nopen, without any pole.LXXX./--_Of a Man bearing a Weight on his Shoulders_, Plate X./The/ shoulder which bears the weight is always higher than the other.This is seen in the figure opposite, in which the centre line passes\nthrough the whole, with an equal weight on each side, to the leg on\nwhich it rests.If the weight were not equally divided on each side\nof this central line of gravity, the whole would fall to the ground.But Nature has provided, that as much of the natural weight of the man\nshould be thrown on one side, as of accidental weight on the other,\nto form a counterpoise.This is effected by the man's bending, and\nleaning on the side not loaded, so as to form an equilibrium to the\naccidental weight he carries; and this cannot be done, unless the\nloaded shoulder be raised, and the other lowered.This is the resource\nwith which Nature has furnished a man on such occasions.LXXXI./--_Of Equilibrium._\n\n\n/Any/ figure bearing an additional weight out of the central line, must\nthrow as much natural or accidental weight on the opposite side as is\nsufficient to form a counterpoise round that line, which passes from\nthe pit of the neck, through the whole mass of weight, to that part\nof the foot which rests upon the ground.We observe, that when a man\nlifts a weight with one arm, he naturally throws out the opposite arm;\nand if that be not enough to form an equipoise, he will add as much of\nhis own weight, by bending his body, as will enable him to resist such\naccidental load.We see also, that a man ready to fall sideways and\nbackwards at the same time, always throws out the arm on the opposite\nside.LXXXII./--_Of Motion._\n\n\n/Whether/ a man moves with velocity or slowness, the parts above the\nleg which sustains the weight, will always be lower than the others on\nthe opposite side.LXXXIII./--_The Level of the Shoulders._\n\n\n/The/ shoulders or sides of a man, or any other animal, will preserve\nless of their level, in proportion to the slowness of their motion;\nand, _vice versa_, those parts will lose less of their level when the\nmotion is quicker.This is proved by the ninth proposition, treating of\nlocal motions, where it is said, any weight will press in the direction\nof the line of its motion; therefore the whole moving towards any one\npoint, the parts belonging to it will follow the shortest line of the\nmotion of its whole, without giving any of its weight to the collateral\nparts of the whole._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 35_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 35_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LXXXIV./--_Objection to the above answered_, Plate XI./It/ has been objected, in regard to the first part of the above\nproposition, that it does not follow that a man standing still, or\nmoving slowly, has his members always in perfect balance upon the\ncentre of gravity; because we do not find that Nature always follows\nthat rule, but, on the contrary, the figure will sometimes bend\nsideways, standing upon one foot; sometimes it will rest part of its\nweight upon that leg which is bent at the knee, as is seen in the\nfigures B C. But I shall reply thus, that what is not performed by the\nshoulders in the figure C, is done by the hip, as is demonstrated in\nanother place.LXXXV./--_Of the Position of Figures_, Plate XIII./In/ the same proportion as that part of the naked figure marked D A,\nlessens in height from the shoulder to the hip, on account of its\nposition the opposite side increases.And this is the reason: the\nfigure resting upon one (suppose the left) foot, that foot becomes the\ncentre of all the weight above; and the pit of the neck, formed by the\njunction of the two Clavicles, quits also its natural situation at the\nupper extremity of the perpendicular line (which passes through the\nmiddle surface of the body), to bend over the same foot; and as this\nline bends with it, it forces the transverse lines, which are always at\nright angles, to lower their extremities on that side where the foot\nrests, as appears in A B C. The navel and middle parts always preserve\ntheir natural height.LXXXVI./--_Of the Joints._\n\n\n/In/ the bending of the joints it is particularly useful to observe the\ndifference and variety of shape they assume; how the muscles swell on\none side, while they flatten on the other; and this is more apparent in\nthe neck, because the motion of it is of three sorts, two of which are\nsimple motions, and the other complex, participating also of the other\ntwo.The simple motions are, first, when the neck bends towards the\nshoulder, either to the right or left, and when it raises or lowers\nthe head.The second is, when it twists to the right or left, without\nrising or bending, but straight, with the head turned towards one of\nthe shoulders.The third motion, which is called complex, is, when to\nthe bending of it is added the twisting, as when the ear leans towards\none of the shoulders, the head turning the same way, and the face\nturned upwards.LXXXVII./--_Of the Shoulders._\n\n\n/Of/ those which the shoulders can perform, simple motions are the\nprincipal, such as moving the arm upwards and downwards, backwards and\nforwards.Sandra went to the bathroom.Though one might almost call those motions infinite, for if\nthe arm can trace a circle upon a wall, it will have performed all the\nmotions belonging to the shoulders.Every continued quantity being\ndivisible _ad infinitum_, and this circle being a continued quantity,\nproduced by the motion of the arm going through every part of the\ncircumference, it follows, that the motions of the shoulders may also be\nsaid to be infinite._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.LXXXVIII./--_Of the Motions of a Man._\n\n\n/When/ you mean to represent a man removing a weight, consider that the\nmotions are various, viz.either a simple motion, by bending himself\nto raise the weight from the ground upwards, or when he drags the\nweight after him, or pushes it before him, or pulls it down with a rope\npassing through a pulley.It is to be observed, that the weight of the\nman's body pulls the more in proportion as the centre of his gravity\nis removed from the centre of his support.To this must be added the\nstrength of the effort that the legs and back make when they are bent,\nto return to their natural straight situation.A man never ascends or descends, nor walks at all in any direction,\nwithout raising the heel of the back foot.LXXXIX./--_Of the Disposition of Members preparing to act with\ngreat Force_, Plate XIV./When/ a man prepares himself to strike a violent blow, he bends and\ntwists his body as far as he can to the side contrary to that which\nhe means to strike, and collecting all his strength, he, by a complex\nmotion, returns and falls upon the point he has in view[21].XC./--_Of throwing any Thing with Violence_, Plate XV./A man/ throwing a dart, a stone, or any thing else with violence,\nmay be represented, chiefly, two different ways; that is, he may be\npreparing to do it, or the act may be already performed.If you mean to\nplace him in the act of preparation, the inside of the foot upon which\nhe rests will be under the perpendicular line of the pit of the neck;\nand if it be the right foot, the left shoulder will be perpendicular\nover the toes of the same foot.XCI./--_On the Motion of driving any Thing into or drawing it\nout of the Ground._\n\n\n/He/ who wishes to pitch a pole into the ground, or draw one out of it,\nwill raise the leg and bend the knee opposite to the arm which acts,\nin order to balance himself upon the foot that rests, without which he\ncould neither drive in, nor pull out any thing.XCII./--_Of forcible Motions_, Plate XVI./Of/ the two arms, that will be most powerful in its effort, which,\nhaving been farthest removed from its natural situation, is assisted\nmore strongly by the other parts to bring it to the place where it\nmeans to go.As the man A, who moves the arm with a club E, and brings\nit to the opposite side B, assisted by the motion of the whole body._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n[Illustration:\n_Page 39_._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.XCIII./--_The Action of Jumping._\n\n\n/Nature/ will of itself, and without any reasoning in the mind of a man\ngoing to jump, prompt him to raise his arms and shoulders by a sudden\nmotion, together with a great part of his body, and to lift them up\nhigh, till the power of the effort subsides.This impetuous motion\nis accompanied by an instantaneous extension of the body which had\nbent itself, like a spring or bow, along the back, the joints of the\nthighs, knees, and feet, and is let off obliquely, that is, upwards\nand forwards; so that the disposition of the body tending forwards\nand upwards, makes it describe a great arch when it springs up, which\nincreases the leap.XCIV./--_Of the three Motions in jumping upwards._\n\n\n/When/ a man jumps upwards, the motion of the head is three times\nquicker than that of the heel, before the extremity of the foot quits\nthe ground, and twice as quick as that of the hips; because three\nangles are opened and extended at the same time: the superior one is\nthat formed by the body at its joint with the thigh before, the second\nis at the joint of the thighs and legs behind, and the third is at the\ninstep before[22].XCV./--_Of the easy Motions of Members._\n\n\n/In/ regard to the freedom and ease of motions, it is very necessary\nto observe, that when you mean to represent a figure which has to turn\nitself a little round, the feet and all the other members are not to\nmove in the same direction as the head.But you will divide that motion\namong four joints, viz.the feet, the knees, the hips, and the neck.If it rests upon the right leg, the left knee should be a little bent\ninward, with its foot somewhat raised outward.The left shoulder should\nbe lower than the other, and the nape of the neck turned on the same\nside as the outward ankle of the left foot, and the left shoulder\nperpendicular over the great toe of the right foot.And take it as a\ngeneral maxim, that figures do not turn their heads straight with the\nchest, Nature having for our convenience formed the neck so as to turn\nwith ease on every side, when the eyes want to look round; and to this\nthe other joints are in some measure subservient.If the figure be\nsitting, and the arms have some employment across the body, the breast\nwill turn over the joint of the hip._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]\n\n\n\n\n/Chap.XCVI./--_The greatest Twist which a Man can make, in turning to\nlook at himself behind._ Plate XVII./The/ greatest twist that the body can perform is when the back of\nthe heels and the front of the face are seen at the same time.It is\nnot done without difficulty, and is effected by bending the leg and\nlowering the shoulder on that side towards which the head turns.The\ncause of this motion, and also which of the muscles move first and\nwhich last, I shall explain in my treatise on anatomy[23].XCVII./--_Of turning the Leg without the Thigh._\n\n\n/It/ is impossible to turn the leg inwards or outwards without turning\nthe thigh by the same motion, because the setting in of the bones at\nthe knee is such, that they have no motion but backwards and forwards,\nand no more than is necessary for walking or kneeling; never sideways,\nbecause the form of the bones at the joint of the knee does not allow\nit.If this joint had been made pliable on all sides, as that of the\nshoulder, or that of the thigh bone with the hip, a man would have\nhad his legs bent on each side as often as backwards and forwards,\nand seldom or never straight with the thigh.Besides, this joint can\nbend only one way, so that in walking it can never go beyond the\nstraight line of the leg; it bends only forwards, for if it could bend\nbackwards, a man could never get up again upon his feet, if once he\nwere kneeling; as when he means to get up from the kneeling posture (on\nboth knees), he gives the whole weight of his body to one of the knees\nto support, unloading the other, which at that time feels no other\nweight than its own, and therefore is lifted up with ease, and rests\nhis foot flat upon the ground; then returning the whole weight upon\nthat foot, and leaning his hand upon his knee, he at once extends the\nother arm, raises his head, and straightening the thigh with the body,\nhe springs up, and rests upon the same foot, while he brings up the\nother.XCVIII./--_Postures of Figures._\n\n\n/Figures/ that are set in a fixed attitude, are nevertheless to have\nsome contrast of parts.If one arm come before, the other remains\nstill or goes behind.If the figure rest upon one leg, the shoulder on\nthat side will be lower than the other.This is observed by artists\nof judgment, who always take care to balance the figure well upon its\nfeet, for fear it should appear to fall.Because by resting upon one\nfoot, the other leg, being a little bent, does not support the body any\nmore than if it were dead; therefore it is necessary that the parts\nabove that leg should transfer the centre of their weight upon the leg\nwhich supports the body.XCIX./--_Of the Gracefulness of the Members._\n\n\n/The/ members are to be suited to the body in graceful motions,\nexpressive of the meaning which the figure is intended to convey.If it had to give the idea of genteel and agreeable carriage, the\nmembers must be slender and well turned, but not lean; the muscles very\nslightly marked, indicating in a soft manner such as must necessarily\nappear; the arms, particularly, pliant, and no member in a straight\nline with any other adjoining member.If it happen, on account of the\nmotion of the figure, that the right hip be higher than the left, make\nthe joint of the shoulder fall perpendicularly on the highest part of\nthat hip; and let that right shoulder be lower than the left.The pit\nof the neck will always be perpendicular over the middle of the instep\nof the foot that supports the body.The leg that does not bear will\nhave its knee a little lower than the other, and near the other leg.In proportion to the height and size of the\nbuilding, and therefore to the size of its doors, will be the thickness\nof its walls, especially at the foundation, that is to say, beside the\ndoors; and also in proportion to the numbers of a crowd will be the\nunruliness and pressure of it.Hence, partly in necessity and partly in\nprudence, the splaying or chamfering of the jamb of the larger door will\nbe deepened, and, if possible, made at a larger angle for the large door\nthan for the small one; so that the large door will always be\nencompassed by a visible breadth of jamb proportioned to its own\nmagnitude.The decorative value of this feature we shall see hereafter.X. The second kind of apertures we have to examine are those of\nwindows.Window apertures are mainly of two kinds; those for outlook, and those\nfor inlet of light, many being for both purposes, and either purpose, or\nboth, combined in military architecture with those of offence and\ndefence.But all window apertures, as compared with door apertures, have\nalmost infinite licence of form and size: they may be of any shape, from\nthe slit or cross slit to the circle;[56] of any size, from the loophole\nof the castle to the pillars of light of the cathedral apse.Yet,\naccording to their place and purpose, one or two laws of fitness hold\nrespecting them, which let us examine in the two classes of windows\nsuccessively, but without reference to military architecture, which\nhere, as before, we may dismiss as a subject of separate science, only\nnoticing that windows, like all other features, are always delightful,\nif not beautiful, when their position and shape have indeed been thus\nnecessarily determined, and that many of their most picturesque forms\nhave resulted from the requirements of war.We should also find in\nmilitary architecture the typical forms of the two classes of outlet and\ninlet windows in their utmost development; the greatest sweep of sight\nand range of shot on the one hand, and the fullest entry of light and\nair on the other, being constantly required at the smallest possible\napertures.Our business, however, is to reason out the laws for\nourselves, not to take the examples as we find them.For these no general outline is\ndeterminable by the necessities or inconveniences of outlooking, except\nonly that the bottom or sill of the windows, at whatever height, should\nbe horizontal, for the convenience of leaning on it, or standing on it\nif the window be to the ground.The form of the upper part of the window\nis quite immaterial, for all windows allow a greater range of sight\nwhen they are _approached_ than that of the eye itself: it is the\napproachability of the window, that is to say, the annihilation of the\nthickness of the wall, which is the real point to be attended to.If,\ntherefore, the aperture be inaccessible, or so small that the thickness\nof the wall cannot be entered, the wall is to be bevelled[57] on the\noutside, so as to increase the range of sight as far as possible; if the\naperture can be entered, then bevelled from the point to which entrance is\npossible.The bevelling will, if possible, be in every direction, that is\nto say, upwards at the top, outwards at the sides, and downwards at the\nbottom, but essentially _downwards_; the earth and the doings upon it\nbeing the chief object in outlook windows, except of observatories; and\nwhere the object is a distinct and special view downwards, it will be of\nadvantage to shelter the eye as far as possible from the rays of light\ncoming from above, and the head of the window may be left horizontal, or\neven the whole aperture sloped outwards, as the slit in a letter-box\nis inwards.The best windows for outlook are, of course, oriels and bow windows, but\nthese are not to be considered under the head of apertures merely; they\nare either balconies roofed and glazed, and to be considered under the\nhead of external appliances, or they are each a story of an external\nsemi-tower, having true aperture windows on each side of it.These windows may, of course, be of any shape\nand size whatever, according to the other necessities of the building, and\nthe quantity and direction of light desired, their purpose being now to\nthrow it in streams on particular lines or spots; now to diffuse it\neverywhere; sometimes to introduce it in broad masses, tempered in\nstrength, as in the cathedral  window; sometimes in starry\nshowers of scattered brilliancy, like the apertures in the roof of an\nArabian bath; perhaps the most beautiful of all forms being the rose,\nwhich has in it the unity of both characters, and sympathy with that of\nthe source of light itself.It is noticeable, however, that while both\nthe circle and pointed oval are beautiful window forms, it would be very\npainful to cut either of them in half and connect them by vertical\nlines, as in Fig.The reason is, I believe, that so treated, the\nupper arch is not considered as connected with the lower, and forming an\nentire figure, but as the ordinary arch roof of the aperture, and the\nlower arch as an arch _floor_, equally unnecessary and unnatural.Also"]

QUESTION: Where is Mary? 
CRUCIAL ITEMS: {'Mary': 3}
ASSOCIATED SUBGRAPH: []
EPISODIC MEMORY: ['I will relate two\ninstances of this:--When promoted, Captain Burroughs had the misfortune\nto succeed the most popular officer in the regiment in the command of\nhis company, namely, Captain Ewart (now Lieutenant-General Sir John\nAlexander Ewart, K.C.B., etc.Sandra travelled to the garden.), and, among other innovations, Burroughs\ntried to introduce certain _Polytechnique_ ideas new to the\nNinety-Third.At the first morning parade after assuming command of the\ncompany, he wished to satisfy himself that the ears of the men were\nclean inside, but being so short, he could not, even on tiptoe, raise\nhimself high enough to see; he therefore made them come to the kneeling\nposition, and went along the front rank from left to right, minutely\ninspecting the inside of every man\'s ears!The Ninety-Third were all\ntall men in those days, none being under five feet six inches even in\nthe centre of the rear rank of the battalion companies; and the right\nhand man of Burroughs\' company was a stalwart Highlander named Donald\nMacLean, who could scarcely speak English and stood about six feet three\ninches.When Burroughs examined Donald\'s ears he considered them dirty,\nand told the colour-sergeant to put Donald down for three days\' extra\ndrill.Donald, hearing this, at once sprang to his feet from the\nkneeling position and, looking down on the little captain with a look of\nwithering scorn, deliberately said, "She will take three days\' drill\nfrom a man, but not from a monkey!"Of course Donald was at once marched\nto the rear-guard a prisoner, and a charge lodged against him for\n"insubordination and insolence to Captain Burroughs at the time of\ninspection on morning parade."When the prisoner was brought before the\ncolonel he read over the charge, and, turning to Captain Burroughs,\nsaid: "This is a most serious charge, Captain Burroughs, and against an\nold soldier like Donald MacLean who has never been brought up for\npunishment before.Burroughs was ashamed to state\nthe exact words, but beat about the bush, saying that he had ordered\nMacLean three days\' drill, and that he refused to submit to the\nsentence, making use of most insolent and insubordinate language; but\nthe colonel could not get him to state the exact words used, and the\ncolour-sergeant was called as second witness.The colour-sergeant gave a\nplain, straightforward account of the ear-inspection; and when he stated\nhow MacLean had sprung to his feet on hearing the sentence of three\ndays\' drill, and had told the captain, "She will take three days\' drill\nfrom a man, but not from a monkey," the whole of the officers present\nburst into fits of laughter, and even the colonel had to hold his hand\nto his mouth.As soon as he could speak he turned on MacLean, and told\nhim that he deserved to be tried by a court-martial and so forth, but\nended by sentencing him to "three days\' grog stopped."The orderly-room\nhut was then cleared of all except the colonel, Captain Burroughs, and\nthe adjutant, and no one ever knew exactly what passed; but there was no\nrepetition of the kneeling position for ear-inspection on morning\nparade.I have already said that Burroughs had a most kindly heart, and\nfor the next three days after this incident, when the grog bugle\nsounded, Donald MacLean was as regularly called to the captain\'s tent,\nand always returned smacking his lips, and emphatically stating that\n"The captain was a Highland gentleman after all, and not a French\nmonkey."From that day forward, the little captain and the tall\ngrenadier became the best of friends, and years after, on the evening of\nthe 11th of March, 1858, when the killed and wounded were collected\nafter the capture of the Begum\'s Kothee in Lucknow, I saw Captain\nBurroughs crying like a tender-hearted woman by the side of a _dooly_ in\nwhich was stretched the dead body of Donald MacLean, who, it was said,\nreceived his death-wound defending his captain.I have the authority of\nthe late colour-sergeant of No.6 company for the statement that from\nthe date of the death of MacLean, Captain Burroughs regularly remitted\nthirty shillings a month, through the minister of her parish, to\nDonald\'s widowed mother, till the day of her death seven years after.When an action of this kind became generally known in the regiment, it\ncaused many to look with kindly feelings on most of the peculiarities of\nBurroughs.Mary moved to the bathroom.The other anecdote goes back to Camp Kamara and the spring of 1856, when\nthe Highland Brigade were lying there half-way between Balaclava and\nSebastopol.As before noticed, Burroughs was more like a Frenchman than\na Highlander; there were many of his old _Polytechnique_ chums in the\nFrench army in the Crimea, and almost every day he had some visitors\nfrom the French camp, especially after the armistice was proclaimed.Some time in the spring of 1856 Burroughs had picked up a Tartar pony\nand had got a saddle, etc., for it, but he could get no regular groom.Not being a field-officer he was not entitled to a regulation groom, and\nnot being well liked, none of his company would volunteer for the\nbillet, especially as it formed no excuse for getting off other duties.One of the company had accordingly to be detailed on fatigue duty every\nday to groom the captain\'s pony.On a particular day this duty had\nfallen to a young recruit who had lately joined by draft, a man named\nPatrick Doolan, a real Paddy of the true Handy Andy type, who had made\nhis way somehow to Glasgow and had there enlisted into the Ninety-Third.John went back to the bathroom.This day, as usual, Burroughs had visitors from the French camp, and it\nwas proposed that all should go for a ride, so Patrick Doolan was called\nto saddle the captain\'s pony.Doolan had never saddled a pony in his\nlife before, and he put the saddle on with the pommel to the tail and\nthe crupper to the front, and brought the pony thus accoutred to the\ncaptain\'s hut.Every one commenced to laugh, and Burroughs, getting into\na white heat, turned on Patrick, saying, "You fool, you have put the\nsaddle on with the back to the front!"Patrick at once saluted, and,\nwithout the least hesitation, replied, "Shure, sir, you never told me\nwhether you were to ride to Balaclava or the front."Burroughs was so\ntickled with the ready wit of the reply that from that day he took\nDoolan into his service as soldier-servant, taught him his work, and\nretained him till March, 1858, when Burroughs had to go on sick leave\non account of wounds.Burroughs was one of the last men wounded in the\ntaking of Lucknow.Some days after the Begum\'s Kothee was stormed, he\nand his company were sent to drive a lot of rebels out of a house near\nthe Kaiserbagh, and, as usual, Burroughs was well in advance of his men.Just as they were entering the place the enemy fired a mine, and the\ncaptain was sent about a hundred feet in the air; but being like a cat\n(in the matter of being difficult to kill, I mean), he fell on his feet\non the roof of a thatched hut, and escaped, with his life indeed, but\nwith one of his legs broken in two places below the knee.It was only\nthe skill of our good doctor Munro that saved his leg; but he was sent\nto England on sick leave, and before he returned I had left the regiment\nand joined the Commissariat Department.This ends my reminiscences of\nCaptain Burroughs.May he long enjoy the rank he has attained in the\npeace of his island home in Orkney!Notwithstanding his peculiarities,\nhe was a brave and plucky soldier and a most kind-hearted gentleman.By the end of March the Ninety-Third returned to camp at the Dilkoosha,\nglad to get out of the city, where we were suffocated by the stench of\nrotting corpses, and almost devoured with flies by day and mosquitoes by\nnight.The weather was now very hot and altogether uncomfortable, more\nespecially since we were without any means of bathing and could obtain\nno regular changes of clothing.By this time numbers of the townspeople had returned to the city and\nwere putting their houses in order, while thousands of _coolies_ and\nlow-caste natives were employed clearing dead bodies out of houses and\nhidden corners, and generally cleaning up the city.When we repassed the scene of our hard-contested struggle, the Begum\'s\npalace,--which, I may here remark, was actually a much stronger position\nthan the famous Redan at Sebastopol,--we found the inner ditch, that had\ngiven us so much trouble to get across, converted into a vast grave, in\nwhich the dead had been collected in thousands and then covered by the\nearth which the enemy had piled up as ramparts.All round Lucknow for\nmiles the country was covered with dead carcases of every kind,--human\nbeings, horses, camels, bullocks, and donkeys,--and for miles the\natmosphere was tainted and the swarms of flies were horrible, a positive\ntorment and a nuisance.The only comfort was that they roosted at night;\nbut at meal-times they were indescribable, and it was impossible to keep\nthem out of our food; our plates of rice would be perfectly black with\nflies, and it was surprising how we kept such good health, for we had\nlittle or no sickness during the siege of Lucknow.During the few days we remained in camp at the Dilkoosha the army was\nbroken up into movable columns, to take the field after the different\nparties of rebels and to restore order throughout Oude; for although\nLucknow had fallen, the rebellion was not by any means over; the whole\nof Oude was still against us, and had to be reconquered.The\nForty-Second, Seventy-Ninth, and Ninety-Third (the regiments which\ncomposed the famous old Highland Brigade of the Crimea) were once more\nformed into one brigade, and with a regiment of Punjab Infantry and a\nstrong force of engineers, the Ninth Lancers, a regiment of native\ncavalry, a strong force of artillery, both light and heavy,--in brief,\nas fine a little army as ever took the field, under the command of\nGeneral Walpole, with Adrian Hope as brigadier,--was detailed for the\nadvance into Rohilcund for the recapture of Bareilly, where a large army\nstill held together under Khan Bahadoor Khan.Every one in the camp\nexpressed surprise that Sir Colin should entrust his favourite\nHighlanders to Walpole.On the morning of the 7th of April, 1858, the time had at last arrived\nwhen we were to leave Lucknow, and the change was hailed by us with\ndelight.We were glad to get away from the captured city, with its\nhorrible smells and still more horrible sights, and looked forward with\npositive pleasure to a hot-weather campaign in Rohilcund.We were to\nadvance on Bareilly by a route parallel with the course of the Ganges,\nso striking our tents at 2 A.M.we marched through the city\nalong the right bank of the Goomtee, past the Moosabagh, where our first\nhalt was made, about five miles out of Lucknow, in the midst of fresh\nfields, away from all the offensive odours and the myriads of flies.One\ninstance will suffice to give my readers some idea of the torment we\nsuffered from these pests.When we struck tents all the flies were\nroosting in the roofs; when the tents were rolled up the flies got\ncrushed and killed by bushels, and no one who has not seen such a sight\nwould credit the state of the inside of our tents when opened out to be\nrepitched on the new ground.After the tents were pitched and the roofs\nswept down, the sweepers of each company were called to collect the dead\nflies and carry them out of the camp.I noted down the quantity of flies\ncarried out of my own tent.The ordinary kitchen-baskets served out to\nthe regimental cooks by the commissariat for carrying bread, rice, etc.,\nwill hold about an imperial bushel, and from one tent there were carried\nout five basketfuls of dead flies.The sight gave one a practical idea\nof one of the ten plagues of Egypt!Being now rid of the flies we could\nlie down during the heat of the day, and have a sleep without being\ntormented.The defeated army of Lucknow had flocked into Rohilcund, and a large\nforce was reported to be collected in Bareilly under Khan Bahadoor Khan\nand Prince Feroze Shah.The following is a copy of one of Khan Bahadoor\nKhan\'s proclamations for the harassment of our advance: "Do not attempt\nto meet the regular columns of the infidels, because they are superior\nto you in discipline and have more guns; but watch their movements;\nguard all the _ghats_ on the rivers, intercept their communications;\nstop their supplies; cut up their piquets and _daks_; keep constantly\nhanging about their camps; give them no rest!"These were, no doubt,\nthe correct tactics; it was the old Mahratta policy revived.However,\nnothing came of it, and our advance was unopposed till we reached the\njungle fort of Nirput Singh, the Rajpoot chief of Rooyah, near the\nvillage of Rhodamow.I was in the\nadvance-guard under command of a young officer who had just come out\nfrom home as a cadet in the H.E.I.Company\'s service, and there being no\nCompany\'s regiments for him, he was attached to the Ninety-Third before\nwe left Lucknow.His name was Wace, a tall young lad of, I suppose,\nsixteen or seventeen years of age.I don\'t remember him before that\nmorning, but he was most anxious for a fight, and I recollect that\nbefore we marched off our camping-ground, Brigadier Hope called up young\nMr.Wace, and gave him instructions about moving along with great\ncaution with about a dozen picked men for the leading section of the\nadvance-guard.We advanced without opposition till sunrise, and then we came in sight\nof an outpost of the enemy about three miles from the fort; but as soon\nas they saw us they retired, and word was passed back to the column.Shortly afterwards instructions came for the advance-guard to wait for\nthe main column, and I remember young Mr.Wace going up to the\nbrigadier, and asking to be permitted to lead the assault on the fort,\nshould it come to a fight.At this time a summons to surrender had been\nsent to the Raja, but he vouchsafed no reply, and, as we advanced, a\n9-pounder shot was fired at the head of the column, killing a drummer\nof the Forty-Second.The attack on the fort then commenced, without any\nattempt being made to reconnoitre the position, and ended in a most\nsevere loss, Brigadier Hope being among the killed.Lieutenant\nWilloughby, who commanded the Sikhs,--a brother of the officer who blew\nup the powder-magazine at Delhi, rather than let it fall into the hands\nof the enemy,--was also killed; as were Lieutenants Douglas and Bramley\nof the Forty-Second, with nearly one hundred men, Highlanders and Sikhs.John went to the hallway.Hope was shot from a high tree inside the fort, and, at the time, it was\nbelieved that the man who shot him was a European.[43] After we retired\nfrom the fort the excitement was so great among the men of the\nForty-Second and Ninety-Third, owing to the sacrifice of so many\nofficers and men through sheer mismanagement, that if the officers had\ngiven the men the least encouragement, I am convinced they would have\nturned out in a body and hanged General Walpole.The officers who were\nkilled were all most popular men; but the great loss sustained by the\ndeath of Adrian Hope positively excited the men to fury.So heated was\nthe feeling on the night the dead were buried, that if any\nnon-commissioned officer had dared to take the lead, the life of General\nWalpole would not have been worth half an hour\'s purchase.After the force retired,--for we actually retired!--from Rooyah on the\nevening of the 15th of April, we encamped about two miles from the\nplace, and a number of our dead were left in the ditch, mostly\nForty-Second and Sikhs; and, so far as I am aware, no attempt was made\nto invest the fort or to keep the enemy in.They took advantage of this\nto retreat during the night; but this they did leisurely, burning their\nown dead, and stripping and mutilating those of our force that were\nabandoned in the ditch.It was reported in the camp that Colonel Haggard\nof the Ninth Lancers, commanding the cavalry brigade, had proposed to\ninvest the place, but was not allowed to do so by General Walpole, who\nwas said to have acted in such a pig-headed manner that the officers\nconsidered him insane.Rumour added that when Colonel Haggard and a\nsquadron of the Lancers went to reconnoitre the place on the morning of\nthe 16th, it was found empty; and that when Colonel Haggard sent an\naide-de-camp to report this fact to the general, he had replied, "Thank\nGod!"appearing glad that Raja Nirput Singh and his force had slipped\nthrough his fingers after beating back the best-equipped movable column\nin India.These reports gaining currency in the camp made the general\nstill more unpopular, because, in addition to his incapability as an\nofficer, the men put him down as a coward.During the day the mutilated bodies of our men were recovered from the\nditch.The Sikhs burnt theirs, while a large fatigue party of the\nForty-Second and Ninety-Third was employed digging one long grave in a\n_tope_ of trees not far from the camp.About four o\'clock in the\nafternoon the funeral took place, Brigadier Hope and the officers on\nthe right, wrapped in their tartan plaids, the non-commissioned officers\nand the privates on their left, each sewn up in a blanket.Cowie, whom we of the Ninety-Third had nicknamed "the Fighting Padre,"\nafterwards Bishop of Auckland, New Zealand, and the Rev.Ross,\nchaplain of the Forty-Second, conducted the service, Mr.Ross reading\nthe ninetieth Psalm and Mr.The pipers of\nthe Forty-Second and Ninety-Third, with muffled drums, played _The\nFlowers of the Forest_ as a dead march.In all my experience in the army\nor out of it I never witnessed such intense grief, both among officers\nand men, as was expressed at this funeral.Many of all ranks sobbed like\ntender-hearted women.I especially remember our surgeon, "kind-hearted\nBilly Munro" as the men called him; also Lieutenants Archie Butter and\nDick Cunningham, who were aides-de-camp to Adrian Hope.Cunningham had\nrejoined the regiment after recovery from his wounds at Kudjwa in\nOctober, 1857, but they had left him too lame to march, and he was a\nsupernumerary aide-de-camp to Brigadier Hope; he and Butter were both\nalongside the brigadier, I believe, when he was struck down by the\nrenegade ruffian.We halted during the 17th, and strong fatigue-parties were employed with\nthe engineers destroying the fort by blowing up the gateways.The place\nwas ever after known in the Ninety-Third as "Walpole\'s Castle."On the\n18th we marched, and on the 22nd we came upon the retreating rebels at\na place called Sirsa, on the Ramgunga.The Ninth Lancers and\nHorse-Artillery and two companies of the Ninety-Third (I forget their\nnumbers) crossed the Ramgunga by a ford and intercepted the retreat of a\nlarge number of the enemy, who were escaping by a bridge of boats, the\nmaterial for which the country people had collected for them.But their\nretreat was now completely cut off, and about three hundred of them were\nreported either killed or drowned in the Ramgunga.a tremendous sandstorm, with thunder, and rain in\ntorrents, came on.The Ramgunga became so swollen that it was impossible\nfor the detachment of the Ninety-Third to recross, and they bivouacked\nin a deserted village on the opposite side, without tents, the officers\nhailing across that they could make themselves very comfortable for the\nnight if they could only get some tea and sugar, as the men had\nbiscuits, and they had secured a quantity of flour and some goats in the\nvillage.But the boats which the enemy had collected had all broken\nadrift, and there was apparently no possibility of sending anything\nacross to our comrades.This dilemma evoked an act of real cool pluck on\nthe part of our commissariat _gomashta_,[44] _baboo_ Hera Lall\nChatterjee, whom I have before mentioned in my seventh chapter in\nreference to the plunder of a cartload of biscuits at Bunnee bridge on\nthe retreat from Lucknow.By this time Hera Lall had become better\nacquainted with the "wild Highlanders," and was even ready to risk his\nlife to carry a ration of tea and sugar to them.This he made into a\nbundle, which he tied on the crown of his head, and although several of\nthe officers tried to dissuade him from the attempt, he tightened his\n_chudder_[45] round his waist, and declaring that he had often swum the\nHooghly, and that the Ramgunga should not deprive the officers and men\nof a detachment of his regiment of their tea, he plunged into the river,\nand safely reached the other side with his precious freight on his head!This little incident was never forgotten in the regiment so long as Hera\nLall remained the commissariat _gomashta_ of the Ninety-Third.He was\nthen a young man, certainly not more than twenty.Although thirty-five\nmore years of rough-and-tumble life have now considerably grizzled his\nappearance, he must often look back with pride to that stormy April\nevening in 1858, when he risked his life in the Ramgunga to carry a\ntin-pot of tea to the British soldiers.Among the enemy killed that day were several wearing the uniforms\nstripped from the dead of the Forty-Second in the ditch of Rooyah; so,\nof course, we concluded that this was Nirput Singh\'s force, and the\ndefeat and capture of its guns in some measure, I have no doubt,\nre-established General Walpole in the good opinion of the authorities,\nbut not much in that of the force under his command.Nothing else of consequence occurred till about the 27th of April, when\nour force rejoined the Commander-in-Chief\'s column, which had advanced\n_via_ Futtehghur, and we heard that Sir William Peel had died of\nsmallpox at Cawnpore on his way to Calcutta.The news went through the\ncamp from regiment to regiment, and caused almost as much sorrow in the\nNinety-Third as the death of poor Adrian Hope.FOOTNOTES:\n\n[43] See Appendix B.[44] Native assistant in charge of stores.[45] A wrapper worn by Bengalee men and up-country women.CHAPTER XV\n\nBATTLE OF BAREILLY--GHAZIS--A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT--HALT AT BAREILLY\n--ACTIONS OF POSGAON, RUSSOOLPORE, AND NOWRUNGABAD--REST AT LAST!The heat was now very oppressive, and we had many men struck down by the\nsun every day.We reached Shahjehanpore on the 30th of April, and found\nthat every building in the cantonments fit for sheltering European\ntroops had been destroyed by order of the Nana Sahib, who, however, did\nnot himself wait for our arrival.Strange to say, the bridge of boats\nacross the Ramgunga was not destroyed, and some of the buildings in the\njail, and the wall round it, were still standing.Colonel Hale and a\nwing of the Eighty-Second were left here with some guns, to make the\nbest of their position in the jail, which partly dominated the city.The\nShahjehanpore distillery was mostly destroyed, but the native distillers\nhad been working it, and there was a large quantity of rum still in the\nvats, which was found to be good and was consequently annexed by the\ncommissariat.On the 2nd of May we left Shahjehanpore _en route_ for Bareilly, and on\nthe next day reached Futtehgunge Every village was totally deserted,\nbut no plundering was allowed, and any camp-followers found marauding\nwere soon tied up by the provost-marshal\'s staff.Proclamations were\nsent everywhere for the people to remain in their villages, but without\nany effect.Two days later we reached Furreedpore, which we also found\ndeserted, but with evident signs that the enemy were near; and our\nbazaars were full of reports of the great strength of the army of Khan\nBahadoor Khan and Feroze Shah.The usual estimate was thirty thousand\ninfantry, twenty-five thousand cavalry, and about three hundred guns,\namong which was said to be a famous black battery that had beaten the\nEuropean artillery at ball-practice a few months before they mutinied at\nMeerut.The left wing of the Ninety-Third was thrown out, with a\nsquadron of the Lancers and Tombs\' battery, as the advance piquet.Mary moved to the kitchen.As\ndarkness set in we could see the fires of the enemy\'s outposts, their\npatrol advancing quite close to our sentries during the night, but\nmaking no attack.on the 5th of May, according to Sir Colin\'s usual\nplan, three days\' rations were served out, and the whole force was under\narms and slowly advancing before daylight.By sunrise we could see the\nenemy drawn up on the plain some five miles from Bareilly, in front of\nwhat had been the native lines; but as we advanced, they retired.By\nnoon we had crossed the nullah in front of the old cantonments, and,\nexcept by sending round-shot among us at long distances, which did not\ndo much harm, the enemy did not dispute our advance.John went to the bedroom.We were halted in\nthe middle of a bare, sandy plain, and we of the rank and file then got\nto understand why the enemy were apparently in some confusion; we could\nhear the guns of Brigadier Jones ("Jones the Avenger" as he was called)\nhammering at them on the other side.The Ninety-Third formed the extreme\nright of the front line of infantry with a squadron of the Lancers and\nTombs\' battery of horse-artillery.The heat was intense, and when about\ntwo o\'clock a movement in the mango _topes_ in our front caused the\norder to stand to our arms, it attained such a pitch that the barrels of\nour rifles could not be touched by our bare hands!The Sikhs and our light company advanced in skirmishing order, when some\nseven to eight hundred matchlock-men opened fire on them, and all at\nonce a most furious charge was made by a body of about three hundred and\nsixty Rohilla Ghazis, who rushed out, shouting "_Bismillah!Deen!_" Sir Colin was close by, and called out, "Ghazis,\nGhazis!However, they\ninclined to our left, and only a few came on to the Ninety-Third, and\nthese were mostly bayoneted by the light company which was extended in\nfront of the line.The main body rushed on the centre of the\nForty-Second; but as soon as he saw them change their direction Sir\nColin galloped on, shouting out, "Close up, Forty-Second!But that was not so easily done; the Ghazis charged in\nblind fury, with their round shields on their left arms, their bodies\nbent low, waving their _tulwars_ over their heads, throwing themselves\nunder the bayonets, and cutting at the men\'s legs.Colonel Cameron, of\nthe Forty-Second, was pulled from his horse by a Ghazi, who leaped up\nand seized him by the collar while he was engaged with another on the\nopposite side; but his life was saved by Colour-Sergeant Gardener, who\nseized one of the enemy\'s _tulwars_, and rushing to the colonel\'s\nassistance cut off the Ghazi\'s head.General Walpole was also pulled off\nhis horse and received two sword-cuts, but was rescued by the bayonets\nof the Forty-Second.The struggle was short, but every one of the Ghazis\nwas killed.None attempted to escape; they had evidently come on to kill\nor be killed, and a hundred and thirty-three lay in one circle right in\nfront of the colours of the Forty-Second.The Commander-in-Chief himself saw one of the Ghazis, who had broken\nthrough the line, lying down, shamming dead.Sir Colin caught the glance\nof his eye, saw through the ruse, and called to one of the Forty-Second,\n"Bayonet that man!"But the Ghazi was enveloped in a thick quilted tunic\nof green silk, through which the blunt Enfield bayonet would not pass,\nand the Highlander was in danger of being cut down, when a Sikh\n_sirdar_[46] of the Fourth Punjabis rushed to his assistance, and took\nthe Ghazi\'s head clean off with one sweep of his keen _tulwar_.These\nGhazis, with a very few exceptions, were gray-bearded men of the Rohilla\nrace, clad in green, with green turbans and _kummerbunds_,[47] round\nshields on the left arm, and curved _tulwars_ that would split a hair.Sandra travelled to the hallway.They only succeeded in wounding about twenty men--they threw themselves\nso wildly on the bayonets of the Forty-Second!One of them, an exception\nto the majority, was quite a youth, and having got separated from the\nrest challenged the whole of the line to come out and fight him.Joiner, the quartermaster of the Ninety-Third, firing his\ncarbine, but missing.Joiner returned the fire with his revolver,\nand the Ghazi then threw away his carbine and rushed at Joiner with his\n_tulwar_.Some of the light company tried to take the youngster\nprisoner, but it was no use; he cut at every one so madly, that they had\nto bayonet him.The commotion caused by this attack was barely over, when word was\npassed that the enemy were concentrating in front for another rush, and\nthe order was given for the spare ammunition to be brought to the front.I was detached with about a dozen men of No.7 company to find the\nammunition-guard, and bring our ammunition in rear of the line.Just as\nI reached the ammunition-camels, a large force of the rebel cavalry, led\nby Feroze Shah in person, swept round the flank and among the baggage,\ncutting down camels, camel-drivers, and camp-followers in all\ndirections.My detachment united with the ammunition-guard and defended\nourselves, shooting down a number of the enemy\'s _sowars_.Ross, chaplain of the Forty-Second, running for his life,\ndodging round camels and bullocks with a rebel _sowar_ after him, till,\nseeing our detachment, he rushed to us for protection, calling out,\n"Ninety-Third, shoot that impertinent fellow!"Bob Johnston, of my\ncompany, shot the _sowar_ down.Ross had no sword nor revolver, and\nnot even a stick with which to defend himself.Moral--When in the field,\n_padres_, carry a good revolver!Ross gained\nour protection, we saw Mr.Russell, of _The Times_, who was ill and\nunable to walk from the kick of a horse, trying to escape on horseback.He had got out of his _dooly_, undressed and bareheaded as he was, and\nleaped into the saddle, as the _syce_ had been leading his horse near\nhim.Several of the enemy\'s _sowars_ were dodging through the camels to\nget at him.We turned our rifles on them, and I shot down the one\nnearest to Mr.Russell, just as he had cut down an intervening\ncamel-driver and was making for "Our Special"; in fact, his _tulwar_ was\nactually lifted to swoop down on Mr.Russell\'s bare head when my bullet\nput a stop to his proceedings.Mary went to the hallway.Russell tumble from his saddle\nat the same instant as the _sowar_ fell, and I got a rare fright, for I\nthought my bullet must have struck both.Russell had fallen, and I then saw from the position of the slain\n_sowar_ that my bullet had found its proper billet, and that Mr.Russell\nwas down with sunstroke, the blood flowing freely from his nose.Our Mooltanee Irregulars were after the enemy, and\nI had to hasten to the line with the spare ammunition; but before I left\nMr.Russell to his fate, I called some of the Forty-Second\nbaggage-guards to put him into his _dooly_']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The text mentions that Sandra travelled to the hallway. However, it does not mention Mary travelling anywhere. It only mentions "Mary went to the hallway." after mentioning Sandra going to the same place. This implies that Mary is also in the hallway.
Direct answer: hallway
