EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Grandmother told her that if she and Grandfather had been\nwasteful in their younger days, we would not have any silk dresses to\nwear now.Anna said if that was the case she was glad that Grandmother\nsaved the basting thread!1866\n\n_February_ 13.--Our brother James was married to-day to Louise\nLivingston James of New York City._February_ 20.--Our society is going to hold a fair for the Freedmen, in\nthe Town Hall.Susie Daggett and I have been there all day to see about\nthe tables and stoves._February_ 21.--Been at the hall all day, trimming the room.Backus came down and if they had not helped us we would\nnot have done much.Backus put up all the principal drapery and made\nit look beautiful._February_ 22.--At the hall all day.We had\nquite a crowd in the evening and took in over three hundred dollars.Charlie Hills and Ellsworth Daggett stayed there all night to take care\nof the hall.We had a fish pond, a grab-bag and a post-office.Anna says\nthey had all the smart people in the post-office to write the\nletters,--Mr.Morse, Miss Achert, Albert Granger and herself.Some one\nasked Albert Granger if his law business was good and he said one man\nthronged into his office one day._February_ 23.--We took in two hundred dollars to-day at the fair.George Willson if she could not\nwrite a poem expressing our thanks to Mr.Backus and she stepped aside\nfor about five minutes and handed us the following lines which we sent\nto him.We think it is about the nicest thing in the whole fair."In ancient time the God of Wine\n    They crowned with vintage of the vine,\n    And sung his praise with song and glee\n    And all their best of minstrelsy.The Backus whom we honor now\n    Would scorn to wreathe his generous brow\n    With heathen emblems--better he\n    Will love our gratitude to see\n    Expressed in all the happy faces\n    Assembled in these pleasant places.May joy attend his footsteps here\n    And crown him in a brighter sphere."_February_ 24.--Susie Daggett and I went to the hall this morning to\nclean up.We sent back the dishes, not one broken, and disposed of\neverything but the tables and stoves, which were to be taken away this\nafternoon.We feel quite satisfied with the receipts so far, but the\nexpenses will be considerable.In _Ontario County Times_ of the following week we find this card of\nthanks:\n\n_February_ 28.--The Fair for the benefit of the Freedmen, held in the\nTown Hall on Thursday and Friday of last week was eminently successful,\nand the young ladies take this method of returning their sincere thanks\nto the people of Canandaigua and vicinity for their generous\ncontributions and liberal patronage.It being the first public\nenterprise in which the Society has ventured independently, the young\nladies were somewhat fearful of the result, but having met with such\ngenerous responses from every quarter they feel assured that they need\nnever again doubt of success in any similar attempt so long as\nCanandaigua contains so many large hearts and corresponding purses.But\nour village cannot have all the praise this time.S. D. Backus of New\nYork City, for their very substantial aid, not only in gifts and\nunstinted patronage, but for their invaluable labor in the decoration of\nthe hall and conduct of the Fair.But for them most of the manual labor\nwould have fallen upon the ladies.The thanks of the Society are\nespecially due, also, to those ladies who assisted personally with their\nsuperior knowledge and older experience.W. P. Fiske for his\nvaluable services as cashier, and to Messrs.Daggett, Chapin and Hills\nfor services at the door; and to all the little boys and girls who\nhelped in so many ways.The receipts amounted to about $490, and thanks to our cashier, the\nmoney is all good, and will soon be on its way carrying substantial\nvisions of something to eat and to wear to at least a few of the poor\nFreedmen of the South.By order of Society,\n                                            Carrie C. Richards, Pres\'t.Emma H. Wheeler, Sec\'y.Editor--I expected to see an account of the Young Ladies\' Fair in\nyour last number, but only saw a very handsome acknowledgment by the\nladies to the citizens.Your "local" must have been absent; and I beg\nthe privilege in behalf of myself and many others of doing tardy justice\nto the successful efforts of the Aid Society at their debut February\n22nd.Gotham furnished an artist and an architect, and the Society did the\nrest.The decorations were in excellent taste, and so were the young\nladies.The skating pond was never in\nbetter condition.On entering the hall I paused first before the table\nof toys, fancy work and perfumery.Here was the President, and I hope I\nshall be pardoned for saying that no President since the days of\nWashington can compare with the President of this Society.Then I\nvisited a candy table, and hesitated a long time before deciding which I\nwould rather eat, the delicacies that were sold, or the charming\ncreatures who sold them.One delicious morsel, in a pink silk, was so\ntempting that I seriously contemplated eating her with a\nspoon--waterfall and all.[By the way, how do we know that the Romans\nwore waterfalls?Because Marc Antony, in his funeral oration on Mr.Caesar, exclaimed, "O water fall was there, my countrymen!"]At this\npoint my attention was attracted by a fish pond.I tried my luck, caught\na whale, and seeing all my friends beginning to blubber, I determined to\nvisit the old woman who lived in a shoe.--She was very glad to see me.I\nbought one of her children, which the Society can redeem for $1,000 in\nsmoking caps.The fried oysters were delicious; a great many of the bivalves got into\na stew, and I helped several of them out.Delicate ice cream, nicely\n"baked in cowld ovens," was destroyed in immense quantities.I scream\nwhen I remember the plates full I devoured, and the number of bright\nwomen to whom I paid my devours.Beautiful cigar girls sold fragrant\nHavanas, and bit off the ends at five cents apiece, extra.The fair\npost-mistress and her fair clerks, so fair that they were almost\nfairies, drove a very thriving business.--Let no man say hereafter that\nthe young ladies of Canandaigua are uneducated in all that makes women\nlovely and useful.The\nmembers of this Society have won the admiration of all their friends,\nand especially of the most devoted of their servants,\n                                                            Q. E. D.\n\nIf I had written that article, I should have given the praise to Susie\nDaggett, for it belongs to her._Sunday, June_ 24.--My Sunday School scholars are learning the shorter\ncatechism.One recited thirty-five answers to questions to-day, another\ntwenty-six, another twenty, the others eleven.They do\nnot see why it is called the "shorter" Catechism!They all had their\nambrotypes taken with me yesterday at Finley\'s--Mary Hoyt, Fannie and\nElla Lyon, Ella Wood, Ella Van Tyne, Mary Vanderbrook, Jennie Whitlaw\nand Katie Neu.They are all going to dress in white and sit on the front\nseat in church at my wedding.Gooding make\nindividual fruit cakes for each of them and also some for each member of\nour sewing society._Thursday, June_ 21.--We went to a lawn fete at Mrs.F. F. Thompson\'s\nthis afternoon.The flowers, the grounds, the\nyoung people and the music all combined to make the occasion perfect._Note:_ Canandaigua is the summer home of Mrs.Thompson, who has\npreviously given the village a children\'s playground, a swimming school,\na hospital and a home for the aged, and this year (1911) has presented a\npark as a beauty spot at foot of Canandaigua Lake._June_ 28.--Dear Abbie Clark and Captain Williams were married in the\nCongregational church this evening.The church was trimmed beautifully\nand Abbie looked sweet.We attended the reception afterwards at her\nhouse."May calm and sunshine hallow their clasped hands."_July_ 15.--The girls of the Society have sent me my flag bed quilt,\nwhich they have just finished.It was hard work quilting such hot days\nbut it is done beautifully.Bessie Seymour wrote the names on the stars.In the center they used six stars for "Three rousing cheers for the\nUnion."Sandra travelled to the hallway.The names on the others are Sarah McCabe, Mary Paul, Fannie\nPaul, Fannie Palmer, Nettie Palmer, Susie Daggett, Fannie Pierce, Sarah\nAndrews, Lottie Clark, Abbie Williams, Carrie Lamport, Isadore Blodgett,\nNannie Corson, Laura Chapin, Mary F. Fiske, Lucilla F. Pratt, Jennie H.\nHazard, Sarah H. Foster, Mary Jewett, Mary C. Stevens, Etta Smith,\nCornelia Richards, Ella Hildreth, Emma Wheeler, Mary Wheeler, Mrs.Pierce, Alice Jewett, Bessie Seymour, Clara Coleman, Julia Phelps.It\nkept the girls busy to get Abbie Clark\'s quilt and mine finished within\none month.They hope that the rest of the girls will postpone their\nnuptials till there is a change in the weather.Mercury stands 90\ndegrees in the shade._July_ 19, 1866.--Our wedding day.We saw the dear little Grandmother,\nGod bless her, watching us from the window as we drove away.Alexandria Bay, _July_ 26.--Anna writes me that Charlie Wells said he\nhad always wanted a set of Clark\'s Commentaries, but I had carried off\nthe entire Ed._July_ 28.--As we were changing boats at Burlington, Vt, for Saratoga,\nto our surprise, we met Captain and Abbie Williams, but could only stop\na moment.Saratoga, 29_th._--We heard Rev.Theodore Cuyler preach to-day from the\ntext, "Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world."He\nleads devotional exercises every morning in the parlors of the Columbian\nHotel.I spoke to him this morning and he said my father was one of his\nbest and earliest friends.Canandaigua, _September_ 1.--A party of us went down to the Canandaigua\nhotel this morning to see President Johnson, General Grant and Admiral\nFarragut and other dignitaries.The train stopped about half an hour and\nthey all gave brief speeches.1867\n\n_July_ 27.--Col.James M. Bull was buried from the home of Mr.Alexander\nHowell to-day, as none of his family reside here now._November_ 13.--Our brother John and wife and baby Pearl have gone to\nLondon, England, to live._December_ 28.--A large party of Canandaiguans went over to Rochester\nlast evening to hear Charles Dickens\' lecture, and enjoyed it more than\nI can possibly express.He was quite hoarse and had small bills\ndistributed through the Opera House with the announcement:\n\n                    MR.CHARLES DICKENS\n\n    Begs indulgence for a Severe Cold, but hopes its effects\n    may not be very perceptible after a few minutes\' Reading.We brought these notices home with us for souvenirs.It was worth a great deal just to look upon the man\nwho wrote Little Dorrit, David Copperfield and all the other books,\nwhich have delighted us so much.We hope that he will live to write a\ngreat many more.He spoke very appreciatively of his enthusiastic\nreception in this country and almost apologized for some of the opinions\nthat he had expressed in his "American Notes," which he published, after\nhis first visit here, twenty-five years ago.He evidently thinks that\nthe United States of America are quite worth while.1871\n\n_August_ 6.--Under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A., Hon.George H. Stuart,\nPresident of the U. S. Christian Commission, spoke in an open air\nmeeting on the square this afternoon and in our church this evening.The\nhouse was packed and such eloquence I never heard from mortal lips.He\nought to be called the Whitefield of America.He told of the good the\nChristian Commission had done before the war and since.They took up a collection which must have amounted to\nhundreds of dollars.1872\n\n_Naples, June._--John has invited Aunt Ann Field, and James, his wife\nand me and Babe Abigail to come to England to make them a visit, and we\nexpect to sail on the Baltic July sixth.Baltic, July_ 7.--We left New York yesterday under\nfavorable circumstances.It was a beautiful summer day, flags were\nflying and everything seemed so joyful we almost forgot we were leaving\nhome and native land.There were many passengers, among them being Mr.Anthony Drexel and U. S. Grant, Jr., who boarded the steamer\nfrom a tug boat which came down the bay alongside when we had been out\nhalf an hour.President Grant was with him and stood on deck, smoking\nthe proverbial cigar.We were glad to see him and the passengers gave\nhim three cheers and three times three, with the greatest enthusiasm._Liverpool, July_ 16.--We arrived here to-day, having been just ten days\non the voyage.There were many clergymen of note on board, among them,\nRev.John H. Vincent, D.D., eminent in the Methodist Episcopal Church,\nwho is preparing International Sunday School lessons.He sat at our\ntable and Philip Phillips also, who is a noted evangelistic singer.They\nheld services both Sabbaths, July 7 and 15, in the grand saloon of the\nsteamer, and also in the steerage where the text was "And they willingly\nreceived him into the ship."Sandra went to the bedroom.The immigrants listened eagerly, when the\nminister urged them all to "receive Jesus."We enjoyed several evening\nliterary entertainments, when it was too cold or windy to sit on deck.We had the most luscious strawberries at dinner to-night, that I ever\nate.So large and red and ripe, with the hulls on and we dipped them in\npowdered sugar as we ate them, a most appetizing way._London, July_ 17.--On our way to London to-day I noticed beautiful\nflower beds at every station, making our journey almost a path of roses.In the fields, men and women both, were harvesting the hay, making\npicturesque scenes, for the sky was cloudless and I was reminded of the\nold hymn, commencing\n\n    "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\n    Stand dressed in living green."We performed the journey from Liverpool to London, a distance of 240\nmiles, in five hours.John, Laura and little Pearl met us at Euston\nStation, and we were soon whirled away in cabs to 24 Upper Woburn Place,\nTavistock Square, John\'s residence.Dinner was soon ready, a most\nbountiful repast.We spent the remainder of the day visiting and\nenjoying ourselves generally.It seemed so good to be at the end of the\njourney, although we had only two days of really unpleasant weather on\nthe voyage.John and Laura are so kind and hospitable.They have a\nbeautiful home, lovely children and apparently every comfort and luxury\nwhich this world can afford._Sunday, July_ 22.--We went to Spurgeon\'s Tabernacle this morning to\nlisten to this great preacher, with thousands of others.I had never\nlooked upon such a sea of faces before, as I beheld from the gallery\nwhere we sat.The pulpit was underneath one gallery, so there seemed as\nmany people over the preacher\'s head, as there were beneath and around\nhim and the singing was as impressive as the sermon.I thought of the\nhymn, "Hark ten thousand harps and voices, Sound the notes of praise\nabove."Spurgeon was so lame from rheumatism that he used two canes\nand placed one knee on a chair beside him, when preaching.His text was\n"And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth."I found that all I\nhad heard of his eloquence was true._Sunday, July_ 29.--We have spent the entire week sightseeing, taking in\nHyde Park, Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey, St.Paul\'s Cathedral, the\nTower of London and British Museum.We also went to Madame Tussaud\'s\nexhibition of wax figures and while I was looking in the catalogue for\nthe number of an old gentleman who was sitting down apparently asleep,\nhe got up and walked away!We drove to Sydenham ten miles from London,\nto see the Crystal Palace which Abbie called the "Christmas Palace."Henry Chesebro of Canandaigua are here and came\nto see us to-day._August_ 13.--Amid the whirl of visiting, shopping and sightseeing in\nthis great city, my diary has been well nigh forgotten.The descriptive\nletters to home friends have been numerous and knowing that they would\nbe preserved, I thought perhaps they would do as well for future\nreference as a diary kept for the same purpose, but to-day, as St.Pancras\' bell was tolling and a funeral procession going by, we heard by\ncable of the death of our dear, dear Grandmother, the one who first\nencouraged us to keep a journal of daily deeds, and who was always most\ninterested in all that interested us and now I cannot refrain if I\nwould, from writing down at this sad hour, of all the grief that is in\nmy heart.She has only stepped inside the\ntemple-gate where she has long been waiting for the Lord\'s entrance\ncall.I weep for ourselves that we shall see her dear face no more.It\ndoes not seem possible that we shall never see her again on this earth.She took such an interest in our journey and just as we started I put my\ndear little Abigail Beals Clarke in her lap to receive her parting\nblessing.As we left the house she sat at the front window and saw us go\nand smiled her farewell._August_ 20.--Anna has written how often Grandmother prayed that "He who\nholds the winds in his fists and the waters in the hollow of his hands,\nwould care for us and bring us to our desired haven."She had received\none letter, telling of our safe arrival and how much we enjoyed going\nabout London, when she was suddenly taken ill and Dr.Anna\'s letter came, after ten days, telling us all\nthe sad news, and how Grandmother looked out of the window the last\nnight before she was taken ill, and up at the moon and stars and said\nhow beautiful they were.Anna says, "How can I ever write it?Our dear\nlittle Grandmother died on my bed to-day."_August_ 30.--John, Laura and their nurse and baby John, Aunt Ann Field\nand I started Tuesday on a trip to Scotland, going first to Glasgow\nwhere we remained twenty-four hours.We visited the Cathedral and were\nabout to go down into the crypt when the guide told us that Gen.Sherman\nof U.S.A.We stopped to look at him and felt like\ntelling him that we too were Americans.He was in good health and\nspirits, apparently, and looked every inch a soldier with his cloak\na-la-militaire around him.We visited the Lochs and spent one night at\nInversnaid on Loch Lomond and then went on up Loch Katrine to the\nTrossachs.When we took the little steamer, John said, "All aboard for\nNaples," it reminded him so much of Canandaigua Lake.We arrived safely\nin Edinburgh the next day by rail and spent four days in that charming\ncity, so beautiful in situation and in every natural advantage.We saw\nthe window from whence John Knox addressed the populace and we also\nvisited the Castle on the hill.Then we went to Melrose and visited the\nAbbey and also Abbotsford, the residence of Sir Walter Scott.We went\nthrough the rooms and saw many curios and paintings and also the\nlibrary.Sir Walter\'s chair at his desk was protected by a rope, but\nLaura, nothing daunted, lifted the baby over it and seated him there for\na moment saying "I am sure, now, he will be clever."We continued our\njourney that night and arrived in London the next morning._Ventnor, Isle of Wight, September_ 9.--Aunt Ann, Laura\'s sister,\nFlorentine Arnold, nurse and two children, Pearl and Abbie, and I are\nhere for three weeks on the seashore._September_ 16.--We have visited all the neighboring towns, the graves\nof the Dairyman\'s daughter and little Jane, the young cottager, and the\nscene of Leigh Richmond\'s life and labors.We have enjoyed bathing in\nthe surf, and the children playing in the sands and riding on the\ndonkeys.We have very pleasant rooms, in a house kept by an old couple, Mr.Tuddenham, down on the esplanade.They serve excellent meals in a\nmost homelike way.We have an abundance of delicious milk and cream\nwhich they tell me comes from "Cowes"!_London, September_ 30.--Anna has come to England to live with John for\nthe present.She came on the Adriatic, arriving September 24.We are so\nglad to see her once more and will do all in our power to cheer her in\nher loneliness._Paris, October_ 18.--John, Laura, Aunt Ann and I, nurse and baby,\narrived here to-day for a few days\' visit.We had rather a stormy\npassage on the Channel.I asked one of the seamen the name of the vessel\nand he answered me "The H\'Albert H\'Edward, Miss!"This information must\nhave given me courage, for I was perfectly sustained till we reached\nCalais, although nearly every one around me succumbed._October_ 22.--We have driven through the Bois de Boulogne, visited Pere\nla Chaise, the Morgue, the ruins of the Tuileries, which are left just\nas they were since the Commune.We spent half a day at the Louvre\nwithout seeing half of its wonders.I went alone to a photographer\'s, Le\nJeune, to be "taken" and had a funny time.He queried "Parlez-vous\nFrancais?"I shook my head and asked him "Parlez-vous Anglaise?"at\nwhich query he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head!I ventured to\ntell him by signs that I would like my picture taken and he held up two\nsizes of pictures and asked me "Le cabinet, le vignette?"I held up my\nfingers, to tell him I would like six of each, whereupon he proceeded to\nmake ready and when he had seated me, he made me understand that he\nhoped I would sit perfectly still, which I endeavored to do.After the\nfirst sitting, he showed displeasure and let me know that I had swayed\nto and fro.Another attempt was more satisfactory and he said "Tres\nbien, Madame," and I gave him my address and departed._October_ 26.--My photographs have come and all pronounce them indeed\n"tres bien."We visited the Tomb of Napoleon to-day._October_ 27.--We attended service to-day at the American Chapel and I\nenjoyed it more than I can ever express.After hearing a foreign tongue\nfor the past ten days, it seemed like getting home to go into a\nPresbyterian church and hear a sermon from an American pastor.The\nsinging in the choir was so homelike, that when they sang "Awake my soul\nto joyful lays and sing thy great Redeemer\'s praise," it seemed to me\nthat I heard a well known tenor voice from across the sea, especially in\nthe refrain "His loving kindness, oh how free."The text was "As an\neagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad\nher wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord did lead\nhim and there was no strange God with him."It was a\nwonderful sermon and I shall never forget it.On our way home, we\nnoticed the usual traffic going on, building of houses, women were\nstanding in their doors knitting and there seemed to be no sign of\nSunday keeping, outside of the church._London, October_ 31.--John and I returned together from Paris and now I\nhave only a few days left before sailing for home.There was an\nEnglishman here to-day who was bragging about the beer in England being\nso much better than could be made anywhere else.He said, "In America,\nyou have the \'ops, I know, but you haven\'t the Thames water, you know."_Sunday, November_ 3.--We went to hear Rev.He is a new light, comparatively, and bids fair to rival\nSpurgeon and Newman Hall and all the rest.He is like a lion and again\nlike a lamb in the pulpit._Liverpool, November_ 6.--I came down to Liverpool to-day with Abbie and\nnurse, to sail on the Baltic, to-morrow.There were two Englishmen in\nour compartment and hearing Abbie sing "I have a Father in the Promised\nLand," they asked her where her Father lived and she said "In America,"\nand told them she was going on the big ship to-morrow to see him.Then\nthey turned to me and said they supposed I would be glad to know that\nthe latest cable from America was that U. S. Grant was elected for his\nsecond term as President of the United States.I assured them that I was\nvery glad to hear such good news._November_ 9.--I did not know any of the passengers when we sailed, but\nsoon made pleasant acquaintances.Sykes from New York and in course of conversation I found that she as\nwell as myself, was born in Penn Yan, Yates County, New York, and that\nher parents were members of my Father\'s church, which goes to prove that\nthe world is not so very wide after all.Abbie is a great pet among the\npassengers and is being passed around from one to another from morning\ntill night.They love to hear her sing and coax her to say "Grace" at\ntable.She closes her eyes and folds her hands devoutly and says, "For\nwhat we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful."They\nall say "Amen" to this, for they are fearful that they will not perhaps\nbe "thankful" when they finish!_November_ 15.--I have been on deck every day but one, and not missed a\nsingle meal.There was a terrible storm one night and the next morning I\ntold one of the numerous clergymen, that I took great comfort in the\nnight, thinking that nothing could happen with so many of the Lord\'s\nanointed, on board.He said that he wished he had thought of that, for\nhe was frightened almost to death!We have sighted eleven steamers and\non Wednesday we were in sight of the banks of Newfoundland all the\nafternoon, our course being unusually northerly and we encountered no\nfogs, contrary to the expectation of all.Every one pronounces the\nvoyage pleasant and speedy for this time of year._Naples, N. Y., November_ 20.--We arrived safely in New York on Sunday.Abbie spied her father very quickly upon the dock as we slowly came up\nand with glad and happy hearts we returned his "Welcome home."We spent\ntwo days in New York and arrived home safe and sound this evening._November_ 21.--My thirtieth birthday, which we, a reunited family, are\nspending happily together around our own fireside, pleasant memories of\nthe past months adding to the joy of the hour.From the _New York Evangelist_ of August 15, 1872, by Rev."Died, at Canandaigua, N. Y., August 8, 1872, Mrs.Abigail Field Beals,\nwidow of Thomas Beals, in the 98th year of her age.Beals, whose\nmaiden name was Field, was born in Madison, Conn., April 7, 1784.David Dudley Field, D.D., of Stockbridge, Mass.,\nand of Rev.Timothy Field, first pastor of the Congregational church of\nCanandaigua.She came to Canandaigua with her brother, Timothy, in 1800.In 1805 she was married to Thomas Beals, Esq., with whom she lived\nnearly sixty years, until he fell asleep.They had eleven children, of\nwhom only four survive.In 1807 she and her husband united with the\nCongregational church, of which they were ever liberal and faithful\nsupporters.Beals loved the good old ways and kept her house in the\nsimple and substantial style of the past.She herself belonged to an age\nof which she was the last.With great dignity and courtesy of manner\nwhich repelled too much familiarity, she combined a sweet and winning\ngrace, which attracted all to her, so that the youth, while they would\nalmost involuntarily \'rise up before her,\' yet loved to be in her\npresence and called her blessed.She possessed in a rare degree the\nornament of a meek and quiet spirit and lived in an atmosphere of love\nand peace.Her home and room were to her children and her children\'s\nchildren what Jerusalem was to the saints of old.There they loved to\nresort and the saddest thing in her death is the sundering of that tie\nwhich bound so many generations together.She never ceased to take a\ndeep interest in the prosperity of the beautiful village of which she\nand her husband were the pioneers and for which they did so much and in\nthe church of which she was the oldest member.Her mind retained its\nactivity to the last and her heart was warm in sympathy with every good\nwork.While she was well informed in all current events, she most\ndelighted in whatever concerned the Kingdom.Her Bible and religious\nbooks were her constant companions and her conversation told much of her\nbetter thoughts, which were in Heaven.Living so that those who knew her\nnever saw in her anything but fitness for Heaven, she patiently awaited\nthe Master\'s call and went down to her grave in a full age like a shock\nof corn fully ripe that cometh in its season."I don\'t think I shall keep a diary any more, only occasionally jot down\nthings of importance.Noah T. Clarke\'s brother got possession of my\nlittle diary in some way one day and when he returned it I found written\non the fly-leaf this inscription to the diary:\n\n    "You\'d scarce expect a volume of my size\n    To hold so much that\'s beautiful and wise,\n    And though the heartless world might call me cheap\n    Yet from my pages some much joy shall reap.As monstrous oaks from little acorns grow,\n    And kindly shelter all who toil below,\n    So my future greatness and the good I do\n    Shall bless, if not the world, at least a few."I think I will close my old journal with the mottoes which I find upon\nan old well-worn writing book which Anna used for jotting down her\nyouthful deeds.On the cover I find inscribed, "Try to be somebody," and\non the back of the same book, as if trying to console herself for\nunexpected achievement which she could not prevent, "Some must be\ngreat!"*       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n1880\n\n_June_ 17.--Our dear Anna was married to-day to Mr.Alonzo A. Cummings\nof Oakland, Cal., and has gone there to live.I am sorry to have her go\nso far away, but love annihilates space.There is no real separation,\nexcept in alienation of spirit, and that can never come--to us.THE END\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOKS TO MAKE ELDERS YOUNG AGAIN\n\nBy Inez Haynes Gillmore\n\nPHOEBE AND ERNEST\n\nWith 30 illustrations by R.

WILLIAMSON\'S THE PRINCESS PASSES\n\nIllustrated by Edward Penfield.Another ball struck the crupper of his saddle, and another one\nbored a hole through Prince\'s right ear.As soon as he was out of sight Fred stopped, and, ascertaining that no\ndamage had been done, excepting the perforating of Prince\'s ear and his\nhat, he patted his horse\'s neck and said: "Ah, Prince, old boy, you are\nmarked now for life, but it is all right.I shall always know you by\nthat little hole through your ear."Fred stopped that night at a planter\'s house, who at first viewed him\nwith some suspicion; but when he was told of Buckner\'s advance, he was\nso overjoyed, being an ardent Secessionist, that there was nothing good\nenough for his guest.The next day, when Fred rode into Lebanon, the first man that he saw\nwas Mathews, who sauntered up to him, and said in a sarcastic tone: "It\nseems, young man, that you made a short visit to your poor sick\ngrandfather."I didn\'t\nsee the old gentleman; I concluded to come back.Things are getting a\nlittle too brisk up there for me.Buckner has advanced, and there may be\nsome skirmishing around Elizabethtown.""And so you run," exclaimed Mathews in a tone which made Fred\'s blood\nboil.All of this time Mathews had been carefully looking over the boy\nand horse, and quite a crowd had collected around them.continued Mathews; "a round hole through your horse\'s ear, been\nbleeding, too; your saddle torn by a bullet, and a hole through your\nhat.Boy, you had better give an account of yourself.""Not at your command," replied Fred, hotly."And I deny your right to\nquestion me.""You do, do you, my fine young fellow?I will show you," and he made a\ngrab for Prince\'s bridle.A sharp, quick word from Fred, and the horse sprang, overthrowing\nMathews, and scattering the crowd right and left.Mathews arose, shaking\nthe dust from his clothes and swearing like a trooper.A fine-looking man had just ridden up to the crowd as the incident\noccurred.He looked after the flying boy, and nervously fingered the\nrevolver in his holster.Then a smile came over his face, and he spoke\nto Mathews, who was still swearing and loudly calling for a horse to\npursue Fred."No use, Jim; you might as well chase a streak of lightning.That is the\nfastest horse in Kentucky."Mathews looked at the man a moment in surprise, and then exclaimed:\n"Heavens!"Made a run for it night before last," replied Morgan with a laugh, "to\nkeep from being nabbed by old Thomas.But what was the fuss between you\nand that boy?I wonder what he was doing out here any way?But, Mathews,\nhe did upset you nicely; I think you rolled over at least six times.""I will be even with him yet," growled Mathews.I have heard half a dozen men say that, myself included.But let\'s\nhear what the rumpus was about."When Morgan heard the story, he said: "So Buckner is at Elizabethtown,\nis he?I was going to Bowling Green, but now\nI will change my course to Elizabethtown.But I would like to know what\nthat boy has been doing.From what you say he must have been in a\nskirmish.Trying to throw a train off the track, perhaps; it would be\njust like him.""But, Mathews," he continued, "the boy is gone, so let us talk\nbusiness.I am going to raise a regiment of cavalry for the Confederate\nservice, and I want you to raise a company.""That I will, John," said Mathews."There is no other man I had rather\nride under."Fred laughed heartily as he looked back and saw Mathews shaking the dust\nfrom himself.Finding that he was not pursued he brought Prince down to\na walk."I could almost swear," he said to himself, "that I caught a\nglimpse of Morgan as I dashed through the crowd.Thomas surely ought to\nhave him before this time.As he was riding through Danville he met his uncle, Judge Pennington,\nwho, to his surprise, greeted him most cordially, and would insist on\nhis stopping a while."Over towards Elizabethtown to see my sick grandfather," replied Fred,\ngravely.asked his uncle, somewhat nettled."Well, uncle, I have been over towards Elizabethtown ostensibly to see\nmy grandfather, but really to see what I could find over there.""I found Buckner\'s men as thick as hops, and I found a warm reception\nbesides.Look here," and he showed his uncle the hole through his hat."If you will go out and look at Prince, you will find a hole through\nhis ear, and you will also find the saddle torn with a bullet.Oh, yes,\nBuckner\'s men were glad to see me; they gave me a warm reception.""Oh, I side-tracked one of their trains.""Fred," said he, "you are engaging in\ndangerous business.I have heard of\nsome of your doings.Mary moved to the hallway."Then it was he I saw at Lebanon."Because--because--I thought--I thought he was in Lexington.""It was because," answered the judge, severely, "that you thought he was\na prisoner at Camp Dick Robinson.Ah, Fred, you were not as sharp as you\nthought.You foiled their plans; but, thank God!All pretense of neutrality is now at an\nend.These men will now be found in the ranks, fighting for the liberty\nof the South.As for Morgan, he will be heard from, mark my word.""He is a daring fellow, and sharp,\ntoo; yes, I believe he will be heard from.""Fred, Morgan thinks you have had more to do with finding out their\nplans than any other one person.""Morgan does me too much honor," replied Fred, quietly.The judge remained quiet for a moment, and then said: "My boy, I wish\nyou could have seen Morgan before you had so thoroughly committed\nyourself to the other side.He\nbelieves if he could talk with you, you might be induced to change your\nmind.He says in the kind of work in which he expects to engage, you\nwould be worth a brigade of men.Fred, will you, will you not think of\nthis?You are breaking our hearts with your course now.""Dear uncle," replied Fred, "I thank Morgan for his good opinion, and I\nreciprocate his opinion; for of all the men I have met, I believe he,\nmost of all, has the elements of a dashing, successful leader.But as\nfor his offer, I cannot consider it for a moment."The judge sighed, and Fred saw that his further presence was not\ndesirable, so he made his adieus, and rode away.Morgan wants to win me over," thought Fred, "and that was the\nreason uncle was so nice.I think this last scrape has burnt the bridges\nbetween us, and they will trouble me no more."Fred made his report to General Thomas, who heard it with evident\nsatisfaction."This, then, was your idea, Fred?""Yes, General, I in some way conceived the notion that Buckner would try\nto surprise Louisville just as he did try to do.I knew that trains were\nrunning regularly between Nashville and Louisville, and thought that a\nsurprise could be effected.But the idea was so vague I was ashamed to\ntell you, for fear of exciting ridicule.So, I got my leave of absence\nand stole off, and if nothing had come of it, no one would have been the\nwiser."General Thomas smiled, and said: "It was an idea worthy of a great\ngeneral, Fred.General Anderson has much to thank you for, as well as\nthe people of Louisville.But you must take a good rest now, both you\nand your horse.From appearances, I think it will not be many days\nbefore General Zollicoffer will give us plenty to do."FOOTNOTE:\n\n[A] The name of the gallant young man who tore up the track was\nCrutcher; the author does not know the name of the fireman.On October 7th General Anderson, at his own request, was relieved of the\ncommand of the Department of Kentucky, on account of continued\nill-health.The next day General W. T. Sherman, a man destined to fill\nan important place in the history of the war, was appointed to the\nposition.Both the Federal and the Confederate governments had now\nthrown aside all pretense of neutrality.Kentucky echoed to the martial\ntread of armed men.At Maysville under General Nelson, at Camp Dick Robinson under General\nThomas, at Louisville under General Sherman, and at Paducah under\nGeneral Grant, the Federal government was gathering its hosts; while the\nConfederate government with its troops occupied Columbus, Bowling Green,\nCumberland Gap, and the mountains of eastern Kentucky.General Albert\nSydney Johnston, one of the ablest of the Confederate generals, was in\nsupreme command, with headquarters at Bowling Green.General Zollicoffer marched from Cumberland Gap early in the month, and\nassumed offensive operations.When General Sherman took command, Fred was sent by General Thomas to\nLouisville with dispatches.General Sherman had heard of some of the\nexploits of the young messenger, and he was received very kindly.Sherman, at that time, was in the prime of life.Straight as an arrow,\nof commanding presence, he was every inch a soldier.He was quick and\nimpulsive in his actions, and to Fred seemed to be a bundle of nerves.In conversation he was open and frank and expressed his opinion freely,\nin this resembling General Nelson.But the rough, overbearing nature of\nNelson he entirely lacked.He was one of the most courteous of men.He would have Fred tell of some of his exploits, and when he gave an\naccount of his first journey to Louisville, and his adventure with\nCaptain Conway, the general was greatly pleased.Fred\'s account of how\nhe discovered the details of the plot at Lexington was received with\nastonishment, and he was highly complimented.But the climax came when\nhe told of how he had thrown the train from the track, and thus brought\nBuckner\'s intended surprise to naught.The general jumped up, grasped\nFred\'s hand, and exclaimed:\n\n"That, young man, calls for a commission, if I can get you one, and I\nthink I can.""General," replied Fred, "I thank you very much, but I do not wish a\ncommission.It is true, I am hired\nprivately by General Nelson, and if I understand rightly I am getting\nthe pay of a lieutenant; but I am not bound by oath to serve any length\nof time, neither could I have accomplished what I have if I had been a\nregular enlisted soldier.""But remember, if you are ever in\nneed of any favor, do not hesitate to call on me."This Fred readily promised, and left the general, highly elated over the\ninterview.Before leaving Louisville, Fred did not forget to call on the Vaughns.He found Miss Mabel well, and he thought her more beautiful than ever.A\nsad, pensive look on her face but added to her loveliness.Only the day\nbefore she had bidden her betrothed farewell, and he had marched to the\nfront to help fight the battles of his country.As she hung weeping\naround his neck, he pointed to a little miniature flag pinned on his\nbreast--it was the same flag that Mabel wore on that day she was beset\nby the mob--and said:\n\n"Dearest, it shall be worn there as long as my heart beats.Never shall\nit be touched by a traitorous hand as long as I live.Every time I look\nupon it, it will be an incentive to prove worthy of the brave girl who\nwore it on her breast in the face of a brutal mob."Then with one fond clasp of the hands, one long lingering kiss, he was\ngone; and to Mabel all the light and joy of the world seemed to go with\nhim.But the coming of Fred brought new thoughts, and for the time her eyes\ngrew brighter, her cheeks rosier and laugh happier.The bright, brave\nboy who saved her from the mob was very welcome, and to her he was only\na boy, a precious, darling boy.They made Fred relate his adventures, and one minute Mabel\'s eyes would\nsparkle with fun, and the next melt in tenderness.In spite of himself,\nFred\'s heart beat very fast, he hardly knew why.But when he told with\ntrembling voice how he had parted from his father, and how he had been\ndisowned and driven from home, the sympathy of the impulsive girl\novercame her, and with eyes swimming in tears, she arose, threw her arms\naround him, imprinted a kiss on his forehead, and murmured: "Poor boy!Then turning to her mother, she said, "We will adopt him,\nwon\'t we, mother, and I will have a brother."Then remembering what she had done, she retired blushing and in\nconfusion to her seat.That kiss finished Fred; it thrilled him through\nand through.Yet somehow the thought of being a brother to Mabel didn\'t\ngive him any satisfaction.He knew Mabel looked upon him as only a boy,\nand the thought made him angry, but the next moment he was ashamed of\nhimself.He took his leave, promising to call the next time he was in\nthe city, and went away with conflicting emotions.Fred was really suffering from an attack of first love, and didn\'t know\nit.It was better for him that he didn\'t, for it was the sooner\nforgotten.On his return to Camp Dick Robinson Fred found that General Thomas had\nadvanced some of his troops toward Cumberland Gap.Colonel Garrard was\noccupying an exposed position on the Rock Castle Hills, and Fred was\nsent to him with dispatches.Fred found the little command in\nconsiderable doubt over the movements of General Zollicoffer.One hour\nthe rumor would be that he was advancing, and the next hour would bring\nthe story that he was surely retreating.Colonel Garrard feared that he\nwould be attacked with a greatly superior force.Fred resolved that he would do a little scouting on his own account.Colonel Garrard offered to send a small party with him, but Fred\ndeclined the offer, saying that a squad would only attract attention,\nand if he ran into danger he would trust to the fleetness of his horse\nto save him.Riding east, he made a wide detour, and at last came to where he thought\nhe must be near the enemy\'s lines.In his front was a fine plantation;\nnear by, in the woods, some <DW64>s were chopping.These <DW64>s he\nresolved to interview.His appearance created great consternation, and\nsome of them dropped their axes, and looked as if about to run."Don\'t be afraid, boys," said Fred, kindly."I only want to know who\nlives in yonder house.""Not now, sah; he down to Zollicoffer camp.""Oh, then General Zollicoffer is camped near here?""Yes, sah; \'bout two mile down de road.""Do any of the soldiers ever come this way?""Yes, sah; \'bout twenty went up de road not mo\' than two hours ago.Den\na capin man, he cum to see Missy Alice most ebber day.""Thank you," said Fred, as he rode away."I think I will pay a visit to\nMissy Alice myself."Riding boldly up to the house, he dismounted.Before entering the house\nhe accosted an old <DW64> who was working in the yard, and slipping a\ndollar into his hand, said:\n\n"Uncle, if you see any one coming either way, will you cry, \'Massa, your\nhorse is getting away?\'""Trus\' me fo\' dat," said the old man, grinning from ear to ear."I jess\nmake dat hoss jump, and den I yell, \'Massa, hoss gittin\' way.\'""That\'s it, uncle, you are all right," and Fred turned and went into the\nhouse, where he introduced himself as a Mr.He\nhad friends in Zollicoffer\'s army, and had run the gauntlet of the\nFederal lines to visit them.Could they tell him how far it was to\nGeneral Zollicoffer\'s camp.The ladies received him coldly, but told him the distance.But Fred was\nnot to be repulsed.He was a good talker, and he tried his best.He told\nthem the news of the outside world, and what the Yankees were doing, and\nhow they would soon be driven from the State.This at once endeared him\nto the ladies, especially the younger, who was a most pronounced little\nrebel.Miss Alice was a comely girl, somewhere between twenty and\ntwenty-five years of age, and by a little but well directed flattery\nFred completely won her confidence.She inquired after some\nacquaintances in Lexington, and by a happy coincidence Fred knew them,\nand the conversation became animated.At length Fred remarked: "I hope it will not be long before General\nZollicoffer will advance.We are getting anxious up at Lexington; we\nwant to see the Yankees driven into the Ohio.""You will not have to wait long," replied the girl."Captain Conway\ntells me they are about ready, and will advance on the 20th or 21st----"\nshe stopped suddenly, bit her lip, and looked scared.In all probability she had told something that Captain Conway had told\nher to keep secret.Fred did not appear to notice her confusion, and at\nonce said: "Conway, Conway, Captain Conway.Is it Captain P. C. Conway\nof whom you speak?""Yes, sir," replied the girl, brightening up."Why, I know him, know him like a book; in fact, we are old\nfriends--special friends, I may say.He would rejoice to find me here,"\nand then he added mentally, "and cut my throat.""A brilliant soldier, and a brave one, is Captain Conway," continued\nFred, "and if he is given an opportunity to distinguish himself, it will\nnot be long before it will be Major or Colonel Conway."This praise pleased Miss Alice greatly, and she informed Fred that he\nwould soon have the pleasure of meeting his friend; that she expected\nhim every moment.Fred moved somewhat uneasily in his chair.He had no desire to meet\nCaptain Conway, and he was about to make an excuse of going out to see\nhow his horse was standing, when they were startled by the old <DW64>\nrunning toward the house and yelling at the top of his voice: "Massa,\nmassa, yo\' hoss is gittin\' away."The sly old fellow had thrown a stone at Prince, and the horse was\nrearing and plunging.Fred dashed out of the house; a party of horsemen was coming up the\nroad, in fact, was nearly to the house.It was but the work of a moment\nfor Fred to unhitch his horse and vault into the saddle, but the party\nwas now not more than fifty yards away.They had noticed the horse hitched at the gate, and were coming at full\nspeed to try and surprise the owner.The moment Conway saw Fred he knew\nhim.he cried, "Fred Shackelford, what luck!"and snatched a pistol\nfrom the holster and fired.The ball whistled past Fred\'s head\nharmlessly, and he turned in the saddle and returned the fire.It was\nthe first time he had ever shot at a man, and even in the heat of\nexcitement he experienced a queer sensation, a sinking of the heart, as\nthough he were committing a crime.Fairly and squarely the ball from his revolver struck the horse of\nCaptain Conway in the forehead, and the animal fell dead, the rider\nrolling in the dust.His men stopped the pursuit, and,\ndismounting, gathered around the captain, thinking he was killed.But he sprang to his feet, shouting: "A hundred dollars to the one who\nwill take that young devil, dead or alive.Here, Corporal Smith, you\nhave a fleet horse, let me take him," and jumping into the saddle, he\nwas in pursuit, followed by all his men, except Corporal Smith, who\nstood in the road looking after them.asked the two ladies, who stood\non the veranda, wringing their hands, and very much excited."Blamed if I know," answered the corporal."The sight of that young chap\nseemed to make the captain kinder crazy.The moment he caught sight of\nhim, he called him by name, and banged away at him.""You say the captain called him by name?""Well, he said he knew the captain, and that he was one of his best\nfriends.The corporal had no explanation to offer, so went and took a look at the\ncaptain\'s horse.In the meantime the pursued and the pursuers had passed out of sight up\nthe road, enveloped in a cloud of dust."Remember, boys," shouted Conway, "a hundred dollars to the one who\nbrings him down.But it was nothing but play for Fred to distance them, and he laughed to\nthink that they expected to catch him.But the laugh suddenly died on\nhis lips; he turned pale, and glanced hurriedly to the right and left.A\nhigh rail fence ran on each side of the road.The scouting party of\nwhich the <DW64>s spoke was returning.Captain Conway saw the other party, and shouted in triumph."Now, boys, we have him," and he spurred his horse forward, revolver in\nhand.There was a look of malignant hatred on his face, and he muttered:\n"Now, my boy, I will settle scores with you.I shall never take you back\nto camp.\'Captured a spy, killed while trying to escape.\'As for Fred, even in his extremity, his courage or his presence of mind\nnever deserted him.He felt that to be captured by Conway was death, for\nhad not the captain sworn to kill him on sight?His mind was made up; he\nwould wheel and charge the captain\'s party.Just as he was about to do this, he espied an opening in the\nfence on the left.As quick as thought he dashed through it, thinking it\nmight afford a chance of escape.The field\nwas a perfect cul-de-sac, bounded on all sides by a high rail fence, the\nonly opening the one he had come through.Through this opening the enemy poured, and when they saw the trap which\nFred had entered, their shouts made the welkin ring.Their shouts rang in Fred\'s ears like the tolling of a\nfuneral bell.So must the bay of hounds sound in the ears of the hunted\nquarry.It was built of heavy rails, and\nfull seven feet high.Bending over his horse\'s\nneck, Fred said: "Prince, it is a question of life or death.Do your\nbest, old fellow; we can but fail."With\ndistended nostrils, eyes flashing with excitement, and every muscle\nquivering, he gathered himself for the mighty spring.As lightly as a\nbird he cleared the fence, staggered as he struck the ground on the\nother side, then on again like the wind.Fred turned in his saddle, and uttered a yell of defiance.But the hands of his troopers were unsteady,\nand the shots went wild.Before his men could dismount and throw down\nthe fence, Fred was beyond pursuit.Captain Conway fairly foamed at the\nmouth.He raved and swore like a madman."It\'s no use swearing, Captain," said a grizzled lieutenant."I thought\nI knew something about horses, but that beat any leap I ever saw.I would rather have the horse than the boy."']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The text does not mention Sandra at all. It talks about a scene where Fred is being chased by Captain Conway and his men, but there is no mention of Sandra's name or any character that could be related to her.

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['It\'s a fine sight to see them start.Would you like to come and look at them?"He had turned back and was walking with us down the street, pointing\nout everything that occurred to him as noticeable, in the kindest and\ncivilest way.When we apologised for troubling him, and would have\nparted company, our friend made no attempt to go."Oh, I\'ve nothing at all to do, except"--he took out the biggest and\nmost respectable of watches--"except to attend a prayer-meeting at\nhalf-past six.I should have time to show you the town; we think it is\na very nice little town.I ought to know it; I\'ve lived in it, boy and\nman for thirty-seven years.But now I have left my business to my sons,\nand I just go about and amuse myself, looking into the shop now and\nthen just for curiosity.You must have seen my old shop, ladies, if you\ncame down that street."Which he named, and also gave us his own name, which we had seen over\nthe shop door, but I shall not record either.Not that I think the\nhonest man is ever likely to read such "light" literature as this book,\nor to recall the three wanderers to whom he was so civil and kind, and\nupon whom he poured out an amount of local and personal facts, which\nwe listened to--as a student of human nature is prone to do--with an\namused interest in which the comic verged on the pathetic.How large\nto each man seems his own little world, and what child-like faith he\nhas in its importance to other people!I shall always recall our friend\nat St.Ives, with his prayer-meetings, his chapel-goings--I concluded\nhe was a Methodist, a sect very numerous in Cornwall--his delight in\nhis successful shop and well-brought-up sons, who managed it so well,\nleaving him to enjoy his _otium cum dignitate_--no doubt a municipal\ndignity, for he showed us the Town Hall with great gusto.Evidently to\nhis honest, simple soul, St.By and by again he pulled out the turnip-like watch."Just ten minutes\nto get to my prayer-meeting, and I never like to be late, I have been a\npunctual man all my life, ma\'am," added he, half apologetically, till\nI suggested that this was probably the cause of his peace and success.Upon which he smiled, lifted his hat with a benign adieu, hoped we had\nliked St.Ives--we had liked his company at any rate--and with a final\npointing across the street, "There\'s my shop, ladies, if you would care\nto look at it," trotted away to his prayer-meeting.Ives, especially Tregenna, its\nancient mansion transformed into an hotel, is exceedingly pretty, but\nnight was falling fast, and we saw nothing.Speedily we despatched a\nmost untempting meal, and hurried Charles\'s departure, lest we should\nbe benighted, as we nearly were, during the long miles of straight and\nunlovely road--the good road--between here and Penzance.We had done\nour duty, we had seen the place, but as, in leaving it behind us, we\nlaughingly repeated the nursery rhyme, we came to the conclusion that\nthe man who was "_going_ to St.Ives" was the least fortunate of all\nthose notable individuals.DAY THE ELEVENTH\n\n\nThe last thing before retiring, we had glanced out on a gloomy sea, a\nstarless sky, pitch darkness, broken only by those moving lights on St.Michael\'s Mount, and thought anxiously of the morrow.It would be hard,\nif after journeying thus far and looking forward to it so many years,\nthe day on which we went to the Land\'s End should turn out a wet day!Still "hope on, hope ever," as we used to write in our copy-books.Some\nof us, I think, still go on writing it in empty air, and will do so\ntill the hand is dust.It was with a feeling almost of solemnity that we woke and looked out\non the dawn, grey and misty, but still not wet.To be just on the point\nof gaining the wish of a life-time, however small, is a fact rare\nenough to have a certain pathos in it.We slept again, and trusted\nfor the best, which by breakfast-time really came, in flickering\nsun-gleams, and bits of hopeful blue sky.We wondered for the last\ntime, as we had wondered for half a century, "what the Land\'s End would\nbe like," and then started, rather thoughtful than merry, to find out\nthe truth of the case.Glad as we were to have for our expedition this quiet Sunday instead\nof a tumultuous week day, conscience smote us in driving through\nPenzance, with the church-bells ringing, and the people streaming along\nto morning service, all in their Sunday best.Perhaps we might manage\nto go to afternoon church at Sennen, or St.Sennen\'s, which we knew\nby report, as the long-deceased father of a family we were acquainted\nwith had been curate there early in the century, and we had promised\nfaithfully "just to go and look at the old place."But one can keep Sunday sometimes even outside church-doors.I shall\nnever forget the Sabbatic peace of that day; those lonely and lovely\nroads, first rich with the big trees and plentiful vegetation about\nPenzance, then gradually growing barer and barer as we drove along the\nhigh promontory which forms the extreme point westward of our island.The way along which so many tourist-laden vehicles pass daily was\nnow all solitary; we scarcely saw a soul, except perhaps a labourer\nleaning over a gate in his decent Sunday clothes, or two or three\nchildren trotting to school or church, with their books under their\narms.Unquestionably Cornwall is a respectable, sober-minded county;\nreligious-minded too, whether Methodist, Quaker, or other nonconformist\nsects, of which there are a good many, or decent, conservative Church\nof England.Buryan\'s--a curious old church founded on the place where\nan Irishwoman, Saint Buriana, is said to have made her hermitage.A\nfew stray cottages comprised the whole village.There was nothing\nspecial to see, except to drink in the general atmosphere of peace and\nsunshine and solitude, till we came to Treryn, the nearest point to the\ncelebrated Logan or rocking-stone.From childhood we had read about it; the most remarkable specimen in\nEngland of those very remarkable stones, whether natural or artificial,\nwho can decide?"Which the touch of a finger alone sets moving,\n  But all earth\'s powers cannot shake from their base."Not quite true, this; since in 1824 a rash and foolish Lieutenant\nGoldsmith (let his name be gibbeted for ever!)did come with a boat\'s\ncrew, and by main force remove the Logan a few inches from the point\non which it rests.Indignant justice very properly compelled him, at\ngreat labour and pains, to put it back again, but it has never rocked\nproperly since.By Charles\'s advice we took a guide, a solemn-looking youth, who\nstalked silently ahead of us along the "hedges," which, as at the\nLizard, furnished the regular path across the fields coastwards.Soon the gleaming circle of sea again flashed upon us, from behind a\nlabyrinth of rocks, whence we met a couple of tourists returning."You\'ll find it a pretty stiff climb to the Logan, ladies," said one of\nthem in answer to a question.And so we should have done, indeed, had not our guide\'s hand been\nmuch readier than his tongue.I, at least, should never have got even\nso far as that little rock-nest where I located myself--a somewhat\nanxious-minded old hen--and watched my chickens climb triumphantly that\nenormous mass of stone which we understood to be the Logan.they shouted across the dead stillness, the\nlovely solitude of sky and sea.And I suppose it did rock, but must\nhonestly confess _I_ could not see it stir a single inch.However, it was a big stone, a very big stone, and the stones\naround it were equally huge and most picturesquely thrown together.Also--delightful to my young folks!--they furnished the most\nadventurous scramble that heart could desire.I alone felt a certain\nrelief when we were all again on smooth ground, with no legs or arms\nbroken.The cliff-walk between the Logan and the Land\'s End is said to be one\nof the finest in England for coast scenery.Treryn or Treen Dinas,\nPardeneck Point, and Tol Pedn Penwith had been named as places we ought\nto see, but this was impracticable.We had to content ourselves with a\ndull inland road, across a country gradually getting more barren and\nugly, till we found ourselves suddenly at what seemed the back-yard of\na village public-house, where two or three lounging stable-men came\nforward to the carriage, and Charles jumped down from his box.I forbear to translate the world of meaning implied in that brief\nexclamation.Perhaps we shall admire the place more\nwhen we have ceased to be hungry."The words of wisdom were listened to; and we spent our first quarter of\nan hour at the Land\'s End in attacking a skeleton "remain" of not too\ndaintily-cooked beef, and a cavernous cheese, in a tiny back parlour\nof the--let me give it its right name--First and Last Inn, of Great\nBritain."We never provide for Sunday," said the waitress, responding to a\nsympathetic question on the difficulty it must be to get food here."It\'s very seldom any tourists come on a Sunday."At which we felt altogether humbled; but in a few minutes more our\ncontrition passed into sovereign content.We went out of doors, upon the narrow green plateau in front of the\nhouse, and then we recognised where we were--standing at the extreme\nend of a peninsula, with a long line of rocks running out still further\ninto the sea.That "great and wide sea, wherein are moving things\ninnumerable," the mysterious sea "kept in the hollow of His hand," who\nis Infinity, and looking at which, in the intense solitude and silence,\none seems dimly to guess at what Infinity may be.Any one who wishes to\ngo to church for once in the Great Temple which His hands have builded,\nshould spend a Sunday at the Land\'s End.At first, our thought had been, What in the world shall we do here for\ntwo mortal hours!Now, we wished we had had two whole days.A sunset, a\nsunrise, a star-lit night, what would they not have been in this grand\nlonely place--almost as lonely as a ship at sea?It would be next best\nto finding ourselves in the middle of the Atlantic.But this bliss could not be; so we proceeded to make the best of what\nwe had.The bright day was darkening, and a soft greyness began to\ncreep over land and sea.No, not soft, that is the very last adjective\napplicable to the Land\'s End.Even on that calm day there was a fresh\nwind--there must be always wind--and the air felt sharper and more salt\nthan any sea-air I ever knew.Stimulating too, so that one\'s nerves\nwere strung to the highest pitch of excitement.We felt able to do\nanything, without fear and without fatigue.So that when a guide came\nforward--a regular man-of-war\'s-man he looked--we at once resolved to\nadventure along the line of rocks, seaward, "out as far as anybody was\naccustomed to go.""Ay, ay; I\'ll take you, ladies.That is--the young ladies might go--but\nyou--" eying me over with his keen sailor\'s glance, full of honesty and\ngood humour, "you\'re pretty well on in years, ma\'am."Laughing, I told him how far on, but that I was able to do a good deal\nyet."Oh, I\'ve taken ladies much older than you.One the other day was\nnearly seventy.So we\'ll do our best, ma\'am.He offered a rugged, brown hand, as firm and steady as a mast, to hold\nby, and nothing could exceed the care and kindliness with which he\nguided every step of every one of us, along that perilous path, that\nis, perilous except for cautious feet and steady heads.If you make one false step, you are done\nfor," said our guide, composedly as he pointed to the boiling whirl of\nwaters below.[Illustration: THE LAND\'S END AND THE LOGAN ROCK.]Still, though a narrow and giddy path, there was a path, and the\nexploit, though a little risky, was not fool-hardy.We should have\nbeen bitterly sorry not to have done it--not to have stood for one\ngrand ten minutes, where in all our lives we may never stand again, at\nthe farthest point where footing is possible, gazing out upon that\nmagnificent circle of sea which sweeps over the submerged "land of\nLyonesse," far, far away, into the wide Atlantic.There were just two people standing with us, clergymen evidently, and\none, the guide told us, was "the parson at St.We spoke to\nhim, as people do speak, instinctively, when mutually watching such a\nscene, and by and by we mentioned the name of the long-dead curate of\nSt.The "parson" caught instantly at the name.Oh, yes, my father knew him quite well.He used constantly\nto walk across from Sennen to our house, and take us children long\nrambles across the cliffs, with a volume of Southey or Wordsworth under\nhis arm.He was a fine young fellow in those days, I have heard, and an\nexcellent clergyman.And he afterwards married a very nice girl from\nthe north somewhere."The "nice girl" was now a sweet silver-haired little\nlady of nearly eighty; the "fine young fellow" had long since departed;\nand the boy was this grave middle-aged gentleman, who remembered both\nas a tradition of his youth.What a sermon it all preached, beside this\neternal rock, this ever-moving, never-changing sea!But time was passing--how fast it does pass, minutes, ay, and years!We\nbade adieu to our known unknown friend, and turned our feet backwards,\ncautiously as ever, stopping at intervals to listen to the gossip of\nour guide."Yes, ladies, that\'s the spot--you may see the hoof-mark--where General\nArmstrong\'s horse fell over; he just slipped off in time, but the poor\nbeast was drowned.And here, over that rock, happened the most curious\nthing.I wouldn\'t have believed it myself, only I knew a man that saw\nit with his own eyes.Once a bullock fell off into the pool below\nthere--just look, ladies."(We did look, into a perfect Maelstrom of\nboiling waves.)"Everybody thought he was drowned, till he was seen\nswimming about unhurt.They fished him up, and exhibited him as a\ncuriosity."And again, pointing to a rock far out in the sea.Thirty years ago a ship went to pieces there, and\nthe captain and his wife managed to climb on to that rock.They held\non there for two days and a night, before a boat could get at them.At last they were taken off one at a time, with rockets and a rope;\nthe wife first.But the rope slipped and she fell into the water.She\nwas pulled out in a minute or so, and rowed ashore, but they durst\nnot tell her husband she was drowned.I was standing on the beach at\nWhitesand Bay when the boat came in.I was only a lad, but I remember\nit well, and her too lifted out all dripping and quite dead."They went back for him, and got him off safe, telling him nothing.But\nwhen he found she was dead he went crazy-like--kept for ever saying,\n\'She saved my life, she saved my life,\' till he was taken away by his\nfriends.Look out, ma\'am, mind your footing; just here a lady slipped\nand broke her leg a week ago.I had to carry her all the way to the\nhotel.We all smiled at the comical candour of the honest sailor, who\nproceeded to give us bits of his autobiography.He was Cornish born,\nbut had seen a deal of the world as an A.B.on board her Majesty\'s ship\n_Agamemnon_."Of course you have heard of the _Agamemnon_, ma\'am.I was in her off\nBalaklava.His eyes brightened as we discussed names and places once\nso familiar, belonging to that time, which now seems so far back as to\nbe almost historical."Then you know what a winter we had, and what a summer afterwards.I\ncame home invalided, and didn\'t attempt the service afterwards; but I\nnever thought I should come home at all.Yes, it\'s a fine place the\nLand\'s End, though the air is so strong that it kills some folks right\noff.Once an invalid gentleman came, and he was dead in a fortnight.But I\'m not dead yet, and I stop here mostly all the year round."He sniffed the salt air and smiled all over his weather-beaten\nface--keen, bronzed, blue-eyed, like one of the old Vikings.He was a\nfine specimen of a true British tar.When, having seen all we could, we\ngave him his small honorarium, he accepted it gratefully, and insisted\non our taking in return a memento of the place in the shape of a stone\nweighing about two pounds, glittering with ore, and doubtless valuable,\nbut ponderous.Oh, the trouble it gave me to carry it home, and pack\nand unpack it among my small luggage!But I did bring it home, and\nI keep it still in remembrance of the Land\'s End, and of the honest\nsailor of H.M.S.We could dream of an unknown Land\'s End no more.It\nbecame now a real place, of which the reality, though different from\nthe imagination, was at least no disappointment.John journeyed to the bathroom.How few people in\nattaining a life-long desire can say as much!Our only regret, an endurable one now, was that we had not carried out\nour original plan of staying some days there--tourist-haunted, troubled\ndays they might have been, but the evenings and mornings would have\nbeen glorious.With somewhat heavy hearts we summoned Charles and the\ncarriage, for already a misty drift of rain began sweeping over the sea."Still, we must see Whitesand Bay," said one of us, recalling a story\na friend had once told how, staying at Land\'s End, she crossed the bay\nalone in a blinding storm, took refuge at the coastguard station, where\nshe was hospitably received, and piloted back with most chivalric care\nby a coastguard, who did not tell her till their journey\'s end that he\nhad left at home a wife, and a baby just an hour old.We only caught a glimmer of the\nbay through drizzling rain, which by the time we reached Sennen village\nhad become a regular downpour.Evidently, we could do no more that day,\nwhich was fast melting into night."We\'ll go home," was the sad resolve, glad nevertheless that we had a\ncomfortable "home" to go to.So closing the carriage and protecting ourselves as well as we could\nfrom the driving rain, we went forward, passing the Quakers\' burial\nground, where is said to be one of the finest views in Cornwall; the\nNine Maidens, a circle of Druidical stones, and many other interesting\nthings, without once looking at or thinking of them.Half a mile from Marazion the rain ceased, and a light like that of the\nrising moon began to break through the clouds.What a night it might\nbe, or might have been, could we have stayed at the Land\'s End!It is in great things as in small, the\nworry, the torment, the paralysing burden of life.We\nhave done our best to be happy, and we have been happy.DAY THE TWELFTH\n\n\nMonday morning.Black Monday we were half inclined to call it, knowing\nthat by the week\'s end our travels must be over and done, and that if\nwe wished still to see all we had planned, we must inevitably next\nmorning return to civilisation and railways, a determination which\ninvolved taking this night "a long, a last farewell" of our comfortable\ncarriage and our faithful Charles."But it needn\'t be until night," said he, evidently loth to part from\nhis ladies."If I get back to Falmouth by daylight to-morrow morning,\nmaster will be quite satisfied.I can take you wherever you like\nto-day.""Oh, he shall get a good feed and a rest till the middle of the night,\nthen he\'ll do well enough.We shall have the old moon after one o\'clock\nto get home by.Between Penzance and Falmouth it\'s a good road, though\nrather lonely."I should think it was, in the "wee hours" by the dim light of a waning\nmoon.But Charles seemed to care nothing about it, so we said no more,\nbut decided to take the drive--our last drive.Our minds were perplexed between Botallack Mine, the Gurnard\'s Head,\nLamorna Cove, and several other places, which we were told we must on\nno account miss seeing, the first especially.Some of us, blessed with\nscientific relatives, almost dreaded returning home without having seen\na single Cornish mine; others, lovers of scenery, longed for more of\nthat magnificent coast.But finally, a meek little voice carried the\nday.[Illustration: SENNEN COVE."I was so disappointed--more than I liked to say--when it rained,\nand I couldn\'t get my shells for our bazaar.If it wouldn\'t trouble anybody very much, mightn\'t we go again to\nWhitesand Bay?"It was a heavenly day; to spend it\nin delicious idleness on that wide sweep of sunshiny sand would be a\nrest for the next day\'s fatigue.there\nwould be no temptation to put on miners\' clothes, and go dangling in\na basket down to the heart of the earth, as the Princess of Wales was\nreported to have done.The pursuit of knowledge may be delightful, but\nsome of us owned to a secret preference for _terra firma_ and the upper\nair.We resolved to face opprobrium, and declare boldly we had "no\ntime" (needless to add no inclination) to go and see Botallack Mine.The Gurnard\'s Head cost us a pang to miss; but then we should catch a\nsecond view of the Land\'s End.Yes, we would go to Whitesand Bay.It was a far shorter journey in sunshine than in rain, even though we\nmade various divergencies for blackberries and other pleasures.Never\nhad the sky looked bluer or the sea brighter, and much we wished that\nwe could have wandered on in dreamy peace, day after day, or even gone\nthrough England, gipsy-fashion, in a house upon wheels, which always\nseemed to me the very ideal of travelling.Pretty little Sennen, with its ancient\nchurch and its new school house, where the civil schoolmaster gave me\nsome ink to write a post-card for those to whom even the post-mark\n"Sennen" would have a touching interest, and where the boys and girls,\nreleased for dinner, were running about.Board school pupils, no doubt,\nweighted with an amount of learning which would have been appalling\nto their grandfathers and grandmothers, the simple parishioners of\nthe "fine young fellow" half a century ago.As we passed through the\nvillage with its pretty cottages and "Lodgings to Let," we could not\nhelp thinking what a delightful holiday resort this would be for\na large small family, who could be turned out as we were when the\ncarriage could no farther go, on the wide sweep of green common,\ngradually melting into silvery sand, so fine and soft that it was\nalmost a pleasure to tumble down the <DW72>s, and get up again, shaking\nyourself like a dog, without any sense of dirt or discomfort.What a\nparadise for children, who might burrow like rabbits and wriggle about\nlike sand-eels, and never come to any harm!Without thought of any danger, we began selecting our bathing-place,\nshallow enough, with long strips of wet shimmering sand to be crossed\nbefore reaching even the tiniest waves; when one of us, the cautious\none, appealed to an old woman, the only human being in sight."Folks ne\'er bathe here.Whether she understood us or not, or whether we\nquite understood her, I am not sure, and should be sorry to libel such\na splendid bathing ground--apparently.But maternal wisdom interposed,\nand the girls yielded.When, half an hour afterwards, we saw a solitary\nfigure moving on a distant ledge of rock, and a black dot, doubtless\na human head, swimming or bobbing about in the sea beneath--maternal\nwisdom was reproached as arrant cowardice.But the sand was delicious,\nthe sea-wind so fresh, and the sea so bright, that disappointment could\nnot last.We made an encampment of our various impedimenta, stretched\nourselves out, and began the search for shells, in which every\narm\'s-length involved a mine of wealth and beauty.Never except at one place, on the estuary of the Mersey, have I\nseen a beach made up of shells so lovely in colour and shape; very\nminute; some being no bigger than a grain of rice or a pin\'s head.The\ncollecting of them was a fascination.We forgot all the historical\ninterests that ought to have moved us, saw neither Athelstan, King\nStephen, King John, nor Perkin Warbeck, each of whom is said to have\nlanded here--what were they to a tiny shell, like that moralised over\nby Tennyson in "Maud"--"small, but a work divine"?I think infinite\ngreatness sometimes touches one less than infinite littleness--the\nexceeding tenderness of Nature, or the Spirit which is behind Nature,\nwho can fashion with equal perfectness a starry hemisphere and a\nglow-worm; an ocean and a little pink shell.The only imperfection in\ncreation seems--oh, strange mystery!--to be man.But away with moralising, or dreaming, though this was just a day for\ndreaming, clear, bright, warm, with not a sound except the murmur\nof the low waves, running in an enormous length--curling over and\nbreaking on the soft sands.Everything was so heavenly calm, it seemed\nimpossible to believe in that terrible scene when the captain and his\nwife were seen clinging to the Brisons rock, just ahead.Doubtless our friend of the _Agamemnon_ was telling this and all\nhis other stories to an admiring circle of tourists, for we saw the\nLand\'s End covered with a moving swarm like black flies.How thankful\nwe felt that we had "done" it on a Sunday!Still, we were pleased\nto have another gaze at it, with its line of picturesque rocks, the\nArmed Knight and the Irish Lady--though, I confess, I never could make\nout which was the knight and which was the lady.Can it be that some\nfragment of the legend of Tristram and Iseult originated these names?After several sweet lazy hours, we went through a "fish-cellar," a\nlittle group of cottages, and climbed a headland, to take our veritable\nfarewell of the Land\'s End, and then decided to go home.We had rolled\nor thrown our provision basket, rugs, &c., down the sandy <DW72>, but it\nwas another thing to carry them up again.I went in quest of a small\nboy, and there presented himself a big man, coastguard, as the only\nunemployed hand in the place, who apologised with such a magnificent\nair for not having "cleaned" himself, that I almost blushed to ask\nhim to do such a menial service as to carry a bundle of wraps.But\nhe accepted it, conversing amiably as we went, and giving me a most\ngraphic picture of life at Sennen during the winter.When he left me,\nmaking a short cut to our encampment--a black dot on the sands, with\ntwo moving black dots near it--a fisher wife joined me, and of her own\naccord began a conversation.She and I fraternised at once, chiefly on the subject of children, a\ngroup of whom were descending the road from Sennen School.She told me\nhow many of them were hers, and what prizes they had gained, and what\nhard work it was.She could neither read nor write, she said, but she\nliked her children to be good scholars, and they learnt a deal up at\nSennen.Apparently they did, and something else besides learning, for when I\nhad parted from my loquacious friend, I came up to the group just in\ntime to prevent a stand-up fight between two small mites, the _casus\nbelli_ of which I could no more arrive at, than a great many wiser\npeople can discover the origin of national wars.So I thought the\nstrong hand of "intervention"--civilised intervention--was best, and\nput an end to it, administering first a good scolding, and then a coin.The division of this coin among the little party compelled an extempore\nsum in arithmetic, which I required them to do (for the excellent\nreason that I couldn\'t do it myself!)Therefore I\nconclude that the heads of the Sennen school-children are as solid as\ntheir fists, and equally good for use.[Illustration: ON THE ROAD TO ST.which as the fisher wife told me, only goes to\nPenzance about once a year, and is, as yet, innocent of tourists, for\nthe swarm at the Land\'s End seldom goes near Whitesand Bay.Existence\nhere must be very much that of an oyster,--but perhaps oysters are\nhappy.By the time we reached Penzance the lovely day was dying into an\nequally lovely evening.It was high water, the bay was all alive with boats, and there was\nquite a little crowd of people gathered at the mild little station of\nMarazion.A princess was expected, that young half-English, half-foreign\nprincess, in whose romantic story the British public has taken such an\ninterest, sympathising with the motherly kindness of our good Queen,\nwith the wedding at Windsor, and the sad little infant funeral there,\na year after.The Princess Frederica of Hanover, and the Baron Von\nPawel-Rammingen, her father\'s secretary, who, like a stout mediaeval\nknight, had loved, wooed, and married her, were coming to St.Michael\'s\nMount on a visit to the St.Marazion had evidently roused itself, and risen to the occasion.Half\nthe town must have turned out to the beach, and the other half secured\nevery available boat, in which it followed, at respectful distance,\nthe two boats, one full of luggage, the other of human beings, which\nwere supposed to be the royal party.People speculated with earnest\ncuriosity, which was the princess, and which her husband, and what the\nSt.Aubyns would do with them; whether they would be taken to see the\nLand\'s End, and whether they would go there as ordinary tourists, or in\na grand visit of state.How hard it is that royal folk can never see\nanything except in state, or in a certain adventitious garb, beautiful,\nno doubt, but satisfactorily hiding the real thing.How they must long\nsometimes for a walk, after the fashion of Haroun Alraschid, up and\ndown Regent Street and Oxford Street!or an incognito foreign tour, or\neven a solitary country walk, without a "lady-in-waiting."We had no opera-glass to add to the many levelled at those two boats,\nso we went in--hoping host and guests would spend a pleasant evening in\nthe lovely old rooms we knew.We spent ours in rest, and in arranging\nfor to-morrow\'s flight.Also in consulting with our kindly landlady\nas to a possible house at Marazion for some friends whom the winter\nmight drive southwards, like the swallows, to a climate which, in this\none little bay shut out from east and north, is--they told us--during\nall the cruel months which to many of us means only enduring life, not\nliving--as mild and equable almost as the Mediterranean shores.And\nfinally, we settled all with our faithful Charles, who looked quite\nmournful at parting with his ladies."Yes, it is rather a long drive, and pretty lonely," said he."But I\'ll\nwait till the moons up, and that\'ll help us.We\'ll get into Falmouth\nby daylight.I\'ve got to do the same thing often enough through the\nsummer, so I don\'t mind it."Thus said the good fellow, putting a cheery face on it, then with a\nhasty "Good-bye, ladies," he rushed away.But we had taken his address,\nnot meaning to lose sight of him.(Nor have we done so up to this date\nof writing; and the fidelity has been equal on both sides.)Then, in the midst of a peal of bells which was kept up unweariedly\ntill 10 P.M.--evidently Marazion is not blessed with the sight\nof a princess every day--we closed our eyes upon all outward things,\nand went away to the Land of Nod.DAY THE THIRTEENTH\n\n\nInto King Arthurs land--Tintagel his birth-place, and Camelford,\nwhere he fought his last battle--the legendary region of which one\nmay believe as much or as little as one pleases--we were going\nto-day.With the good common sense which we flattered ourselves had\naccompanied every step of our unsentimental journey, we had arranged\nall before-hand, ordered a carriage to meet the mail train, and hoped\nto find at Tintagel--not King Uther Pendragon, King Arthur or King\nMark, but a highly respectable landlord, who promised us a welcome at\nan inn--which we only trusted would be as warm and as kindly as that we\nleft behind us at Marazion.The line of railway which goes to the far west of England is one of the\nprettiest in the kingdom on a fine day, which we were again blessed\nwith.It had been a wet summer, we heard, throughout Cornwall, but\nin all our journey, save that one wild storm at the Lizard, sunshine\nscarcely ever failed us.Ives\nBay or sweeping through the mining district of Redruth, and the wooded\ncountry near Truro, Grampound, and St.Austell, till we again saw the\nglittering sea on the other side of Cornwall--all was brightness.Then\ndarting inland once more, our iron horse carried us past Lostwithiel,\nthe little town which once boasted Joseph Addison, M.P., as its\nrepresentative; gave us a fleeting vision of Ristormel, one of the\nancient castles of Cornwall, and on through a leafy land, beginning to\nchange from rich green to the still richer yellows and reds of autumn,\ntill we stopped at Bodmin Road.No difficulty in finding our carriage, for it was the only one there;\na huge vehicle, of ancient build, the horses to match, capable of\naccommodating a whole family and its luggage.We missed our compact\nlittle machine, and our brisk, kindly Charles, but soon settled\nourselves in dignified, roomy state, for the twenty miles, or rather\nmore, which lay between us and the coast.Our way ran along lonely\nquiet country roads and woods almost as green as when Queen Guinevere\nrode through them "a maying," before the dark days of her sin and King\nArthur\'s death.Here it occurs to me, as it did this day to a practical youthful mind,\n"What in the world do people know about King Arthur?"Well, most people have read Tennyson, and a few are acquainted with\nthe "Morte d\'Arthur" of Sir Thomas Malory.But, perhaps I had better\nbriefly give the story, or as much of it as is necessary for the\nedification of outsiders.Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falling in love with Ygrayne, wife of\nthe duke of Cornwall, besieged them in their twin castles of Tintagel\nand Terrabil, slew the husband, and the same day married the wife.Unto\nwhom a boy was born, and by advice of the enchanter Merlin, carried\naway, from the sea-shore beneath Tintagel, and confided to a good\nknight, Sir Ector, to be brought up as his own son, and christened\nArthur.On the death of the king, Merlin produced the youth, who was\nrecognized by his mother Ygrayne, and proclaimed king in the stead\nof Uther Pendragon.He instituted the Order of Knights of the Round\nTable, who were to go everywhere, punishing vice and rescuing oppressed\nvirtue, for the love of God and of some noble lady.He married\nGuinevere, daughter of King Leodegrance, who forsook him for the love\nof Sir Launcelot, his bravest knight and dearest friend.One by one,\nhis best knights fell away into sin, and his nephew Mordred raised a\nrebellion, fought with him, and conquered him at Camelford.Seeing his\nend was near, Arthur bade his last faithful knight, Sir Bedevere, carry\nhim to the shore of a mere (supposed to be Dozmare Pool) and throw in\nthere his sword Excalibur; when appeared a boat with three queens,\nwho lifted him in, mourning over him.With them he sailed away across\nthe mere, to be healed of his grievous wound.Some say that he was\nafterwards buried in a chapel near, others declare that he lives still\nin fairy land, and will reappear in latter days, to reinstate the Order\nof Knights of the Round Table, and rule his beloved England, which will\nthen be perfect as he once tried to make it, but in vain.Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but\na very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country\ntowns; the same genteel linendrapers\' and un-genteel ironmongers\'\nshops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but\nsolid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and\ntheir backs nestled in gardens and fields.Some of the inhabitants of\nthese said houses were to be seen taking a quiet afternoon stroll.Doubtless they are eminently respectable and worthy folk, leading a\nmild provincial life like the people in Miss Martineau\'s _Deerbrook_,\nor Miss Austen\'s _Pride and Prejudice_--of which latter quality they\nhave probably a good share.We let our horses rest, but we ourselves felt not the slightest wish to\nrest at Camelford, so walked leisurely on till we came to the little\nriver Camel, and to Slaughter Bridge, said to be the point where King\nArthur\'s army was routed and where he received his death-wound.A\nslab of stone, some little distance up the stream, is still called\n"King Arthur\'s Tomb."But as his coffin is preserved, as well as his\nRound Table, at Winchester; where, according to mediaeval tradition,\nthe bodies of both Arthur and Guinevere were found, and the head\nof Guinevere had yellow hair; also that near the little village of\nDavidstow, is a long barrow, having in the centre a mound, which is\ncalled "King Arthur\'s grave"--inquiring minds have plenty of "facts" to\nchoose from.Possibly at last they had better resort to fiction, and\nbelieve in Arthur\'s disappearance, as Tennyson makes him say,\n\n  "To the island-valley of Avillion...\n  Where I may heal me of my grievous wound."Dozmare Pool we found so far out of our route that we had to make a\nvirtue of necessity, and imagine it all; the melancholy moorland lake,\nwith the bleak hill above it, and stray glimpses of the sea beyond.A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend\nof Arthur.Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his\ndwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to\nthe bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing\nround it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still\nlingeringly believes.Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and\nhorses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it;\nflitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human\nfoot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and\nwe might have heard them all.Might also have seen, in fancy, the flash\nof the "brand Excalibur"; heard the wailing song of the three queens;\nand pictured the dying Arthur lying on the lap of his sister Morgane la\nFaye.But, I forgot, this is an un-sentimental journey.The Delabole quarries are as un-sentimental a place as one could\ndesire.It was very curious to come suddenly upon this world of slate,\npiled up in enormous masses on either side the road, and beyond them\nhills of debris, centuries old--for the mines have been worked ever\nsince the time of Queen Elizabeth.Houses, walls, gates, fences,\neverything that can possibly be made of slate, is made.No green or\nother colour tempers the all-pervading shade of bluish-grey, for\nvegetation in the immediate vicinity of the quarries is abolished,\nthe result of which would be rather dreary, save for the cheerful\natmosphere of wholesome labour, the noise of waggons, horses,\nsteam-engines--such a contrast to the silence of the deserted tin-mines.But, these Delabole quarries passed, silence and solitude come back\nagain.Even the yearly-increasing influx of tourists fails to make\nthe little village of Trevena anything but a village, where the\nsaid tourists lounge about in the one street, if it can be called a\nstreet, between the two inns and the often-painted, picturesque old\npost-office.Everything looked so simple, so home-like, that we were\namused to find we had to get ready for a _table d\'hote_ dinner, in\nthe only available eating room where the one indefatigable waitress,\na comely Cornish girl, who seemed Argus and Briareus rolled into one,\nserved us--a party small enough to make conversation general, and\npleasant and intelligent enough to make it very agreeable, which does\nnot always happen at an English hotel.Then we sallied out to find the lane which leads to Tintagel Castle,\nor Castles--for one sits in the sea, the other on the opposite heights\nin the mainland, with power of communicating by the narrow causeway\nwhich now at least exists between the rock and the shore.This seems to\nconfirm the legend, how the luckless husband of Ygrayne shut up himself\nand his wife in two castles, he being slain in the one, and she married\nto the victorious King Uther Pendragon, in the other.Both looked so steep and dangerous in the fast-coming twilight that we\nthought it best to attempt neither, so contented ourselves with a walk\non the cliffs and the smooth green field which led thither.Leaning\nagainst a gate, we stood and watched one of the grandest out of the\nmany grand sunsets which had blessed us in Cornwall.The black rock of\nTintagel filled the foreground; beyond, the eye saw nothing but sea,\nthe sea which covers vanished Lyonesse, until it met the sky, a clear\namber with long bars like waves, so that you could hardly tell where\nsea ended and sky began.Then into it there swam slowly a long low\ncloud, shaped like a boat, with a raised prow, and two or three figures\nsitting at the stern."King Arthur and the three queens," we declared, and really a very\nmoderate imagination could have fancied it this."But what is that long\nblack thing at the bow?""Oh," observed drily the most practical of the three, "it\'s King\nArthur\'s luggage."We fell into fits of laughter, and\nwent home to tea and bed.DAYS FOURTEENTH, FIFTEENTH, AND SIXTEENTH--\n\n\nAnd all Arthurian days, so I will condense them into one chapter, and\nnot spin out the hours that were flying so fast.Yet we hardly wished\nto stop them; for pleasant as travelling is, the best delight of all\nis--the coming home.Walking, to one more of those exquisite autumn days, warm as summer,\nyet with a tender brightness that hot summer never has, like the love\nbetween two old people, out of whom all passion has died--we remembered\nthat we were at Tintagel, the home of Ygrayne and Arthur, of King Mark\nand Tristram and Iseult.I had to tell that story to my girls in the\nbriefest form, how King Mark sent his nephew, Sir Tristram, to fetch\nhome Iseult of Ireland for his queen, and on the voyage Bragswaine,\nher handmaiden, gave each a love-potion, which caused the usual fatal\nresult; how at last Tristram fled from Tintagel into Brittany, where\nhe married another Iseult "of the white hands," and lived peacefully,\ntill, stricken by death, his fancy went back to his old love, whom he\nimplored to come to him.A tale--of which\nthe only redeeming point is the innocence, simplicity, and dignity of\nthe second Iseult, the unloved Breton wife, to whom none of our modern\npoets who have sung or travestied the wild, passionate, miserable, ugly\nstory, have ever done full justice.These sinful lovers, the much-wronged but brutal King Mark, the\nscarcely less brutal Uther Pendragon, and hapless Ygrayne--what a\ncurious condition of morals and manners the Arthurian legends unfold!A time when might was right; when every one seized what he wanted just\nbecause he wanted it, and kept it, if he could, till a stronger hand\nwrenched it from him.That in such a state of society there should\never have arisen the dimmest dream of a man like Arthur--not perhaps\nTennyson\'s Arthur, the "blameless king," but even Sir Thomas Malory\'s,\nfounded on mere tradition--is a remarkable thing.Clear through all\nthe mists of ages shines that ideal of knighthood, enjoining courage,\nhonour, faith, chastity, the worship of God and the service of men.Also, in the very highest degree, inculcating that chivalrous love of\nwoman--not women--which barbaric nations never knew.As we looked at\nthat hoar ruin sitting solitary in the sunny sea, and thought of the\ndays when it was a complete fortress, inclosing a mass of human beings,\nall with human joys, sorrows, passions, crimes--things that must have\nexisted in essence, however legend has exaggerated or altered them--we\ncould not but feel that the mere possibility of a King Arthur shining\ndown the dim vista of long-past centuries, is something to prove that\ngoodness, like light, has an existence as indestructible as Him from\nwhom it comes.We looked at Tintagel with its risky rock-path."It will be a hot\nclimb, and our bathing days are numbered.Let us go in the opposite\ndirection to Bossinney Cove."Practicality when weighed against Poetry is poor--Poetry always kicks\nthe beam.While waiting for\nthe tide to cover the little strip of sand, we re-mounted the winding\npath, and settled ourselves like seabirds on the furthermost point of\nrock, whence, just by extending a hand, we could have dropped anything,\nourselves even, into a sheer abyss of boiling waves, dizzy to look down\ninto, and yet delicious.So was the bath, though a little gloomy, for the sun could barely reach\nthe shut-in cove; and we were interfered with considerably by--not\ntourists--but a line of donkeys!They were seen solemnly descending the\nnarrow cliff-path one by one--eleven in all--each with an empty sack\nover his shoulder.Lastly came a very old man, who, without taking the\nleast notice of us, disposed himself to fill these sacks with sand.One after the other the eleven meek animals came forward and submitted\neach to his load, which proceeding occupied a good hour and a half.I hardly know which was the most patient, the old man or his donkeys.[Illustration: CRESWICK\'S MILL IN THE ROCKY VALLEY.]We began some of us to talk to his beasts, and others to himself."Yes,\nit was hard work," he said, "but he managed to come down to the cove\nthree times a day.They all had their\nnames; Lucy, Cherry, Sammy, Tom, Jack, Ned;" each animal pricked up its\nlong ears and turned round its quiet eyes when called.Some were young\nand some old, but all were very sure-footed, which was necessary here."The weight some of \'em would carry was wonderful."The old man seemed proud of the creatures, and kind to them too in a\nsort of way.He had been a fisherman, he said, but now was too old for\nthat; so got his living by collecting sand."It makes capital garden-paths, this sand.I\'d be glad to bring you\nsome, ladies," said he, evidently with an eye to business.When we\nexplained that this was impracticable, unless he would come all the way\nto London, he merely said, "Oh," and accepted the disappointment.Then\nbidding us a civil "Good day," he disappeared with his laden train.Nothing of the past knightly days, nothing of the\nbusy existing modern present affected him, or ever would do so.He\nmight have been own brother, or cousin, to Wordsworth\'s "Leech-gatherer\non the lonely moor."Whenever we think of Bossinney Cove, we shall\ncertainly think of that mild old man and his eleven donkeys.The day was hot, and it had been a steep climb; we decided to drive in\nthe afternoon, "for a rest," to Boscastle.Artists and tourists haunt this picturesque nook.A village built at\nthe end of a deep narrow creek, which runs far inland, and is a safe\nshelter for vessels of considerable size.On either side is a high\nfootpath, leading to two headlands, from both of which the views of\nsea and coast are very fine.And there are relics of antiquity and\nlegends thereto belonging--a green mound, all that remains of Bottrieux\nCastle; and Ferrabury Church, with its silent tower.A peal of bells\nhad been brought, and the ship which carried them had nearly reached\nthe cove, when the pilot, bidding the captain "thank God for his safe\nvoyage," was answered that he "thanked only himself and a fair wind."Immediately a storm arose; and the ship went down with every soul on\nboard--except the pilot.So the church tower is mute--but on winter\nnights the lost bells are still heard, sounding mournfully from the\ndepths of the sea.As we sat, watching with a vague fascination the spouting, minute by\nminute, of a "blow-hole," almost as fine as the Kynance post-office--we\nmoralised on the story of the bells, and on the strange notions people\nhave, even in these days, of Divine punishments; imputing to the\nAlmighty Father all their own narrow jealousies and petty revenges,\ndragging down God into the likeness of men, such an one as themselves,\ninstead of striving to lift man into the image of God.Meantime the young folks rambled and scrambled--watched with anxious\nand even envious eyes--for it takes one years to get entirely\nreconciled to the quiescence of the down-hill journey.And then we\ndrove slowly back--just in time for another grand sunset, with Tintagel\nblack in the foreground, until it and all else melted into darkness,\nand there was nothing left but to\n\n  "Watch the twilight stars come out\n    Above the lonely sea."Next morning we must climb Tintagel, for it would be our last day.How softly the waves crept in upon the\nbeach--just as they might have done when they laid at Merlin\'s feet\n"the little naked child," disowned of man but dear to Heaven, who was\nto grow up into the "stainless king."He and his knights--the "shadowy people of the realm of dream,"--were\nall about us, as, guided by a rheumatic old woman, who climbed feebly\nup the stair, where generations of ghostly feet must have ascended and\ndescended, we reached a bastion and gateway, quite pre-historic.Sandra went back to the garden.Other\nruins apparently belong to the eleventh or twelfth centuries.It may have been the very landing-place of King\nUther or King Mark, or other Cornish heroes, who held this wonderful\nnatural-artificial fortress in the dim days of old romance."Here are King Arthur\'s cups and saucers," said the old woman, pausing\nin the midst of a long lament over her own ailments, to point out some\nholes in the slate rock."And up there you\'ll find the chapel.It\'s an\neasy climb--if you mind the path--just where it passes the spring."That spring, trickling down from the very top of the rock, and making\na verdant space all round it--what a treasure it must have been to the\nunknown inhabitants who, centuries ago, entrenched themselves here--for\noffence or defence--against the main-land.Peacefully it flowed on\nstill, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside\nit.We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those\nlong-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved,\nfought and died.The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it\ncan still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur\'s time.However,\nthere are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys\nso much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is\na great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost\nanything it likes.We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one\nobvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene,\nseawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed\nto behold.Beaten by winds and waves till the grey of its slate\nformation is nearly black; worn into holes by the constant action of\nthe tide which widens yearly the space between it and the main-land,\nand gnaws the rock below into dangerous hollows that in time become\nsea-caves, Tintagel still remains--and one marvels that so much of it\ndoes still remain--a landmark of the cloudy time between legend and\nactual history.Whether the ruin on the opposite height was once a portion of\nTintagel Castle, before the sea divided it, making a promontory into\nan island--or whether it was the Castle Terrabil, in which Gorlois,\nYgrayne\'s husband, was slain--no one now can say.That both the twin\nfortresses were habitable till Elizabeth\'s time, there is evidence to\nprove.But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep\nand the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in\nwhose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the\nfamiliar scene.We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two\ntame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about\nin a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there.We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough\nor a raven.So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and\nscream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky\nhollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the "iron\ngate," over against Tintagel.We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel\nwe found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves\nbeyond Tintagel, which they declared were "the finest things they had\nfound in Cornwall."It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day.And, I think, the looser grows one\'s grasp of life, the greater is\none\'s longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this\nwonderful, beautiful world.So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves\nonce more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas!not John\nCurgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep.No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby\nwaves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat\nwent dancing up and down like a sea-gull!"Ay, there\'s some sea on, there always is here, but we\'ll be through it\npresently," indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied\nhis oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all\nthe while.He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea,\nunless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had\nto be done.We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts\nof the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click\nof their hammers.Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in\nsummer.In winter--\n\n"Oh, they\'re used to it; we\'re all used to it," said our man, who was\nintelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven."Many a\ntime I\'ve got sea-fowls\' eggs on those rocks there," pointing to a\ncliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly.The\ngentry buy them, and we\'re glad of the money.Dangerous?--yes, rather;\nbut one must earn one\'s bread, and it\'s not so bad when you take to it\nyoung."Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds\'\neggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs."Here you are, ladies, and the sea\'s down a bit, as I said.Hold on,\nmate, the boat will go right into the cave."And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out\nof daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking\non a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow\nthat it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them;\nwhile beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of\nthe everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from\nwhich no one could ever hope to come out alive."I don\'t like this at all," said a small voice."Hadn\'t we better get out again?"But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to\nreturn; and begged for "only five minutes" in that wonderful place,\ncompared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as\nnothing.Yet with its\nterror was mingled an awful delight."Give me but five, nay, two\nminutes more!""Very well, just as you choose," was the response of meek despair.The boatmen were told to row on into\ndaylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic\noverhanging cliffs permitted.And never, never, never in this world\nshall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave.But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself\non my memory with an almost painful vividness.However, I promised not\nto regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not.I did see\nit, for just a glimpse; and that will serve.Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in\nquiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building\ndating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff,\nand with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude\nHaven on the other.Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild\nSeptember sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited\ncountry which lie between Tintagel and Launceston.In the midst of\nit, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round\nand pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about\nhalf-a-mile off."There, ladies, that\'s King Arthur\'s grave."The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.These varied\nrecords of the hero\'s last resting-place remind one of the three heads,\nsaid to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little\nboy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man.But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur\'s\ncountry is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it\nalone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of\nTintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the\nbright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea.Just the region, in\nshort, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian\nlegend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of\nbarbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes.An age in which the mere\nidea of such a hero as that ideal knight\n\n  "Who reverenced his conscience as his God:\n  Whose glory was redressing human wrong:\n  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it:\n  Who loved one only, and who clave to her--"\n\nrises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star.If Arthur could "come again"--perhaps in the person of one of the\ndescendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died\namong us in this very nineteenth century--\n\n  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--"\n\nif this could be--what a blessing for Arthur\'s beloved England![Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.]L\'ENVOI\n\n\nWritten more than a year after.The "old hen" and her chickens have\nlong been safe at home.A dense December fog creeps in everywhere,\nchoking and blinding, as I finish the history of those fifteen innocent\ndays, calm as autumn, and bright as spring, when we three took our\nUnsentimental Journey together through Cornwall.Many a clever critic,\nlike Sir Charles Coldstream when he looked into the crater of Vesuvius,\nmay see "nothing in it"--a few kindly readers looking a little further,\nmay see a little more: probably the writer only sees the whole.But such as it is, let it stay--simple memorial of what Americans would\ncall "a good time," the sunshine of which may cast its brightness far\nforward, even into that quiet time "when travelling days are done."LONDON:\n  R. CLAY, SONS, AND TAYLOR,\n  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C."What is your idea about the way they happened to come there, based on\nwhat you have learned since?""Well, it is a very simple idea," returned the sprite."You know when a\nsuspender button comes off it always disappears.Of course it must go\nsomewhere, but the question is, where?No one has ever yet been known to\nrecover the suspender button he has once really lost; and my notion of\nit is simply that the minute a metal suspender button comes off the\nclothes of anybody in all the whole universe, it immediately flies up\nthrough the air and space to Twinkleville, which is nothing more than a\nhuge magnet, and lies there until somebody picks it up and tries to sell\nit.I remember as a boy sweeping our back yard clear of them one\nevening, and waking the next morning to find the whole place covered\nwith them again; but we never could make money on them, because the moon\nwas our sole market, and only the best people of the moon ever used\nsuspenders, and as these were unfortunately relatives of ours, we had to\ngive them all the buttons they wanted for nothing, so that the button\ncrops became rather an expense to us than otherwise.But with soda-water\nit was different.Everybody, it doesn\'t make any difference where he\nlives, likes soda-water, and it was an especially popular thing in the\nmoon, where the plain water is always so full of fish that nobody can\ndrink it.But as I said before, often the stage-coach wouldn\'t or\ncouldn\'t stop, and we found ourselves getting poorer every day.Finally\nmy father made up his mind to lease, and move into this new star, sink a\nhalf-dozen soda-water wells there, and by means of a patent he owned,\nwhich enabled him to give each well a separate and distinct flavor,\ndrive everybody else out of the business.""You don\'t happen to remember how that patent your father owned worked,\ndo you?"asked the major, noticing that Jimmieboy seemed particularly\ninterested when the sprite mentioned this."If you do, I\'d like to buy\nthe plan of it from you and give it to Jimmieboy for a Christmas\npresent, so that he can have soda-water wells in his own back yard at\nhome.""No, I can\'t remember anything about it," said the sprite."Nine\nthousand years is a long time to remember things of that kind, though I\ndon\'t think the scheme was a very hard one to work.For vanilla cream,\nit only required a well with plain soda-water in it with a quart of\nvanilla beans and three pints of cream poured into it four times a week;\nsame way with other flavors--a quart of strawberries for strawberry,\nsarsaparilla for sarsaparilla, and so forth; but the secret was in the\npouring; there was something in the way papa did the pouring; I never\nknew just what it was.But if you don\'t stop asking questions I\'ll never finish my story.""You shouldn\'t make it so interesting if you don\'t want us to have our\ncuriosity excited by it," said Jimmieboy."I\'d have asked those\nquestions if the major hadn\'t."Well, we moved, and in a very short time were comfortably settled in\nthe suburban star I have mentioned," continued the sprite.John went to the bedroom."As we\nexpected, my father grew very, very rich.He was referred to in the moon\nnewspapers as \'The Soda-water King,\' and once an article about him said\nthat he owned the finest suspender-button mine in the universe, which\nwas more or less true, but which, as it turned out, was unfortunate in\nits results.Some moon people hearing of his ownership of the\nTwinkleville Button Mines came to him and tried to persuade him that\nthey ought to be worked.Father said he didn\'t see any use of it,\nbecause the common people didn\'t wear suspenders, and so didn\'t need the\nbuttons."\'True,\' said they, \'but we can compel them to need them, by making a\nlaw requiring that everybody over sixteen shall wear suspenders.\'"\'That\'s a good idea,\' said my father, and he tried to have it made a\nlaw that every one should wear suspenders, high or low, and as a result\nhe got everybody mad at him.The best people were angry, because up to\nthat time the wearing of suspenders had been regarded as a sign of noble\nbirth, and if everybody, including the common people, were to have them\nthey would cease to be so.The common people themselves were angry,\nbecause to have to buy suspenders would simply be an addition to the\ncost of living, and they hadn\'t any money to spare.In consequence we\nwere cut off by the best people of the moon.Nobody ever came to see us\nexcept the very commonest kind of common people, and they came at night,\nand then only to drop pailfuls of cod-liver oil, squills, ipecac, and\nother unpopular things into our soda-water wells, so that in a very\nshort time my poor father\'s soda-water business was utterly ruined.People don\'t like to order ten quarts of vanilla cream soda-water for\nSunday dinner, and find it flavored with cod-liver oil, you know.""Yes, I do know," said Jimmieboy, screwSandra moved to the bathroom.']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Landed at Flushing, he was fortunate enough to meet with an old officer\nwho had been in service with his father.By his advice, he shunned going\nimmediately to the Hague, but forwarded his letters to the court of the\nStadtholder."Our prince," said the veteran, "must as yet keep terms with his\nfather-in-law and with your King Charles; and to approach him in the\ncharacter of a Scottish malecontent would render it imprudent for him to\ndistinguish you by his favour.Wait, therefore, his orders, without\nforcing yourself on his notice; observe the strictest prudence and\nretirement; assume for the present a different name; shun the company of\nthe British exiles; and, depend upon it, you will not repent your\nprudence."The old friend of Silas Morton argued justly.After a considerable time\nhad elapsed, the Prince of Orange, in a progress through the United\nStates, came to the town where Morton, impatient at his situation and the\nincognito which he was obliged to observe, still continued, nevertheless,\nto be a resident.He had an hour of private interview assigned, in which\nthe prince expressed himself highly pleased with his intelligence, his\nprudence, and the liberal view which he seemed to take of the factions of\nhis native country, their motives and their purposes."I would gladly," said William, "attach you to my own person; but that\ncannot be without giving offence in England.But I will do as much for\nyou, as well out of respect for the sentiments you have expressed, as for\nthe recommendations you have brought me.Here is a commission in a Swiss\nregiment at present in garrison in a distant province, where you will\nmeet few or none of your countrymen.Continue to be Captain Melville, and\nlet the name of Morton sleep till better days.""Thus began my fortune," continued Morton; "and my services have, on\nvarious occasions, been distinguished by his Royal Highness, until the\nmoment that brought him to Britain as our political deliverer.His\ncommands must excuse my silence to my few friends in Scotland; and I\nwonder not at the report of my death, considering the wreck of the\nvessel, and that I found no occasion to use the letters of exchange with\nwhich I was furnished by the liberality of some of them,--a circumstance\nwhich must have confirmed the belief that I had perished.""But, dear hinny," asked Mrs.Wilson, "did ye find nae Scotch body at the\nPrince of Oranger\'s court that kend ye?I wad hae thought Morton o\'\nMilnwood was kend a\' through the country.""I was purposely engaged in distant service," said Morton, "until a\nperiod when few, without as deep and kind a motive of interest as yours,\nAilie, would have known the stripling Morton in Major-General Melville.""Malville was your mother\'s name," said Mrs.Wilson; "but Morton sounds\nfar bonnier in my auld lugs.And when ye tak up the lairdship, ye maun\ntak the auld name and designation again.""I am like to be in no haste to do either the one or the other, Ailie,\nfor I have some reasons for the present to conceal my being alive from\nevery one but you; and as for the lairdship of Milnwood, it is in as good\nhands.""As gude hands, hinny!"re-echoed Ailie; "I\'m hopefu\' ye are no meaning\nmine?The rents and the lands are but a sair fash to me.And I\'m ower\nfailed to tak a helpmate, though Wylie Mactrickit the writer was very\npressing, and spak very civilly; but I\'m ower auld a cat to draw that\nstrae before me.He canna whilliwhaw me as he\'s dune mony a ane.And then\nI thought aye ye wad come back, and I wad get my pickle meal and my soup\nmilk, and keep a\' things right about ye as I used to do in your puir\nuncle\'s time, and it wad be just pleasure eneugh for me to see ye thrive\nand guide the gear canny.Ye\'ll hae learned that in Holland, I\'se\nwarrant, for they\'re thrifty folk there, as I hear tell.--But ye\'ll be\nfor keeping rather a mair house than puir auld Milnwood that\'s gave; and,\nindeed, I would approve o\' your eating butchermeat maybe as aften as\nthree times a-week,--it keeps the wind out o\' the stamack.""We will talk of all this another time," said Morton, surprised at the\ngenerosity upon a large scale which mingled in Ailie\'s thoughts and\nactions with habitual and sordid parsimony, and at the odd contrast\nbetween her love of saving and indifference to self-acquisition."You\nmust know," he continued, "that I am in this country only for a few days\non some special business of importance to the Government, and therefore,\nAilie, not a word of having seen me.At some other time I will acquaint\nyou fully with my motives and intentions.""E\'en be it sae, my jo," replied Ailie, "I can keep a secret like my\nneighbours; and weel auld Milnwood kend it, honest man, for he tauld me\nwhere he keepit his gear, and that\'s what maist folk like to hae as\nprivate as possibly may be.--But come awa wi\' me, hinny, till I show ye\nthe oak-parlour how grandly it\'s keepit, just as if ye had been expected\nhaine every day,--I loot naebody sort it but my ain hands.It was a kind\no\' divertisement to me, though whiles the tear wan into my ee, and I said\nto mysell, What needs I fash wi\' grates and carpets and cushions and the\nmuckle brass candlesticks ony mair?for they\'ll ne\'er come hame that\naught it rightfully."With these words she hauled him away to this sanctum sanctorum, the\nscrubbing and cleaning whereof was her daily employment, as its high\nstate of good order constituted the very pride of her heart.Morton, as\nhe followed her into the room, underwent a rebuke for not "dighting his\nshune," which showed that Ailie had not relinquished her habits of\nauthority.On entering the oak-parlour he could not but recollect the\nfeelings of solemn awe with which, when a boy, he had been affected at\nhis occasional and rare admission to an apartment which he then supposed\nhad not its equal save in the halls of princes.It may be readily\nsupposed that the worked-worsted chairs, with their short ebony legs and\nlong upright backs, had lost much of their influence over his mind; that\nthe large brass andirons seemed diminished in splendour; that the green\nworsted tapestry appeared no masterpiece of the Arras loom; and that the\nroom looked, on the whole, dark, gloomy, and disconsolate.Yet there were\ntwo objects, "The counterfeit presentment of two brothers," which,\ndissimilar as those described by Hamlet, affected his mind with a variety\nof sensations.One full-length portrait represented his father in\ncomplete armour, with a countenance indicating his masculine and\ndetermined character; and the other set forth his uncle, in velvet and\nbrocade, looking as if he were ashamed of his own finery, though entirely\nindebted for it to the liberality of the painter."It was an idle fancy," Ailie said, "to dress the honest auld man in thae\nexpensive fal-lalls that he ne\'er wore in his life, instead o\' his douce\nRaploch grey, and his band wi\' the narrow edging."In private, Morton could not help being much of her opinion; for anything\napproaching to the dress of a gentleman sate as ill on the ungainly\nperson of his relative as an open or generous expression would have done\non his mean and money-making features.He now extricated himself from\nAilie to visit some of his haunts in the neighbouring wood, while her own\nhands made an addition to the dinner she was preparing,--an incident no\notherwise remarkable than as it cost the life of a fowl, which, for any\nevent of less importance than the arrival of Henry Morton, might have\ncackled on to a good old age ere Ailie could have been guilty of the\nextravagance of killing and dressing it.The meal was seasoned by talk of\nold times and by the plans which Ailie laid out for futurity, in which\nshe assigned her young master all the prudential habits of her old one,\nand planned out the dexterity with which she was to exercise her duty as\ngovernante.Morton let the old woman enjoy her day-dreams and\ncastle-building during moments of such pleasure, and deferred till some\nfitter occasion the communication of his purpose again to return and\nspend his life upon the Continent.His next care was to lay aside his military dress, which he considered\nlikely to render more difficult his researches after Burley.He exchanged\nit--for a grey doublet and cloak, formerly his usual attire at Milnwood,\nand which Mrs.Wilson produced from a chest of walnut-tree, wherein she\nhad laid them aside, without forgetting carefully to brush and air them\nfrom time to time.Morton retained his sword and fire-arms, without which\nfew persons travelled in those unsettled times.When he appeared in his\nnew attire, Mrs.Wilson was first thankful "that they fitted him sae\ndecently, since, though he was nae fatter, yet he looked mair manly than\nwhen he was taen frae Milnwood."Next she enlarged on the advantage of saving old clothes to be what she\ncalled "beet-masters to the new," and was far advanced in the history of\na velvet cloak belonging to the late Milnwood, which had first been\nconverted to a velvet doublet, and then into a pair of breeches, and\nappeared each time as good as new, when Morton interrupted her account of\nits transmigration to bid her good-by.He gave, indeed, a sufficient shock to her feelings, by expressing the\nnecessity he was under of proceeding on his journey that evening.And whar wad ye\nsleep but in your ain house, after ye hae been sae mony years frae hame?""I feel all the unkindness of it, Ailie, but it must be so; and that was\nthe reason that I attempted to conceal myself from you, as I suspected\nyou would not let me part from you so easily.""But whar are ye gaun, then?""Saw e\'er mortal een\nthe like o\' you, just to come ae moment, and flee awa like an arrow out\nof a bow the neist?""I must go down," replied Morton, "to Niel Blane the Piper\'s Howff; he\ncan give me a bed, I suppose?"I\'se warrant can he," replied Ailie, "and gar ye pay weel for \'t\ninto the bargain.Laddie, I daresay ye hae lost your wits in thae foreign\nparts, to gang and gie siller for a supper and a bed, and might hae baith\nfor naething, and thanks t\' ye for accepting them.""I assure you, Ailie," said Morton, desirous to silence her\nremonstrances, "that this is a business of great importance, in which I\nmay be a great gainer, and cannot possibly be a loser.""I dinna see how that can be, if ye begin by gieing maybe the feck o\'\ntwal shillings Scots for your supper; but young folks are aye\nventuresome, and think to get siller that way.My puir auld master took\na surer gate, and never parted wi\' it when he had anes gotten \'t."Persevering in his desperate resolution, Morton took leave of Ailie, and\nmounted his horse to proceed to the little town, after exacting a solemn\npromise that she would conceal his return until she again saw or heard\nfrom him."I am not very extravagant," was his natural reflection, as he trotted\nslowly towards the town; "but were Ailie and I to set up house together,\nas she proposes, I think my profusion would break the good old creature\'s\nheart before a week were out."Where\'s the jolly host\n               You told me of?\'T has been my custom ever\n               To parley with mine host.Morton reached the borough town without meeting with any remarkable\nadventure, and alighted at the little inn.It had occurred to him more\nthan once, while upon his journey, that his resumption of the dress which\nhe had worn while a youth, although favourable to his views in other\nrespects, might render it more difficult for him to remain incognito.But\na few years of campaigns and wandering had so changed his appearance that\nhe had great confidence that in the grown man, whose brows exhibited the\ntraces of resolution and considerate thought, none would recognise the\nraw and bashful stripling who won the game of the popinjay.The only\nchance was that here and there some Whig, whom he had led to battle,\nmight remember the Captain of the Milnwood Marksmen; but the risk, if\nthere was any, could not be guarded against.The Howff seemed full and frequented as if possessed of all its old\ncelebrity.The person and demeanour of Niel Blane, more fat and less\ncivil than of yore, intimated that he had increased as well in purse as\nin corpulence; for in Scotland a landlord\'s complaisance for his guests\ndecreases in exact proportion to his rise in the world.His daughter had\nacquired the air of a dexterous barmaid, undisturbed by the circumstances\nof love and war, so apt to perplex her in the exercise of her vocation.Both showed Morton the degree of attention which could have been expected\nby a stranger travelling without attendants, at a time when they were\nparticularly the badges of distinction.He took upon himself exactly the\ncharacter his appearance presented, went to the stable and saw his horse\naccommodated, then returned to the house, and seating himself in the\npublic room (for to request one to himself would, in those days, have\nbeen thought an overweening degree of conceit), he found himself in the\nvery apartment in which he had some years before celebrated his victory\nat the game of the popinjay,--a jocular preferment which led to so many\nserious consequences.He felt himself, as may well be supposed, a much changed man since that\nfestivity; and yet, to look around him, the groups assembled in the Howff\nseemed not dissimilar to those which the same scene had formerly\npresented.Two or three burghers husbanded their "dribbles o\' brandy;"\ntwo or three dragoons lounged over their muddy ale, and cursed the\ninactive times that allowed them no better cheer.Their cornet did not,\nindeed, play at backgammon with the curate in his cassock, but he drank\na little modicum of _aqua mirabilis_ with the grey-cloaked Presbyterian\nminister.The scene was another, and yet the same, differing only in\npersons, but corresponding in general character.Let the tide of the world wax or wane as it will, Morton thought as he\nlooked around him, enough will be found to fill the places which chance\nrenders vacant; and in the usual occupations and amusements of life,\nhuman beings will succeed each other as leaves upon the same tree, with\nthe same individual difference and the same general resemblance.After pausing a few minutes, Morton, whose experience had taught him the\nreadiest mode of securing attention, ordered a pint of claret; and as the\nsmiling landlord appeared with the pewter measure foaming fresh from the\ntap (for bottling wine was not then in fashion), he asked him to sit down\nand take a share of the good cheer.This invitation was peculiarly\nacceptable to Niel Blane, who, if he did not positively expect it from\nevery guest not provided with better company, yet received it from many,\nand was not a whit abashed or surprised at the summons.He sat down,\nalong with his guest, in a secluded nook near the chimney; and while he\nreceived encouragement to drink by far the greater share of the liquor\nbefore them, he entered at length, as a part of his expected functions,\nupon the news of the country,--the births, deaths, and marriages; the\nchange of property; the downfall of old families, and the rise of new.But politics, now the fertile source of eloquence, mine host did not care\nto mingle in his theme; and it was only in answer to a question of Morton\nthat he replied, with an air of indifference, "Um!we aye hae sodgers\namang us, mair or less.There\'s a wheen German horse down at Glasgow\nyonder; they ca\' their commander Wittybody, or some sic name, though he\'s\nas grave and grewsome an auld Dutchman as e\'er I saw."said Morton,--"an old man, with grey hair and\nshort black moustaches; speaks seldom?""And smokes for ever," replied Niel Blane."I see your honour kens the\nman.He may be a very gude man too, for aught I see,--that is,\nconsidering he is a sodger and a Dutchman; but if he were ten generals,\nand as mony Wittybodies, he has nae skill in the pipes; he gar\'d me stop\nin the middle of Torphichen\'s Rant,--the best piece o\' music that ever\nbag gae wind to.""But these fellows," said Morton, glancing his eye towards the soldiers\n"that were in the apartment, are not of his corps?""Na, na, these are Scotch dragoons," said mine host,--"our ain auld\ncaterpillars; these were Claver\'se\'s lads a while syne, and wad be again,\nmaybe, if he had the lang ten in his hand.""Is there not a report of his death?""Troth is there," said the landlord; "your honour is right,--there is sic\na fleeing rumour; but, in my puir opinion, it\'s lang or the deil die.I\nwad hae the folks here look to themsells.If he makes an outbreak, he\'ll\nbe doun frae the Hielands or I could drink this glass,--and whare are\nthey then?A\' thae hell-rakers o\' dragoons wad be at his whistle in a\nmoment.Nae doubt they\'re Willie\'s men e\'en now, as they were James\'s a\nwhile syne; and reason good,--they fight for their pay; what else hae\nthey to fight for?They hae neither lands nor houses, I trow.There\'s ae\ngude thing o\' the change, or the Revolution, as they ca\' it,--folks may\nspeak out afore thae birkies now, and nae fear o\' being hauled awa to the\nguard-house, or having the thumikins screwed on your finger-ends, just as\nI wad drive the screw through a cork."There was a little pause, when Morton, feeling confident in the progress\nhe had made in mine host\'s familiarity, asked, though with the hesitation\nproper to one who puts a question on the answer to which rests something\nof importance, "Whether Blane knew a woman in that neighbourhood called\nElizabeth Maclure?""Whether I ken Bessie Maclure?"answered the landlord, with a landlord\'s\nlaugh,--"How can I but ken my ain wife\'s (haly be her rest!)--my ain\nwife\'s first gudeman\'s sister, Bessie Maclure?An honest wife she is, but\nsair she\'s been trysted wi\' misfortunes,--the loss o\' twa decent lads o\'\nsons, in the time o\' the persecution, as they ca\' it nowadays; and\ndoucely and decently she has borne her burden, blaming nane and\ncondemning nane.If there\'s an honest woman in the world, it\'s Bessie\nMaclure.And to lose her twa sons, as I was saying, and to hae dragoons\nclinked down on her for a month bypast,--for, be Whig or Tory uppermost,\nthey aye quarter thae loons on victuallers,--to lose, as I was saying--"\n\n"This woman keeps an inn, then?""A public, in a puir way," replied Blane, looking round at his own\nsuperior accommodations,--"a sour browst o\' sma\' ale that she sells to\nfolk that are over drouthy wi\' travel to be nice; but naething to ca\' a\nstirring trade or a thriving changehouse.""Your honour will rest here a\' the night?Ye\'ll hardly get accommodation\nat Bessie\'s," said Niel, whose regard for his deceased wife\'s relative by\nno means extended to sending company from his own house to hers."There is a friend," answered Morton, "whom I am to meet with there, and\nI only called here to take a stirrup-cup and inquire the way.""Your honour had better," answerd the landlord, with the perseverance of\nhis calling, "send some ane to warn your friend to come on here.""I tell you, landlord," answered Morton, impatiently, "that will not\nserve my purpose; I must go straight to this woman Maclure\'s house, and\nI desire you to find me a guide.""Aweel, sir, ye\'ll choose for yoursell, to be sure," said Niel Blane,\nsomewhat disconcerted; "but deil a guide ye\'ll need if ye gae doun the\nwater for twa mile or sae, as gin ye were bound for Milnwoodhouse, and\nthen tak the first broken disjasked-looking road that makes for the\nhills,--ye\'ll ken \'t by a broken ash-tree that stands at the side o\' a\nburn just where the roads meet; and then travel out the path,--ye canna\nmiss Widow Maclure\'s public, for deil another house or hauld is on the\nroad for ten lang Scots miles, and that\'s worth twenty English.I am\nsorry your honour would think o\' gaun out o\' my house the night.But my\nwife\'s gude-sister is a decent woman, and it\'s no lost that a friend\ngets."Morton accordingly paid his reckoning and departed.The sunset of the\nsummer day placed him at the ash-tree, where the path led up towards the\nmoors."Here," he said to himself, "my misfortunes commenced; for just here,\nwhen Burley and I were about to separate on the first night we ever met,\nhe was alarmed by the intelligence that the passes were secured by\nsoldiers lying in wait for him.Beneath that very ash sate the old woman\nwho apprised him of his danger.How strange that my whole fortunes should\nhave become inseparably interwoven with that man\'s, without anything more\non my part than the discharge of an ordinary duty of humanity!Would to\nHeaven it were possible I could find my humble quiet and tranquillity of\nmind upon the spot where I lost them!"Thus arranging his reflections betwixt speech and thought, he turned his\nhorse\'s head up the path.Evening lowered around him as he advanced up the narrow dell which had\nonce been a wood, but was now a ravine divested of trees, unless where a\nfew, from their inaccessible situation on the edge of precipitous banks,\nor clinging among rocks and huge stones, defied the invasion of men and\nof cattle, like the scattered tribes of a conquered country, driven to\ntake refuge in the barren strength of its mountains.These too, wasted\nand decayed, seemed rather to exist than to flourish, and only served to\nindicate what the landscape had once been.But the stream brawled down\namong them in all its freshness and vivacity, giving the life and\nanimation which a mountain rivulet alone can confer on the barest and\nmost savage scenes, and which the inhabitants of such a country miss when\ngazing even upon the tranquil winding of a majestic stream through plains\nof fertility, and beside palaces of splendour.The track of the road\nfollowed the course of the brook, which was now visible, and now only to\nbe distinguished by its brawling heard among the stones or in the clefts\nof the rock that occasionally interrupted its course."Murmurer that thou art," said Morton, in the enthusiasm of his reverie,\n"why chafe with the rocks that stop thy course for a moment?There is a\nsea to receive thee in its bosom; and there is an eternity for man when\nhis fretful and hasty course through the vale of time shall be ceased and\nover.What thy petty fuming is to the deep and vast billows of a\nshoreless ocean, are our cares, hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows to the\nobjects which must occupy us through the awful and boundless succession\nof ages!"Thus moralizing, our traveller passed on till the dell opened, and the\nbanks, receding from the brook, left a little green vale, exhibiting a\ncroft, or small field, on which some corn was growing, and a cottage,\nwhose walls were not above five feet high, and whose thatched roof, green\nwith moisture, age, houseleek, and grass, had in some places suffered\ndamage from the encroachment of two cows, whose appetite this appearance\nof verdure had diverted from their more legitimate pasture.An ill-spelt\nand worse-written inscription intimated to the traveller that he might\nhere find refreshment for man and horse,--no unacceptable intimation,\nrude as the hut appeared to be, considering the wild path he had trod in\napproaching it, and the high and waste mountains which rose in desolate\ndignity behind this humble asylum.It must indeed have been, thought Morton, in some such spot as this that\nBurley was likely to find a congenial confident.As he approached, he observed the good dame of the house herself, seated\nby the door; she had hitherto been concealed from him by a huge\nalder-bush."Good evening, Mother," said the traveller."Your name is Mistress\nMaclure?""Elizabeth Maclure, sir, a poor widow," was the reply."Can you lodge a stranger for a night?""I can, sir, if he will be pleased with the widow\'s cake and the widow\'s\ncruse.""I have been a soldier, good dame," answered Morton, "and nothing can\ncome amiss to me in the way of entertainment."said the old woman, with a sigh,--"God send ye a better\ntrade!""It is believed to be an honourable profession, my good dame; I hope you\ndo not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?""I judge no one, sir," replied the woman, "and your voice sounds like\nthat of a civil gentleman; but I hae witnessed sae muckle ill wi\'\nsodgering in this puir land that I am e\'en content that I can see nae\nmair o\'t wi\' these sightless organs."As she spoke thus, Morton observed that she was blind."Shall I not be troublesome to you, my good dame?"said he,\ncompassionately; "your infirmity seems ill calculated for your\nprofession.""Na, sir," answered the old woman, "I can gang about the house readily\neneugh; and I hae a bit lassie to help me, and the dragoon lads will look\nafter your horse when they come hame frae their patrol, for a sma\'\nmatter; they are civiller now than lang syne.""Peggy, my bonny bird," continued the hostess, addressing a little girl\nof twelve years old, who had by this time appeared, "tak the gentleman\'s\nhorse to the stable, and slack his girths, and tak aff the bridle, and\nshake down a lock o\' hay before him, till the dragoons come back.--Come\nthis way, sir," she continued; "ye\'ll find my house clean, though it\'s a\npuir ane."Morton followed her into the cottage accordingly.Then out and spake the auld mother,\n               And fast her tears did fa\n               "Ye wadna be warn\'d, my son Johnie,\n               Frae the hunting to bide awa!"When he entered the cottage, Morton perceived that the old hostess had\nspoken truth.The inside of the hut belied its outward appearance, and\nwas neat, and even comfortable, especially the inner apartment, in which\nthe hostess informed her guest that he was to sup and sleep.Refreshments\nwere placed before him such as the little inn afforded; and though he had\nsmall occasion for them, he accepted the offer, as the means of\nmaintaining some discourse with the landlady.Notwithstanding her\nblindness, she was assiduous in her attendance, and seemed, by a sort of\ninstinct, to find her way to what she wanted."Have you no one but this pretty little girl to assist you in waiting on\nyour guests?""None, sir," replied his old hostess; "I dwell alone, like the widow of\nZarephath.Few guests come to this puir place, and I haena custom eneugh\nto hire servants.I had anes twa fine sons that lookit after a\' thing.--But God gives and takes away,--His name be praised!"she continued,\nturning her clouded eyes towards Heaven.--"I was anes better off, that\nis, waridly speaking, even since I lost them; but that was before this\nlast change."John journeyed to the hallway.said Morton; "and yet you are a Presbyterian, my good mother?""I am, sir; praised be the light that showed me the right way," replied\nthe landlady."Then I should have thought," continued the guest, "the Revolution would\nhave brought you nothing but good.""If," said the old woman, "it has brought the land gude, and freedom of\nworship to tender consciences, it\'s little matter what it has brought to\na puir blind worm like me.""Still," replied Morton, "I cannot see how it could possibly injure you.""It\'s a lang story, sir," answered his hostess, with a sigh."But ae\nnight, sax weeks or thereby afore Bothwell Brigg, a young gentleman\nstopped at this puir cottage, stiff and bloody with wounds, pale and dune\nout wi\' riding, and his horse sae weary he couldna drag ae foot after the\nother, and his foes were close ahint him, and he was ane o\' our enemies.You that\'s a sodger will think me but a silly auld\nwife; but I fed him, and relieved him, and keepit him hidden till the\npursuit was ower.""And who," said Morton, "dares disapprove of your having done so?""I kenna," answered the blind woman; "I gat ill-will about it amang some\no\' our ain folk.They said I should hae been to him what Jael was to\nSisera.But weel I wot I had nae divine command to shed blood, and to\nsave it was baith like a woman and a Christian.And then they said I\nwanted natural affection, to relieve ane that belanged to the band that\nmurdered my twa sons.""Ay, sir; though maybe ye\'ll gie their deaths another name.The tane fell\nwi\' sword in hand, fighting for a broken national Covenant; the\ntother,--oh, they took him and shot him dead on the green before his\nmother\'s face!My auld een dazzled when the shots were looten off, and,\nto my thought, they waxed weaker and weaker ever since that weary day;\nand sorrow, and heart-break, and tears that would not be dried, might\nhelp on the disorder.betraying Lord Evandale\'s young blood\nto his enemies\' sword wad ne\'er hae brought my Ninian and Johnie alive\nagain.""Was it Lord Evandale whose\nlife you saved?""In troth, even his," she replied."And kind he was to me after, and gae\nme a cow and calf, malt, meal, and siller, and nane durst steer me when\nhe was in power.But we live on an outside bit of Tillietudlem land, and\nthe estate was sair plea\'d between Leddy Margaret Bellenden and the\npresent laird, Basil Olifant, and Lord Evandale backed the auld leddy for\nlove o\' her daughter Miss Edith, as the country said, ane o\' the best and\nbonniest lassies in Scotland.But they behuved to gie way, and Basil gat\nthe Castle and land, and on the back o\' that came the Revolution, and wha\nto turn coat faster than the laird?for he said he had been a true Whig\na\' the time, and turned <DW7> only for fashion\'s sake.And then he got\nfavour, and Lord Evandale\'s head was under water; for he was ower proud\nand manfu\' to bend to every blast o\' wind, though mony a ane may ken as\nweel as me that be his ain principles as they might, he was nae ill\nfriend to our folk when he could protect us, and far kinder than Basil\nOlifant, that aye keepit the cobble head doun the stream.But he was set\nby and ill looked on, and his word ne\'er asked; and then Basil, wha\'s a\nrevengefu\' man, set himsell to vex him in a\' shapes, and especially by\noppressing and despoiling the auld blind widow, Bessie Maclure, that\nsaved Lord Evandale\'s life, and that he was sae kind to.But he\'s mistaen\nif that\'s his end; for it will be lang or Lord Evandale hears a word frae\nme about the selling my kye for rent or e\'er it was due, or the putting\nthe dragoons on me when the country\'s quiet, or onything else that will\nvex him,--I can bear my ain burden patiently, and warld\'s loss is the\nleast part o\'t."Astonished and interested at this picture of patient, grateful, and\nhigh-minded resignation, Morton could not help bestowing an execration\nupon the poor-spirited rascal who had taken such a dastardly course of\nvengeance."Dinna curse him, sir," said the old woman; "I have heard a good man say\nthat a curse was like a stone flung up to the heavens, and maist like to\nreturn on the head that sent it.But if ye ken Lord Evandale, bid him\nlook to himsell, for I hear strange words pass atween the sodgers that\nare lying here, and his name is often mentioned; and the tane o\' them has\nbeen twice up at Tillietudlem.He\'s a kind of favourite wi\' the laird,\nthough he was in former times ane o\' the maist cruel oppressors ever rade\nthrough a country (out-taken Sergeant Bothwell),--they ca\' him Inglis.""I have the deepest interest in Lord Evandale\'s safety," said Morton,\n"and you may depend on my finding some mode to apprise him of these\nsuspicious circumstances.And, in return, my good friend, will you\nindulge me with another question?Do you know anything of Quintin Mackell\nof Irongray?"echoed the blind woman, in a tone of great surprise and\nalarm."Quintin Mackell of Irongray," repeated Morton."Is there anything so\nalarming in the sound of that name?""Na, na," answered the woman, with hesitation; "but to hear him asked\nafter by a stranger and a sodger,--Gude protect us, what mischief is\nto come next!""None by my means, I assure you," said Morton; "the subject of my inquiry\nhas nothing to fear from me if, as I suppose, this Quintin Mackell is the\nsame with John Bal-----.""Do not mention his name," said the widow, pressing his lips with her\nfingers."I see you have his secret and his pass-word, and I\'ll be free\nwi\' you.But, for God\'s sake, speak lound and low.In the name of Heaven,\nI trust ye seek him not to his hurt!"I said truly; but one he has nothing to fear from.I commanded a party\nat Bothwell Bridge.""And verily there is something in your voice I\ncan trust.Ye speak prompt and readily, and like an honest man.""I trust I am so," said Morton."But nae displeasure to you, sir, in thae waefu\' times," continued Mrs.Maclure, "the hand of brother is against brother, and he fears as mickle\nalmaist frae this Government as e\'er he did frae the auld persecutors."said Morton, in a tone of inquiry; "I was not aware of that.But\nI am only just now returned from abroad.""I\'ll tell ye," said the blind woman, first assuming an attitude of\nlistening that showed how effectually her powers of collecting\nintelligence had been transferred from the eye to the ear; for, instead\nof casting a glance of circumspection around, she stooped her face, and\nturned her head slowly around, in such a manner as to insure that there\nwas not the slightest sound stirring in the neighbourhood, and then\ncontinued,--"I\'ll tell ye.Ye ken how he has laboured to raise up again\nthe Covenant, burned, broken, and buried in the hard hearts and selfish\ndevices of this stubborn people.Now, when he went to Holland, far from\nthe countenance and thanks of the great, and the comfortable fellowship\nof the godly, both whilk he was in right to expect, the Prince of Orange\nwad show him no favour, and the ministers no godly communion.This was\nhard to bide for ane that had suffered and done mickle,--ower mickle, it\nmay be; but why suld I be a judge?He came back to me and to the auld\nplace o\' refuge that had often received him in his distresses, mair\nespecially before the great day of victory at Drumclog, for I sail ne\'er\nforget how he was bending hither of a\' nights in the year on that e\'ening\nafter the play when young Milnwood wan the popinjay; but I warned him off\nfor that time."exclaimed Morton, "it was you that sat in your red cloak by the\nhigh-road, and told him there was a lion in the path?"said the old woman, breaking off her\nnarrative in astonishment."But be wha ye may," she continued, resuming\nit with tranquillity, "ye can ken naething waur o\' me than that I hae\nbeen willing to save the life o\' friend and foe.""I know no ill of you, Mrs.Maclure, and I mean no ill by you; I only\nwished to show you that I know so much of this person\'s affairs that I\nmight be safely intrusted with the rest.Proceed, if you please, in your\nnarrative.""There is a strange command in your voice," said the blind woman, "though\nits tones are sweet.The Stewarts hae been\ndethroned, and William and Mary reign in their stead; but nae mair word\nof the Covenant than if it were a dead letter.They hae taen the indulged\nclergy, and an Erastian General Assembly of the ante pure and triumphant\nKirk of Scotland, even into their very arms and bosoms.Our faithfu\'\nchampions o\' the testimony agree e\'en waur wi\' this than wi\' the open\ntyranny and apostasy of the persecuting times, for souls are hardened and\ndeadened, and the mouths of fasting multitudes are crammed wi\' fizenless\nbran instead of the sweet word in season; and mony an hungry, starving\ncreature, when he sits down on a Sunday forenoon to get something that\nmight warm him to the great work, has a dry clatter o\' morality driven\nabout his lugs, and--"\n\n"In short," said Morton, desirous to stop a discussion which the good old\nwoman, as enthusiastically attached to her religious profession as to the\nduties of humanity, might probably have indulged longer,--"In short, you\nare not disposed to acquiesce in this new government, and Burley is of\nthe same opinion?""Many of our brethren, sir, are of belief we fought for the Covenant, and\nfasted and prayed and suffered for that grand national league, and now we\nare like neither to see nor hear tell of that which we suffered and\nfought and fasted and prayed for.And anes it was thought something might\nbe made by bringing back the auld family on a new bargain and a new\nbottom, as, after a\', when King James went awa, I understand the great\nquarrel of the English against him was in behalf of seven unhallowed\nprelates; and sae, though ae part of our people were free to join wi\' the\npresent model, and levied an armed regiment under the Yerl of Angus, yet\nour honest friend, and others that stude up for purity of doctrine and\nfreedom of conscience, were determined to hear the breath o\' the\nJacobites before they took part again them, fearing to fa\' to the ground\nlike a wall built with unslaked mortar, or from sitting between twa\nstools.""They chose an odd quarter," said Morton, "from which to expect freedom\nof conscience and purity of doctrine."said the landlady, "the natural day-spring rises in the\neast, but the spiritual dayspring may rise in the north, for what we\nblinded mortals ken.""And Burley went to the north to seek it?""Truly ay, sir; and he saw Claver\'se himsell, that they ca\' Dundee now."exclaimed Morton, in amazement; "I would have sworn that meeting\nwould have been the last of one of their lives.""Na, na, sir; in troubled times, as I understand," said Mrs.Maclure,\n"there\'s sudden changes,--Montgomery and Ferguson and mony ane mair that\nwere King James\'s greatest faes are on his side now.Claver\'se spake our\nfriend fair, and sent him to consult with Lord Evandale.But then there\nwas a break-off, for Lord Evandale wadna look at, hear, or speak wi\' him;\nand now he\'s anes wud and aye waur, and roars for revenge again Lord\nEvandale, and will hear nought of onything but burn and slay.And oh,\nthae starts o\' passion!they unsettle his mind, and gie the Enemy sair\nadvantages."Are ye acquainted familiarly wi\' John Balfour o\' Burley, and\ndinna ken that he has had sair and frequent combats to sustain against\nthe Evil One?Did ye ever see him alone but the Bible was in his hand,\nand the drawn sword on his knee?Did ye never sleep in the same room wi\'\nhim, and hear him strive in his dreams with the delusions of Satan?Oh,\nye ken little o\' him if ye have seen him only in fair daylight; for nae\nman can put the face upon his doleful visits and strifes that he can do.I hae seen him, after sic a strife of agony, tremble that an infant might\nhae held him, while the hair on his brow was drapping as fast as ever my\npuir thatched roof did in a heavy rain."As she spoke, Morton began to\nrecollect the appearance of Burley during his sleep in the hay-loft at\nMilnwood, the report of Cuddie that his senses had become impaired, and\nsome whispers current among the Cameronians, who boasted frequently of\nBurley\'s soul-exercises and his strifes with the foul fiend,--which\nseveral circumstances led him to conclude that this man himself was a\nvictim to those delusions, though his mind, naturally acute and forcible,\nnot only disguised his superstition from those in whose opinion it might\nhave discredited his judgment, but by exerting such a force as is said to\nbe proper to those afflicted with epilepsy, could postpone the fits which\nit occasioned until he was either freed from superintendence, or\nsurrounded by such as held him more highly on account of these\nvisitations.It was natural to suppose, and could easily be inferred from\nthe narrative of Mrs.Maclure, that disappointed ambition, wrecked hopes,\nand the downfall of the party which he had served with such desperate\nfidelity, were likely to aggravate enthusiasm into temporary insanity.It\nwas, indeed, no uncommon circumstance in those singular times that men\nlike Sir Harry Vane, Harrison, Overton, and others, themselves slaves to\nthe wildest and most enthusiastic dreams, could, when mingling with the\nworld, conduct themselves not only with good sense in difficulties, and\ncourage in dangers, but with the most acute sagacity and determined\nvalour.Maclure\'s information confirmed\nMorton in these impressions."In the grey of the morning," she said, "my little Peggy sail show ye the\ngate to him before the sodgers are up.But ye maun let his hour of\ndanger, as he ca\'s it, be ower, afore ye venture on him in his place of\nrefuge.Peggy will tell ye when to venture in.She kens his ways weel,\nfor whiles she carries him some little helps that he canna do\nwithout to sustain life.""And in what retreat, then," said Morton, "has this unfortunate person\nfound refuge?""An awsome place," answered the blind woman, "as ever living creature\ntook refuge in; they ca it the Black Linn of Linklater.It\'s a doleful\nplace, but he loves it abune a\' others, because he has sae often been in\nsafe hiding there; and it\'s my belief he prefers it to a tapestried\nchamber and a down bed.I hae seen it mysell mony a day\nsyne.I was a daft hempie lassie then, and little thought what was to\ncome o\'t.--Wad ye choose ony thing, sir, ere ye betake yoursell to your\nrest, for ye maun stir wi\' the first dawn o\' the grey light?""Nothing more, my good mother," said Morton; and they parted for the\nevening.Morton recommended himself to Heaven, threw himself on the bed, heard,\nbetween sleeping and waking, the trampling of the dragoon horses at the\nriders\' return from their patrol, and then slept soundly after such\npainful agitation.The darksome cave they enter, where they found\n               The accursed man low sitting on the ground,\n               Musing full sadly in his sullen mind.As the morning began to appear on the mountains, a gentle knock was heard\nat the door of the humble apartment in which Morton slept, and a girlish\ntreble voice asked him, from without, "If he wad please gang to the Linn\nor the folk raise?"He arose upon the invitation, and, dressing himself hastily, went forth\nand joined his little guide.The mountain maid tript lightly before him,\nthrough the grey haze, over hill and moor.It was a wild and varied walk,\nunmarked by any regular or distinguishable track, and keeping, upon the\nwhole, the direction of the ascent of the brook, though without tracing\nits windings.The landscape, as they advanced, became waster and more\nwild, until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley."Nearly a mile off," answered\nthe girl."And do you often go this wild journey, my little maid?""When grannie sends me wi\' milk and meal to the Linn," answered the\nchild."And are you not afraid to travel so wild a road alone?""Hout na, sir," replied the guide; "nae living creature wad touch sic a\nbit thing as I am, and grannie says we need never fear onything else when\nwe are doing a gude turn."said Morton to himself, and\nfollowed her steps in silence.They soon came to a decayed thicket, where brambles and thorns supplied\nthe room of the oak and birches of which it had once consisted.Here the\nguide turned short off the open heath, and, by a sheep-track, conducted\nMorton to the brook.A hoarse and sullen roar had in part prepared him\nfor the scene which presented itself, yet it was not to be viewed without\nsurprise and even terror.When he emerged from the devious path which\nconducted him through the thicket, he found himself placed on a ledge of\nflat rock projecting over one side of a chasm not less than a hundred\nfeet deep, where the dark mountain-stream made a decided and rapid shoot\nover the precipice, and was swallowed up by a deep, black, yawning gulf.The eye in vain strove to see the bottom of the fall; it could catch but\none sheet of foaming uproar and sheer descent, until the view was\nobstructed by the proecting crags which enclosed the bottom of the\nwaterfall, and hid from sight the dark pool which received its tortured\nwaters; far beneath, at the distance of perhaps a quarter of a mile, the\neye caught the winding of the stream as it emerged into a more open\ncourse.But, for that distance, they were lost to sight as much as if a\ncavern had been arched over them; and indeed the steep and projecting\nledges of rock through which they wound their way in darkness were very\nnearly closing and over-roofing their course.While Morton gazed at this scene of tumult, which seemed, by the\nsurrounding thickets and the clefts into which the waters descended, to\nseek to hide itself from every eye, his little attendant as she stood\nbeside him on the platform of rock which commanded the best view of the\nfall, pulled him by the sleeve, and said, in a tone which he could not\nhear without stooping his ear near the speaker, "Hear till him!Morton listened more attentively; and out of the very abyss into which\nthe brook fell, and amidst the turnultuary sounds of the cataract,\nthought he could distinguish shouts, screams, and even articulate words,\nas if the tortured demon of the stream had been mingling his complaints\nwith the roar of his broken waters."This is the way," said the little girl; "follow me, gin ye please, sir,\nbut tak tent to your feet;" and, with the daring agility which custom had\nrendered easy, she vanished from the platform on which she stood, and, by\nnotches and slight projections in the rock, scrambled down its face into\nthe chasm which it overhung.Steady, bold, and active, Morton hesitated\nnot to follow her; but the necessary attention to secure his hold and\nfooting in a descent where both foot and hand were needful for security,\nprevented him from looking around him, till, having descended nigh twenty\nfeet, and being sixty or seventy above the pool which received the fall,\nhis guide made a pause, and he again found himself by her side in a\nsituation that appeared equally romantic and precarious.They were nearly\nopposite to the waterfall, and in point of level situated at about\none-quarter\'s depth from the point of the cliff over which it thundered,\nand three-fourths of the height above the dark, deep, and restless pool\nwhich received its fall.Both these tremendous points--the first shoot,\nnamely, of the yet unbroken stream, and the deep and sombre abyss into\nwhich it was emptied--were full before him, as well as the whole\ncontinuous stream of billowy froth, which, dashing from the one, was\neddying and boiling in the other.They were so near this grand phenomenon\nthat they were covered with its spray, and well-nigh deafened by the\nincessant roar.But crossing in the very front of the fall, and at scarce\nthree yards distance from the cataract, an old oak-tree, flung across the\nchasm in a manner that seemed accidental, formed a bridge of fearfully\nnarrow dimensions and uncertain footing.The upper end of the tree rested\non the platform on which they stood; the lower or uprooted extremity\nextended behind a projection on the opposite side, and was secured,\nMorton\'s eye could not discover where.From behind the same projection\nglimmered a strong red light, which, glancing in the waves of the falling\nwater, and tinging them partially with crimson, had a strange\npreternatural and sinister effect when contrasted with the beams of the\nrising sun, which glanced on the first broken waves of the fall, though\neven its meridian splendour could not gain the third of its full depth.When he had looked around him for a moment, the girl again pulled his\nsleeve, and, pointing to the oak and the projecting point beyond it (for\nhearing speech was now out of the question), indicated that there lay his\nfarther passage.Morton gazed at her with surprise; for although he well knew that the\npersecuted Presbyterians had in the preceding reigns sought refuge among\ndells and thickets, caves and cataracts, in spots the most extraordinary\nand secluded; although he had heard of the champions of the Covenant, who\nhad long abidden beside Dobs-lien on the wild heights of Polmoodie, and\nothers who had been concealed in the yet more terrific cavern called\nCreehope-linn, in the parish of Closeburn,--yet his imagination had never\nexactly figured out the horrors of such a residence, and he was surprised\nhow the strange and romantic scene which he now saw had remained\nconcealed from him, while a curious investigator of such natural\nphenomena.But he readily conceived that, lying in a remote and wild\ndistrict, and being destined as a place of concealment to the persecuted\npreachers and professors of nonconformity, the secret of its existence\nwas carefully preserved by the few shepherds to whom it might be known.As, breaking from these meditations, he began to consider how he should\ntraverse the doubtful and terrific bridge, which, skirted by the cascade,\nand rendered wet and slippery by its constant drizzle, traversed the\nchasm above sixty feet from the bottom of the fall, his guide, as if to\ngive him courage, tript over and back without the least hesitation.Envying for a moment the little bare feet which caught a safer hold of\nthe rugged side of the oak than he could pretend to with his heavy boots,\nMorton nevertheless resolved to attempt the passage, and, fixing his eye\nfirm on a stationary object on the other side, without allowing his head\nto become giddy, or his attention to be distracted by the flash, the\nfoam, and the roar of the waters around him, he strode steadily and\nsafely along the uncertain bridge, and reached the mouth of a small\ncavern on the farther side of the torrent.Here he paused; for a light,\nproceeding from a fire of red-hot charcoal, permitted him to see the\ninterior of the cave, and enabled him to contemplate the appearance of\nits inhabitant, by whom he himself could not be so readily distinguished,\nbeing concealed by the shadow of the rock.What he observed would by no\nmeans have encouraged a less determined man to proceed with the task\nwhich he had undertaken.Burley, only altered from what he had been formerly by the addition of a\ngrisly beard, stood in the midst of the cave, with his clasped Bible in\none hand, and his drawn sword in the other.John travelled to the bedroom.His figure, dimly ruddied by\nthe light of the red charcoal, seemed that of a fiend in the lurid\natmosphere of Pandemonium, and his gestures and words, as far as they\ncould be heard, seemed equally violent and irregular.All alone, and in a\nplace of almost unapproachable seclusion, his demeanour was that of\na man who strives for life and death with a mortal enemy.he exclaimed, accompanying each word with a thrust,\nurged with his whole force against the impassible and empty air, "Did I\nnot tell thee so?--I have resisted, and thou fleest from me!--Coward as\nthou art, come in all thy terrors; come with mine own evil deeds, which\nrender thee most terrible of all,--there is enough betwixt the boards of\nthis book to rescue me!--What mutterest thou of grey hairs?It was well\ndone to slay him,--the more ripe the corn, the readier for the sickle.--\nArt gone?Art gone?--I have ever known thee but a coward--ha!With these wild exclamations he sunk the point of his sword, and remained\nstanding still in the same posture, like a maniac whose fit is over."The dangerous time is by now," said the little girl who had followed;\n"it seldom lasts beyond the time that the sun\'s ower the hill; ye may\ngang in and speak wi\' him now.I\'ll wait for you at the other side of the\nlinn; he canna bide to see twa folk at anes."Slowly and cautiously, and keeping constantly upon his guard, Morton\npresented himself to the view of his old associate in command.comest thou again when thine hour is over?"was his first\nexclamation; and flourishing his sword aloft, his countenance assumed an\nexpression in which ghastly terror seemed mingled with the rage of a\ndemoniac.Balfour," said Morton, in a steady and composed tone,\n"to renew an acquaintance which has been broken off since the fight of\nBothwell Bridge."As soon as Burley became aware that Morton was before him in person,--an\nidea which he caught with marvellous celerity,--he at once exerted that\nmastership over his heated and enthusiastic imagination, the power of\nenforcing which was a most striking part of his extraordinary character.He sunk his sword-point at once, and as he stole it composedly into the\nscabbard, he muttered something of the damp and cold which sent an old\nsoldier to his fencing exercise, to prevent his blood from chilling.This\ndone, he proceeded in the cold, determined manner which was peculiar to\nhis ordinary discourse:--\n\n"Thou hast tarried long, Henry Morton, and hast not come to the vintage\nbefore the twelfth hour has struck.Art thou yet willing to take the\nright hand of fellowship, and be one with those who look not to thrones\nor dynasties, but to the rule of Scripture, for their directions?"[Illustration: Morton and Black Linn--272]\n\n\n"I am surprised," said Morton, evading the direct answer to his question,\n"that you should have known me after so many years.""The features of those who ought to act with me are engraved on my\nheart," answered Burley; "and few but Silas Morton\'s son durst have\nfollowed me into this my castle of retreat.Seest thou that drawbridge of\nNature\'s own construction?"he added, pointing to the prostrate\noak-tree,--"one spurn of my foot, and it is overwhelmed in the abyss\nbelow, bidding foeman on the farther side stand at defiance, and leaving\nenemies on this at the mercy of one who never yet met his equal in single\nfight.""Of such defences," said Morton, "I should have thought you would now\nhave had little need.""What little need, when incarnate\nfiends are combined against me on earth, and Sathan himself--But it\nmatters not," added he, checking himself."Enough that I like my place\nof refuge, my cave of Adullam, and would not change its rude ribs of\nlimestone rock for the fair chambers of the castle of the earls of\nTorwood, with their broad bounds and barony.Thou, unless the foolish\nfever-fit be over, mayst think differently.""It was of those very possessions I came to speak," said Morton; "and I\ndoubt not to find Mr.Balfour the same rational and reflecting person\nwhich I knew him to be in times when zeal disunited brethren.""In a word, then," said Morton, "you have exercised, by means at which I\ncan guess, a secret, but most prejudicial, influence over the fortunes of\nLady Margaret Bellenden and her granddaughter, and in favour of that\nbase, oppressive apostate, Basil Olifant, whom the law, deceived by thy\noperations, has placed in possession of their lawful property.""I do say so," replied Morton; "and face to face you will not deny what\nyou have vouched by your handwriting.""And suppose I deny it not," said Balfour; "and suppose that\nthy--eloquence were found equal to persuade me to retrace the steps I\nhave taken on matured resolve,--what will be thy meed?Dost thou still\nhope to possess the fair-haired girl, with her wide and rich\ninheritance?""I have no such hope," answered Morton, calmly."And for whom, then, hast thou ventured to do this great thing,--to seek\nto rend the prey from the valiant, to bring forth food from the den of\nthe lion, and to extract sweetness from the maw of the devourer?For\nwhose sake hast thou undertaken to read this riddle, more hard than\nSamson\'s?""For Lord Evandale\'s and that of his bride," replied Morton, firmly.Balfour, and believe there are some who are\nwilling to sacrifice their happiness to that of others.""Then, as my soul liveth," replied Balfour, "thou art, to wear beard and\nback a horse and draw a sword, the tamest and most gall-less puppet that\never sustained injury unavenged.thou wouldst help that accursed\nEvandale to the arms of the woman that thou lovest; thou wouldst endow\nthem with wealth and with heritages, and thou think\'st that there lives\nanother man, offended even more deeply than thou, yet equally\ncold-livered and mean-spirited, crawling upon the face of the earth,\nand hast dared to suppose that one other to be John Balfour?""For my own feelings," said Morton, composedly, "I am answerable to none\nbut Heaven; to you, Mr.Balfour, I should suppose it of little\nconsequence whether Basil Olifant or Lord Evandale possess these\nestates.""Thou art deceived," said Burley; "both are indeed in outer darkness,\nand strangers to the light, as he whose eyes have never been opened to\nthe day.But this Basil Olifant is a Nabal, a Demas, a base churl whose\nwealth and power are at the disposal of him who can threaten to deprive\nhim of them.He became a professor because he was deprived of these lands\nof Tillietudlem; he turned a <DW7> to obtain possession of them; he\ncalled himself an Erastian, that he might not again lose them; and he\nwill become what I list while I have in my power the document that may\ndeprive him of them.These lands are a bit between his jaws and a hook in\nhis nostrils, and the rein and the line are in my hands to guide them as\nI think meet; and his they shall therefore be, unless I had assurance of\nbestowing them on a sure and sincere friend.But Lord Evandale is a\nmalignant, of heart like flint, and brow like adamant; the goods of the\nworld fall on him like leaves on the frost-bound earth, and unmoved he\nwill see them whirled off by the first wind.The heathen virtues of such\nas he are more dangerous to us than the sordid cupidity of those who,\ngoverned by their interest, must follow where it leads, and who,\ntherefore, themselves the slaves of avarice, may be compelled to work\nin the vineyard, were it but to earn the wages of sin.""This might have been all well some years since," replied Morton, "and I\ncould understand your argument, although I could never acquiesce in its\njustice.But at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in\nkeeping up an influence which can no longer be directed to an useful\npurpose.The land has peace, liberty, and freedom of conscience,--and\nwhat would you more?"exclaimed Burley, again unsheathing his sword, with a vivacity\nwhich nearly made Morton start."Look at the notches upon that weapon\nthey are three in number, are they not?""It seems so," answered Morton; "but what of that?""The fragment of steel that parted from this first gap rested on the\nskull of the perjured traitor who first introduced Episcopacy into\nScotland; this second notch was made in the rib-bone of an impious\nvillain, the boldest and best soldier that upheld the prelatic cause at\nDrumclog; this third was broken on the steel head-piece of the captain\nwho defended the Chapel of Holyrood when the people rose at the\nRevolution.I cleft him to the teeth, through steel and bone.It has done\ngreat deeds, this little weapon, and each of these blows was a\ndeliverance to the Church.This sword," he said, again sheathing it,\n"has yet more to do,--to weed out this base and pestilential heresy of\nErastianism; to vindicate the true liberty of the Kirk in her purity;\nto restore the Covenant in its glory,--then let it moulder and rust\nbeside the bones of its master.""You have neither men nor means, Mr.Balfour, to disturb the Government\nas now settled," argued Morton; "the people are in general satisfied,\nexcepting only the gentlemen of the Jacobite interest; and surely you\nwould not join with those who would only use you for their own purposes?""It is they," answered Burley, "that should serve ours.I went to the\ncamp of the malignant Claver\'se, as the future King of Israel sought the\nland of the Philistines; I arranged with him a rising; and but for the\nvillain Evandale, the Erastians ere now had been driven from the West.--\nI could slay him," he added, with a vindictive scowl, "were he grasping\nthe horns of the altar!"He then proceeded in a calmer tone: "If thou,\nson of mine ancient comrade, were suitor for thyself to this Edith\nBellenden, and wert willing to put thy hand to the great work with zeal\nequal to thy courage, think not I would prefer the friendship of Basil\nOlifant to thine; thou shouldst then have the means that this document\n[he produced a parchment] affords to place her in possession of the lands\nof her fathers.This have I longed to say to thee ever since I saw thee\nfight the good fight so strongly at the fatal Bridge.The maiden loved\nthee, and thou her."Morton replied firmly, "I will not dissemble with you, Mr.Balfour, even\nto gain a good end.I came in hopes to persuade you to do a deed of\njustice to others, not to gain any selfish end of my own.I have failed;\nI grieve for your sake more than for the loss which others will sustain\nby your injustice.""Would you be really, as you are desirous to be\nthought, a man of honour and conscience, you would, regardless of all\nother considerations, restore that parchment to Lord Evandale, to be used\nfor the advantage of the lawful heir."said Balfour; and, casting the deed into the\nheap of red charcoal beside him, pressed it down with the heel of his\nboot.While it smoked, shrivelled, and crackled in the flames, Morton sprung\nforward to snatch it, and Burley catching hold of him, a struggle ensued.Both were strong men; but although Morton was much the more active and\nyounger of the two, yet Balfour was the most powerful, and effectually\nprevented him from rescuing the deed until it was fairly reduced to a\ncinder.They then quitted hold of each other, and the enthusiast,\nrendered fiercer by the contest, glared on Morton with an eye expressive\nof frantic revenge."Thou hast my secret," he exclaimed; "thou must be']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['A\n   few minutes before 4 o\'clock a subterranean crash was heard,\n   louder than Alpine thunder, and immediately afterward a furious\n   cloud of ashes, smoke and gaseous exhalation shot high up into\n   the still darkened atmosphere of night.At this time at least one\n   thousand of the terrified and half-naked inhabitants of the\n   neighboring village of Dudzeele had collected on the spot, and\n   with wringing hands and fearful outcries bewailed their fate, and\n   threatened instant death to the officers of the commission, and\n   even to the now terrified miners.Finally, just before dawn, on\n   the 5th of November, or, to be more precise, at exactly twenty\n   minutes past 6 A. M., molten lava made its appearance at the\n   surface!The fright now became general, and as the burning buildings shed\n   their ominous glare around, and the languid stream of liquid fire\n   slowly bubbled up and rolled toward the canal, the scene assumed\n   an aspect of awful sublimity and grandeur.The plains around were\n   lit up for many leagues, and the foggy skies intensified and\n   reduplicated the effects of the illumination.Toward sunrise the\n   flow of lava was suspended for nearly an hour, but shortly after\n   ten o\'clock it suddenly increased its volume, and, as it cooled,\n   formed a sort of saucer-shaped funnel, over the edges of which it\n   boiled up, broke, and ran off in every direction.It was at this\n   period that the accomplished Dusoloy, so long the Superintendent,\n   lost his life.As the lava slowly meandered along, he attempted\n   to cross the stream by stepping from one mass of surface cinders\n   to another.Making a false step, the floating rock upon which he\n   sprang suddenly turned over, and before relief could be afforded\n   his body was consumed to a crisp.I regret to add that his fate\n   kindled no sympathy among the assembled multitude; but they\n   rudely seized his mutilated remains, and amid jeers, execrations,\n   and shouts of triumph, attached a large stone to the\n   half-consumed corpse and precipitated it into the canal.Thus are\n   the heroes of science frequently sacrificed to the fury of a\n   plebeian mob.It would afford me a pleasure to inform the department that the\n   unforeseen evils of our scientific convention terminated here.But I regret to add that such is very far from being the case.Indeed, from the appearance of affairs this morning at the\n   volcanic crater--for such it has now become--the possible evils\n   are almost incalculable.Daniel went to the bathroom.The Belgian Government was duly notified\n   by telegraph of the death of the Superintendent and the mutinous\n   disposition of the common people about Bruges, and early on the\n   morning of the 6th of November a squad of flying horse was\n   dispatched to the spot to maintain order.But this interference\n   only made matters worse.The discontent, augmented by the wildest\n   panic, became universal, and the mob reigned supreme.Nor could\n   the poor wretches be greatly condemned; for toward evening the\n   lava current reached the confines of the old village of Dudzeele,\n   and about midnight set the town on fire.The lurid glare of the\n   conflagration awakened the old burghers of Bruges from their\n   slumbers and spread consternation in the city, though distant\n   several miles from the spot.A meeting was called at the\n   Guildhall at dawn, and the wildest excitement prevailed.But\n   after hearing explanations from the members of the commission,\n   the populace quietly but doggedly dispersed.The government from\n   this time forward did all that power and prudence combined could\n   effect to quell the reign of terror around Bruges.In this\n   country the telegraph, being a government monopoly, has been\n   rigorously watched and a cordon of military posts established\n   around the threatened district, so that it has been almost\n   impossible to convey intelligence of this disaster beyond the\n   limits of the danger.In the mean time, a congress of the most\n   experienced scientists was invited to the scene for the purpose\n   of suggesting some remedy against the prospective spread of the\n   devastation.The first meeting took place at the old Guildhall in\n   Bruges and was strictly private, none being admitted except the\n   diplomatic representatives of foreign governments, and the\n   members elect of the college.As in duty bound, I felt called on\n   to attend, and shall in this place attempt a short synopsis of\n   the proceedings.Professor Palmieri, of Naples, presided, and Dr.Kirchoff\n   officiated as secretary.Gassiot, of Paris, was the first speaker, and contended that the\n   theory of nucleatic fusion, now being fully established it only\n   remained to prescribe the laws governing its superficial action."There is but one law applicable, that I am aware of," said he,\n   "and that is the law which drives from the center of a revolving\n   body all fluid matter toward the circumference, and forcibly\n   ejects it into space, if possible, in the same manner that a\n   common grindstone in rapid motion will drive off from its rim\n   drops of water or other foreign unattached matter.Thus, whenever\n   we find a vent or open orifice, as in the craters of active\n   volcanoes, the incandescent lava boils up and frequently\n   overflows the top of the highest peak of the Andes."Palmieri then asked the speaker "if he wished to be understood as\n   expressing the unqualified opinion that an orifice once being\n   opened would continue to flow forever, and that there was no law\n   governing the quantity or regulating the level to which it could\n   rise?"The Neapolitan philosopher then added: "I dissent _in toto_ from\n   the opinion of M. Gassiot.For more than a quarter of a century I\n   have studied the lava-flows of Vesuvius, AEtna and Stromboli, and\n   I can assure the Congress that the Creator has left no such flaw\n   in His mechanism of the globe.The truth is, that molten lava can\n   only rise about 21,000 feet above the level of the sea, owing to\n   the balance-wheel of terrestrial gravitation, which counteracts\n   at that height all centrifugal energy.Were this not so, the\n   entire contents of the globe would gush from the incandescent\n   center and fly off into surrounding space."M. Gassiot replied, "that true volcanoes were supplied by nature\n   with _circumvalvular lips_, and hence, after filling their\n   craters, they ceased to flow.But in the instance before us no\n   such provision existed, and the only protection which he could\n   conceive of consisted in the smallness of the orifice; and he\n   would therefore recommend his Majesty King Leopold to direct all\n   his efforts to confine the aperture to its present size."Palmieri again responded, "that he had no doubt but that the\n   crater at Dudzeele would continue to flow until it had built up\n   around itself basaltic walls to the height of many hundreds,\n   perhaps thousands, of feet, and that the idea of setting bounds\n   to the size of the mouth of the excavation was simply\n   ridiculous."Gassiot interrupted, and was about to answer in a very excited\n   tone, when Prof.Palmieri "disclaimed any intention of personal\n   insult, but spoke from a scientific standpoint."He then\n   proceeded: "The lava bed of Mount AEtna maintains a normal level\n   of 7000 feet, while Vesuvius calmly reposes at a little more than\n   one half that altitude.Whitney, of the Pacific Survey, Mount Kilauea, in the Sandwich\n   Islands, bubbles up to the enormous height of 17,000 feet.It\n   cannot be contended that the crater of Vesuvius is not a true\n   nucleatic orifice, because I have demonstrated that the molten\n   bed regularly rises and falls like the tides of the ocean when\n   controlled by the moon."It was seen at once that the scientists\n   present were totally unprepared to discuss the question in its\n   novel and most important aspects; and on taking a vote, at the\n   close of the session, the members were equally divided between\n   the opinions of Gassiot and Palmieri.A further session will take\n   place on the arrival of Prof.Tyndall, who has been telegraphed\n   for from New York, and of the great Russian geologist and\n   astronomer, Tugenieff.In conclusion, the damage already done may be summed up as\n   follows: The destruction of the Bruges and Hond Canal by the\n   formation of a basaltic <DW18> across it more than two hundred feet\n   wide, the burning of Dudzeele, and the devastation of about\n   thirty thousand acres of valuable land.At the same time it is\n   utterly impossible to predict where the damage may stop, inasmuch\n   as early this morning the mouth of the crater had fallen in, and\n   the flowing stream had more than doubled in size.In consideration of the part hitherto taken by the Government of\n   the United States in originating the work that led to the\n   catastrophe, and by request of M. Musenheim, the Belgian Foreign\n   Secretary, I have taken the liberty of drawing upon the State\n   Department for eighty-seven thousand dollars, being the sum\n   agreed to be paid for the cost of emigration to the United States\n   of two hundred families (our own pro rata) rendered homeless by\n   the conflagration of Dudzeele.I am this moment in receipt of your telegram dated yesterday,\n   and rejoice to learn that Prof.Agassiz has returned from the\n   South Seas, and will be sent forward without delay.With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,\n\n                                        JOHN FLANNAGAN,\n                                United States Consul at Bruges.P.S.--Since concluding the above dispatch, Professor Palmieri did\n   me the honor of a special call, and, after some desultory\n   conversation, approached the all-absorbing topic of the day, and\n   cautiously expressed his opinion as follows: Explaining his\n   theory, as announced at the Congress, he said that "Holland,\n   Belgium, and Denmark, being all low countries, some portions of\n   each lying below the sea-level, he would not be surprised if the\n   present outflow of lava devastated them all, and covered the\n   bottom of the North Sea for many square leagues with a bed of\n   basalt."Sandra went to the hallway.The reason given was this: "That lava must continue to\n   flow until, by its own action, it builds up around the volcanic\n   crater a rim or cone high enough to afford a counterpoise to the\n   centrifugal tendency of axial energy; and that, as the earth\'s\n   crust was demonstrated to be exceptionally thin in the north of\n   Europe, the height required in this instance would be so great\n   that an enormous lapse of time must ensue before the self-created\n   cone could obtain the necessary altitude.Before _AEtna_ attained\n   its present secure height, it devastated an area as large as\n   France; and Prof.Whitney has demonstrated that some center of\n   volcanic action, now extinct, in the State of California, threw\n   out a stream that covered a much greater surface, as the basaltic\n   table mountains, vulgarly so called, extend north and south for a\n   distance as great as from Moscow to Rome."In concluding his\n   remarks, he ventured the prediction that "the North Sea would be\n   completely filled up, and the British Islands again connected\n   with the Continent."J. F., U.S.C._WILDEY\'S DREAM._\n\n\n    A blacksmith stood, at his anvil good,\n          Just fifty years ago,\n    And struck in his might, to the left and right,\n          The iron all aglow.And fast and far, as each miniature star\n          Illumined the dusky air,\n    The sparks of his mind left a halo behind,\n          Like the aureola of prayer.And the blacksmith thought, as he hammered and wrought,\n          Just fifty years ago,\n    Of the sins that start in the human heart\n          When _its_ metal is all aglow;\n    And he breathed a prayer, on the evening air,\n          As he watched the fire-sparks roll,\n    That with hammer and tongs, _he_ might right the wrongs\n          That environ the human soul!When he leaned on his sledge, not like minion or drudge,\n          With center in self alone,\n    But with vision so grand, it embraced every land,\n          In the sweep of its mighty zone;\n    O\'er mountain and main, o\'er forest and plain,\n          He gazed from his swarthy home,\n    Till rafter and wall, grew up in a hall,\n          That covered the world with its dome!\'Neath that bending arch, with a tottering march\n          All peoples went wailing by,\n    To the music of groan, of sob, and of moan,\n          To the grave that was yawning nigh,\n    When the blacksmith rose and redoubled his blows\n          On the iron that was aglow,\n    Till his senses did seem to dissolve in a dream,\n          Just fifty years ago.He thought that he stood upon a mountain chain,\n    And gazed across an almost boundless plain;\n    Men of all nations, and of every clime,\n    Of ancient epochs, and of modern time,\n    Rose in thick ranks before his wandering eye,\n    And passed, like waves, in quick succession by.First came Osiris, with his Memphian band\n    Of swarth Egyptians, darkening all the land;\n    With heads downcast they dragged their limbs along,\n    Laden with chains, and torn by lash and thong.From morn till eve they toiled and bled and died,\n    And stained with blood the Nile\'s encroaching tide.Slowly upon the Theban plain there rose\n    Old Cheop\'s pride, a pyramid of woes;\n    And millions sank unpitied in their graves,\n    With tombs inscribed--"Here lies a realm of slaves."Next came great Nimrod prancing on his steed,\n    His serried ranks, Assyrian and Mede,\n    By bold Sennacherib moulded into one,\n    By bestial Sardanapalus undone.He saw the walls of Babylon arise,\n    Spring from the earth, invade the azure skies,\n    And bear upon their airy ramparts old\n    Gardens and vines, and fruit, and flowers of gold.Beneath their cold and insalubrious shade\n    All woes and vices had their coverts made;\n    Lascivious incest o\'er the land was sown,\n    From peasant cabin to imperial throne,\n    And that proud realm, so full of might and fame,\n    Went down at last in blood, and sin, and shame.Then came the Persian, with his vast array\n    Of armed millions, fretting for the fray,\n    Led on by Xerxes and his harlot horde,\n    Where billows swallowed, and where battle roared.On every side there rose a bloody screen,\n    Till mighty Alexander closed the scene.in his pomp and pride,\n    Dash through the world, and over myriads ride;\n    Plant his proud pennon on the Gangean stream,\n    Pierce where the tigers hide, mount where the eagles scream,\n    And happy only amid war\'s alarms,\n    The clank of fetters, and the clash of arms;\n    And moulding man by battle-fields and blows,\n    To one foul mass of furies, fiends and foes.Such, too, the Roman, vanquishing mankind,\n    Their fields to ravage, and their limbs to bind;\n    Whose proudest trophy, and whose highest good,\n    To write his fame with pencil dipped in blood;\n    To stride the world, like Ocean\'s turbid waves,\n    And sink all nations into servient slaves.As passed the old, so modern realms swept by,\n    Woe in all hearts, and tears in every eye;\n    Crimes stained the noble, famine crushed the poor;\n    Poison for kings, oppression for the boor;\n    Force by the mighty, fraud by the feebler shown;\n    Mercy a myth, and charity unknown.The Dreamer sighed, for sorrow filled his breast;\n    Turned from the scene and sank to deeper rest.cried a low voice full of music sweet,\n    "Come!"Down the steep hills they wend their toilsome way,\n    Cross the vast plain that on their journey lay;\n    Gain the dark city, through its suburbs roam,\n    And pause at length within the dreamer\'s home.Again he stood at his anvil good\n      With an angel by his side,\n    And rested his sledge on its iron edge\n      And blew up his bellows wide;\n    He kindled the flame till the white heat came,\n      Then murmured in accent low:\n    "All ready am I your bidding to try\n      So far as a mortal may go."\'Midst the heat and the smoke the angel spoke,\n      And breathed in his softest tone,\n    "Heaven caught up your prayer on the evening air\n      As it mounted toward the throne.God weaveth no task for mortals to ask\n      Beyond a mortal\'s control,\n    And with hammer and tongs you shall right the wrongs\n      That encompass the human soul."But go you first forth \'<DW41> the sons of the earth,\n      And bring me a human heart\n    That throbs for its kind, spite of weather and wind,\n      And acts still a brother\'s part.The night groweth late, but here will I wait\n      Till dawn streak the eastern skies;\n    And lest you should fail, spread _my_ wings on the gale,\n      And search with _my_ angel eyes."The dreamer once more passed the open door,\n      But plumed for an angel\'s flight;\n    He sped through the world like a thunderbolt hurled\n      When the clouds are alive with light;\n    He followed the sun till his race was won,\n      And probed every heart and mind;\n    But in every zone man labored alone\n      For himself and not for his kind.All mournful and flushed, his dearest hopes crushed,\n      The dreamer returned to his home,\n    And stood in the flare of the forge\'s red glare,\n      Besprinkled with dew and foam."The heart you have sought must be tempered and taught\n      In the flame that is all aglow.""No heart could I find that was true to its kind,\n      So I left all the world in its woe."Then the stern angel cried: "In your own throbbing side\n      Beats a heart that is sound to the core;\n    Will you give your own life to the edge of the knife\n      For the widowed, the orphaned, and poor?""Most unworthy am I for my brothers to die,\n      And sinful my sorrowing heart;\n    But strike, if you will, to redeem or to kill,\n      With life I am willing to part."Then he threw ope his vest and bared his broad breast\n      To the angel\'s glittering blade;\n    Soon the swift purple tide gushed a stream red and wide\n      From the wound that the weapon had made.With a jerk and a start he then plucked out his heart,\n      And buried it deep in the flame\n    That flickered and fell like the flashes of hell\n      O\'er the dreamer\'s quivering frame."Now with hammer and tongs you may right all the wrongs\n      That environ the human soul;\n    But first, you must smite with a Vulcan\'s might\n      The heart in yon blistering bowl."Quick the blacksmith arose, and redoubling his blows,\n      Beat the heart that was all aglow,\n    Till its fiery scars like a shower of stars\n      Illumined the night with their flow.Every sling of his sledge reopened the edge\n      Of wounds that were healed long ago;\n    And from each livid chasm leaped forth a phantasm\n      Of passion, of sin, or of woe.But he heeded no pain as he hammered amain,\n      For the angel was holding the heart,\n    And cried at each blow, "Strike high!"So he hammered and wrought, and he toiled and fought\n      Till Aurora peeped over the plain;\n    When the angel flew by and ascended the sky,\n      _But left on the anvil a chain!_\n    Its links were as bright as heaven\'s own light,\n      As pure as the fountain of youth;\n    And bore on each fold in letters of gold,\n      This token--LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND TRUTH.The dreamer awoke, and peered through the smoke\n      At the anvil that slept by his side;\n    And then in a wreath of flower-bound sheath,\n      The triple-linked chain he espied.Odd Fellowship\'s gem is that bright diadem,\n      Our emblem in age and in youth;\n    For our hearts we must prove in the fire of LOVE,\n      And mould with the hammer of TRUTH._WHITHERWARD._\n\n\nBy pursuing the analogies of nature, the human mind reduces to order the\nvagaries of the imagination, and bodies them forth in forms of\nloveliness and in similitudes of heaven.By an irrevocable decree of Nature\'s God, all his works are progressive\nin the direction of himself.This law is traceable from the molehill up\nto the mountain, from the mite up to the man.Geology, speaking to us\nfrom the depths of a past eternity, from annals inscribed upon the\nimperishable rock, utters not one syllable to contradict this tremendous\ntruth.Millions of ages ago, she commenced her impartial record, and as\nwe unroll it to-day, from the coal-bed and the marble quarry, we read in\ncreation\'s dawn as plainly as we behold in operation around us, the\nmighty decree--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!In the shadowy past this majestic globe floated through the blue ether,\na boiling flood of lava.Time was not;\nfor as yet the golden laws of Kepler had not emerged from chaos.The sun\nhad not hemmed his bright-eyed daughters in, nor marked out on the azure\nconcave the paths they were to tread.The planets were not worlds, but\nshot around the lurid center liquid masses of flame and desolation.Comets sported at random through the sky, and trailed after them their\nhorrid skirts of fire.The Spirit of God had not "moved upon the face of\nthe waters," and rosy Chaos still held the scepter in his hand.As the coral worm toils on in the unfathomable\ndepths of ocean, laying in secret the foundations of mighty continents,\ndestined as the ages roll by to emerge into light and grandeur, so the\nlaws of the universe carried on their everlasting work.An eternity elapsed, and the age of fire passed away.A new era dawned\nupon the earth.The gases were generated, and the elements of air and\nwater overspread the globe.Islands began to appear, at first presenting\npinnacles of bare and blasted granite; but gradually, by decay and\ndecomposition, changing into dank marshes and fertile plains.One after another the sensational universe now springs into being.This\nbut prepared the way for the animated, and that in turn formed the\ngroundwork and basis for the human.Man then came forth, the result of\nall her previous efforts--nature\'s pet, her paragon and her pride.Reason sits enthroned upon his brow, and the soul wraps its sweet\naffections about his heart; angels spread their wings above him, and God\ncalls him His child.He treads the earth its acknowledged monarch, and\ncommences its subjection.One by one the elements have yielded to his\nsway, nature has revealed her hoariest secrets to his ken, and heaven\nthrown wide its portals to his spirit.He stands now upon the very acme\nof the visible creation, and with straining eye, and listening ear, and\nanxious heart, whispers to himself that terrific and tremendous\nword--WHITHERWARD!Late one afternoon in April, I was sitting on the grassy <DW72> of\nTelegraph Hill, watching the waves of sunset as they rolled in from the\nwest, and broke in crimson spray upon the peaks of the Contra Costa\nhills.I was alone; and, as my custom is, was ruminating upon the grand\nproblem of futurity.The broad and beautiful bay spread out like a sea\nof silver at my feet, and the distant mountains, reflecting the rays of\nthe setting sun, seemed to hem it in with barriers of gold.The city lay\nlike a tired infant at evening in its mother\'s arms, and only at\nintervals disturbed my reflections by its expiring sobs.The hours of\nbusiness I well knew had passed, and the heavy iron door had long since\ngrated on its hinges, and the fire-proof shutter been bolted for the\nnight.But I felt that my labors had just commenced.The duties of my\nprofession had swallowed up thought throughout the long hours devoted to\nthe cares of life, and it was not until I was released from their\nthraldom that I found myself in truth a slave.The one master-thought\ncame back into my brain, until it burned its hideous image there in\nletters of fire--WHITHERWARD!The past came up before me with its long memories of Egyptian grandeur,\nwith its triumphs of Grecian art, with its burden of Roman glory.Italy\ncame with her republics, her "starry" Galileo, and her immortal\nBuonarotti.France flashed by, with her garments dyed in blood, and her\nNapoleons in chains.England rose up with her arts and her arms, her\ncommerce and her civilization, her splendor and her shame.I beheld\nNewton gazing at the stars, heard Milton singing of Paradise, and saw\nRussell expiring on the scaffold.But ever and anon a pale,\nthorn-crowned monarch, arrayed in mock-purple, and bending beneath a\ncross, would start forth at my side, and with uplifted eye, but\nspeechless lip, point with one hand to the pages of a volume I had open\non my knee, and with the other to the blue heaven above.Judea would\nthen pass with solemn tread before me.Her patriarchs, her prophets and\nher apostles, her judges, her kings, and her people, one by one came and\nwent like the phantasmagoria of a dream.The present then rose up in\nglittering robes, its feet resting upon the mounds of Nimrod, its brow\nencircled with a coronet of stars, pillaging, with one hand, the cloud\nabove of its lightnings, and sending them forth with the other, bridled\nand subdued, to the uttermost ends of the earth.Earth\'s physical history also swept by in full\nreview.All nature lent her stores, and with an effort of mind, by no\nmeans uncommon for those who have long thought upon a single subject, I\nseemed to possess the power to generalize all that I had ever heard,\nread or seen, into one gorgeous picture, and hang it up in the wide\nheavens before me.The actual scenery around me entirely disappeared, and I beheld an\nimmense pyramid of alabaster, reared to the very stars, upon whose sides\nI saw inscribed a faithful history of the past.Its foundations were in\ndeep shadow, but the light gradually increased toward the top, until its\nsummit was bathed in the most refulgent lustre.Inscribed in golden letters I read on one of its sides these words, in\nalternate layers, rising gradually to the apex: "_Granite_, _Liquid_,\n_Gas_, _Electricity_;" on another, "_Inorganic_, _Vegetable_, _Animal_,\n_Human_;" on the third side, "_Consciousness_, _Memory_, _Reason_,\n_Imagination_;" and on the fourth, "_Chaos_, _Order_, _Harmony_,\n_Love_."At this moment I beheld the figure of a human being standing at the\nbase of the pyramid, and gazing intently upward.He then placed his foot\nupon the foundation, and commenced climbing toward the summit.I caught\na distinct view of his features, and perceived that they were black and\nswarthy like those of the most depraved Hottentot.He toiled slowly\nupward, and as he passed the first layer, he again looked toward me, and\nI observed that his features had undergone a complete transformation.He passed the second\nlayer; and as he entered the third, once more presented his face to me\nfor observation.Another change had overspread it, and I readily\nrecognized in him the tawny native of Malacca or Hindoostan.As he\nreached the last layer, and entered its region of refulgent light, I\ncaught a full glimpse of his form and features, and beheld the high\nforehead, the glossy ringlets, the hazel eye, and the alabaster skin of\nthe true Caucasian.I now observed for the first time that the pyramid was left unfinished,\nand that its summit, instead of presenting a well-defined peak, was in\nreality a level plain.In a few moments more, the figure I had traced\nfrom the base to the fourth layer, reached the apex, and stood with\nfolded arms and upraised brow upon the very summit.His lips parted as\nif about to speak, and as I leaned forward to hear, I caught, in\ndistinct tone and thrilling accent, that word which had so often risen\nto my own lips for utterance, and seared my very brain, because\nunanswered--WHITHERWARD!exclaimed I, aloud, shuddering at the sepulchral\nsound of my voice."Home," responded a tiny voice at my side, and\nturning suddenly around, my eyes met those of a sweet little\nschool-girl, with a basket of flowers upon her arm, who had approached\nme unobserved, and who evidently imagined I had addressed her when I\nspoke."Yes, little daughter," replied I, "\'tis time to proceed\nhomeward, for the sun has ceased to gild the summit of Diavolo, and the\nevening star is visible in the west.I will attend you home," and taking\nher proffered hand, I descended the hill, with the dreadful word still\nringing in my ears, and the fadeless vision still glowing in my heart.#       #       #       #       #\n\nMidnight had come and gone, and still the book lay open on my knee.The\ncandle had burned down close to the socket, and threw a flickering\nglimmer around my chamber; but no indications of fatigue or slumber\nvisited my eyelids.My temples throbbed heavily, and I felt the hot and\nexcited blood playing like the piston-rod of an engine between my heart\nand brain.I had launched forth on the broad ocean of speculation, and now\nperceived, when too late, the perils of my situation.Above me were\ndense and lowering clouds, which no eye could penetrate; around me\nhowling tempests, which no voice could quell; beneath me heaving\nbillows, which no oil could calm.I thought of Plato struggling with his\ndoubts; of Epicurus sinking beneath them; of Socrates swallowing his\npoison; of Cicero surrendering himself to despair.I remembered how all\nthe great souls of the earth had staggered beneath the burden of the\nsame thought, which weighed like a thousand Cordilleras upon my own; and\nas I pressed my hand upon my burning brow, I cried again and\nagain--WHITHERWARD!I could find no relief in philosophy; for I knew her maxims by heart\nfrom Zeno and the Stagirite down to Berkeley and Cousin.I had followed\nher into all her hiding-places, and courted her in all her moods.No\ncoquette was ever half so false, so fickle, and so fair.Her robes are\nwoven of the sunbeams, and a star adorns her brow; but she sits\nimpassive upon her icy throne, and wields no scepter but despair.The\nlight she throws around is not the clear gleam of the sunshine, nor the\nbright twinkle of the star; but glances in fitful glimmerings on the\nsoul, like the aurora on the icebergs of the pole, and lightens up the\nscene only to show its utter desolation.The Bible lay open before me, but I could find no comfort there.Its\nlessons were intended only for the meek and humble, and my heart was\ncased in pride.It reached only to the believing; I was tossed on an\nocean of doubt.It required, as a condition to faith, the innocence of\nan angel and the humility of a child; I had long ago seared my\nconscience by mingling in the busy scenes of life, and was proud of my\nmental acquirements.The Bible spoke comfort to the Publican; I was of\nthe straight sect of the Pharisees.Its promises were directed to the\npoor in spirit, whilst mine panted for renown.At this moment, whilst heedlessly turning over its leaves and scarcely\nglancing at their contents, my attention was arrested by this remarkable\npassage in one of Paul\'s epistles: "That was not _first_ which is\nspiritual, but that which was natural, and _afterward_ that which is\nspiritual.Behold, I show you a mystery: _we shall not all sleep_, but\nwe shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the\nlast trump."Again and again I read this text, for it promised more by reflection\nthan at first appeared in the words.Slowly a light broke in on the\nhorizon\'s verge, and I felt, for the first time in my whole life, that\nthe past was not all inexplicable, nor the future a chaos, but that the\nhuman soul, lit up by the torch of science!and guided by the\nprophecies of Holy Writ, might predict the path it is destined to tread,\nand read in advance the history of its final enfranchisement.Paul\nevidently intended to teach the doctrine of _progress_, even in its\napplicability to man.He did not belong to that narrow-minded sect in\nphilosophy, which declares that the earth and the heavens are finished;\nthat man is the crowning glory of his Maker, and the utmost stretch of\nHis creative power; that henceforth the globe which he inhabits is\nbarren, and can produce no being superior to himself.On the contrary,\nhe clearly intended to teach the same great truth which modern science\nis demonstrating to all the world, that progression is nature\'s first\nlaw, and that even in the human kingdom the irrevocable decree has gone\nforth--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!Such were my reflections when the last glimmer of the candle flashed up\nlike a meteor, and then as suddenly expired in night.I was glad that\nthe shadows were gone.Better, thought I, is utter darkness than that\npoor flame which renders it visible.But I had suddenly grown rich in\nthought.A clue had been furnished to the labyrinth in which I had\nwandered from a child; a hint had been planted in the mind which it\nwould be impossible ever to circumscribe or extinguish.One letter had\nbeen identified by which, like Champollion le Jeune, I could eventually\ndecipher the inscription on the pyramid.What are these spectral\napparitions which rear themselves in the human mind, and are called by\nmortals _hints_?Who lodges them in the chambers of\nthe mind, where they sprout and germinate, and bud and blossom, and\nbear?The Florentine caught one as it fell from the stars, and invented the\ntelescope to observe them.Columbus caught another, as it was whispered\nby the winds, and they wafted him to the shores of a New World.Franklin\nbeheld one flash forth from the cloud, and he traced the lightnings to\ntheir bourn.Another dropped from the skies into the brain of Leverrier,\nand he scaled the very heavens, till he unburied a star.Rapidly was my mind working out the solution of the problem which had so\nlong tortured it, based upon the intimation it had derived from St.Paul\'s epistle, when most unexpectedly, and at the same time most\nunwelcomely, I fell into one of those strange moods which can neither be\ncalled sleep nor consciousness, but which leave their impress far more\npowerfully than the visions of the night or the events of the day.I beheld a small egg, most beautifully dotted over, and stained.Whilst\nmy eye rested on it, it cracked; an opening was made _from within_, and\nalmost immediately afterward a bird of glittering plumage and mocking\nsong flew out, and perched on the bough of a rose-tree, beneath whose\nshadow I found myself reclining.Before my surprise had vanished, I\nbeheld a painted worm at my feet, crawling toward the root of the tree\nwhich was blooming above me.It soon reached the trunk, climbed into the\nbranches, and commenced spinning its cocoon.Hardly had it finished its\nsilken home, ere it came forth in the form of a gorgeous butterfly, and,\nspreading its wings, mounted toward the heavens.Quickly succeeding\nthis, the same pyramid of alabaster, which I had seen from the summit of\nTelegraph Hill late in the afternoon, rose gradually upon the view.It\nwas in nowise changed; the inscriptions on the sides were the same, and\nthe identical figure stood with folded arms and uplifted brow upon the\ntop.I now heard a rushing sound, such as stuns the ear at Niagara, or\ngreets it during a hurricane at sea, when the shrouds of the ship are\nwhistling to the blast, and the flashing billows are dashing against her\nsides.Suddenly the pyramid commenced changing its form, and before many\nmoments elapsed it had assumed the rotundity of a globe, and I beheld it\ncovered with seas, and hills, and lakes, and mountains, and plains, and\nfertile fields.But the human figure still stood upon its crest.Then\ncame forth the single blast of a bugle, such as the soldier hears on the\nmorn of a world-changing battle.Caesar heard it at Pharsalia, Titus at\nJerusalem, Washington at Yorktown, and Wellington at Waterloo.No lightning flash ever rended forest king from crest to root quicker\nthan the transformation which now overspread the earth.In a second of\ntime it became as transparent as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun.But in every other respect it preserved its identity.On casting my eyes\ntoward the human being, I perceived that he still preserved his\nposition, but his feet did not seem to touch the earth.He appeared to\nbe floating upon its arch, as the halcyon floats in the atmosphere.His\nfeatures were lit up with a heavenly radiance, and assumed an expression\nof superhuman beauty.The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?As sudden as the\nquestion came forth the response, "I am."But, inquired my mind, for my\nlips did not move, you have never passed the portals of the grave?Again\nI read in his features the answer, "For ages this earth existed as a\nnatural body, and all its inhabitants partook of its characteristics;\ngradually it approached the spiritual state, and by a law like that\nwhich transforms the egg into the songster, or the worm into the\nbutterfly, it has just accomplished one of its mighty cycles, and now\ngleams forth with the refulgence of the stars.I did not die, but passed\nas naturally into the spiritual world as the huge earth itself.Prophets\nand apostles predicted this change many hundred years ago; but the blind\ninfatuation of our race did not permit them to realize its truth.Your\nown mind, in common with the sages of all time, long brooded over the\nidea, and oftentimes have you exclaimed, in agony and\ndismay--WHITHERWARD!The revolution may not come in the year\nallotted you, but so surely as St.Paul spoke inspiration, so surely as\nscience elicits truth, so surely as the past prognosticates the future,\nthe natural world must pass into the spiritual, and everything be\nchanged in the twinkling of an eye.your own ears may hear\nthe clarion note, your own eyes witness the transfiguration."Slowly the vision faded away, and left me straining my gaze into the\ndark midnight which now shrouded the world, and endeavoring to calm my\nheart, which throbbed as audibly as the hollow echoes of a drum.When\nthe morning sun peeped over the Contra Costa range, I still sat silent\nand abstracted in my chair, revolving over the incidents of the night,\nbut thankful that, though the reason is powerless to brush away the\nclouds which obscure the future, yet the imagination may spread its\nwings, and, soaring into the heavens beyond them, answer the soul when\nin terror she inquires--WHITHERWARD!_OUR WEDDING-DAY._\n\n\n                   I.\n\n    A dozen

occurring around me.The morning of the ninth dawned, dragged\nheavily along, and noon approached, whilst I lay in the same comatose\nstate.No alteration had taken place, except that a deeper and sounder\nsleep seemed to have seized upon me; a symptom hailed by my physician\nwith joy, but regarded by my mother with increased alarm.Suddenly, the incautious closing of my chamber door, as my sister, Miss\nLucy Stanly, then in her fifteenth year, entered the apartment, aroused\nme from slumber and oblivion.I endeavored to recall something\nof the past, but memory for a long time refused its aid, and I appeared\nas fatally and irremediably unconscious as ever.Gradually, however, my\nshattered mind recovered its faculties, and in less than an hour after\nmy awakening, I felt perfectly restored.No pain tormented me, and no\ntorpor benumbed my faculties.I rapidly reviewed, mentally, the\noccurrences of the day before, when, as I imagined, the disaster had\nhappened, and resolved at once to rise from my bed and prosecute my\nintended journey.At this moment my father entered the apartment, and observing that I\nwas awake, ventured to speak to me kindly and in a very low tone.I\nsmiled at his uneasiness, and immediately relieved him from all\napprehension, by conversing freely and intelligibly of the late\ncatastrophe.He seized my hand a thousand\ntimes, and pressed it again and again to his lips.At length,\nremembering that my mother was ignorant of my complete restoration, he\nrushed from the room, in order to be the first to convey the welcome\nintelligence.My bed was soon surrounded by the whole family, chattering away, wild\nwith joy, and imprinting scores of kisses on my lips, cheeks and\nforehead.The excitement proved too severe for me in my weak condition,\nand had not the timely arrival of the physician intervened to clear my\nchamber of every intruder, except Mamma Betty, as we all called the\nnurse, these pages in all probability would never have arrested the\nreader\'s eye.As it was, I suddenly grew very sick and faint; everything\naround me assumed a deep green tinge, and I fell into a deathlike swoon.Another morning\'s sun was shining cheerily in at my window, when\nconsciousness again returned.The doctor was soon at my side, and\ninstead of prescribing physic as a remedy, requested my sister to sit at\nmy bedside, and read in a low tone any interesting little story she\nmight select.He cautioned her not to mention, even in the most casual\nmanner, _Mormonism_, _St.Louis_, or the _Moselle_, which order she most\nimplicitly obeyed; nor could all my ingenuity extract a solitary remark\nin relation to either.My sister was not very long in making a selection; for, supposing what\ndelighted herself would not fail to amuse me, she brought in a\nmanuscript, carefully folded, and proceeded at once to narrate its\nhistory.It was written by my father, as a sort of model or sampler for\nmy brothers and sisters, which they were to imitate when composition-day\ncame round, instead of "hammering away," as he called it, on moral\nessays and metaphysical commonplaces.It was styled\n\n\nTHE KING OF THE NINE-PINS: A MYTH.Heinrich Schwarz, or Black Hal, as he was wont to be called, was an old\ntoper, but he was possessed of infinite good humor, and related a great\nmany very queer stories, the truth of which no one, that I ever heard\nof, had the hardihood to doubt; for Black Hal had an uncommon share of\n"Teutonic pluck" about him, and was at times very unceremonious in the\ndisplay of it.But Hal had a weakness--it was not liquor, for that was\nhis strength--which he never denied; _Hal was too fond of nine-pins_.He\nhad told me, in confidence, that "many a time and oft" he had rolled\nincessantly for weeks together.I think I heard him say that he once\nrolled for a month, day and night, without stopping a single moment to\neat or to drink, or even to catch his breath.I did not question his veracity at the time; but since, on reflection,\nthe fact seems almost incredible; and were it not that this sketch might\naccidentally fall in his way, I might be tempted to show philosophically\nthat such a thing could not possibly be.And yet I have read of very\nlong fasts in my day--that, for instance, of Captain Riley in the Great\nSahara, and others, which will readily occur to the reader.But I must\nnot episodize, or I shall not reach my story.Black Hal was sitting late one afternoon in a Nine-Pin Alley, in the\nlittle town of Kaatskill, in the State of New York--it is true, for he\nsaid so--when a tremendous thunder-storm invested his retreat.His\ncompanions, one by one, had left him, until, rising from his seat and\ngazing around, he discovered that he was alone.The alley-keeper, too,\ncould nowhere be found, and the boys who were employed to set up the\npins had disappeared with the rest.It was growing very late, and Hal\nhad a long walk, and he thought it most prudent to get ready to start\nhome.The lightning glared in at the door and windows most vividly, and\nthe heavy thunder crashed and rumbled and roared louder than he had ever\nheard it before.The rain, too, now commenced to batter down\ntremendously, and just as night set in, Hal had just got ready to set\nout.Hal first felt uneasy, next unhappy, and finally miserable.If he\nhad but a boy to talk to!A verse\nthat he learned in his boyhood, across the wide sea, came unasked into\nhis mind.It always came there precisely at the time he did not desire\nits company.It ran thus:\n\n    "Oh!for the might of dread Odin\n       The powers upon him shed,\n     For a sail in the good ship Skidbladnir,[A-236]\n       And a talk with Mimir\'s head!"[B-236]\n\n[Footnote A-236: The ship Skidbladnir was the property of Odin.He could\nsail in it on the most dangerous seas, and yet could fold it up and\ncarry it in his pocket.][Footnote B-236: Mimir\'s head was always the companion of Odin.When he\ndesired to know what was transpiring in distant countries, he inquired\nof Mimir, and always received a correct reply.]This verse was repeated over and over again inaudibly.Gradually,\nhowever, his voice became a little louder, and a little louder still,\nuntil finally poor Hal hallooed it vociferously forth so sonorously that\nit drowned the very thunder.He had repeated it just seventy-seven\ntimes, when suddenly a monstrous head was thrust in at the door, and\ndemanded, in a voice that sounded like the maelstrom, "What do _you_\nwant with Odin?""Oh, nothing--nothing in the world, I thank you, sir,"\npolitely responded poor Hal, shaking from head to foot.Here the head\nwas followed by the shoulders, arms, body and legs of a giant at least\nforty feet high.Of course he came in on all fours, and approached in\nclose proximity to Black Hal.Hal involuntarily retreated, as far as he\ncould, reciting to himself the only prayer he remembered, "Now I lay me\ndown to sleep," etc.The giant did not appear desirous of pursuing Hal, being afraid--so Hal\nsaid--that he would draw his knife on him.But be the cause what it\nmight, he seated himself at the head of the nine-pin alley, and shouted,\n"Stand up!"As he did so, the nine-pins at the other end arose and took\ntheir places."Now, sir," said he, turning again to Hal, "I\'ll bet you an ounce of\nyour blood I can beat you rolling."Hal trembled again, but meekly replied, "Please, sir, we don\'t bet\n_blood_ nowadays--we bet _money_.""Blood\'s my money," roared forth the giant.Hal tried in\nvain to hoist the window."Yes, sir," said Hal; and he thought as it was only _an ounce_, he could\nspare that without much danger, and it might appease the monster\'s\nappetite."Yes, sir," replied Hal, as he seized what he supposed to be the largest\nand his favorite ball."What are you doing with Mimir\'s head?""I beg your pardon, most humbly," began Hal, as he let the bloody head\nfall; "I did not mean any harm."Hal fell on his knees and recited most devoutly, "Now I lay me down,"\netc.I say," and the giant seized poor Hal by the collar\nand set him on his feet.He now selected a large ball, and poising it carefully in his hand, ran\na few steps, and sent it whirling right in among the nine-pins; but what\nwas his astonishment to behold them jump lightly aside, and permit the\nball to pass in an avenue directly through the middle of the alley.The second and third ball met with no better success.Odin--for Hal said it was certainly he, as he had Mimir\'s head\nalong--now grasped a ball and rolled it with all his might; but long\nbefore it reached the nine-pins, they had, every one of them, tumbled\ndown, and lay sprawling on the alley.said the giant, as he grinned most gleefully at poor Hal.Taking another ball, he\nhurled it down the alley, and the same result followed."I give up the game," whined out Hal."Then you lose double," rejoined Odin.Hal readily consented to pay two ounces, for he imagined, by yielding at\nonce, he would so much the sooner get rid of his grim companion.As he\nsaid so, Odin pulled a pair of scales out of his coat pocket, made\nproportionably to his own size.He poised them upon a beam in the alley,\nand drew forth what he denominated two ounces, and put them in one\nscale.Each ounce was about the size of a twenty-eight pound weight, and\nwas quite as heavy.shouted the giant, as he\ngrasped the gasping and terrified gambler.He soon rolled up his\nsleeves, and bound his arm with a pocket handkerchief.Next he drew\nforth a lancet as long as a sword, and drove the point into the biggest\nvein he could discover.When he returned to\nconsciousness, the sun was shining brightly in at the window, and the\nsweet rumbling of the balls assured him that he still lay where the\ngiant left him.On rising to his feet he perceived that a large coagulum\nof blood had collected where his head rested all night, and that he\ncould scarcely walk from the effects of his exhaustion.He returned\nimmediately home and told his wife all that had occurred; and though,\nlike some of the neighbors, she distrusted the tale, yet she never\nintimated her doubts to Black Hal himself.The alley-keeper assured me\nin a whisper, one day, that upon the very night fixed on by Hal for the\nadventure, he was beastly drunk, and had been engaged in a fight with\none of his boon companions, who gave him a black eye and a bloody nose.But the alley-keeper was always jealous of Black Hal\'s superiority in\nstory telling; besides, he often drank too much himself, and I suspect\nhe originated the report he related to me in a fit of wounded pride, or\ndrunken braggadocio.One thing is certain, he never ventured to repeat\nthe story in the presence of Black Hal himself.#       #       #       #       #\n\nIn spite of the attention I endeavored to bestow on the marvelous\nhistory of Black Hal and his grim companion, my mind occasionally\nwandered far away, and could only find repose in communing with her who\nI now discovered for the first time held in her own hands the thread of\nmy destiny.Lucy was not blind to these fits of abstraction, and\nwhenever they gained entire control of my attention, she would pause,\nlay down the manuscript, and threaten most seriously to discontinue the\nperusal, unless I proved a better listener.I ask no man\'s pardon for\ndeclaring that my sister was an excellent reader.Most brothers, perhaps\nthink the same of most sisters; but there _was_ a charm in Lucy\'s accent\nand a distinctness in her enunciation I have never heard excelled.Owing\nto these qualities, as much, perhaps, as to the strangeness of the\nstory, I became interested in the fate of the drunken gambler, and when\nLucy concluded, I was ready to exclaim, "And pray where is Black Hal\nnow?"My thoughts took another direction, however, and I impatiently demanded\nwhether or not the sample story had been imitated.A guilty blush\nassured me quite as satisfactorily as words could have done, that Miss\nLucy had herself made an attempt, and I therefore insisted that as she\nhad whetted and excited the appetite, it would be highly\nunfraternal--(particularly in my present very precarious\ncondition)--that parenthesis settled the matter--to deny me the means of\nsatisfying it."But you\'ll laugh at me," timidly whispered my sister."Of course I shall," said I, "if your catastrophe is half as melancholy\nas Black Hal\'s.But make haste, or I shall be off to St.But pray\ninform me, what is the subject of your composition?""I believe, on my soul," responded I, laughing outright, "you girls\nnever think about anything else."I provoked no reply, and the manuscript being unfolded, my sister thus\nattempted to elucidate\n\n\nTHE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE.Professor Williams having ceased his manipulations, my eyes\ninvoluntarily closed, and I became unconscious to everything occurring\naround me.There\'s truth in mesmerism, after all, thought I, and being\nin the clairvoyant state, I beheld a most beautiful comet at this moment\nemerging from the constellation Taurus, and describing a curve about the\nstar Zeta, one of the Pleiades.and as this thought entered my brain, I grasped a hair in the tail of\nthe comet as it whizzed by me.I climbed up the glittering hair until I found myself seated very\ncomfortably on the comet\'s back, and was beginning to enjoy my starlit\nramble exceedingly, when I was suddenly aroused from my meditations by\nthe song of a heavenly minstrel, who, wandering from star to star and\nsystem to system, sang the fate of other worlds and other beings to\nthose who would listen to his strains and grant him the rites of\nhospitality.As I approached, his tones were suddenly changed, his voice\nlowered into a deeper key, and gazing intently at me, or at what\nevidenced my presence to his sight, thus began:\n\nThe flaming sword of the cherub, which had waved so frightfully above\nthe gate of the garden of Eden, had disappeared; the angel himself was\ngone; and Adam, as he approached the spot where so lately he had enjoyed\nthe delights of heaven, beheld with astonishment and regret that\nParadise and all its splendors had departed from the earth forever.Where the garden lately bloomed, he could discover only the dark and\nsmouldering embers of a conflagration; a hard lava had incrusted itself\nalong the golden walks; the birds were flown, the flowers withered, the\nfountains dried up, and desolation brooded over the scene.sighed the patriarch of men, "where are now the pleasures which I\nonce enjoyed along these peaceful avenues?Where are all those\nbeautiful spirits, given by Heaven to watch over and protect me?Each\nguardian angel has deserted me, and the rainbow glories of Paradise have\nflown.No more the sun shines out in undimmed splendor, for clouds array\nhim in gloom; the earth, forgetful of her verdure and her flowers,\nproduces thorns to wound and frosts to chill me.The very air, once all\nbalm and zephyrs, now howls around me with the voice of the storm and\nthe fury of the hurricane.No more the notes of peace and happiness\ngreet my ears, but the harsh tones of strife and battle resound on every\nside.Nature has kindled the flames of discord in her own bosom, and\nuniversal war has begun his reign!"And then the father of mankind hid his face in the bosom of his\ncompanion, and wept the bitter tears of contrition and repentance."Oh, do not weep so bitterly, my Adam," exclaimed his companion."True,\nwe are miserable, but all is not yet lost; we have forfeited the smiles\nof Heaven, but we may yet regain our lost place in its affections.Let\nus learn from our misfortunes the anguish of guilt, but let us learn\nalso the mercy of redemption."Oh, talk not of happiness now," interrupted Adam; "that nymph who once\nwailed at our side, attentive to the beck, has disappeared, and fled\nfrom the companionship of such guilty, fallen beings as ourselves,\nforever.""Not forever, Adam," kindly rejoined Eve; "she may yet be lurking among\nthese groves, or lie hid behind yon hills.""Then let us find her," quickly responded Adam; "you follow the sun,\nsweet Eve, to his resting-place, whilst I will trace these sparkling\nwaters to their bourn.Let us ramble this whole creation o\'er; and when\nwe have found her, let us meet again on this very spot, and cling to her\nside, until the doom of death shall overtake us."And the eye of Adam beamed with hope, then kindled for the first time on\nearth in the bosom of man; and he bade Eve his first farewell, and\nstarted eastward in his search.Eve turned her face to the west, and set out on her allotted journey.The sun had shone a hundred times in midsummer splendor, and a hundred\ntimes had hid himself in the clouds of winter, and yet no human foot had\ntrod the spot where the garden of Eden once bloomed.Adam had in vain\ntraced the Euphrates to the sea, and climbed the Himalaya Mountains.In\nvain had he endured the tropical heats on the Ganges, and the winter\'s\ncold in Siberia.He stood at last upon the borders of that narrow sea\nwhich separates Asia from America, and casting a wistful glance to the\nfar-off continent, exclaimed: "In yon land, so deeply blue in the\ndistance, that it looks like heaven, Happiness may have taken refuge.I will return to Eden, and learn if\nEve, too, has been unsuccessful."And then he took one more look at the distant land, sighed his adieu,\nand set out on his return.First child of misery, first daughter of despair!Poor Eve,\nwith the blue of heaven in her eye, and the crimson of shame upon her\nlip!Poor Eve, arrayed in beauty, but hastening to decay--she, too, was\nunsuccessful.Wandering in her westward way, the azure waters of the Mediterranean\nsoon gleamed upon her sight.She stood at length upon the pebbly shore,\nand the glad waves, silent as death before, when they kissed her naked\nfeet, commenced that song still heard in their eternal roar.A mermaid\nseemed to rise from the waters at her feet, and to imitate her every\nmotion.Her long dark tresses, her deep blue eyes, her rosy cheek, her\nsorrowful look, all were reflected in the mermaid before her."Sweet spirit," said Eve, "canst thou inform me where the nymph\nHappiness lies concealed?She always stood beside us in the garden of\nEden; but when we were driven from Paradise we beheld her no more."The lips of the mermaid moved, but Eve could hear no reply.mother of mankind, the crystal waters of every sea, reflecting thy\nlovely image, still faithful to their trust, conceal a mermaid in their\nbosom for every daughter of beauty who looks upon them!Neither the orange groves of the Arno, nor the vineyards of France;\nneither the forests of Germania, nor the caves of Norway, concealed the\nsought-for nymph.Her track was imprinted in the\nsands of Sahara, by the banks of the Niger, on the rocks of Bengola, in\nthe vales of Abyssinia--but all in vain.Come, Death," cried Eve; "']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: The text does not mention Sandra at all. It talks about Adam and Eve's journey after being expelled from the Garden of Eden, their search for Happiness, and their interactions with nature and a mermaid.

of course I was a stranger, and explained to\nhim that what I wanted was not to make any mistake, but to get into the\nchurch where there were the most respectable people who would be of use\nto me; and what do you think he said?He was huffed about it--actually\nmad!He said he’d rather have given me a hundred dollars than had me ask\nhim that question; and after that he was cool, and so was I, and we’ve\nnever had much to say to each other since then.Of course, there’s no\nquarrel, you know.Only it strikes me he’ll be a queer sort of man to\nget along with.A lawyer with cranks like that--why, you never know what\nhe’ll do next.”\n\n“He’s one of the best fellows alive,” said Horace, with sharp emphasis.“Why, of course he is,” replied Mr.“But that isn’t business.Take the General, for instance; he’s a good fellow, too--in a different\nkind of way, of course--and see where it’s landed him.Look out for him and you are all right.Tracy might be making\nfive or six times as much as he is, if he went the right way to work.He\ndoes more business and gets less for it than any other lawyer in town.There’s no sense in that.”\n\n“Upon my word, Mr.Sandra went to the office.Tenney,” said Horace, after a moment’s pause, in\nwhich he deliberately framed what he was going to say, “I find it\ndifficult to understand why you thought it worth while to come here at\nall to-day: it surely wasn’t to talk about Tracy; and the things I want\nto know about my father you won’t discuss.What I see is this: that you were a\nprivate in the regiment my father was colonel of; that he made you a\nsort of adjutant, or something in the nature of a clerk, and so lifted\nyou out of the ranks; that during the war, when your health failed, he\ngave you a place in his business here at home, which lifted you out of\nthe farm; that a while later he made you a partner; and that gradually\nthe tables have been completely turned, until you are the colonel and\nhe is the private, you are rich and he is nearly insolvent.That is what\nthe thing sums up to in my mind.Have you come to tell me that now you are going to be good to\nhim?”\n\n“Good God!Haven’t I been good to him?” said Tenney, with real\nindignation.“Couldn’t I have frozen him out eighteen months ago instead\nof taking up his overdrafts at only ten per cent, charge so as to keep\nhim along?There isn’t one man in a hundred who would have done for him\nwhat I have.”\n\n“I am glad to hear it,” replied the young man.“If the proportion was much larger, I am afraid this would be a very\nunhappy world to live in.”\n\nMr.He had not clearly grasped the\nmeaning of this remark, but instinct told him that it was hostile.You may take it that way, if you like.” He rose as he spoke\nand began buttoning his overcoat.“Only let me say this: when the smash\ncomes, you can’t say I didn’t warn you.If you won’t listen to me,\nthat’s _your_ lookout.”\n\n“But I haven’t done anything but listen to you for the last two hours,”\n said Horace, who longed to tell his visitor to go to the devil, and yet\nwas betrayed into signs of anxiety at the prospect of his departure.“If\nyou’ll remember, you haven’t told me anything that I asked for.Heaven\nknows, I should be only too glad to listen, if you’ve got anything to\nsay.”\n\nMr.Tenney made a smiling movement with his thin lips and sat down\nagain.“I thought you would change your tune,” he said, calmly.Horace offered\na gesture of dissent, to which the hardware merchant paid no attention.He had measured his man, and decided upon a system of treatment.“What\nI really wanted,” he continued, “was to look you over and hear you talk,\nand kind of walk around you and size you up, so to speak.You see I’ve\nonly known you as a youngster--better at spending money than at making\nit.Now that you’ve started as a lawyer, I thought I’d take stock of you\nagain, don’t you see; and the best way to sound you all around was to\ntalk about your father’s affairs.”\n\nHorace was conscious of a temptation to be angry at this cool statement,\nbut he did not yield to it.“Then it isn’t true--what you have told me?”\n he asked.“Well, yes, it is, mostly,” answered Mr.Tenney, again contemplating his\njoined finger-tips.“But it isn’t of so much importance compared with\nsome other things.There’s bigger game afoot than partnerships in\nhardware stores.”\n\nHorace gave a little laugh of mingled irritation and curiosity.“What\nthe devil _are_ you driving at, Tenney?” he said, and swung his chair\nonce more to face his visitor.This time the two men eyed each other more sympathetically, and the\ntones of the two voices lost something of their previous reserve.Tenney himself resumed the conversation with an air of direct candor:\n\n“I heard somebody say you rather counted on getting some of the Minster\niron-works business.”\n\n“Well, the fact is, I may have said I hoped to, but nothing definite has\nbeen settled.The ladies are friends of mine: we came up from New York\ntogether last month; but nothing was decided.”\n\n“I see,” said Mr.Tenney, and Horace felt uneasily, as he looked into\nthose sharp gray eyes, that no doubt they did see very clearly.There’s no harm in that, only\nit’s no good to gas with me, for there’s some solid business to be\ndone--something mighty promising for both of us.”\n\n“Of course I’ve no notion what you mean,” said Horace.“But it’s just\nas well to clear up the ground as we go along.The first experiment of\nyoking up Boyces and Tenneys together hasn’t turned out so admirably as\nto warrant me--What shall I say?”\n\n“As to warrant you going in with your eyes shut.” Mr.Tenney supplied\nthe lacking phrase with evident enjoyment.On the contrary, what I want of you is to have your eyes peeled\nparticularly wide open.But, first of all, Tracy mustn’t hear a breath\nof this whole thing.”\n\n“Then go no further, I beg of you.I sha’n’t touch it.”\n\n“Oh, yes, you will,” said Mr.“He\nhas his own private business.The railroad work, for\nexample: you don’t share in that.That is his own, and quite right, too.But that very fact leaves you free, doesn’t it, to go into speculations\non your own account?”\n\n“Speculations--yes, perhaps.”\n\n“No ‘perhaps’ about it; of course it does.At least, you can hear what\nI have to say without telling him, whether you go into the thing or not;\ndo you promise me that?”\n\n“I don’t think I wish to promise anything,” said Horace, doubtingly.If you won’t deal, you won’t; and I must protect myself my\nown way.” Mr.Tenney did not rise and again begin buttoning his coat,\nnor was it, indeed, necessary.There had been menace enough in his tone\nto effect his purpose.“Very well, then,” answered Horace, in a low voice; “if you insist, I\npromise.”\n\n“I shall know within half an hour if you do tell him,” said Mr.Tenney,\nin his most affable manner; “but of course you won’t.”\n\n“Of course I won’t!” snapped Horace, testily.The first thing, then, is to put the\naffairs of the Minster women into your hands.”\n\nHorace took his feet off the table, and looked in fixed surprise at\nhis father’s partner.“How--what do you mean?” he stammered at last,\nrealizing, even as he spoke, that there were certain strange depths in\nMr.Tenney’s eyes which had been dimly apparent at the outset, and then\nhad been for a long time veiled, and were now once more discernible.“How do you mean?”\n\n“It can be fixed, as easy as rolling off a log.Old Clarke has gone to\nFlorida for his health, and there’s going to be a change made.A word\nfrom me can turn the whole thing over to you.”\n\n“A word from you!” Horace spoke with incredulity, but he did not really\ndoubt.There was a revelation of reserve power in the man’s glance that\nfascinated him.Daniel went to the bedroom.“That’s what I said.The question is whether I shall speak it or not.”\n\n“To be frank with you”--Horace smiled a little--“I hope very much that\nyou will.”\n\n“I daresay.But have you got the nerve for it?--that’s the point.Can\nyou keep your mouth shut, and your head clear, and will you follow me\nwithout kicking or blabbing?That’s what I want to know.”\n\n“And that’s just what I can’t tell you.I’m not going to bind myself\nto do unknown things.” Horace said this bravely enough, but the shrewd,\nlistening ear understood very well the lurking accent of assent.“You needn’t bind yourself to anything, except to tell Tracy nothing\ntill I give you the word, and then only what we shall agree upon.Of\ncourse, later on he will have to know something about it.And mind, mum’s the word.” Mr.Tenney rose now, not tentatively,\nbut as one who is really going.Horace sprang to his feet as well, and\ndespite the other’s declaration that he was pressed for time, and had\nalready stayed too long, insisted on detaining him.“What I don’t understand in all this,” he said, hurriedly--“for that\nmatter the whole thing is a mystery--but what I particularly fail to see\nis your object in benefiting me.You tell me\nthat you have got my father in a hole, and then you offer me a great and\nsubstantial prize.You are not the man to\ndo things for nothing.What you haven’t told me is what there is in this\naffair for you.”\n\nMr.Tenney seemed complimented by this tribute to his commercial sense\nand single-mindedness.“No, I haven’t told you,” he said, buttoning his\ncoat.“That’ll come in due time.All you’ve got to do meanwhile is to\nkeep still, and to take the thing when it comes to you.Let me know\nat once, and say nothing to any living soul--least of all Tracy--until\nyou’ve talked with me.That oughtn’t to be hard.”\n\n“And suppose I don’t like the conditions?”\n\n“Then you may lump them,” said Schuyler Ten, ney, disclosing his small\nteeth again in a half-smile, as he made his way out.MINSTER’S NEW LEGAL ADVISER.Horace Boyce, on returning home one evening,\nfound on his table a note which had been delivered during the day by\na servant.Minster--“Desideria Minster” she signed\nherself--asking him to call upon her the following afternoon.The young\nman read the missive over and over again by the lamplight, and if it\nhad been a love-letter from the daughter instead of the polite business\nappointment by the mother, his eyes couldn’t have flashed more eagerly\nas he took in the meaning of its words.He thought long upon that, ruminating in his\neasy-chair before the fire until far past midnight, until the dainty\nlittle Japanese saucer at his side was heaped up with cigar ashes, and\nthe air was heavy with smoke.Evidently this summons was directly connected with the remarks made by\nTenney a fortnight before.He had said the Minster business should come\nto him, and here it was.Minster wrote to him at his\nresidence, rather than at his office, was proof that she too wished to\nhave him alone, and not the firm of Tracy & Boyce, as her adviser.That\nthere should be this prejudice against Reuben, momentarily disturbed the\nyoung man; but, upon examination, he found it easy to account for it.Reuben was very nice--his partner even paused for a moment to reflect\nhow decent a fellow Reuben really was--but then, he scarcely belonged to\nthe class of society in which people like the Boyces and Minsters moved.Naturally the millionnaire widow, belonging as she did to an ancient\nfamily in the Hudson River valley, and bearing the queer name of a\ngrandmother who had been a colonial beauty, would prefer to have as her\nfamily lawyer somebody who also had ancestors.The invitation had its notable social side, too.There was no good\nin blinking the fact that his father the General--who had effected a\nsomewhat noisy entrance to the house a half-hour ago, and the sound\nof whose burdened breathing now intermittently came to his ears in the\nsilence of the night--had allowed the family status to lapse.The Boyces\nwere not what they had been.In the course of such few calls as he had\nmade since his return, it had been impossible for him not to detect\nthe existence of a certain surprise that he should have called at all.Everybody, too, had taken pains to avoid reference to his father, even\nwhen the course of talk made such allusion natural.This had for the\nmoment angered the young man, and later had not a little discouraged\nhim.As a boy he had felt it a great thing to be the son of a general,\nand to find it now to be a distinct detriment was disheartening indeed.But this black-bordered, perfumed note from Mrs.Minster put all, as\nby the sweep of a hand, into the background.Once he visited that\nproud household as a friend, once he looked Thessaly in the face as\nthe confidential adviser of the Minster family, the Boyces were\nrehabilitated.To dwell upon the thought was very pleasant, for it led the way by\nsweetly vagrant paths to dreams of the dark-eyed, beautiful Kate.During the past month these visions had lost color and form under the\ndisconcerting influences just spoken of, but now they became, as if by\nmagic, all rosy-hued and definite again.He had planned to himself on\nthat first November day a career which should be crowned by marriage\nwith the lovely daughter of the millions, and had made a mental march\naround the walls encompassing her to spy out their least defended point.Now, all at once, marvellous as it seemed, he found himself transported\nwithin the battlements.He was to be her mother’s lawyer--nay, _her_\nlawyer as well, and to his sanguine fancy this meant everything.It meant one of the most beautiful\nwomen he had ever seen as his wife--a lady well-born, delicately\nnurtured, clever, and good; it meant vast wealth, untold wealth, with\nwhich to be not only the principal personage of these provincial parts,\nbut a great figure in New York or Washington or Europe.He might be\nsenator in Congress, minister to Paris, or even aspire to the towering,\nsolitary eminence of the Presidency itself with the backing of these\nmillions.It meant a yacht, the very dream of sea-going luxury and\nspeed, in which to bask under Hawaiian skies, to loiter lazily along the\ntopaz shores of far Cathay, to flit to and fro between spice lands and\ncold northern seas, the whole watery globe subject to her keel.Why,\nthere could be a castle on the Moselle, a country house in Devonshire,\na flat in Paris, a villa at Mentone, a summer island home on the St.Lawrence, a mansion in New York--all together, if he liked, or as many\nas pleased his whim.It might be worth the while to lease a shooting in\nScotland, only the mischief was that badly bred Americans, the odious\n_nouveaux riches_, had rather discredited the national name in the\nHighlands.So the young man’s fancies floated on the wreaths of scented smoke till\nat last he yawned in spite of himself, sated with the contemplation of\nthe gifts the gods had brought him.Minster’s note once\nagain before he went to bed, and sleep overtook his brain while it was\nstill pleasantly musing on the choicest methods of expending the income\nof her millions.Curiously enough, during all these hours of happy castle-building, the\nquestion of why Schuyler Tenney had interested himself in the young\nman’s fortunes never once crossed that young man’s mind.To be frank,\nthe pictures he painted were all of “gentlemen” and “ladies,” and his\nfather’s partner, though his help might be of great assistance at\nthe outset, could scarcely expect to mingle in such company, even in\nHorace’s tobacco reveries.Neither to his father at the breakfast-table, nor to Reuben Tracy at\nthe office, did young Mr.Boyce next day mention the fact that he was to\ncall on Mrs.This enforced silence was not much to his liking,\nprimarily because his temperament was the reverse of secretive.When\nhe had done anything or thought of doing something, the impulse to tell\nabout it was always strong upon him.The fact that the desire to talk\nwas not rigorously balanced by regard for the exact and prosaic truth\nmay not have been an essential part of the trait when we come to\nanalysis, but garrulity and exaggeration ran together in Horace’s\nnature.To repress them now, just at the time when the most important\nevent of his life impended, required a good deal of effort.He had some qualms of conscience, too, so far as Reuben was concerned.Two or three things had happened within the past week which had laid\nhim under special obligation to the courtesy and good feeling of his\npartner.They were not important, perhaps, but still the memory of them\nweighed upon _his_ mind when, at three o’clock, he put on his coat and\nexplained that he might not be back again that afternoon.Reuben nodded,\nand said, “All right: I shall be here.If so-and-so comes, I’ll go over\nthe matter and make notes for you.” Then Horace longed very much to tell\nall about the Minster summons and the rest, and this longing arose as\nmuch from a wish to be frank and fair as from a craving to confide his\nsecret to somebody; but he only hesitated for a second, and then went\nout.Minster received him in the chamber which had been her husband’s\nworking room, and which still contained his desk, although it had since\nbeen furnished with book-shelves and was called the library.Horace\nnoted, as the widow rose to greet him, that, though the desk was open,\nits pigeon-holes did not seem to contain many papers.After his hostess had bidden him to be seated, and had spoken in mildly\ndeprecating tones about the weather, she closed her resolutely lined\nlips, folded her hands in her lap, and looked at him in amiable\nsuspense.Minster’s dark face, with its\nhigh frame of white hair and its bright black eyes, habitually produced\nan impression of great cleverness and alert insight, and Horace was\nconscious of embarrassment in finding the task of conversation devolved\nupon himself.He took up the burden, however, and carried it along from\nsubject to subject until at last it seemed fitting to broach the great\ntopic.“I didn’t get your note until evening,” he said, with a polite inquiring\nsmile.“No, I didn’t send it until after dinner,” she replied, and a pause\nensued.It fortunately occurred to Horace to say he was very glad to have her\ncall upon him always, if in any way she saw how he could serve her.As\nhe spoke these words, he felt that they were discreet and noncommittal,\nand yet must force her to come to the point.“It is very kind of you, I’m sure,” she said, graciously, and came to a\nfull stop.“If there is anything I can do now,” Horace remarked tentatively.What I wanted to ask you was, do you know the Wendovers?”\n\n“I don’t think I do.” murmured the young man, with a great sinking of\nthe heart.“They’re New York people,” the lady explained.“I know almost nobody in New York,” answered Horace gloomily.No, I am quite sure the name is new to me.”\n\n“That is curious,” said Mrs.She took a letter up from the\ndesk.“This is from Judge Wendover, and it mentions you.I gathered from\nit that he knew you quite well.”\n\nOh, shades of the lies that might have been told, if one had only known!Horace swiftly ransacked his brain for a way out of this dilemma.Evidently this letter bore upon his selection as her lawyer.He guessed\nrightly that it had been written at Tenney’s suggestion and by some one\nwho had Mrs.John travelled to the garden.Obviously this some one was of the\nlegal profession.“The name does sound familiar, on second thought,” he said.“I daresay\nit is, if I could only place it.You see, I had a number of offers to\nenter legal firms in New York, and in that way I saw a good many people\nfor a few minutes, you know, and quite probably I’ve forgotten some of\ntheir names.They would remember me, of course, but I might confuse them\none with another, don’t you see?Strange, I don’t fix the man you mean.Was he a middle-aged man, grayish hair, well dressed?”\n\n“Yes, that describes him.” She did not add that it would equally\ndescribe seven out of every ten other men called “judge” throughout the\nUnited States.“Now I place him,” said Horace triumphantly.“There was some talk of\nmy going into his office as a junior partner.Mutual friends of ours\nproposed it, I remember.Curious that I should\nhave forgotten his name.One’s memory plays such whimsical tricks,\nthough.”\n\n“I didn’t know Judge Wendover was practising law,” said Mrs.“He never was much of a lawyer.He was county judge once down in\nPeekskill, about the time I was married, but he didn’t get reelected;\nand I thought he gave it all up when he went to New York.”\n\n“If it’s the man I mean,” put in Horace, groping his way despairingly,\n“there wasn’t much business in his office.That is why I didn’t go in, I\ndaresay: it wouldn’t be worth my while unless he himself was devoted to\nthe law, and carried on a big practice.”\n\n“I daresay it’s the same man,” remarked Mrs.“He probably\n_would_ have a kind of law office.They generally do.”\n\n“Well, may I ask,” Horace ventured after another pause, “in what\nconnection he mentions my name?”\n\n“He recommends me to consult you about affairs--to--well, how shall I\nsay it?--to make you my lawyer?”\n\nEureka!The words were out, and the difficult passage about Judge\nWhat’s-his-name was left safely behind.Horace felt his brain swimming\non a sea of exaltation, but he kept his face immobile, and bowed his\nhead with gravity.“I am very young for so serious a responsibility, I’m afraid,” he said\nmodestly.“There isn’t really much to do,”\n she answered.“And somebody would have to learn what there is; and\nyou can do that as well as any one else, better than a stranger.The\ndifficulty is,” she spoke more slowly, and Horace listened with all his\nears: “you have a partner, I’m told.”\n\nThe young man did not hesitate for an instant.“Only in a limited way,”\n he replied.Tracy and I have combined on certain lines of work\nwhere two heads are better than one, but we each keep distinct our own\nprivate practice.It is much better.”\n\n“I certainly prefer it,” said Mrs.“I am glad to hear you keep\nseparate.Tracy, and, indeed, he is very highly spoken\nof as a _lawyer_; but certain things I have heard--social matters, I\nmean--”\n\nThe lady broke off discreetly.She could not tell this young man what\nshe had heard about that visit to the Lawton house.Horace listened to\nher without the remotest notion of her meaning, and so could only smile\nfaintly and give the least suggestion of a sigh.“We can’t have everything in this world just to our minds,” he said\njudicially, and it seemed to him to cover the case with prudent\nvagueness.“I suppose you thought the partnership would be a good thing?” she\nasked.“At the time--_yes_,” answered Horace.“And, to be fair, it really has\nsome advantages.Tracy is a prodigious worker, for one thing, and\nhe is very even-tempered and willing; so that the burden of details\nis taken off my shoulders to a great extent, and that disposes one to\noverlook a good many things, you know.”\n\nMrs.She also knew what it was to delight\nin relief from the burden of details, and she said to herself that\nfortunately Mr.Boyce would thus have the more leisure to devote the\naffairs of the Minsters.Into their further talk it is not needful to pursue the lady and her\nlawyer.She spoke only in general terms, outlining her interests and\ninvestments which required attention, and vaguely defining what she\nexpected him to do.Horace listened very closely, but beyond a nebulous\ncomprehension of the existence of a big company and a little company,\nwhich together controlled the iron-works and its appurtenances, he\nlearned next to nothing.One of the first things which she desired of\nHorace was, however, that he should go to Florida and talk the whole\nsubject over with Mr.Clarke, and to this he gladly assented.“I will write to him that you are coming,” she said, as she rose.“I may\ntell you that he personally preferred Mr.Tracy as his successor; but,\nas I have told you--well, there were reasons why--”\n\nHorace made haste to bow and say “quite so,” and thus spare Mrs.“Perhaps it will be better to say nothing\nto any one until I have returned from Florida,” he added, as a parting\nsuggestion, and it had her assent.The young man walked buoyantly down the gravel path and along the\nstreets, his veins fairly tingling with excitement and joy.The great\nprize had come to him--wealth, honor, fame, were all within his grasp.He thought proudly, as he strode along, of what he would do after his\nmarriage.Even the idea of hyphenating the two names in the English\nfashion, Minster-Boyce, came into his mind, and was made welcome.Perhaps, though, it couldn’t well be done until his father was dead; and\nthat reminded him--he really must speak to the General about his loose\nbehavior.Thus Horace exultantly communed with his happy self, and formed\nresolutions, dreamed dreams, discussed radiant probabilities as he\nwalked, until his abstracted eye was suddenly, insensibly arrested by\nthe sight of a familiar sign across the street--“S.Tenney & Co.” Then\nfor the first time he remembered his promise, and the air grew colder\nabout him as he recalled it.He crossed the road after a moment’s\nhesitation, and entered the hardware store.Tenney was alone in the little office partitioned off by wood and\nglass from the open store.He received the account given by Horace of\nhis visit to the Minster mansion with no indication of surprise, and\nwith no outward sign of satisfaction.“So far, so good,” he said, briefly.Then, after a moment’s meditation,\nhe looked up sharply in the face of the young man, who was still\nstanding: “Did you say anything about your terms?”\n\n“Of course not.You don’t show price-lists like a\nstorekeeper, in the _law!_”\n\nMr.Tenney smiled just a little at Horace’s haughty tone--a smile of\nfurtive amusement.“It’s just as well,” he said.“I’ll talk with you\nabout that later.The old lady’s rather close-fisted.We may make a\npoint there--by sending in bills much smaller than old Clarke’s used to\nbe.Luckily it wasn’t needed.”\n\nThe matter-of-fact way in which Mr.Tenney used this “we” grated\ndisagreeably on the young man’s ear, suggesting as it did a new\npartnership uncomfortably vague in form; but he deemed it wise not to\ntouch upon the subject.His next question, as to the identity of Judge\nWendover, brought upon the stage, however, still a third partner in the\nshadowy firm to which he had committed himself.“Oh, Wendover’s in with us.He’s all right,” replied Schuyler Tenney,\nlightly.He’s the president of the Thessaly\nManufacturing Company.You’ll hear a good deal about _that_ later on.”\n The speaker showed his teeth again by a smiling movement of the lips at\nthis assurance, and Horace somehow felt his uneasiness growing.“She wants me to go to Florida to see Clarke, and talk things over,” he\nsaid.We must consider all that very carefully\nbefore you go.I’ll think\nout what you are to tell him.”\n\nHorace was momentarily shrinking in importance before his own mental\nvision; and, though he resented it, he could not but submit.“I suppose\nI’d better make some other excuse to Tracy about the Florida trip,” he\nsaid, almost deferentially; “what do you think?”\n\n“Oh, you think so, do you?” Mr.Tenney was interested, and made a\nrenewed scrutiny of the young man’s face.I’ll think about\nit, and let you know to-morrow.Look in about this time, and don’t say\nanything till then.So long!”\n\nThus dismissed, Horace took his leave, and it was not until he had\nnearly reached his home that the thoughts chasing each other in his mind\nbegan to take on once more roseate hues and hopeful outlines.Tenney watched his partner’s son through the partition until he was\nout of sight, and then smiled at the papers on his desk in confidence.“He’s ready to lie at a minute’s notice,” he mused; “offered on his own\nhook to lie to Tracy.That’s all right--only he mustn’t try it on with\nme!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.--THE THESSALY CITIZENS’ CLUB.The village of Thessaly took no pains to conceal the fact that it was\nvery proud of itself.What is perhaps more unique is that the farming\npeople round about, and even the smaller and rival hamlets scattered\nthrough the section, cordially recognized Thessaly’s right to be proud,\nand had a certain satisfaction in themselves sharing that pride.Lest this should breed misconception and paint a more halcyon picture of\nthese minor communities than is deserved, let it be explained that they\nwere not without their vehement jealousies and bickerings among one\nanother.Often there arose between them sore contentions over questions\nof tax equalization and over political neglects and intrigues; and\nhere, too, there existed, in generous measure, those queer parochial\nprejudices--based upon no question whatever, and defying alike inquiry\nand explanation--which are so curious a heritage from the childhood days\nof the race.No long-toed brachycephalous cave-dweller of the stone\nage could have disliked the stranger who hibernated in the holes on\nthe other side of the river more heartily than the people of Octavius\ndisliked those of Sidon.In the hop-picking season the young men of\nthese two townships always fell to fighting when they met, and their\npitched conflicts in and around the Half-way House near Tyre, when\ndances were given there in the winter, were things to talk about\nstraight through until hoeing had begun in the spring.There were many\nother of these odd and inexplicable aversions--as, for instance, that\nwhich had for many years impelled every farmer along the whole length of\nthe Nedahma Creek road to vote against any and all candidates nominated\nfrom Juno Mills, a place which they scarcely knew and had no earthly\nreason for disliking.But in such cases no one asked for reasons.Matters simply stood that way, and there was nothing more to be said.Neighbors took almost as much\npleasure in boasting of its wealth and activity, and prophesying its\nfuture greatness, as did its own sons.The farmers when they came in\ngazed with gratified amazement at the new warehouses, the new chimneys,\nthe new factory walls that were rising everywhere about them, and\nreturned more satisfied than ever that “Thessaly was just a-humming\nalong.” Dearborn County had always heretofore been a strictly\nagricultural district, full of rich farm-lands and well-to-do\nfarm-owners, and celebrated in the markets of New York for the\nexcellence of its dairy products.Now it seemed certain that Thessaly\nwould soon be a city, and it was already a subject for congratulation\nthat the industries which were rooting, sprouting, or bearing fruit\nthere had given Dearborn County a place among the dozen foremost\nmanufacturing shires in the State.The farmers were as pleased over this as any one else.It was true that\nthey were growing poorer year by year; that their lands were gradually\nbecoming covered with a parchment film of mortgages, more deadly than\nsorrel or the dreaded black-moss; that the prices of produce had gone\ndown on the one hand as much as the cost of living and of labor had\nrisen on the other; that a rich farmer had become a rarity in a district\nwhich once was controlled by the princes of herds and waving fields:\nbut all the same the agriculturists of Dearborn County were proud of\nThessaly, of its crowds of foreign-born operatives, its smoke-capped\nchimneys, and its noisy bustle.They marched almost solidly to the polls\nto vote for the laws which were supposed to protect its industries, and\nthey consoled themselves for falling incomes and increased expenditure\nby roseate pictures of the great “home market” which Thessaly was to\ncreate for them when it became a city.For many years it had been\nscarcely known to the outside world save as the seat of a seminary of\nsomething more than local repute.This institution still nestled under\nthe brow of the hill whence the boy Reuben Tracy had looked with fondly\nwistful vision down upon it, but it was no longer of much importance.It\nwas yet possible to discern in the quiet streets immediately adjoining\nthe seminary enclosure, with their tall arched canopies of elm-boughs,\nand old-fashioned white houses with verandas and antique gardens, some\nremains of the academic character that this institution had formerly\nimparted to the whole village.John went back to the bedroom.But the centre of activity and of\npopulation had long since moved southward, and around this had grown up\na new Thessaly, which needed neither elms nor gardens, which had use for\nits children at the loom or the lathe when the rudiments of the common\nschool were finished, and which alike in its hours of toil and of\nleisure was anything rather than academie.I suppose that in this modern Thessaly, with its factories and mills,\nits semi-foreign saloons, and its long streets of uniformly ugly cottage\ndwellings, there were many hundreds of adults who had no idea whether\nthe once-famous Thessaly seminary was still open or not.If Thessaly had had the time and inclination for a serious study of\nitself, this decadence of the object of its former pride might have\nawakened some regret.The seminary, which had been one of the first in\nthe land to open its doors to both sexes, had borne an honorable part in\nthe great agitation against slavery that preceded the war.Some of its\nprofessors had been distinguished abolitionists--of the kind who strove,\nsuffered, and made sacrifices when the cause was still unpopular,\nyet somehow fell or were edged out of public view once the cause had\ntriumphed and there were rewards to be distributed, and they had taken\nthe sentiment of the village with them in those old days.Then there\nwas a steady demand upon the seminary library, which was open to\nhouseholders of the village, for good books.Then there was maintained\neach winter a lecture course, which was able, not so much by money as by\nthe weight and character of its habitual patrons, to enrich its annual\nlists with such names as Emerson, Burritt, Phillips, Curtis, and\nBeecher.At this time had occurred the most sensational episode in the\nhistory of the village--when the rumor spread that a runaway <DW64> was\nsecreted somewhere about the seminary buildings, and a pro-slavery crowd\ncame over from Tyre to have him out and to vindicate upon the persons of\nhis protectors the outraged majesty of the Fugitive Slave law, and the\ncitizens of Thessaly rose and chased back the invaders with celerity and\nemphasis.But all this had happened so long ago that it was only vaguely\nremembered now.There were those who still liked to recall those\ndays and to tell stories about them, but they had only themselves for\nlisteners.The new Thessaly was not precisely intolerant of the history\nof this ante-bellum period, but it had fresher and more important\nmatters to think of; and its customary comment upon these legends of the\nslow, one-horse past was, “Things have changed a good deal since then,”\n offered with a smile of distinct satisfaction.Stephen Minster’s enterprise in opening up the\niron fields out at Juno, and in building the big smelting-works on the\noutskirts of Thessaly, had altered everything.The branch road to the\ncoal district which he called into existence lifted the village at once\ninto prominence as a manufacturing site.Other factories were erected\nfor the making of buttons, shoes, Scotch-caps, pasteboard boxes,\nmatches, and a number of varieties of cotton cloths.When this last\nindustry appeared in the midst of them, the people of Thessaly found\ntheir heads fairly turned.This period of industrial progress, of which I speak with, I hope,\nbecoming respect and pride, had now lasted some dozen years, and, so far\nfrom showing signs of interruption, there were under discussion four or\nfive new projects for additional trades to be started in the village,\nwhich would be decided upon by the time the snow was off the ground.During these years, Thessaly had more than quadrupled its population,\nwhich was now supposed to approximate thirteen thousand, and might be\neven more.There had been considerable talk for the past year or two\nabout getting a charter as a city from the legislature, and undoubtedly\nthis would soon be done.About this step there were, however, certain\ndifficulties, more clearly felt than expressed.Not even those who were\nmost exultant over Thessaly’s splendid advance in wealth and activity\nwere blind to sundry facts written on the other side of the ledger.Thessaly had now some two thousand voters, of whom perhaps two-fifths\nhad been born in Europe.It had a saloon for every three hundred and\nfifty inhabitants, and there was an uneasy sense of connection between\nthese two facts which gave rise to awkward thoughts.The village was\nfairly well managed by its trustees; the electorate insisted upon\nnothing save that they should grant licenses liberally, and, this apart,\ntheir government did not leave much to be desired.But how would it be\nwhen the municipal honors were taken on, when mayor, aider-men and all\nthe other officers of the new city, with enlarged powers of expenditure\nand legislation, should be voted for?Whenever the responsible business\nmen of Thessaly allowed their minds to dwell upon a forecast of what\nthis board of aldermen would probably be like, they frankly owned to\nthemselves that the prospect was not inviting.But as a rule they did\nnot say so, and the village was drifting citywards on a flowing tide.*****\n\nIt was just before Christmas that Reuben Tracy took the first step\ntoward realizing his dream of making this Thessaly a better place than\nit was.Fourteen citizens, all more or less intimate friends of his,\nassembled at his office one evening, and devoted some hours to listening\nto and discussing his plans.An embarrassment arose almost at the outset through the discovery that\nfive or six of the men present thought Thessaly was getting on very well\nas it was, and had assumed that the meeting was called for the purpose\nof arranging a citizens’ movement to run the coming spring elections\nfor trustees in the interest of good government--by which they of course\nunderstood that they were to be asked to take office.The exposure of\nthis mistake threatened for a little time to wreck the purpose of the\ngathering.Jones, a gentleman who made matches, or rather had just\ntaken a handsome sum from the great Ruby Loco-foco Trust as his reward\nfor ceasing to manufacture them, was especially disposed to resent\nwhat Reuben said about the moral and material state of the village.He\ninsisted that it was the busiest and most progressive town in that whole\nsection of the State; it had six streets well paved, was lighted with\ngas, had no disorderly houses to speak of,']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['The book-keeper contented himself with saying, in a preoccupied tone, as\nhe received the money:\n\n"You can\'t be too careful when you have much money about you.I am\nalmost sorry I sent for this money," he proceeded."I don\'t think I\nshall need to use it to-day.""Shall I take it back to the bank, sir?""No; I shall put it in the safe over night.I don\'t care to risk you or\nthe money again to-day.""He won\'t put it in the safe."TALBOT\'S SCHEME FAILS.Talbot went into the office where he was alone.But the partition walls\nwere of glass, and Dan managed to put himself in a position where he\ncould see all that passed within.The book-keeper opened the package of bills, and divided them into two\nparcels.One he replaced in the original paper and labeled it "$12,000."The other he put into another paper, and put into his own pocket.Dan\nsaw it all, but could not distinguish the denominations of the bills\nassigned to the different packages.He had no doubt, however, that the\nsmaller bills were placed in the package intended to be deposited in the\nsafe, so that, though of apparently equal value, it really contained\nonly about one-tenth of the money drawn from the bank.Indeed, he was not observed,\nexcept by Dan, whose business it was to watch him.The division being made, he opened the safe and placed the package\ntherein.He was anxious to communicate his discovery to the detective outside,\nbut for some time had no opportunity.About an hour later he was sent out on an errand.He looked about him in\na guarded manner till he attracted the attention of the outside\ndetective.The latter, in answer to a slight nod, approached him\ncarelessly."Well," he asked, "have you any news?"Talbot has divided the money into two\npackages, and one of them he has put into his own pocket."He means to appropriate the greater part to his own\nuse.""Is there anything more for me to do?"Does the book-keeper suspect that he\nis watched?""I am afraid he will get away with the money," said Dan, anxiously.Do you know whether there\'s any woman in the case?""He visits a young lady on Lexington avenue."It is probably on her account that he wishes to\nbecome suddenly rich."This supposition was a correct one, as we know.It did not, however,\nargue unusual shrewdness on the part of the detective, since no motive\nis more common in such cases.Dan returned to the office promptly, and nothing of importance occurred\nduring the remainder of the day.Talbot was preparing to leave, he called in the janitor."You may lock the safe," he said."By the way, you may use the word \'Hartford\' for the combination.""Be particularly careful, as the safe contains a package of\nmoney--twelve thousand dollars.""Wouldn\'t it have been better to deposit it in the bank, Mr."Yes, but it was not till the bank closed that I decided not to use it\nto-day.However, it is secure in the safe," he added, carelessly."I have no doubt of that, Mr.In turning a street corner, he brushed against a rough-looking man who\nwas leaning against a lamp-post."I beg your pardon," said the book-keeper, politely."Hartford," said Talbot, in a low tone."They\'ve got the word," said Talbot to himself."Now the responsibility\nrests with them.His face flushed, and his eyes lighted up with joy, as he uttered her\nname.He was deeply in love, and he felt that at last he was in a\nposition to win the consent of the object of his passion.He knew, or,\nrather, he suspected her to be coldly selfish, but he was infatuated.It\nwas enough that he had fulfilled the conditions imposed upon him.In a\nfew days he would be on his way to Europe with the lady of his love.Matters were so arranged that the loss of the twelve thousand dollars\nwould be credited to the burglars.If his\nEuropean journey should excite a shadow of suspicion, nothing could be\nproved, and he could represent that he had been lucky in stock\nspeculations, as even now he intended to represent to Miss Conway.He was not afraid that she would be deeply shocked by his method of\nobtaining money, but he felt that it would be better not to trust her\nwith a secret, which, if divulged, would compromise his safety.Yes, Miss Conway was at home, and she soon entered the room, smiling\nupon him inquiringly."Well," she said, "have you any news to tell me?""Virginia, are you ready to fulfill your promise?"asked Talbot,\neagerly."I make so many promises, you know," she said, fencing."Suppose that the conditions are fulfilled, Virginia?"I dared everything, and I have\nsucceeded.""As you might have done before, had you listened to me."Ten thousand dollars--the amount you required.""We will make the grand\ntour?"She stooped and pressed a kiss lightly upon his cheek.It was a mercenary kiss, but he was so much in love that he felt repaid\nfor the wrong and wickedness he had done.It would not always be so,\neven if he should never be detected, but for the moment he was happy."Now let us form our plans," he said."Will you marry me to-morrow\nevening?"We will call on a clergyman, quietly, to-morrow\nevening, and in fifteen minutes we shall be man and wife.On Saturday a\nsteamer leaves for Europe.I can hardly believe that I shall so soon\nrealize the dreams of years."How can you be spared from your business?""No; not till you are almost ready to start.""It is better that there should be no gossip about it.Besides, your\naunt would probably be scandalized by our hasty marriage, and insist\nupon delay.That\'s something we should neither of us be willing to\nconsent to.""No, for it would interfere with our European trip.""You consent, then, to my plans?""Yes; I will give you your own way this time," said Virginia, smiling."And you will insist on having your own way ever after?""Of course," she said; "isn\'t that right?""I am afraid I must consent, at any rate; but, since you are to rule,\nyou must not be a tyrant, my darling."Talbot agreed to stay to dinner; indeed, it had been his intention from\nthe first.He remained till the city clocks struck eleven, and then took\nleave of Miss Conway at the door.He set out for his boarding-place, his mind filled with thoughts of his\ncoming happiness, when a hand was laid on his arm.He wheeled suddenly, and his glance fell on a quiet man--the detective."You are suspected\nof robbing the firm that employs you."exclaimed Talbot, putting on a bold face,\nthough his heart sank within him."I hope so; but you must accompany me, and submit to a search.If my\nsuspicions are unfounded, I will apologize."I will give you into\ncustody."The detective put a whistle to his mouth, and his summons brought a\npoliceman."Take this man into custody," he said.exclaimed Talbot; but he was very pale."You will be searched at the station-house, Mr.Mary went back to the garden."I hope nothing will be found to criminate you.Talbot, with a swift motion, drew something from his pocket, and hurled\nit into the darkness.The detective darted after it, and brought it back."This is what I wanted," he said."Policeman, you will bear witness\nthat it was in Mr.I fear we shall have to detain\nyou a considerable time, sir."Fate had turned against him, and he was\nsullen and desperate.he asked himself; but no answer suggested\nitself.In the house on Houston street, Bill wasted little regret on the absence\nof his wife and child.Neither did he trouble himself to speculate as to\nwhere she had gone."I\'m better without her," he said to his confederate, Mike."She\'s\nalways a-whinin\' and complainin\', Nance is.If I speak a rough word to her, and it stands to reason a chap can\'t\nalways be soft-spoken, she begins to cry.I like to see a woman have\nsome spirit, I do.""They may have too much," said Mike, shrugging his shoulders."My missus\nain\'t much like yours.If I speak rough to\nher, she ups with something and flings it at my head."Oh, I just leave her to get over it; that\'s the best way.""Why, you\'re not half a man, you ain\'t.Do\nyou want to know what I\'d do if a woman raised her hand against me?""I\'d beat her till she couldn\'t see!"said Bill, fiercely; and he looked\nas if he was quite capable of it."You haven\'t got a wife like mine.""Just you take me round there some time, Mike.If she has a tantrum,\nturn her over to me."He was not as great a ruffian as Bill, and the\nproposal did not strike him favorably.His wife was certainly a virago, and though strong above the average, he\nwas her superior in physical strength, but something hindered him from\nusing it to subdue her.So he was often overmatched by the shrill-voiced\nvixen, who knew very well that he would not proceed to extremities.Had\nshe been Bill\'s wife, she would have had to yield, or there would have\nbeen bloodshed."I say, Bill," said Mike, suddenly, "how much did your wife hear of our\nplans last night?""If she had she would not dare to say a word," said Bill, carelessly."She knows I\'d kill her if she betrayed me," said Bill."There ain\'t no\nuse considerin\' that.""Well, I\'m glad you think so.It would be awkward if the police got wind\nof it.""What do you think of that chap that\'s puttin\' us up to it?""I don\'t like him, but I like his money.""Five hundred dollars a-piece ain\'t much for the risk we run.""If we don\'t find more in the safe, we\'ll bleed him when all\'s over.It was true that Bill was the leading spirit.He was reckless and\ndesperate, while Mike was apt to count the cost, and dwell upon the\ndanger incurred.They had been associated more than once in unlawful undertakings; and\nthough both had served a short term of imprisonment, they had in\ngeneral escaped scot-free.It was Bill who hung round the store, and who received from Talbot at\nthe close of the afternoon the "combination," which was to make the\nopening of the safe comparatively easy."It\'s a good thing to have a friend inside," he said to his confederate."There\'ll be the janitor to dispose of," suggested Mike."Don\'t kill him if you can help it, Bill.Murder has an ugly look, and\nthey\'ll look out twice as sharp for a murderer as for a burglar.He can wake up when we\'re\ngone, but we\'ll tie him so he can\'t give the alarm."Obey\norders, and I\'ll bring you out all right."So the day passed, and darkness came on.The janitor, or watchman, was a sturdy old man, who in early life had\nbeen a sailor.Some accident had made him lame, and this incapacitated\nhim for his early vocation.It had not, however, impaired his physical\nstrength, which was very great, and Mr.Rogers was glad to employ him in\nhis present capacity.When Jack Green--Jack was the name he generally went by--heard of the\ncontemplated burglary, he was excited and pleased.It was becoming\nrather tame to him to watch night after night without interruption, and\nhe fancied he should like a little scrimmage.He even wanted to\nwithstand the burglars single-handed."What\'s the use of callin\' in the police?""It\'s only two men,\nand old Jack is a match for two.""You\'re a strong man, Jack," said Dan, "but one of the burglars is as\nstrong as you are.He\'s broad-shouldered and\nbig-chested.""I ain\'t afraid of him," said Jack, defiantly."Perhaps not, but there\'s another man, too.But Jack finally yielded, though reluctantly, and three policemen were\nadmitted about eight o\'clock, and carefully secreted, to act when\nnecessary.Jack pleaded for the privilege of meeting the burglars first,\nand the privilege was granted, partly in order that they might be taken\nin the act.Old Jack was instructed how to act, and though it was a part\nnot wholly in accordance with his fearless spirit, he finally agreed to\ndo as he was told.It is not necessary to explain how the burglars effected their entrance.This was effected about twelve o\'clock, and by the light of a\ndark-lantern Bill and Mike advanced cautiously toward the safe.At this point old Jack made his appearance, putting on an air of alarm\nand dismay.he demanded, in a tone which he partially succeeded in\nmaking tremulous."Keep quiet, and we will do you no harm."All right; I\'ll do it myself.The word agreed with the information\nthey had received from Talbot.It served to convince them that the\njanitor had indeed succumbed, and could be relied upon.There was no\nsuspicion in the mind of either that there was any one else in the\nestablishment, and they felt moderately secure from interruption."Here, old fellow, hold the lantern while we go to work.Just behave\nyourself, and we\'ll give you ten dollars--shall we, Mike?""Yes," answered Mike; "I\'m agreed.""It\'ll look as if I was helpin\' to rob my master," objected Jack."Oh, never mind about that; he won\'t know it.When all is over we\'ll tie\nyou up, so that it will look as if you couldn\'t help yourself.Jack felt like making a violent assault upon the man who was offering\nhim a bribe, but he controlled his impulse, and answered:\n\n"I\'m a poor man, and ten dollars will come handy.""All right," said Bill, convinced by this time that Jack\'s fidelity was\nvery cheaply purchased.He plumed himself on his success in converting\nthe janitor into an ally, and felt that the way was clear before him."Mike, give the lantern to this old man, and come here and help me."Old Jack took the lantern, laughing in his sleeve at the ease with which\nhe had gulled the burglars, while they kneeled before the safe.It was then that, looking over his shoulder, he noticed the stealthy\napproach of the policemen, accompanied by Dan.Setting down the lantern, he sprang upon the back of Bill as\nhe was crouching before him, exclaiming:\n\n"Now, you villain, I have you!"The attack was so sudden and unexpected that Bill, powerful as he was,\nwas prostrated, and for an instant interposed no resistance."You\'ll repent this, you old idiot!"he hissed between his closed teeth,\nand, in spite of old Jack\'s efforts to keep him down, he forced his way\nup.At the same moment Mike, who had been momentarily dazed by the sudden\nattack, seized the janitor, and, between them both, old Jack\'s life was\nlikely to be of a very brief tenure.But here the reinforcements\nappeared, and changed the aspect of the battle.One burly policeman seized Bill by the collar, while Mike was taken in\nhand by another, and their heavy clubs fell with merciless force on the\nheads of the two captives.In the new surprise Jack found himself a free man, and, holding up the\nlantern, cried, exultingly:\n\n"If I am an old idiot, I\'ve got the better of you, you scoundrels!It was hard for him to give in, but the\nfight was too unequal."Mike," said he, "this is a plant.I wish I had that cursed book-keeper\nhere; he led us into this.""Yes," answered Bill; "he put us up to this."No need to curse him," said Jack, dryly; "he meant you to succeed.""Didn\'t he tell you we were coming to-night?""How did you find it out, then?""It wasn\'t enough; but we should have got more out of him.""Before you go away with your prisoners," said Jack to the policeman, "I\nwish to open the safe before you, to see if I am right in my suspicions.Talbot drew over ten thousand dollars from the bank to-day, and led\nus to think that he deposited it in the safe.I wish to ascertain, in\nthe presence of witnesses, how much he placed there, and how much he\ncarried away.""That cursed book-keeper deceived us, then."Burglar," said old Jack, indifferently."There\'s an\nold saying, \'Curses, like chickens, still come home to roost.\'Your\ncursing won\'t hurt me any.""If my curses don\'t my fists may!"retorted Bill, with a malignant look."You won\'t have a chance to carry out your threats for some years to\ncome, if you get your deserts," said Jack, by no means terrified."I\'ve\nonly done my duty, and I\'m ready to do it again whenever needed."By this time the safe was open; all present saw the envelope of money\nlabeled "$12,000."The two burglars saw the prize which was to have rewarded their efforts\nand risk with a tantalizing sense of defeat.They had been so near\nsuccess, only to be foiled at last, and consigned to a jail for a term\nof years.muttered Bill, bitterly, and in his heart Mike said\namen."Gentlemen, I will count this money before you," said the janitor, as he\nopened the parcel.It resulted, as my readers already\nknow, in the discovery that, in place of twelve thousand, the parcel\ncontained but one thousand dollars."Gentlemen, will you take\nnotice of this?Of course it is clear where the rest is gone--Talbot\ncarried it away with him.""By this time he is in custody," said Jack."Look here, old man, who engineered this thing?""Come here, Dan," said Jack, summoning our hero, who modestly stood in\nthe background.Burglar, this boy is entitled to the credit of\ndefeating you.We should have known nothing of your intentions but for\nDan, the Detective.""Why, I could crush him with one hand.""Force is a good thing, but brains are better," said Jack."Dan here has\ngot a better head-piece than any of us.""You\'ve done yourself credit, boy," said the chief policeman."When I\nhave a difficult case I\'ll send for you.""You are giving me more credit than I deserve," said Dan, modestly."If I ever get out of jail, I\'ll remember you," said Bill, scowling."I\nwouldn\'t have minded so much if it had been a man, but to be laid by the\nheels by a boy like you--that\'s enough to make me sick.""You\'ve said enough, my man," said the policeman who had him in charge.The two prisoners, escorted by their captors, made their unwilling way\nto the station-house.They were duly tried, and were sentenced to a ten\nyears\' term of imprisonment.As for Talbot, he tried to have it believed that he took the money found\non him because he distrusted the honesty of the janitor; but this\nstatement fell to the ground before Dan\'s testimony and that of Bill\'s\nwife.He, too, received a heavy sentence, and it was felt that he only got his\njust deserts.*       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the morning after the events recorded above, Mr.Rogers called Dan\ninto the counting-room."Dan," he said, "I wish to express to you my personal obligations for\nthe admirable manner in which you have managed the affair of this\nburglary.""I am convinced that but for you I should have lost twelve thousand\ndollars.It would not have ruined me, to be sure, but it would have been\na heavy loss.""Such a loss as that would have ruined me," said Dan, smiling."So I should suppose," assented his employer."I predict, however, that\nthe time will come when you can stand such a loss, and have something\nleft.""As there must always be a beginning, suppose you begin with that."Rogers had turned to his desk and written a check, which he handed\nto Dan.This was the way it read:\n\n\n     No.Pay to Dan Mordaunt or order One Thousand Dollars.Dan took the check, supposing it might be for twenty dollars or so.When\nhe saw the amount, he started in excitement and incredulity."It is a large sum for a boy like you,\nDan."But, sir, you don\'t mean all this for me?"It is less than ten per cent on the money you have saved\nfor us.""How can I thank you for your kindness, sir?"By the way, what wages do we pay\nyou?""It is a little better than selling papers in front of the Astor House,\nisn\'t it, Dan?"Now, Dan, let me give you two\npieces of advice.""First, put this money in a good savings-bank, and don\'t draw upon it\nunless you are obliged to."And next, spend a part of your earnings in improving your education.You have already had unusual advantages for a boy of your age, but you\nshould still be learning.It may help you, in a business point of view,\nto understand book-keeping."Daniel journeyed to the garden.Dan not only did this, but resumed the study of both French and German,\nof which he had some elementary knowledge, and advanced rapidly in all.Punctually every month Dan received a remittance of sixty dollars\nthrough a foreign banker, whose office was near Wall street.Of this sum it may be remembered that ten dollars were to be\nappropriated to Althea\'s dress.Of the little girl it may be said she was very happy in her new home.Mordaunt, whom she called mamma,\nwhile she always looked forward with delight to Dan\'s return at night.Mordaunt was very happy in the child\'s companionship, and found the\ntask of teaching her very congenial.But for the little girl she would have had many lonely hours, since Dan\nwas absent all day on business."I don\'t know what I shall do, Althea, when you go to school," she said\none day."I don\'t want to go to school.Let me stay at home with you, mamma.""For the present I can teach you, my dear, but the time will come when\nfor your own good it will be better to go to school.I cannot teach you\nas well as the teachers you will find there.""You know ever so much, mamma."Compared with you, my dear, I seem to know a great deal, but there are\nothers who know much more."Althea was too young as yet, however, to attend school, and the happy\nhome life continued.Mordaunt and Dan often wondered how long their mysterious ward was\nto remain with them.If so, how could that\nmother voluntarily forego her child\'s society?These were questions they sometimes asked themselves, but no answer\nsuggested itself.They were content to have them remain unanswered, so\nlong as Althea might remain with them.The increase of Dan\'s income, and the large sum he had on interest,\nwould have enabled them to live comfortably even without the provision\nmade for their young ward.Dan felt himself justified in indulging\nin a little extravagance."Mother," said he, one evening, "I am thinking of taking a course of\nlessons in dancing.""What has put that into your head, Dan?""Julia Rogers is to have a birthday party in two or three months, and I\nthink from a hint her father dropped to-day I shall have an invitation.I shall feel awkward if I don\'t know how to dance."Tom Carver will be sure to be there, and if I don\'t dance, or if I am\nawkward, he will be sure to sneer at me.""Will that make you feel bad, Dan?""Not exactly, but I don\'t want to appear at disadvantage when he is\naround.If I have been a newsboy, I want to show that I can take the\npart of gentleman as well as he.""Does the ability to dance make a gentleman, Dan?""No, mother, but I should feel awkward without it.I don\'t want to be a\nwall-flower.What do you say to my plan, mother?""Carry it out by all means, Dan.There is no reason why you shouldn\'t\nhold up your head with any of them," and Mrs.Mordaunt\'s eyes rested\nwith pride on the handsome face and manly expression of her son."You are a little prejudiced in my favor, mother," said Dan, smiling."If I were as awkward as a cat in a strange garret, you wouldn\'t see\nit."He selected a\nfashionable teacher, although the price was high, for he thought it\nmight secure him desirable acquaintances, purchased a handsome suit of\nclothes, and soon became very much interested in the lessons.He had a\nquick ear, a good figure, and a natural grace of movement, which soon\nmade him noticeable in the class, and he was quite in demand among the\nyoung ladies as a partner.He was no less a favorite socially, being agreeable as well as\ngood-looking.Mordaunt," said the professor, "I wish all my scholars did me as\nmuch credit as you do."Thank you, sir," said Dan, modestly, but he felt gratified.By the time the invitation came Dan had no fears as to acquitting\nhimself creditably."I hope Tom Carver will be there," he said to his mother, as he was\ndressing for the party.Rogers lived in a handsome brown-stone-front house up town.As Dan approached, he saw the entire house brilliantly lighted.He\npassed beneath a canopy, over carpeted steps, to the front door, and\nrang the bell.The door was opened by a stylish-looking <DW52> man, whose grand air\nshowed that he felt the importance and dignity of his position.As Dan passed in he said:\n\n"Gentlemen\'s dressing-room third floor back."With a single glance through the open door at the lighted parlors, where\nseveral guests were already assembled, Dan followed directions, and went\nup stairs.Entering the dressing-room, he saw a boy carefully arranging his hair\nbefore the glass."That\'s my friend, Tom Carver," said Dan to himself.Tom was so busily engaged at his toilet that he didn\'t at once look at\nthe new guest.When he had leisure to look up, he seemed surprised, and\nremarked, superciliously:\n\n"I didn\'t expect to see _you_ here.""Are you engaged to look after this room?"With all my heart, if you\'ll brush me," answered Dan, partly offended\nand partly amused."Our positions are rather different, I think."You are a guest of Miss Rogers, and so am I.""You don\'t mean to say that you are going down into the parlor?""A boy who sells papers in front of the Astor House is not a suitable\nguest at a fashionable party.""That is not your affair," said Dan, coldly."But it is not true that I\nsell papers anywhere.""And I will again, if necessary," answered Dan, as he took Tom\'s place\nin front of the glass and began to arrange his toilet.Then, for the first time, Tom took notice that Dan was dressed as well\nas himself, in a style with which the most captious critic could not\nfind fault.He would have liked\nto see Dan in awkward, ill-fitting, or shabby clothes.It seemed to him\nthat an ex-newsboy had no right to dress so well, and he was greatly\npuzzled to understand how he could afford it."It is not remarkable that I should be well dressed."So can I," answered Dan, laconically."Do you mean to say that you bought that suit and paid for it?""You are very kind to take so much interest in me.It may relieve your\nmind to see this."Dan took a roll of bills from his pocket, and displayed them to the\nastonished Tom."I don\'t see where you got so much money," said Tom, mystified."I\'ve got more in the bank," said Dan."I mention it to you that you\nneedn\'t feel bad about my extravagance in buying a party suit.""I wouldn\'t have come to this party if I had been you," said Tom,\nchanging his tone."You\'ll be so awkward, you know.You don\'t know any one except Miss\nRogers, who, of course, invited you out of pity, not expecting you would\naccept.""You forget I know you," said Dan, smiling again."I beg you won\'t presume upon our former slight acquaintance," said Tom,\nhastily."I shall be so busily occupied that I really can\'t give you any\nattention.""Then I must shift for myself, I suppose," said Dan, good-humoredly."Go first, if you like," said Tom, superciliously."He doesn\'t want to go down with me," thought Dan."Perhaps I shall\nsurprise him a little;" and he made his way down stairs.As Dan entered the parlors he saw the young lady in whose honor the\nparty was given only a few feet distant.He advanced with perfect ease, and paid his respects."I am very glad to see you here this evening, Mr.Mordaunt," said Julia,\ncordially."I had no idea he would look\nso well."Mentally she pronounced him the handsomest young gentleman present."Take your partners for a quadrille, young gentlemen," announced the\nmaster of ceremonies."Not as yet," answered the young lady, smiling.So it happened that as Tom Carver entered the room, he beheld, to his\nintense surprise and disgust, Dan leading the young hostess to her place\nin the quadrille."I suppose he\nnever attempted to dance in his life.It will be fun to watch his\nawkwardness.I am very much surprised that Julia should condescend to\ndance with him--a common newsboy."At first Tom thought he wouldn\'t dance, but Mrs.Rogers approaching\nsaid:\n\n"Tom, there\'s Jane Sheldon.Accordingly Tom found himself leading up a little girl of eight.There was no place except in the quadrille in which Dan and Julia Rogers\nwere to dance.Tom found himself one of the "sides.""Good-evening, Julia," he said, catching the eye of Miss Rogers."I am too late to be your partner.""Yes, but you see I am not left a wall-flower," said the young lady,\nsmiling.Mordaunt kindly relieved me of that apprehension.""You are fortunate," said Tom, sneering."I leave my partner to thank you for that compliment," said Julia,\ndetermined not to gratify Tom by appearing to understand the sneer."There\'s no occasion," said Tom, rudely."I am glad of it," said Dan, "for I am so unused to compliments that I\nam afraid I should answer awkwardly.""I can very well believe that," returned Tom, significantly.She looked offended rather for she felt that\nrudeness to her partner reflected upon herself.But here the music struck up, and the quadrille began."Now for awkwardness," said Tom to himself, and he watched Dan closely.But, to his surprise, nothing could be neater or better modulated than\nDan\'s movements.Instead of hopping about, as Tom thought he would, he\nwas thoroughly graceful."Where could the fellow have learned to dance?"he asked himself, in\ndisappointment.Julia was gratified; for, to tell the truth, she too had not been\naltogether without misgivings on the subject of Dan\'s dancing, and,\nbeing herself an excellent dancer, she would have found it a little\ndisagreeable if Dan had proved awkward.The quadrille proceeded, and Tom was chagrined that the newsboy, as he\nmentally termed Dan, had proved a better dancer than himself."Oh, well, it\'s easy to dance in a quadrille," he said to himself, by\nway of consolation."He won\'t venture on any of the round dances."But as Dan was leading Julia to her seat he asked her hand in the next\npolka, and was graciously accepted.He then bowed and left her, knowing that he ought not to monopolize the\nyoung hostess.Although Tom had told Dan not to expect any attentions from him, he was\nled by curiosity to accost our hero."It seems that newsboys dance," said he."But it was not in very good taste for you to engage Miss Rogers for the\nfirst dance."Mary went back to the bathroom."Somebody had to be prominent, or Miss Rogers would have been left to\ndance by herself.""There are others who would have made more suitable partners for her.""I am sorry to have stood in your way."I shall have plenty of opportunities of dancing\nwith her, and you won\'t.I suppose she took pity on you, as you know no\nother young lady here."Just then a pretty girl, beautifully dressed, approached Dan.Mordaunt," she said, offering her hand with a beaming\nsmile."Good-evening, Miss Carroll," said Dan.In a minute Dan was whirling round the room with the young lady, greatly\nto Tom\'s amazement, for Edith Carroll was from a family of high social\nstanding, living on Murray Hill."How in the duse does Dan Mordaunt know that girl?"To Tom\'s further disappointment Dan danced as gracefully in the galop as\nin the quadrille.When the galop was over, Dan promenaded with another young lady, whose\nacquaintance he had made at dancing-school, and altogether seemed as\nmuch at his ease as if he had been attending parties all his life.Tom managed to obtain Edith Carroll as a partner."I didn\'t know you were acquainted with Dan Mordaunt," he said."Oh, yes, I know him very well.Why I think he dances _beautifully_,\nand so do all the girls.""How do the girls know how he dances?""Why he goes to our dancing-school.The professor says he is his best\npupil."That\'s fortunate for him," said Tom, with a sneer."Perhaps he may\nbecome a dancing-master in time.""He would make a good one, but I don\'t think he\'s very likely to do\nthat.""It would be a good thing for him.He is as well-dressed as any\nyoung gentleman here."This was true, and Tom resented it.He felt that Dan had no right to\ndress well."He ought not to spend so much money on dress when he has his mother to\nsupport," he said, provoked."It seems to me you take a great deal of interest in Mr.Mordaunt," said\nthe young beauty, pointedly."Oh, no; he can do as he likes for all me, but, of course, when a boy\nin his position dresses as if he were rich one can\'t help noticing it.""I am sure he can\'t be very poor, or he could not attend Dodworth\'s\ndancing-school.At any rate I like to dance with him, and I don\'t care\nwhether he\'s poor or rich."Presently Tom saw Dan dancing the polka with Julia Rogers, and with the\nsame grace that he had exhibited in the other dances.He felt jealous, for he fancied himself a favorite with Julia, because\ntheir families being intimate, he saw a good deal of her.On the whole Tom was not enjoying the party.He did succeed, however, in\nobtaining the privilege of escorting Julia to supper.Just in front of him was Dan, escorting a young lady from Fifth avenue.Mordaunt appears to be enjoying himself," said Julia Rogers."Yes, he has plenty of cheek," muttered Tom."Excuse me, Tom, but do you think such expressions suitable for such an\noccasion as this?""I am sorry you don\'t like it, but I never saw a more forward or\npresuming fellow than this Dan Mordaunt."Mary went back to the bedroom."I beg you to keep your opinion to yourself," said Julia Rogers, with\ndignity."I find he is a great favorite with all the young ladies here.I had no idea he knew so many of them."It seemed to him that all the girls were infatuated with\na common newsboy, while his vanity was hurt by finding himself quite\ndistanced in the race.About twelve o\'clock the two boys met in the dressing-room."You seemed to enjoy yourself," said Tom, coldly."Yes, thanks to your kind attentions," answered Dan, with a smile."It\nis pleasant to meet old friends, you know.By the way, I suppose we\nshall meet at Miss Carroll\'s party.""So the young lady tells me," answered Dan, smiling."I suppose _you\'ll_ be giving a fashionable party next," said Tom, with\na sneer.But Dan\'s dreams were by no means sweet that night.When he reached home, it was to hear of a great and startling\nmisfortune.At half-past twelve Dan ascended the stairs to his mother\'s room.He had\npromised to come in and tell her how he had enjoyed himself at the\nparty.He was in excellent spirits on account of the flattering\nattentions he had received.It was in this frame of mind that he opened\nthe door.What was his surprise, even consternation, when his mother\nadvanced to meet him with tearful eyes and an expression of distress."Oh, Dan, I am so glad you have got home!""I am quite well, Dan; but Althea----"\n\nAnd Mrs.You don\'t mean she is----"\n\nHe couldn\'t finish the sentence, but his mother divined what he meant.she said, "but she has disappeared--she has been\nstolen."Mordaunt told what she knew, but that related only to the\nparticulars of the abduction.We are in a position to tell the reader\nmore, but it will be necessary to go back for a month, and transfer the\nscene to another continent.In a spacious and handsomely furnished apartment at the West End of\nLondon sat the lady who had placed Althea in charge of the Mordaunts.She was deep in thought, and that not of an agreeable nature."I fear," she said to herself, "that trouble awaits me.John Hartley,\nwhom I supposed to be in California, is certainly in London.I cannot be\nmistaken in his face, and I certainly saw him in Hyde Park to-day.I don\'t know, but I fear he did.If so, he will not long\ndelay in making his appearance.Then I shall be persecuted, but I must\nbe firm.He shall not learn through me where Althea is.He is her\nfather, it is true, but he has forfeited all claim to her guardianship.A confirmed gambler and drunkard, he would soon waste her fortune,\nbequeathed her by her poor mother.He can have no possible claim to it;\nfor, apart from his having had no hand in leaving it to her, he was\ndivorced from my poor sister before her death."At this point there was a knock at the door of the room.There entered a young servant-maid, who courtesied, and said:\n\n"Mrs.Vernon, there is a gentleman who wishes to see you.""Yes, mum; he said his name was Bancroft."I know no one of that name," mused the lady."Well, Margaret,\nyou may show him up, and you may remain in the anteroom within call."Her eyes were fixed upon the door with natural curiosity, when her\nvisitor entered.Instantly her face flushed, and her eyes sparkled with anger."I see you know me, Harriet Vernon," he said."It is some time since we\nmet, is it not?I am charmed, I am sure, to see my sister-in-law looking\nso well."He sank into a chair without waiting for an invitation."When did you change your name to Bancroft?"demanded the lady,\nabruptly."Oh," he said, showing his teeth, "that was a little ruse.I feared you\nwould have no welcome for John Hartley, notwithstanding our near\nrelationship, and I was forced to sail under false colors.""It was quite in character," said Mrs.Vernon, coldly; "you were always\nfalse.The slender tie that\nconnected us was broken when my sister obtained a divorce from you.""You think so, my lady," said the visitor, dropping his tone of mocking\nbadinage, and regarding her in a menacing manner, "but you were never\nmore mistaken.You may flatter yourself that you are rid of me, but you\nflatter yourself in vain.""Do you come here to threaten me, John Hartley?""I come here to ask for my child."Where you cannot get at her," answered Mrs."Don\'t think to put me off in that way," he said, fiercely."Don\'t think to terrify me, John Hartley," said the lady,\ncontemptuously."I am not so easily alarmed as your poor wife."Hartley looked at her as if he would have assaulted her had he dared,\nbut she knew very well that he did not dare.He was a bully, but he was\na coward."You refuse, then, to tell me what you have done with my child?"A father has some rights, and the law will not permit\nhis child to be kept from him.""Does your anxiety to see Althea arise from parental affection?"she\nasked, in a sarcastic tone.I have a right to the custody of my\nchild.""I suppose you have a right to waste her fortune also at the\ngaming-table.""I have a right to act as my child\'s guardian," he retorted."Why should you not, John Hartley?You\nill-treated and abused her mother.Fortunately, she escaped from you before it was all gone.But you\nshortened her life, and she did not long survive the separation.It was\nher last request that I should care for her child--that I should, above\nall, keep her out of your clutches.I made that promise, and I mean to\nkeep it.""You poisoned my wife\'s mind against me," he said."But for your cursed\ninterference we should never have separated.""You are right, perhaps, in your last statement.I certainly did urge my\nsister to leave you.I obtained her consent to the application for a\ndivorce, but as to poisoning her mind against you, there was no need of\nthat.By your conduct and your treatment you destroyed her love and\nforfeited her respect, and she saw the propriety of the course which I\nrecommended.""I didn\'t come here to be lectured.You can spare your invectives,\nHarriet Vernon.I was not a model husband,\nperhaps, but I was as good as the average.""If that is the case, Heaven help the woman who marries!""Or the man that marries a woman like you!""You are welcome to your opinion of me.I am entirely indifferent to\nyour good or bad opinion."I don\'t recognize your right to question me on this subject, but I\nwill answer you.He appeared to be occupied with\nsome thought.When he spoke it was in a more conciliatory tone."I don\'t doubt that she is in good hands," he said."I am sure you will\ntreat her kindly.Perhaps you are a better guardian than I. I am willing\nto leave her in your hands, but I ought to have some compensation.""Althea has a hundred thousand dollars, yielding at least five thousand\ndollars income.Probably her expenses are little more than one-tenth of\nthis sum.Give me half her income--say\nthree thousand dollars annually--and I will give you and her no further\ntrouble.""I thought that was the object of your visit," said Mrs."I was right in giving you no credit for parental affection.In regard\nto your proposition, I cannot entertain it.You had one half of my\nsister\'s fortune, and you spent it.You have no further claim on her\nmoney.""Then I swear to you that I will be even with you.I will find the\nchild, and when I do you shall never see her again.""Margaret," she said, coldly, "will you show this gentleman out?""You are certainly very polite, Harriet Vernon," he said."You are bold,\ntoo, for you are defying me, and that is dangerous.You had better\nreconsider your determination, before it is too late.""It will never be too late; I can at any time buy you off," she said,\ncontemptuously."We shall see," he hissed, eying her malignantly.Vernon, when her visitor had been shown out,\n"never admit that person again; I am always out to him.""I wonder who \'twas," she thought, curiously.John Hartley, when a young man, had wooed and won Althea\'s mother.Julia\nBelmont was a beautiful and accomplished girl, an heiress in her own\nright, and might have made her choice among at least a dozen suitors.That she should have accepted the hand of John Hartley, a banker\'s\nclerk, reputed "fast," was surprising, but a woman\'s taste in such a\ncase is often hard to explain or justify.Vernon--strenuously objected to the match, and by so doing gained the\nhatred of her future brother-in-law.Opposition proved ineffectual, and\nJulia Belmont became Mrs.Her fortune amounted to two hundred\nthousand dollars.The trustee and her sister succeeded in obtaining her\nconsent that half of this sum should be settled on herself, and her\nissue, should she have any.John Hartley resigned his position\nimmediately after marriage, and declined to enter upon any business."Julia and I have enough to live upon.If I am\nout of business I can devote myself more entirely to her."This reasoning satisfied his young wife, and for a time all went well.But Hartley joined a fashionable club, formed a taste for gambling,\nindulged in copious libations, not unfrequently staggering home drunk,\nto the acute sorrow of his wife, and then excesses soon led to\nill-treatment.The money, which he could spend in a few years, melted\naway, and he tried to gain possession of the remainder of his wife\'s\nproperty.But, meanwhile, Althea was born, and a consideration for her\nchild\'s welfare strengthened the wife in her firm refusal to accede to\nthis unreasonable demand."You shall have the income, John," she said--"I will keep none back; but\nthe principal must be kept for Althea.""You care more for the brat than you do for me," he muttered."I care for you both," she answered."You know how the money would go,\nJohn."That meddling sister of yours has put you up to this," he said,\nangrily.It is right, and I have decided for myself.""I feel that in refusing I am doing my duty by you.""It is a strange way--to oppose your husband\'s wishes.Women ought never\nto be trusted with money--they don\'t know how to take care of it.""You are not the person to say this, John.In five years you have wasted\none hundred thousand dollars.""It was bad luck in investments," he replied.Investing money at the gaming-table is not\nvery profitable.""Do you mean to insult me, madam?""I am only telling the sad truth, John."She withdrew, flushed and indignant, for she had spirit enough to resent\nthis outrage, and he left the house in a furious rage.When Hartley found that there was no hope of carrying his point, all\nrestraint seemed removed.He plunged into worse excesses, and his\ntreatment became so bad that Mrs.Hartley consented to institute\nproceedings for divorce.It was granted, and the child was given to her.When he returned his wife had died of\npneumonia, and her sister--Mrs.Vernon, now a widow--had assumed the\ncare of Althea.An attempt to gain possession of the child induced her\nto find another guardian for the child.This was the way Althea had\ncome into the family of our young hero.Thus much, that the reader may understand the position of affairs, and\nfollow intelligently the future course of the story.When John Hartley left the presence of his sister-in-law, he muttered\nmaledictions upon her."I\'ll have the child yet, if only to spite her," he muttered, between\nhis teeth."I won\'t allow a jade to stand between me and my own flesh\nand blood.I must think of some plan to circumvent her."He had absolutely no clew, and little money to assist\nhim in his quest.But Fortune, which does not always favor the brave,\nbut often helps the undeserving, came unexpectedly to his help.At an American banker\'s he ran across an old acquaintance--one who had\nbelonged to the same club as himself in years past."What are you doing here, Hartley?"By the way, I was reminded of you not long since.""I saw your child in Union Square, in New York.""Are you sure it was my\nchild?""Of course; I used to see it often, you know."Don\'t _you_ know where she lives?""No; her aunt is keeping the child from me.She was with a middle-aged lady, who evidently\nwas suspicious of me, for she did not bring out the child but once more,\nand was clearly anxious when I took notice of her.""She was acting according to instructions, no doubt.""So do I. Why do they keep _you_ away from her?""Because she has money, and they wish to keep it in their hands," said\nHartley, plausibly.She is living\nhere in London, doubtless on my little girl\'s fortune."John Hartley knew that this was not true, for Mrs.Vernon was a rich\nwoman; but it suited his purpose to say so, and the statement was\nbelieved by his acquaintance."This is bad treatment, Hartley," he said, in a tone of sympathy."What are you going to do about it?""Try to find out where the child is placed, and get possession of her."This information John Hartley felt to be of value.It narrowed his\nsearch, and made success much less difficult.In order to obtain more definite information, he lay in wait for Mrs.Margaret at first repulsed him, but a sovereign judiciously slipped into\nher hand convinced her that Hartley was quite the gentleman, and he had\nno difficulty, by the promise of a future douceur, in obtaining her\nco-operation."If it\'s no harm you mean my\nmissus----"\n\n"Certainly not, but she is keeping my child from me.You can understand\na father\'s wish to see his child, my dear girl.""Indeed, I think it\'s cruel to keep her from you, sir.""Then look over your mistress\' papers and try to obtain the street and\nnumber where she is boarding in New York."Of course you have, sir," said the girl, readily.So it came about that the girl obtained Dan\'s address, and communicated\nit to John Hartley.As soon as possible afterward Hartley sailed for New York."I\'ll secure the child," he said to himself, exultingly, "and then my\nsweet sister-in-law must pay roundly for her if she wants her back."All which attested the devoted love of John Hartley for his child.ALTHEA\'S ABDUCTION.Arrived in New York, John Hartley lost no time in ascertaining where Dan\nand his mother lived.In order the better to watch without incurring\nsuspicion, he engaged by the week a room in a house opposite, which,\nluckily for his purpose, happened to be for rent.It was a front window,\nand furnished him with a post of observation from which he could see who\nwent in and out of the house opposite.Hartley soon learned that it would not be so easy as he had anticipated\nto gain possession of the little girl.She never went out alone, but\nalways accompanied either by Dan or his mother.If, now, Althea were attending school, there\nwould be an opportunity to kidnap her.As it was, he was at his wits\'\nend.Mordaunt chanced to need some small\narticle necessary to the work upon which she was engaged.She might\nindeed wait until the next day, but she was repairing a vest of Dan\'s,\nwhich he would need to wear in the morning, and she did not like to\ndisappoint him."My child," she said, "I find I must go out a little while.""I want to buy some braid to bind Dan\'s vest.He will want to wear it in\nthe morning.""May I go with you, mamma?"You can be reading your picture-book till I come back.Mordaunt put on her street dress, and left the house in the\ndirection of Eighth avenue, where there was a cheap store at which she\noften traded.No sooner did Hartley see her leave the house, as he could readily do,\nfor the night was light, than he hurried to Union Square, scarcely five\nminutes distant, and hailed a cab-driver."Do you want a job, my man?""There is nothing wrong, sir, I hope."My child has been kidnapped during my absence in Europe."She is in the custody of some designing persons, who keep possession\nof her on account of a fortune which she is to inherit.She does not\nknow me to be her father, we have been so long separated; but I feel\nanxious to take her away from her treacherous guardians."I\'ve got a little girl of my own, and I understand\nyour feelings.Fifteen minutes afterward the cab drew\nup before Mrs.Brown\'s door, and Hartley, springing from it, rang the\nbell.Brown was out, and a servant answered the\nbell."A lady lives here with a little girl," he said, quickly."Precisely; and the little girl is named Althea."Mordaunt has been run over by a street-car, and been carried into\nmy house.She wishes the little girl to come at once to her.""I am afraid her leg is broken; but I can\'t wait.Will you bring the\nlittle girl down at once?"Nancy went up stairs two steps at a time, and broke into Mrs."Put on your hat at once, Miss Althea," she said."But she said she was coming right back.""She\'s hurt, and she can\'t come, and she has sent for you."But how shall I know where to go, Nancy?""There\'s a kind gentleman at the door with a carriage.Your ma has been\ntaken to his home."I\'m afraid mamma\'s been killed," she said."No, she hasn\'t, or how could she send for you?"This argument tended to reassure Althea, and she put on her little shawl\nand hat, and hurried down stairs.Hartley was waiting for her impatiently, fearing that Mrs.Mordaunt\nwould come back sooner than was anticipated, and so interfere with the\nfulfillment of his plans."So she calls this woman mamma," said Hartley to himself."Not very badly, but she cannot come home to-night.Get into the\ncarriage, and I will tell you about it as we are riding to her."He hurried the little girl into the carriage, and taking a seat beside\nher, ordered the cabman to drive on.He had before directed him to drive to the South Ferry."She was crossing the street," said Hartley, "when she got in the way of\na carriage and was thrown down and run over."The carriage was not a heavy one, luckily, and\nshe is only badly bruised.She will be all right in a few days."John Hartley was a trifle inconsistent in his stories, having told the\nservant that Mrs.Mordaunt had been run over by a street-car; but in\ntruth he had forgotten the details of his first narrative, and had\nmodified it in the second telling.However, Nancy had failed to tell the\nchild precisely how Mrs.Mordaunt had been hurt, and she was not old\nenough to be suspicious."Not far from here," answered Hartley, evasively."Then I shall soon see mamma.""No, not my own mamma, but I call her so."My papa is a very bad man."I thought this was some of Harriet Vernon\'s work," said Hartley to\nhimself."It seems like my amiable sister-in-law.She might have been in\nbetter business than poisoning my child\'s mind against me."he asked, partly out of curiosity, but mainly\nto occupy the child\'s mind, so that she might not be fully conscious of\nthe lapse of time."Oh, yes; Dan is a nice boy.He has gone to a party\nto-night.""And he won\'t be home till late."I am glad of that," thought Hartley.He goes down town every morning, and he doesn\'t come home\ntill supper time."Hartley managed to continue his inquiries about Dan, but at last Althea\nbecame restless."I don\'t see how mamma could have gone so far.""I see how it is," he said."The cab-driver lost the way, and that has\ndelayed us."Meanwhile they reached the South\nFerry, and Hartley began to consider in what way he could explain their\ncrossing the water.After a moment\'s thought Hartley took a flask from his pocket, into\nwhich he had dropped a sleeping potion, and offered it to the child."Drink, my dear," he said; "it will do you good."It was a sweet wine and pleasant to the taste."It is a cordial," answered Hartley.I will ask mamma to get some."I feel very sleepy," said Althea, drowsily, the potion having already\nbegun to attack her.The innocent and unsuspecting child did as she was directed.She struggled against the increasing drowsiness, but in\nvain."There will be no further trouble," thought Hartley."When she wakes up\nit will be morning.It might have been supposed that some instinct of parental affection\nwould have made it disagreeable to this man to kidnap his own child by\nsuch means, but John Hartley had never been troubled with a heart or\nnatural affections.He was supremely selfish, and surveyed the sleeping\nchild as coolly and indifferently as if he had never before set eyes\nupon her.Two miles and a half beyond the South Ferry, in a thinly settled\noutlying district of Brooklyn, stood a three-story brick house, shabby\nand neglected in appearance, bearing upon a sign over the door the name\n\n\n         DONOVAN\'S\n\n     WINES AND LIQUORS.It was the nightly resort of a set of rough and lawless men, many of\nthem thieves and social outlaws, who drank and smoked as they sat at\nsmall tables in the sand-strewn bar-room.Hugh Donovan himself had served a term at Sing Sing for burglary, and\nwas suspected to be indirectly interested in the ventures of others\nengaged in similar offenses, though he managed to avoid arrest.John Hartley ordered the hackman to stop.He sprang from the carriage,\nand unceremoniously entered the bar-room.Donovan, a short, thickset man\nwith reddish whiskers, a beard of a week\'s growth, and but one\nserviceable eye, sat in a wooden arm-chair, smoking a clay pipe.There\nwere two other men in the room, and a newsboy sat dozing on a settee.Donovan looked up, and his face assumed a look of surprise as he met the\nglance of the visitor, whom he appeared to know.he asked, taking the pipe from\nhis mouth."I have a job for her and for you."I want her taken care of for a few\ndays or weeks.""Shure, the old woman isn\'t a very good protector for a gal.There are reasons--imperative reasons--why the girl\nshould be concealed for a time, and I can think of no other place than\nthis."I have little time for explanation, but I may\ntell you that she has been kept from me by my enemies, who wanted to get\nhold of her money.""Did the old lady leave it all away from you, then?The least I can expect is to be made guardian of my\nown child.Is there no way of getting up stairs\nexcept by passing through the bar-room?"Hartley, we can go up the back way.At the rear of the house was a stair-way, up which he\nclambered, bearing the sleeping child in his arms.Donovan pushed the door open, and disclosed a dirty room, with his\nbetter-half--a tall, gaunt woman--reclining in a rocking-chair,\nevidently partially under the influence of liquor, as might be guessed\nfrom a black bottle on a wooden table near by.She stared in astonishment at her husband\'s companions."Shure, Hugh, who is it you\'re bringin\' here?""It\'s a child, old woman, that you\'re to have the care of.""Divil a bit do I want a child to worrit me.""Will I get the money, or Hugh?""You shall have half, Bridget," said her husband."I will pay ten dollars a week--half to you, and half to your husband,"\nsaid Hartley."Here\'s a week\'s pay in advance," and he took out two\nfive-dollar bills, one of which was eagerly clutched by Mrs."I\'ll take care of her," said she, readily."Shure that\'s a quare name.You can call her any name you like," said\nHartley, indifferently."Perhaps you had better call her Katy, as there\nmay be a hue and cry after her, and that may divert suspicion."Donovan, and she opened the door of a small\nroom, in which was a single untidy bed.I gave her a sleeping potion--otherwise\nshe might have made a fuss, for she doesn\'t know me to be her father."Donovan, I depend upon your keeping her safe.It will not do\nto let her escape, for she might find her way back to the people from\nwhom I have taken her.""Say nothing about me in connection with the matter, Donovan.I will\ncommunicate with you from time to time.If the police are put on the\ntrack, I depend on your sending her away to some other place of\nsecurity."I shall go back to New York at once.I must leave\nyou to pacify her as well as you can when she awakes."I\'ll trate her like my own child," said Mrs.Had Hartley been a devoted father, this assurance from the coarse,\nred-faced woman would have been satisfactory, but he cared only for the\nchild as a means of replenishing his pockets, and gave himself no\ntrouble.The hackman was still waiting at the door."It\'s a queer place to leave a child," thought he, as his experienced\neye took in the features of the place."It appears to be a liquor\nsaloon.However, it is none of\nmy business."Driver, I am ready," said Hartley."Go over Fulton Ferry, and leave me at your stand in Union Square."Hartley threw himself back on the seat, and\ngave himself up to pleasant self-congratulation."I think this will bring Harriet Vernon to terms," he said."She will\nfind that she can\'t stand between me and my child.If she will make it\nworth my while, she shall have the child back, but I propose to see that\nmy interests are secured."The next morning Hartley stepped into an up-town hotel, and wrote a\nletter to his sister-in-law in London, demanding that four thousand\ndollars be sent him yearly, in quarterly payments, in consideration of\nwhich he agreed to give up the child, and abstain from further\nmolestation.ALTHEA BECOMES KATY DONOVAN.The sleeping potion which had been administered to Althea kept her in\nsound sleep till eight o\'clock the next morning.When her eyes opened,\nand she became conscious of her surroundings, she looked about her in\nsurprise.Then she sat up in bed and gazed wildly at the torn wall paper\nand dirty and shabby furniture.The door opened, and the red and inflamed face of Mrs."I want mamma," answered the child, still more frightened."Shure I\'m your ma, child.""No, you are not," said Althea.I sent you away to board, but\nyou\'ve come home to live with your ma."You are a bad woman," returned the child,\nready to cry."It\'s a purty thing for a child to tell her ma she\'s lyin\'.""Don\'t you go\non talkin\' that way, but get right up, or you sha\'n\'t have any\nbreakfast.""Oh, send me back to my mother and Dan!""Dress yourself, and I\'ll see about it," said Mrs.Althea looked for her clothes, but could not find them.In their place\nshe found a faded calico dress and some ragged undergarments, which had\nonce belonged to a daughter of Mrs."Those clothes are not mine," said Althea."I had a pretty pink dress and a nice new skirt.These was the clothes you took off last night,"\nsaid Mrs."I won\'t put this dress on," said the child, indignantly."Then you\'ll have to lay abed all day, and won\'t get nothing to eat,"\nsaid the woman."Shure you\'re a quare child to ask your own mother\'s name."That\'s a quare name intirely.I\'m afraid\nyou\'re gone crazy, Katy."Was it possible that she could be Katy Donovan,\nand that this red-faced woman was her mother?She began to doubt her own\nidentity.She could not remember this woman, but was it possible that\nthere was any connection between them?"I used to live in New York with Mamma Mordaunt.""Well, you\'re livin\' in Brooklyn now with Mamma Donovan.""Shure I shouldn\'t have sent you away from me to have you come home and\ndeny your own mother.""Will you let me go to New York and see Mamma Mordaunt?"asked Althea,\nafter a pause."If you\'re a good girl, perhaps I will.Now get up, and I\'ll give you\nsome breakfast."With a shudder of dislike Althea arrayed herself in the dirty garments\nof the real Katy Donovan, and looked at her image in the cracked mirror\nwith a disgust which she could not repress.Hartley had suggested that her own garments should be taken away in\norder to make her escape less feasible.She opened the door, and entered the room in which Mrs.Donovan had set\nthe table for breakfast.As she came in at one door, Hugh Donovan entered at another."Come here, little gal," he said, with a grin.Althea looked at him with real terror.Certainly Hugh Donovan was not a\nman to attract a child.Althea at once thought of an ogre whom Dan had described to her in a\nfairy story, and half fancied that she was in the power of such a\ncreature."I don\'t want to," said the child, trembling."Go to your father, Katy," said Mrs.Althea shuddered at the idea, and she gazed as if\nfascinated at his one eye."Yes, come to your pa," said Donovan, jeeringly."I like little\ngals--\'specially when they\'re my own.""Yes, you be, and don\'t you deny it.The little girl began to cry in nervous terror, and Donovan laughed,\nthinking it a good joke."Well, it\'ll do after breakfast," he said."Sit up, child, and we\'ll see\nwhat the ould woman has got for us."Donovan did not excel as a cook, but Althea managed to eat a little\nbread and butter, for neither of which articles the lady of the house\nwas responsible.When the meal was over she said:\n\n"Now, will you take me back to New York?""You are not going back at all," said Hugh."You are our little girl,\nand you are going to live with us."Althea looked from one to the other in terror.Was it possible they\ncould be in earnest?She was forced to believe it, and was overwhelmed\nat the prospect.She burst into a tempest of sobs.Hugh Donovan\'s face darkened, and his anger was kindled."Stop it now, if you know what\'s best for yourself!"Althea was terrified, but she could not at once control her emotion.Her husband took it,\nand brandished it menacingly."Yes," said Althea, trembling, stopping short, as if fascinated."Then you\'ll feel it if you don\'t stop your howlin\'."Al']

to whom\npertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the\ngiving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; whose are\nthe fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came."Modern\napostles, extolling Christianity, are found using a different tone: they\nprefer the mediaeval cry translated into modern phrase.But the\nmediaeval cry too was in substance very ancient--more ancient than the\ndays of Augustus.Pagans in successive ages said, "These people are\nunlike us, and refuse to be made like us: let us punish them."The Jews\nwere steadfast in their separateness, and through that separateness\nChristianity was born.A modern book on Liberty has maintained that from\nthe freedom of individual men to persist in idiosyncrasies the world may\nbe enriched.Why should we not apply this argument to the idiosyncrasy\nof a nation, and pause in our haste to hoot it down?There is still a\ngreat function for the steadfastness of the Jew: not that he should\nshut out the utmost illumination which knowledge can throw on his\nnational history, but that he should cherish the store of inheritance\nwhich that history has left him.Every Jew should be conscious that he\nis one of a multitude possessing common objects of piety in the immortal\nachievements and immortal sorrows of ancestors who have transmitted to\nthem a physical and mental type strong enough, eminent enough in\nfaculties, pregnant enough with peculiar promise, to constitute a new\nbeneficent individuality among the nations, and, by confuting the\ntraditions of scorn, nobly avenge the wrongs done to their Fathers.There is a sense in which the worthy child of a nation that has brought\nforth illustrious prophets, high and unique among the poets of the\nworld, is bound by their visions.Yes, for the effective bond of human action is feeling, and the worthy\nchild of a people owning the triple name of Hebrew, Israelite, and Jew,\nfeels his kinship with the glories and the sorrows, the degradation and\nthe possible renovation of his national family.Will any one teach the nullification of this feeling and call his\ndoctrine a philosophy?He will teach a blinding superstition--the\nsuperstition that a theory of human wellbeing can be constructed in\ndisregard of the influences which have made us human.His marriage, according to this, was a pure\nwork of supererogation.It took place about the 5th of April, 1614.It\nis not known who performed the ceremony.How Pocahontas passed her time in Jamestown during the period of her\ndetention, we are not told.Conjectures are made that she was an inmate\nof the house of Sir Thomas Dale, or of that of the Rev.Whittaker,\nboth of whom labored zealously to enlighten her mind on religious\nsubjects.She must also have been learning English and civilized ways,\nfor it is sure that she spoke our language very well when she went to\nLondon.John Rolfe was also laboring for her conversion, and we may\nsuppose that with all these ministrations, mingled with her love of Mr.Rolfe, which that ingenious widower had discovered, and her desire to\nconvert him into a husband, she was not an unwilling captive.Whatever\nmay have been her barbarous instincts, we have the testimony of Governor\nDale that she lived "civilly and lovingly" with her husband.STORY OF POCAHONTAS, CONTINUED\n\nSir Thomas Dale was on the whole the most efficient and discreet\nGovernor the colony had had.One element of his success was no doubt the\nchange in the charter of 1609.By the first charter everything had\nbeen held in common by the company, and there had been no division of\nproperty or allotment of land among the colonists.Under the new regime\nland was held in severalty, and the spur of individual interest began\nat once to improve the condition of the settlement.The character of the\ncolonists was also gradually improving.They had not been of a sort\nto fulfill the earnest desire of the London promoter\'s to spread vital\npiety in the New World.A zealous defense of Virginia and Maryland,\nagainst "scandalous imputation," entitled "Leah and Rachel; or, The\nTwo Fruitful Sisters," by Mr.John Hammond, London, 1656, considers\nthe charges that Virginia "is an unhealthy place, a nest of rogues,\nabandoned women, dissolut and rookery persons; a place of intolerable\nlabour, bad usage and hard diet"; and admits that "at the first\nsettling, and for many years after, it deserved most of these\naspersions, nor were they then aspersions but truths.... There were\njails supplied, youth seduced, infamous women drilled in, the provision\nall brought out of England, and that embezzled by the Trustees."Governor Dale was a soldier; entering the army in the Netherlands as a\nprivate he had risen to high position, and received knighthood in 1606.Shortly after he was with Sir Thomas Gates in South Holland.The States\nGeneral in 1611 granted him three years\' term of absence in Virginia.Upon his arrival he began to put in force that system of industry and\nfrugality he had observed in Holland.He had all the imperiousness of a\nsoldier, and in an altercation with Captain Newport, occasioned by some\ninjurious remarks the latter made about Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer,\nhe pulled his beard and threatened to hang him.Active operations for\nsettling new plantations were at once begun, and Dale wrote to Cecil,\nthe Earl of Salisbury, for 2,000 good colonists to be sent out, for the\nthree hundred that came were "so profane, so riotous, so full of mutiny,\nthat not many are Christians but in name, their bodies so diseased and\ncrazed that not sixty of them may be employed."He served afterwards\nwith credit in Holland, was made commander of the East Indian fleet in\n1618, had a naval engagement with the Dutch near Bantam in 1619, and\ndied in 1620 from the effects of the climate.He was twice married, and\nhis second wife, Lady Fanny, the cousin of his first wife, survived him\nand received a patent for a Virginia plantation.Governor Dale kept steadily in view the conversion of the Indians to\nChristianity, and the success of John Rolfe with Matoaka inspired\nhim with a desire to convert another daughter of Powhatan, of whose\nexquisite perfections he had heard.He therefore despatched Ralph Hamor,\nwith the English boy, Thomas Savage, as interpreter, on a mission to\nthe court of Powhatan, "upon a message unto him, which was to deale with\nhim, if by any means I might procure a daughter of his, who (Pocahuntas\nbeing already in our possession) is generally reported to be his delight\nand darling, and surely he esteemed her as his owne Soule, for surer\npledge of peace."This visit Hamor relates with great naivete.At his town of Matchcot, near the head of York River, Powhatan\nhimself received his visitors when they landed, with great cordiality,\nexpressing much pleasure at seeing again the boy who had been presented\nto him by Captain Newport, and whom he had not seen since he gave him\nleave to go and see his friends at Jamestown four years before; he also\ninquired anxiously after Namontack, whom he had sent to King James\'s\nland to see him and his country and report thereon, and then led the way\nto his house, where he sat down on his bedstead side."On each hand of\nhim was placed a comely and personable young woman, which they called\nhis Queenes, the howse within round about beset with them, the outside\nguarded with a hundred bowmen."The first thing offered was a pipe of tobacco, which Powhatan "first\ndrank," and then passed to Hamor, who "drank" what he pleased and then\nreturned it.The Emperor then inquired how his brother Sir Thomas Dale\nfared, "and after that of his daughter\'s welfare, her marriage, his\nunknown son, and how they liked, lived and loved together."Hamor\nreplied "that his brother was very well, and his daughter so well\ncontent that she would not change her life to return and live with him,\nwhereat he laughed heartily, and said he was very glad of it."Powhatan then desired to know the cause of his unexpected coming, and\nMr.Hamor said his message was private, to be delivered to him without\nthe presence of any except one of his councilors, and one of the guides,\nwho already knew it.Therefore the house was cleared of all except the two Queens, who may\nnever sequester themselves, and Mr.First there\nwas a message of love and inviolable peace, the production of presents\nof coffee, beads, combs, fish-hooks, and knives, and the promise of\na grindstone when it pleased the Emperor to send for it.Hamor then\nproceeded:\n\n"The bruite of the exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being\nfamous through all your territories, hath come to the hearing of your\nbrother, Sir Thomas Dale, who for this purpose hath addressed me hither,\nto intreate you by that brotherly friendship you make profession of, to\npermit her (with me) to returne unto him, partly for the desire which\nhimselfe hath, and partly for the desire her sister hath to see her of\nwhom, if fame hath not been prodigall, as like enough it hath not, your\nbrother (by your favour) would gladly make his nearest companion, wife\nand bed fellow [many times he would have interrupted my speech, which\nI entreated him to heare out, and then if he pleased to returne me\nanswer], and the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly\nunited together, and made one people [as he supposeth and believes] in\nthe bond of love, he would make a natural union between us, principally\nbecause himself hath taken resolution to dwel in your country so long as\nhe liveth, and would not only therefore have the firmest assurance hee\nmay, of perpetuall friendship from you, but also hereby binde himselfe\nthereunto."Powhatan replied with dignity that he gladly accepted the salute of love\nand peace, which he and his subjects would exactly maintain.But as to\nthe other matter he said: "My daughter, whom my brother desireth, I sold\nwithin these three days to be wife to a great Weroance for two bushels\nof Roanoke [a small kind of beads made of oyster shells], and it is true\nshe is already gone with him, three days\' journey from me."Hamor persisted that this marriage need not stand in the way; "that if\nhe pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might, restoring the Roanoke\nwithout the imputation of injustice, take home his daughter again, the\nrather because she was not full twelve years old, and therefore not\nmarriageable; assuring him besides the bond of peace, so much the\nfirmer, he should have treble the price of his daughter in beads,\ncopper, hatchets, and many other things more useful for him."The reply of the noble old savage to this infamous demand ought to have\nbrought a blush to the cheeks of those who made it.He said he loved his\ndaughter as dearly as his life; he had many children, but he delighted\nin none so much as in her; he could not live if he did not see her\noften, as he would not if she were living with the whites, and he\nwas determined not to put himself in their hands.He desired no other\nassurance of friendship than his brother had given him, who had already\none of his daughters as a pledge, which was sufficient while she lived;\n"when she dieth he shall have another child of mine."And then he broke\nforth in pathetic eloquence: "I hold it not a brotherly part of your\nKing, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further\ngive him to understand, that if he had no pledge at all, he should not\nneed to distrust any injury from me, or any under my subjection; there\nhave been too many of his and my men killed, and by my occasion there\nshall never be more; I which have power to perform it have said it; no\nnot though I should have just occasion offered, for I am now old and\nwould gladly end my days in peace; so as if the English offer me any\ninjury, my country is large enough, I will remove myself farther from\nyou."The old man hospitably entertained his guests for a day or two, loaded\nthem with presents, among which were two dressed buckskins, white as\nsnow, for his son and daughter, and, requesting some articles sent him\nin return, bade them farewell with this message to Governor Dale: "I\nhope this will give him good satisfaction, if it do not I will go three\ndays\' journey farther from him, and never see Englishmen more."It\nspeaks well for the temperate habits of this savage that after he had\nfeasted his guests, "he caused to be fetched a great glass of sack, some\nthree quarts or better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven\nyears since, carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all\nthis time spent, and gave each of us in a great oyster shell some three\nspoonfuls."We trust that Sir Thomas Dale gave a faithful account of all this to his\nwife in England.Sir Thomas Gates left Virginia in the spring of 1614 and never returned.After his departure scarcity and severity developed a mutiny, and six\nof the settlers were executed.Rolfe was planting tobacco (he has the\ncredit of being the first white planter of it), and his wife was getting\nan inside view of Christian civilization.In 1616 Sir Thomas Dale returned to England with his company and John\nRolfe and Pocahontas, and several other Indians.They reached Plymouth\nearly in June, and on the 20th Lord Carew made this note: "Sir Thomas\nDale returned from Virginia; he hath brought divers men and women of\nthatt countrye to be educated here, and one Rolfe who married a daughter\nof Pohetan (the barbarous prince) called Pocahuntas, hath brought his\nwife with him into England."On the 22d Sir John Chamberlain wrote to\nSir Dudley Carlton that there were "ten or twelve, old and young, of\nthat country."The Indian girls who came with Pocahontas appear to have been a great\ncare to the London company.In May, 1620, is a record that the company\nhad to pay for physic and cordials for one of them who had been living\nas a servant in Cheapside, and was very weak of a consumption.The same\nyear two other of the maids were shipped off to the Bermudas, after\nbeing long a charge to the company, in the hope that they might there\nget husbands, "that after they were converted and had children, they\nmight be sent to their country and kindred to civilize them."The attempt to educate them in England was not\nvery successful, and a proposal to bring over Indian boys obtained this\ncomment from Sir Edwin Sandys:\n\n"Now to send for them into England, and to have them educated here, he\nfound upon experience of those brought by Sir Thomas Dale, might be far\nfrom the Christian work intended."One Nanamack, a lad brought over by\nLord Delaware, lived some years in houses where "he heard not much of\nreligion but sins, had many times examples of drinking, swearing and\nlike evils, ran as he was a mere Pagan," till he fell in with a\ndevout family and changed his life, but died before he was baptized.Accompanying Pocahontas was a councilor of Powhatan, one Tomocomo, the\nhusband of one of her sisters, of whom Purchas says in his "Pilgrimes":\n"With this savage I have often conversed with my good friend Master\nDoctor Goldstone where he was a frequent geust, and where I have seen\nhim sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of\nhis country and religion.... Master Rolfe lent me a discourse which\nI have in my Pilgrimage delivered.And his wife did not only accustom\nherself to civility, but still carried herself as the daughter of a\nking, and was accordingly respected, not only by the Company which\nallowed provision for herself and her son, but of divers particular\npersons of honor, in their hopeful zeal by her to advance Christianity.I was present when my honorable and reverend patron, the Lord Bishop of\nLondon, Doctor King, entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond\nwhat I had seen in his great hospitality offered to other ladies.At\nher return towards Virginia she came at Gravesend to her end and grave,\nhaving given great demonstration of her Christian sincerity, as the\nfirst fruits of Virginia conversion, leaving here a goodly memory,\nand the hopes of her resurrection, her soul aspiring to see and enjoy\npermanently in heaven what here she had joyed to hear and believe of her\nblessed Saviour.Not such was Tomocomo, but a blasphemer of what he knew\nnot and preferring his God to ours because he taught them (by his own\nso appearing) to wear their Devil-lock at the left ear; he acquainted me\nwith the manner of that his appearance, and believed that their Okee or\nDevil had taught them their husbandry."Upon news of her arrival, Captain Smith, either to increase his own\nimportance or because Pocahontas was neglected, addressed a letter or\n"little booke" to Queen Anne, the consort of King James.This letter is\nfound in Smith\'s "General Historie" ( 1624), where it is introduced\nas having been sent to Queen Anne in 1616.We find no mention of its receipt or of any acknowledgment of\nit.Whether the "abstract" in the "General Historie" is exactly like\nthe original we have no means of knowing.We have no more confidence in\nSmith\'s memory than we have in his dates.The letter is as follows:\n\n"To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene Anne of Great Brittaine."The love I beare my God, my King and Countrie hath so oft emboldened me\nin the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee\npresume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestie this short\ndiscourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues,\nI must be guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee\nthankful."That some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the\npower of Powhaten, their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage\nexceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquaus, the\nmost manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage and\nhis sister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and well-beloved daughter,\nbeing but a childe of twelve or thirteen yeeres of age, whose\ncompassionate pitifull heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause\nto respect her: I being the first Christian this proud King and his grim\nattendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their barbarous power, I\ncannot say I felt the least occasion of want that was in the power of\nthose my mortall foes to prevent notwithstanding al their threats.After\nsome six weeks fatting amongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of\nmy execution, she hazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save\nmine, and not onely that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was\nsafely conducted to Jamestowne, where I found about eight and thirty\nmiserable poore and sicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those\nlarge territories of Virginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore\nCommonwealth, as had the Salvages not fed us, we directly had starved."And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly brought us by\nthis Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant\nFortune turned our Peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not\nspare to dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have been oft appeased,\nand our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to\nimploy her, or the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or\nher extraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am\nsure: when her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought\nto surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the dark night could not\naffright her from comming through the irksome woods, and with watered\neies gave me intilligence, with her best advice to escape his furie:\nwhich had hee known hee had surely slaine her.Jamestowne with her wild\ntraine she as freely frequented, as her father\'s habitation: and during\nthe time of two or three yeares, she next under God, was still the\ninstrument to preserve this Colonie from death, famine and utter\nconfusion, which if in those times had once beene dissolved, Virginia\nmight have laine as it was at our first arrivall to this day.Since\nthen, this buisinesse having been turned and varied by many accidents\nfrom that I left it at: it is most certaine, after a long and\ntroublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father and our\nColonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres longer,\nthe Colonie by that meanes was releived, peace concluded, and at last\nrejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,\nwith whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of\nthat Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe\nin mariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly\nconsidered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding."Thus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestic, what at your\nbest leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done\nin the time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented\nyou from a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet\nI never begged anything of the State, or any, and it is my want of\nabilitie and her exceeding desert, your birth, meanes, and authoritie,\nher birth, vertue, want and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly\nto beseech your Majestic: to take this knowledge of her though it be\nfrom one so unworthy to be the reporter, as myselfe, her husband\'s\nestate not being able to make her fit to attend your Majestic: the most\nand least I can doe, is to tell you this, because none so oft hath tried\nit as myselfe: and the rather being of so great a spirit, however her\nstation: if she should not be well received, seeing this Kingdome\nmay rightly have a Kingdome by her meanes: her present love to us and\nChristianitie, might turne to such scorne and furie, as to divert all\nthis good to the worst of evill, when finding so great a Queene should\ndoe her some honour more than she can imagine, for being so kinde to\nyour servants and subjects, would so ravish her with content, as endeare\nher dearest bloud to effect that, your Majestic and all the Kings honest\nsubjects most earnestly desire: and so I humbly kisse your gracious\nhands."The passage in this letter, "She hazarded the beating out of her owne\nbraines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the\nparagraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;\nand Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up\nhis\n\n"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the\nfirst three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to\nNew England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the\nservice she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect\nof the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there\nSmith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only\none we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she\nhad supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He\nwrites:\n\n"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured\nher face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband\nwith divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself\nto have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to\ntalke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, \'You\ndid promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to\nyou; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the\nsame reason so must I do you:\' which though I would have excused, I\ndurst not allow of that title, because she was a king\'s daughter.With\na well set countenance she said: \'Were you not afraid to come into my\nfather\'s country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and\nfear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and\nyou shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your\ncontrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other\ntill I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek\nyou, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."\'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by\nPowhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they\nand their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make\nnotches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that\ntask.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him\nto show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had\ntold so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had\nheard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably\nnot coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was\nconvinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave\nPowhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave\nme nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they\ndid think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen\nmany English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and\nhe heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,\nas also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both\nat the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but\nthe contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of\ncuriosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,\nand the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson\'s "Christmas his Mask" at court, January\n6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain\nwrites to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father\ncounsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and\nher assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though\nsore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England\nshe does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter\nwriters," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that\nRolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he\nhad not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian\nprincesse."His interest in the colony was never\nthe most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of\nthe Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The\nKing very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was\nsure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that\nyou know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a\nportrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is\ntranslated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,\nEmperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died\non shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved\nby Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the\nLondon edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that\nthe portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The\nportrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:\n\nRound the portrait:\n\n"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:\n\n         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"\nBelow:\n\n"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of\nAttanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian\nfaith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this\nyoung lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have\nsufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her\nown country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the\nEnglish; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,\nof her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at\nGravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably\non the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which\nI cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George\'s Church,\nwhere she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of\nthat church has this record:\n\n\n       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe\n        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent\n     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried\n          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State\nPapers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March\n21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became\nGovernor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that\nunscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the\ncompany.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot\nimagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives\nhave given the country to Mr.Rolfe\'s child, and that they reserve it\nfrom all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some\ndo here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for\nyourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that\nLady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe\'s hands\nin Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and\nMr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had\ncome into Rolfe\'s possession and get satisfaction of him."This George\nSandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish\nEmpire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book\nwritten in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid\'s\n"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his\nmarriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his\nbrother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be\nconverted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own\nindemnity for having brought up John\'s child by Powhatan\'s daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas\nto the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil\npractices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle\nHenry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned\nto Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his\napplication to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the\nIndian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother\'s sister.He left an only\ndaughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by\nwhom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father\nto the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to\nCol.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"\nsays that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an\nesteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,\ngrandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the\ngreat granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with\nfighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;\nhis own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,\nand usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and\nconquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not\ndefined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the\nPotomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he\nalternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of\nwhich at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey\n(York) River.He is said\nto have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the\nyoungest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his\nharem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into\nall his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to\nselect.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:\n"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold\nand stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes\nand attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is\nsupposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how\nmuch more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a\nsad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,\nhanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so\non his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,\nvigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath\nbeen, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and\nthat to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,\nas also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in\nsecurity and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions\nof peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is\nlikewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives\nwhom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,\npresenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,\nor tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on\nburning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put\non such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to\nthe necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)\nthe impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other\nheathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the\nknowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an\ninfused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall\nbe so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on\nearth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the\nappearance and habits of Powhatan\'s subjects, as they were observed\nby Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or\nconjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept\nand conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but\npropitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception\nof an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a\nceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,\nalthough Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the\ndevil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes\ntheir own children.An image of their god which he sent to England\n"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed\nmonster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are\nno other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe\nalso pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief\nthat the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a\nwell-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the\nbetter effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow\'s Relation,"\nquoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"\nunder date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought\na fast day was appointed.The\nexercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to\nprayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the\ndifference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name\nof God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as\nsometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the\nground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never\nobserved the like."Mary journeyed to the bedroom.It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of\nthose in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they\ngot a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth\nand the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either\naccording to the custom of the country or as a defense against the\nstinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says\nStrachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so\ndiscolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth\nhow they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the\nwomen," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming\nit the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden\nquince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient\nBritain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]\nhe or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this\ncollour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not\nyet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their\noyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly\ncommunicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"\nLondon, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their\nchildren are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors\npresently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no\nbeards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at\nthe end; with big lips and wide mouths\', yet nothing so unsightly as\nthe Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty\nhands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as\nbarbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an\nell long."A Puritan divine--"New England\'s Plantation, 1630"--says of\nthe Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before\nlike our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to\nour gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from\nStrachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:\n\n"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in\nthe same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white\nbone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up\nhollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles\' legges, eagles,\nhawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,\nsquirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke\nto the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these\nholes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard\nin length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes\nfamiliarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt\ntyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense\nit bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves\nhis prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight\nagainst the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for\nthe crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is\nsomething pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death\nof his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun\nby the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege\nof moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him\npeace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the\ncruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the\nheart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle\nwords for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of\na gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has\nwoven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later\nwriters have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts\nthat industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and\nunrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters\nin her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the\nappearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so\ninclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt\nto learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those\nwho taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,\nsensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something\nmore than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger\nand a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who\nopposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in\ncivilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight\nof a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural\nto a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than\nefforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the\nwhites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the\nsupport of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on\nsight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed\nwhites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a\nbase violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to\nher situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her\ncaptors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,\nthat her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always\nremains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained\nby the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her\nadopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian\nname she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than\nshe left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre\nof 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she\nmight have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles\nof the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying\nwhen she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all\nhistory, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose\nempire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except\nthe remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.When I read the several\ndates of the tombs, of some that died yesterday, and some six hundred\nyears ago, I consider that great day when we shall all of us be\ncontemporaries, and make our appearance together.JOHN LAWRENCE published "The Clergyman\'s Recreation, shewing the\nPleasure and Profit of the Art of Gardening;" 8vo.Also a poem,\ncalled "Paradise Regained, or the Art of Gardening;" 8vo.The\nsixth edition of "The Clergyman\'s Recreation" has "the effigies of the\nauthor, engraved by Vertue."I have seen eight copies of this sixth\nedition, and in neither of them has this portrait been.No doubt the\ncollecting to form Granger\'s, has deprived each copy of its portrait.This is an expressive portrait, ornamented with a vine wreath, and with\na rich cornucopia or clusters of ripe fruit.The original picture from\nwhich Vertue\'s print was taken, was at Pallion, near Durham, the seat of\nhis grandson, John Goodchild, Esq.In Rodd\'s catalogue of engraved\nportraits, printed a few years ago, was "John Lawrence, prebend of\nSalisbury, _original drawing by Vertue_, price 5s."Lawrence\npublished also, in folio, in 1726, his System of Agriculture and\nGardening.of his Literary Anecdotes, has given\na list of all his works, has preserved a few particulars respecting him,\nand pays a just tribute to him.A list of his works may also be seen in\nWatts\'s Bibl.of Gardening\ninforms us that he was "of a hospitable and benevolent disposition,\ntaking great pleasure in presenting a rich dessert of fruit to his\nfriends."He was presented to the rectory of Yelvertoft,\nNorthamptonshire, in 1703, "by the extraordinary uncommon bounty of a\ngenerous patron."In 1721, he was presented to that of Bishop\'s\nWearmouth, Durham, where he died in 1732.He was also a prebend of\nSalisbury.Lawrence thus enforces the pleasures of a garden, to his own\norder:--"to make them happy by loving an innocent diversion, the\namusements of a garden being not only most delightful to those that love\nthem, but most wholesome to those that use them.A good man knows how to\nrecapitulate all his pleasures in a devout lifting up of his hands, his\neyes and his heart, to the great and bountiful author of nature, who\ngives beauty, relish, and success to all our honest labours."His pen\nlikewise paints with "soft and tempting colours," the extreme beauty of\nour fruit-trees, when clothed with their different coloured blossoms,\n(what Lord Byron calls _the sweet and blooming fruits of\nearth_):--"What a pleasing entertainment is it to the eye, to behold\nthe apricot in its full blossom, white as snow, and at the same time the\npeach with its crimson-coloured blooms; both beginning to be\ninterspersed with green leaves!These are succeeded by the pear, the\ncherry, and the plum, whose blossoms and leaves make a very beautiful\nmixture in the spring; and it cannot be a less pleasant sight to see\nclusters of swelling fruit all the summer, as the earnest of the full\ngratification of another sense in autumn.And now we have come hither,\nwhat painter can draw a landskip more charming and beautiful to the eye,\nthan an old Newington peach-tree laden with fruit in August, when the\nsun has first begun to paint one side of the fruit with such soft and\ntempting colours?The apricot, the pear, the cherry and plum, when they\nappear in plenty as they ought, present themselves to the eye at the\ntime of ripening in very inviting blushes.In short, all the several\nsorts of fruit trees have such pleasing varieties, that were there no\nother sense to be gratified but the sight, they may vie with a parterre\neven of the finest flowers."He thus mentions the month of _July_:--"How\nbeautiful and refreshing are the mornings and evenings of such days,\nwhen the very air is perfumed with pleasant odours, and every thing that\npresents itself to the eye gives fresh occasion to the devout admirer to\npraise and adore the Great Creator, who hath given such wisdom and power\nto man to diversify nature in such various instances, and (for his own\nuse, pleasure, and profit,) to assist her in all her operations."This\nworthy clergyman might have applied to the delights of a garden, the\nsacred words of scripture:--"her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all\nher paths are peace."[75]\n\nALEXANDER POPE.Numerous are the engraved portraits of this graceful and\nharmonious poet.Noble\'s continuation of Granger, gives all, or the\ngreater part of the engravings from his portraits, from which it will be\nseen, that he was drawn by Kneller, by Richardson, by many others, and\nparticularly by his friend Jervas.Pope\'s attachment to him, however, has enshrined\nhis name in glowing lines to future generations.The portraits of Pope\nwhich Jervas drew, were done _con amore_.Jennings, of Cheapside,\nhas prefixed to his elegant folio edition of the "Essay on Man," a\n_whole-length_ of Mr.In Dodsley\'s Collection\nof Poems, vol.Pope, as an\naccompaniment to Mr.John went back to the garden.Dodsley\'s affecting poem to his memory, which he\nentitles _The Cave of Pope_.Surely this bust must have strongly\nresembled Pope, or Mr.The profile\nto Ruffhead\'s Life, in 4to.1769, _must_ have been a likeness, or Bishop\nWarburton would not have permitted its insertion.His age was then\ntwenty-four.It is finely engraved by Ravenet, from Kneller.A copy of this is admirably engraved in Bell\'s Poets,\nrichly ornamented.A copy from that by Richardson is prefixed to\nWarton\'s edition.Among the portraits at _Hagley_, is that of Pope, and\nhis dog Bounce, by Richardson.[76] Lord Chesterfield thus speaks of\nPope:--"His poor, crazy, deformed body, was a mere Pandora\'s box,\ncontaining all the physical ills that ever afflicted humanity.This,\nperhaps, whetted the edge of his satire, and may, in some degree, excuse\nit.I will say nothing of his works; they speak sufficiently for\nthemselves; they will live as long as taste and letters shall remain in\nthis country, and be more and more admired, as envy and resentment shall\nsubside.But I will venture this piece of classical blasphemy: which is,\nthat however he may be supposed to be obliged to Horace, Horace is more\nobliged to him."Ruffhead (generally supposed to have had his\ninformation from Dr.Warburton) thus states:--"Mr.Pope was low in\nstature, and of a diminutive and misshapen figure, which no one\nridiculed more pleasantly than himself.His constitution was naturally\ntender and delicate, and in his temper he was naturally mild and\ngentle, yet sometimes betrayed that exquisite sensibility which is the\nconcomitant of genius.His lively perception and delicate feeling,\nirritated by wretched ill health, made him too quickly take fire, but\nhis good sense and humanity soon rendered him placable.With regard to\nthe extent of his genius, it was so wide and various, that perhaps it\nmay not be too much to say, that he excelled in every species of\ncomposition; and, beside his excellence as a poet, he was both an\nantiquarian and an architect, and neither in an inferior degree.[77] No\nman ever entertained more exalted notions of friendship, or was ever\nmore sincere, steady, warm, and disinterested, in all his attachments.Every inch of his heart was let out in lodgings for his friends."Lord\nOrrery thus speaks of him:--"His prose writings are little less\nharmonious than his verse; and his voice, in common conversation, was so\nnaturally musical, that I remember honest Tom Southern used to call him\nthe Little Nightingale; his manners were delicate, easy, and engaging;\nhe treated his friends with a politeness that charmed, and a generosity\nthat was much to his honour.Every guest was made happy within his\ndoors; pleasure dwelt under his roof, and elegance presided at his\ntable."I\nwill merely select one or two instances.In a letter to _Swift_, he\nsays, "My house is too large; my gardens furnish too much wood and\nprovision for _my_ use.They\nhave intermarried, and are become rather low friends than servants.Would to God you would come over with Lord Orrery, whose care of you in\nthe voyage I could so certainly depend on; and bring with you your old\nhousekeeper, and two or three servants.I have room for all, a heart for\nall, and (think what you will) a fortune for all."In another letter to\nSwift, he says, "I wish you had any motive to see this kingdom.I could\nkeep you; for I am rich, that is, I have more than I want.I can afford\nroom for yourself and two servants.I have, indeed, room enough, nothing\nbut myself at home: the kind and hearty housewife is dead!the agreeable\nand instructive neighbour is gone!yet my house is enlarged, and the\ngardens extend and flourish, as knowing nothing of the guests they have\nlost.I have more fruit trees and kitchen garden than you have any\nthought of; nay, I have good melons and pineapples of my own growth."Allen_, he says, "Let me know your day for coming, and\nI will have every room in my house as warm for you as the owner always\nwould be."Mathias, in his Pursuits of Literature, (besides\nexpatiating with fond delight, in numerous pages, on the genius of\nPope,) thus speaks of him:--"Familiar with the great, intimate with the\npolite, graced by the attentions of the fair, admired by the learned, a\nfavourite with the nation, independent in an acquired opulence, the\nhonourable product of his genius, and of his industry; the companion of\npersons distinguished for their virtue, birth, high fashion, rank, or\nwit, and resident in the centre of all public information and\nintelligence; every avenue to knowledge, and every mode of observation\nwere open to his curious, prying, piercing, and unwearied\nintellect."[78]\n\nOne may with truth further apply to Mr.Pope what was said of Buchanan,\nthat his mind was stored with all the fire, and all the graces of\nancient literature.Pope\'s attachment to _gardens_, appears not only\nin his letter to Martha Blount, describing Sir W. Raleigh\'s seat--but in\nhis own garden at Twickenham, (where, as Mr.Loudon feelingly observes,\n_only the soil of which now remains_)--and in his letter to Mr.Blount,\ndescribing his grotto--but it also bursts forth in many passages\nthroughout his works--and in his celebrated _Guardian_ (No.173), which\nattacks, with the keenest wit, "our study to recede from nature," in our\ngiants made out of yews, and lavender pigs with sage growing in their\nbellies.His epistle to Lord Burlington confirms the charms he felt in\nstudying nature.Mason, in a note to his English Garden, says, "I\nhad before called Bacon the prophet, and Milton, the herald of true\ntaste in gardening.The former, because, in developing the constituent\nproperties of a princely garden, he had largely expatiated upon that\nadorned natural wildness which we now deem the essence of the art.The\nlatter, on account of his having made this natural wildness the leading\nidea in his exquisite description of Paradise.I here call Addison,\n_Pope_, Kent, &c. the champions of this true taste."Mason has\nadded an _&c._, may we not add to these respected names, that of honest\nold Bridgman?It was the determination of Lord Byron (had his life been\nlonger spared), to have erected, at his own expence, a monument to\nPope.[79] We can gather even from his rapid and hurried "Letter on the\nRev.W. L. Bowles\'s Strictures," his attachment to the high name of\nPope:--"If Lucretius had not been spoiled by the Epicurean system, we\nshould have had a far superior poem to any now in existence.As mere\npoetry, it is the first of Latin poems.Pope has not this defect; his moral is as pure as his poetry is\nglorious."--"Pope\'s charities were his own, and they were noble and\nextensive, far beyond his fortune\'s warrant."--"I have loved and\nhonoured the fame and name of that illustrious and unrivalled man, far\nmore than my own paltry renown, and the trashy jingle of the crowd of\nschools and upstarts, who pretend to rival, or even surpass him.Sooner\nthan a single leaf should be torn from _his_ laurel, it were better that\nall which these men, and that I, as one of their set, have ever\nwritten, should\n\n   Line trunks, clothe spice, or, fluttering in a row,\n   Befringe the rails of Bedlam, or Soho.""The most _perfect_ of our poets, and the purest of our moralists."--"He\nis the _moral_ poet of all civilization; and, as such, let us hope that\nhe will one day be the national poet of mankind.He is the only poet\nthat never shocks; the only poet whose _faultlessness_ has been made his\nreproach.Cast your eye over his productions; consider their extent, and\ncontemplate their variety:--pastoral, passion, mock-heroic, translation,\nsatire, ethics,--all excellent, and often perfect.If his great charm be\nhis _melody_, how comes it that foreigners adore him even in their\ndiluted translations?Mason has also farther recorded the resplendent fame of this\ncelebrated man; for in his _Musaeus_, a monody to the memory of Pope, he\ninvokes the shades of Chaucer, Spencer, and Milton, to do homage to his\ndeparting spirit:--\n\n                 ----to cheer thee at this rueful time\n   While black death doth on thy heart-strings prey.So may we greet thee with a nobler strain,\n   When soon we meet for aye in yon star-sprinkled plain.Milton thus begins _his_ homage:--\n\n   Thrice hail, thou heaven-taught warbler, last and best\n   Of all the train!Poet, in whom conjoin\'d\n   All that to ear, or heart, or head, could yield\n   Rapture; harmonious, manly, clear, sublime!Accept this gratulation: may it cheer\n   Thy sinking soul; or these corporeal ills\n   Ought daunt thee, nor appal.Know, in high heav\'n\n   Fame blooms eternal on that spirit divine,\n   Who builds immortal verse."[81]\n\nSir E. Brydges, in his "Letters on the Genius of Lord Byron," thus\ncharacterizes the grace and sweetness of his pathetic powers, in his\n_Eloisa_:--"When either his passions or imaginations _were_ roused, they\nwere deep, strong, and splendid.Notwithstanding _Eloisa_ was an\nhistorical subject, his invention of circumstances of detail, his\nimagery, the changes and turns of passion, the brilliancy of hues thrown\nupon the whole, the eloquence, the tenderness, the fire, the inimitable\ngrace and felicity of language, were all the fruits of creative genius.This poem stands alone in its kind; never anticipated, and never likely\nto be approached hereafter."Young uttered this sublime apostrophe when the death of Pope was first\nannounced to him:--\n\n   _Thou, who couldst make immortals_, art thou dead?Of his _Essay on Man_, the Nouveau Dict.Portatif thus\nspeaks:--"Une metaphysique lumineuse, ornee des charmes de la poesie,\nune morale touchante, dont les lecons penetrent le coeur et\nconvainquent l\'esprit, des peintures vives, ou l\'homme apprend a se\nconnoitre, pour apprendre a deviner meilleur; tels sont les principaux\ncaracteres qui distinguent le poeme Anglois.Son imagination est\negalement sage et feconde, elle prodigue les pensees neunes, et donne le\npiquant de la nouveante, aux pensees anciennes; il embelloit les\nmatieres les plus seches, par la coloris d\'une elocution noble, facile,\nenergeque, variee avec un art infini."In the gardens of Stowe is the following inscription to\n\n                       ALEXANDER POPE,\n           Who, uniting the correctness of judgment\n                    To the fire of genius,\n           By the melody and power of his numbers,\n        Gave sweetness to sense, and grace to philosophy.He employed the pointed brilliancy of his wit\n                    To chastise the vices,\n                 And the eloquence of poetry']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['It was quite dark, and the engineer\nof the freight train waved his arm as a signal of danger; one of\nthe guards, also, showed a red light with his hand lantern, but his\naction either was not seen or was misunderstood, for without any\nreduction of speed being made the engine of the excursion train\nplunged headlong into the disabled goods wagon.The collision was\nso violent as to turn the engine aside off the track and cause it\nto strike the stone pier of a bridge near by, by which it was flung\ncompletely around and then driven up the <DW72> of the cutting, where\nit toppled over like a rearing horse and fell back into the roadway.The tender likewise was overturned; but not so the carriages.They\nrushed along holding to the track, and the side of each as it passed\nwas ripped and torn by the projecting end of the goods wagon.Of the twenty-three carriages and vans in the train scarcely one\nescaped damage, while the more forward ones were in several cases\nlifted one on top of the other or forced partly up the <DW72> of\nthe cutting, whence they fell back again, crushing the passengers\nbeneath them.This accident occurred on the 21st of June, 1870; it was very\nthoroughly investigated by Captain Tyler on behalf of the Board of\nTrade, with the apparent conclusion that it was one which could\nhardly have been guarded against.The freight cars, the broken\naxle of which occasioned the disaster, did not belong to the Great\nNorthern company, and the wheels of the train had been properly\nexamined by viewing and tapping at the several stopping-places; the\nflaw which led to the fracture was, however, of such a nature that\nit could have been detected only by the removal of the wheel.It did\nnot appear that the employés of the company had been guilty of any\nnegligence; and it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the\naccident was due to one of those defects to which the results of\neven the most perfect human workmanship must ever remain liable, and\nthis had revealed itself under exactly those conditions which must\ninvolve the most disastrous consequences.The English accident did, however, establish one thing, if nothing\nelse; it showed the immeasurable superiority of the system of\ninvestigation pursued in the case of railroad accidents in England\nover that pursued in this country.There a trained expert after\nthe occurrence of each disaster visits the spot and sifts the\naffair to the very bottom, locating responsibility and pointing out\ndistinctly the measures necessary to guard against its repetition.Here the case ordinarily goes to a coroner\'s jury, the findings of\nwhich as a rule admirably sustain the ancient reputation of that\naugust tribunal.It is absolutely sad to follow the course of these\ninvestigations, they are conducted with such an entire disregard of\nmethod and lead to such inadequate conclusions.Indeed, how could it\nbe otherwise?--The same man never investigates two accidents, and,\nfor the one investigation he does make, he is competent only in his\nown esteem.Take the New Hamburgh accident as an example.Rarely has any\ncatastrophe merited a more careful investigation, and few\nindeed have ever called forth more ill-considered criticism or\ncrude suggestions.Almost nothing of interest respecting it was\nelicited at the inquest, and now no reliable criticism can be\nventured upon it.The question of responsibility in that case,\nand of prevention thereafter, involved careful inquiry into at\nleast four subjects:--First, the ownership and condition of the\nfreight car, the fractured axle of which occasioned the disaster,\ntogether with the precautions taken by the company, usually and in\nthis particular case, to test the wheels of freight cars moving\nover its road, especially during times of severe cold.--Second,\nthe conduct of those in charge of the freight train immediately\npreceding and at the time of the accident; was the fracture of the\naxle at once noticed and were measures taken to stop the train, or\nwas the derailment aggravated by neglect into the form it finally\ntook?--Third, was there any neglect in signaling the accident on\nthe part of those in charge of the disabled train, and how much\ntime elapsed between the accident and the collision?--Fourth, what,\nif any, improved appliances would have enabled those in charge\nof either train to have averted the accident?--and what, if any,\ndefects either in the rules or the equipment in use were revealed?No satisfactory conclusion can now be arrived at upon any of these\npoints, though the probabilities are that with the appliances since\nintroduced the train might have been stopped in time.In this case,\nas in that at Claybridge, the coroner\'s jury returned a verdict\nexonerating every one concerned from responsibility, and very\npossibly they were justified in so doing; though it is extremely\nquestionable whether Captain Tyler would have arrived at a similar\nconclusion.There is a strong probability that the investigation\nwent off, so to speak, on a wholly false issue,--turned on the\ndraw-bridge frenzy instead of upon the question of care.So far\nas the verdict declared that the disaster was due to a collision\nbetween a passenger train and a derailed oil car, and not to the\nexistence of a draw in the bridge on which it happened to occur, it\nwas, indeed, entitled to respect, and yet it was on this very point\nthat it excited the most criticism.Loud commendation was heard\nthrough the press of the Connecticut law, which had been in force\nfor twenty years, and, indeed, still is in force there, under which\nall trains are compelled to come to a full stop before entering\non any bridge which has a draw in it,--a law which may best be\ndescribed as a useless nuisance.Yet the grand jury of the Court of\nOyer and Terminer of New York city even went so far as to recommend,\nin a report made by it on the 23d of February, 1871,--sixteen days\nafter the accident,--the passage by the legislature then in session\nat Albany of a similar legal absurdity.Fortunately better counsels\nprevailed, and, as the public recovered its equilibrium, the matter\nwas allowed to drop.The Connecticut law in question, however, originated in an accident\nwhich at the time had startled and shocked the community as much\neven as that at Versailles did before or that at Abergele has since\ndone.It occurred to an express train on the New York & New Haven\nroad at Norwalk, in Connecticut, on the 6th of May, 1853.CHAPTER X.\n\nTHE NORWALK ACCIDENT.The railroad at Norwalk crosses a small inlet of Long Island Sound\nby means of a draw-bridge, which is approached from the direction\nof New York around a sharp curve.A ball at the mast-head was in\n1853 the signal that the draw was open and the bridge closed to\nthe passage of trains.The express passenger train for Boston,\nconsisting of a locomotive and two baggage and five passenger cars,\ncontaining about one hundred and fifty persons, left New York as\nusual at eight o\'clock that morning.The locomotive was not in\ncharge of its usual engine-driver but of a substitute named Tucker;\na man who some seven years before had been injured in a previous\ncollision on the same road, for which he did not appear to have\nbeen in any way responsible, but who had then given up his position\nand gone to California, whence he had recently returned and was now\nagain an applicant for an engineer\'s situation.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.This was his third\ntrip over the road, as substitute.In approaching the bridge at\nNorwalk he apparently wholly neglected to look for the draw-signal.He was running his train at about the usual rate of speed, and\nfirst became aware that the draw was open when within four hundred\nfeet of it and after it had become wholly impossible to stop the\ntrain in time.He immediately whistled for brakes and reversed his\nengine, and then, without setting the brake on his tender, both he\nand the fireman sprang off and escaped with trifling injuries.The\ntrain at this time did not appear to be moving at a speed of over\nfifteen miles an hour.The draw was sixty feet in width; the water\nin the then state of the tide was about twelve feet deep, and the\nsame distance below the level of the bridge.Although the speed\nof the train had been materially reduced, yet when it came to the\nopening it was still moving with sufficient impetus to send its\nlocomotive clean across the sixty foot interval and to cause it to\nstrike the opposite abutment about eight feet below the track; it\nthen fell heavily to the bottom.The tender lodged on top of the\nlocomotive, bottom up and resting against the pier, while on top\nof this again was the first baggage car.The second baggage car,\nwhich contained also a compartment for smokers, followed, but in\nfalling was canted over to the north side of the draw in such a way\nas not to be wholly submerged, so that most of those in it were\nsaved.The first passenger car next plunged into the opening; its\nforward end crushed in, as it fell against the baggage car in front\nof it, while its rear end dropped into the deep water below; and\non top of it came the second passenger car, burying the passengers\nin the first beneath the _débris_, and itself partially submerged.The succeeding or third passenger car, instead of following the\nothers, broke in two in the middle, the forward part hanging down\nover the edge of the draw, while the rear of it rested on the track\nand stayed the course of the remainder of the train.Including those\nin the smoking compartment more than a hundred persons were plunged\ninto the channel, of whom forty-six lost their lives, while some\nthirty others were more or less severely injured.The killed were\nmainly among the passengers in the first car; for, in falling, the\nroof of the second car was split open, and it finally rested in such\na position that, as no succeeding car came on top of it, many of\nthose in it were enabled to extricate themselves; indeed, more than\none of the passengers in falling were absolutely thrown through the\naperture in the roof, and, without any volition on their part, were\nsaved with unmoistened garments.Shocking as this catastrophe was, it was eclipsed in horror by\nanother exactly similar in character, though from the peculiar\ncircumstances of the case it excited far less public notice, which\noccurred eleven years later on the Grand Trunk railway of Canada.In this case a large party of emigrants, over 500 in number and\nchiefly Poles, Germans and Norwegians of the better class, had\nlanded at Quebec and were being forwarded on a special train to\ntheir destination in the West.With their baggage they filled\nthirteen cars.The Grand Trunk on the way to Montreal crosses the\nRichelieu river at Beloeil by an iron bridge, in the westernmost\nspan of which was a draw over the canal, some 45 feet below it.Both\nby law and under the running rules of the road all trains were to\ncome to a dead stand on approaching the bridge, and to proceed only\nwhen the safety signal was clearly discerned.This rule, however,\nas it appeared at the subsequent inquest, had been systematically\ndisobeyed, it having been considered sufficient if the train was\n"slowed down."In the present case, however--the night of June 29,\n1864,--though the danger signal was displayed and in full sight\nfor a distance of 1,600 feet, the engine-driver, unfamiliar with\nthe road and its signals, failed to see it, and, without slowing\nhis train even, ran directly onto the bridge.He became aware of\nthe danger when too late to stop.The draw was open to permit the\npassage of a steamer with six barges in tow, one of which was\ndirectly under the opening.The whole train went through the draw,\nsinking the barge and piling itself up in the water on top of it.The three last cars, falling on the accumulated wreck, toppled over\nupon the west embankment and were thus less injured than the others.The details of the accident were singularly distressing."As soon\nas possible a strong cable was attached to the upper part of the\npiling, and by this means two cars, the last of the ill-fated train,\nwere dragged onto the wharf under the bridge.A shapeless blue mass of hands and heads and feet\nprotruded among the splinters and frame-work, and gradually resolved\nitself into a closely-packed mass of human beings, all ragged and\nbloody and dinted from crown to foot with blue bruises and weals\nand cuts inflicted by the ponderous iron work, the splinters and\nthe enormous weight of the train.* * * A great many of the dead\nhad evidently been asleep; the majority of them had taken off their\nboots and coats in the endeavor to make themselves as comfortable\nas possible.They lay heaped upon one another like sacks, dressed\nin the traditional blue clothing of the German people.* * * A\nchild was got at and removed nine hours after the accident, being\nuninjured in its dead mother\'s arms."The accident happened at 2 A.M., and before sundown of the next day\n86 bodies had been taken out of the canal; others were subsequently\nrecovered, and yet more died from their hurts.It was altogether a disaster of the most\nappalling description, in extenuation of which nothing was to\nbe said.It befell, however, a body of comparatively friendless\nemigrants, and excited not a tithe of the painful interest which yet\nattaches to the similar accident to the Boston express at Norwalk.These terrible disasters were both due, not alone to the\ncarelessness of the two engine-drivers, but to the use of a crude\nand inadequate system of signals.It so happened, however, that\nthe legislature of Connecticut was unfortunately in session at the\ntime of the Norwalk disaster, and consequently the public panic\nand indignation took shape in a law compelling every train on\nthe railroads of that state to come to a dead stand-still before\nentering upon any bridge in which there was a draw.This law is\nstill in force, and from time to time, as after the New Hamburg\ncatastrophe, an unreasoning clamor is raised for it in other\nstates.In point of fact it imposes a most absurd, unnecessary and\nannoying delay on travel, and rests upon the Connecticut statute\nbook a curious illustration of what usually happens when legislators\nundertake to incorporate running railroad regulations into the\nstatutes-at-large.It is of a par with another law, which has for\nmore than twenty-five years been in force in Connecticut\'s sister\nstate of Massachusetts, compelling in all cases where the tracks of\ndifferent companies cross each other at a level the trains of each\ncompany to stop before reaching the crossing, and then to pass over\nit slowly.The danger of collision at crossings is undoubtedly much\ngreater than that of going through open draws.Precautions against\ndanger in each case are unquestionably proper and they cannot be\ntoo perfect, but to have recourse to stopping either in the one\ncase or the other simply reveals an utter ignorance of the great\nadvance which has been made in railroad signals and the science of\ninterlocking.In both these cases it is, indeed, entitled to just\nabout the same degree of respect as would be a proposal to recur to\npioneer engines as a means of preventing accidents to night trains.The machinery by means of which both draws and grade crossings\ncan be protected, will be referred to in another connection,[7]\nmeanwhile it is a curious fact that neither at grade crossings\nnor at draws has the mere stopping of trains proved a sufficient\nprotection.Several times in the experience of Massachusetts\' roads\nhave those in charge of locomotives, after stopping and while moving\nat a slow rate of speed, actually run themselves into draws with\ntheir eyes open, and afterwards been wholly unable to give any\nsatisfactory explanation of their conduct.But the insufficiency\nof stopping as a reliable means of prevention was especially\nillustrated in the case of an accident which occurred upon the\nBoston & Maine railroad on the morning of the 21st of November,\n1862, when the early local passenger train was run into the open\ndraw of the bridge almost at the entrance to the Boston station.It\nso happened that the train had stopped at the Charlestown station\njust before going onto the bridge, and at the time the accident\noccurred was moving at a speed scarcely faster than a man could\nwalk; and yet the locomotive was entirely submerged, as the water\nat that point is deep, and the only thing which probably saved the\ntrain was that the draw was so narrow and the cars were so long that\nthe foremost one lodged across the opening, and its forward end only\nwas beneath the water.At the rate at which the train was moving\nthe resistance thus offered was sufficient to stop it, though, even\nas it was, no less than six persons lost their lives and a much\nlarger number were more or less injured.Here all the precautions\nimposed by the Connecticut law were taken, and served only to\nreveal the weak point in it.The accident was due to the neglect of\nthe corporation in not having the draw and its system of signals\ninterlocked in such a way that the movement of the one should\nautomatically cause a corresponding movement of the other; and this\nneglect in high quarters made it possible for a careless employé to\nopen the draw on a particularly dark and foggy morning, while he\nforgot at the same time to shift his signals.An exactly similar\ninstance of carelessness on the part of an employé resulted in the\nderailment of a train upon the Long Branch line of the Central Road\nof New Jersey at the Shrewsbury river draw on August 9, 1877.In\nthis case the safety signal was shown while the draw fastening had\nbeen left unsecured.The jar of the passing train threw the draw\nslightly open so as to disconnect the tracks; thus causing the\nderailment of the train, which subsequently plunged over the side\nof the bridge.Fortunately the tide was out, or there would have\nbeen a terrible loss of life; as it was, some seventy persons were\ninjured, five of whom subsequently died.This accident also, like\nthat on the Boston & Maine road in 1862, very forcibly illustrated\nthe necessity of an interlocking apparatus.The safety signal was\nshown before the draw was secured, which should have been impossible.[7] Chapters XVII and XVIII.Prior to the year 1873 there is no consecutive record of this or\nany other class of railroad accidents occurring in America, but\nduring the six years 1873-8 there occurred twenty-one cases of\nminor disaster at draws, three only of them to passenger trains.Altogether, excluding the Shrewsbury river accident, these resulted\nin the death of five employés and injury to one other.In Great Britain not a single case of disaster of any\ndescription has been reported as occurring at a draw-bridge since\nthe year 1870, when the present system of official Board of Trade\nreports was begun.The lesson clearly to be drawn from a careful\ninvestigation of all the American accidents reported would seem to\nbe that a statute provision making compulsory the interlocking of\nall draws in railroad bridges with a proper and infallible system\nof signals might have claims on the consideration of an intelligent\nlegislature; not so an enactment which compels the stopping of\ntrains at points where danger is small, and makes no provision as\nrespects other points where it is great.Great as were the terrors inspired by the Norwalk disaster in those\ncomparatively early days of railroad experience, and deep as the\nimpression on the public memory must have been to leave its mark\non the statute book even to the present time, that and the similar\ndisaster at the Richelieu river are believed to have been the only\ntwo of great magnitude which have occurred at open railroad draws.That this should be so is well calculated to excite surprise,\nfor the draw-bridge precautions against accident in America are\nwretchedly crude and inadequate, amounting as a rule to little more\nthan the primitive balls and targets by day and lanterns by night,\nwithout any system of alarms or interlocking.Electricity as an\nadjunct to human care, or a corrective rather of human negligence,\nis almost never used; and, in fact, the chief reliance is still on\nthe vigilance of engine-drivers.But, if accidents at draws have\nbeen comparatively rare and unattended with any considerable loss\nof life, it has been far otherwise with the rest of the structures\nof which the draw forms a part.Bridge accidents in fact always\nhave been, and will probably always remain, incomparably the worst\nto which travel by rail is exposed.It would be impossible for\ncorporations to take too great precautions against them, and that\nthe precautions taken are very great is conclusively shown by the\nfact that, with thousands of bridges many times each day subjected\nto the strain of the passage at speed of heavy trains, so very few\ndisasters occur.When they do occur, however, the lessons taught\nby them are, though distinct enough, apt to be in one important\nrespect of a far less satisfactory character than those taught by\ncollisions.In the case of these last the great resultant fact\nspeaks for itself.The whole community knows when it sees a block\nsystem, or a stronger car construction, or an improved train brake\nsuddenly introduced that the sacrifice has not been in vain--that\nthe lesson has been learned.It is by no means always so in the\ncase of accidents on bridges.With these the cause of disaster\nis apt to be so scientific in its nature that it cannot even be\ndescribed, except through the use of engineering terms which to the\nmass of readers are absolutely incomprehensible.The simplest of\nrailroad bridges is an inexplicable mystery to at least ninety-nine\npersons out of each hundred.Even when the cause of disaster is\nunderstood, the precautions taken against its recurrence cannot be\nseen.From the nature of the case they must consist chiefly of a\nbetter material, or a more scientific construction, or an increased\nwatchfulness on the part of officials and subordinates.This,\nhowever, is not apparent on the surface, and, when the next accident\nof the same nature occurs, the inference, as inevitable as it is\nusually unjust, is at once drawn that the one which preceded it\nhad been productive of no results.The truth of this was strongly\nillustrated by the two bridge accidents which happened, the one at\nAshtabula, Ohio, on the 29th of December, 1876, and the other at\nTariffville, Connecticut, on the 15th of January, 1878.There has been no recent disaster which combined more elements\nof horror or excited more widespread public emotion than that at\nAshtabula bridge.It was, indeed, so terrible in its character and\nso heart-rending in its details, that for the time being it fairly\ndivided the attention of the country with that dispute over the\npresidential succession, then the subject uppermost in the minds of\nall.A blinding northeasterly snow-storm, accompanied by a heavy\nwind, prevailed throughout the day which preceded the accident,\ngreatly impeding the movement of trains.The Pacific express over\nthe Michigan Southern & Lake Shore road had left Erie, going west,\nconsiderably behind its time, and had been started only with great\ndifficulty and with the assistance of four locomotives.It was due\nat Ashtabula at about 5.30 o\'clock P.M., but was three hours late,\nand, the days being then at their shortest, when it arrived at the\nbridge which was the scene of the accident the darkness was so great\nthat nothing could be seen through the driving snow by those on the\nleading locomotive even for a distance of 50 feet ahead.The train\nwas made up of two heavy locomotives, four baggage, mail and express\ncars, one smoking car, two ordinary coaches, a drawing-room car\nand three sleepers, being in all two locomotives and eleven cars,\nin the order named, containing, as nearly as can be ascertained,\n190 human beings, of whom 170 were passengers.Ashtabula bridge is\nsituated only about 1,000 feet east of the station of the same name,\nand spans a deep ravine, at the bottom of which flows a shallow\nstream, some two or three feet in depth, which empties into Lake\nErie a mile or two away.The bridge was an iron Howe truss of 150\nfeet span, elevated 69 feet above the bottom of the ravine, and\nsupported at either end by solid masonwork abutments.As the train approached the bridge it had\nto force its way through a heavy snow-drift, and, when it passed\nonto it, it was moving at a speed of some twelve or fourteen miles\nan hour.The entire length of the bridge afforded space only for\ntwo of the express cars at most in addition to the locomotives,\nso that when the wheels of the leading locomotive rested on the\nwestern abutment of the bridge nine of the eleven cars which made up\nthe train, including all those in which there were passengers, had\nyet to reach its eastern end.At the instant when the train stood\nin this position, the engineer of the leading locomotive heard a\nsudden cracking sound apparently beneath him, and thought he felt\nthe bridge giving way.Instantly pulling the throttle valve wide\nopen, his locomotive gave a spring forward and, as it did so, the\nbridge fell, the rear wheels of his tender falling with it.The\njerk and impetus of the locomotive, however, sufficed to tear out\nthe coupling, and as his tender was dragged up out of the abyss\nonto the track, though its rear wheels did not get upon the rails,\nthe frightened engineer caught a fearful glimpse of the second\nlocomotive as it seemed to turn and then fall bottom upwards into\nthe ravine.The bridge had given way, not at once but by a slowly\nsinking motion, which began at the point where the pressure was\nheaviest, under the two locomotives and at the west abutment.There\nbeing two tracks, and this train being on the southernmost of the\ntwo, the southern truss had first yielded, letting that side of\nthe bridge down, and rolling, as it were, the second locomotive\nand the cars immediately behind it off to the left and quite clear\nof a straight line drawn between the two abutments; then almost\nimmediately the other truss gave way and the whole bridge fell, but\nin doing so swung slightly to the right.Before this took place the\nentire train with the exception of the last two sleepers had reached\nthe chasm, each car as it passed over falling nearer than the one\nwhich had preceded it to the east abutment, and finally the last two\nsleepers came, and, without being deflected from their course at\nall, plunged straight down and fell upon the wreck of the bridge at\nits east end.It was necessarily all the work of a few seconds.At the bottom of the ravine the snow lay waist deep and the stream\nwas covered with ice some eight inches in thickness.Upon this\nwere piled up the fallen cars and engine, the latter on top of the\nformer near the western abutment and upside down.All the passenger\ncars were heated by stoves.At first a dead silence seemed to\nfollow the successive shocks of the falling mass.In less than\ntwo minutes, however, the fire began to show itself and within\nfifteen the holocaust was at its height.As usual, it was a mass of\nhuman beings, all more or less stunned, a few killed, many injured\nand helpless, and more yet simply pinned down to watch, in the\npossession as full as helpless of all their faculties, the rapid\napproach of the flames.The number of those killed outright seems\nto have been surprisingly small.In the last car, for instance,\nno one was lost.This was due to the energy and presence of mind\nof the porter, a <DW64> named Steward, who, when he felt the car\nresting firmly on its side, broke a window and crawled through it,\nand then passed along breaking the other windows and extricating\nthe passengers until all were gotten out.Those in the other cars\nwere far less fortunate.Though an immediate alarm had been given\nin the neighboring town, the storm was so violent and the snow so\ndeep that assistance arrived but slowly.Nor when it did arrive\ncould much be effected.The essential thing was to extinguish the\nflames.The means for so doing were close at hand in a steam pump\nbelonging to the railroad company, while an abundance of hose could\nhave been procured at another place but a short distance off.In\nthe excitement and agitation of the moment contradictory orders\nwere given, even to forbidding the use of the pump, and practically\nno effort to extinguish the fire was made.Within half an hour of\nthe accident the flames were at their height, and when the next\nmorning dawned nothing remained in the ravine but a charred and\nundistinguishable mass of car trucks, brake-rods, twisted rails and\nbent and tangled bridge iron, with the upturned locomotive close to\nthe west abutment.In this accident some eighty persons are supposed to have lost\ntheir lives, while over sixty others were injured.The exact number\nof those killed can never be known, however, as more than half of\nthose reported were utterly consumed in the fire; indeed, even of\nthe bodies recovered scarcely one half could be identified.Of the\ncause of the disaster much was said at the time in language most\nunnecessarily scientific;--but little was required to be said.It\nadmitted of no extenuation.An iron bridge, built in the early days\nof iron-bridges,--that which fell under the train at Ashtabula, was\nfaulty in its original construction, and the indications of weakness\nit had given had been distinct, but had not been regarded.That it\nhad stood so long and that it should have given way when it did,\nwere equally matters for surprise.A double track bridge, it should\nnaturally have fallen under the combined pressure of trains moving\nsimultaneously in opposite directions.The strain under which it\nyielded was not a particularly severe one, even taken in connection\nwith the great atmospheric pressure of the storm then prevailing.It was, in short, one of those disasters, fortunately of infrequent\noccurrence, with which accident has little if any connection.It was due to original inexperience and to subsequent ignorance\nor carelessness, or possibly recklessness as criminal as it was\nfool-hardy.Besides being a bridge accident, this was also a stove accident,--in\nthis respect a repetition of Angola.One of the most remarkable\nfeatures about it, indeed, was the fearful rapidity with which\nthe fire spread, and the incidents of its spread detailed in the\nsubsequent evidence of the survivors were simply horrible.Men,\nwomen and children, full of the instinct of self-preservation, were\ncaught and pinned fast for the advancing flames, while those who\ntried to rescue them were driven back by the heat and compelled\nhelplessly to listen to their shrieks.It is, however, unnecessary\nto enter into these details, for they are but the repetition of\nan experience which has often been told, and they do but enforce\na lesson which the railroad companies seem resolved not to learn.Unquestionably the time in this country will come when through\ntrains will be heated from a locomotive or a heating-car.That time,\nhowever, had not yet come.Meanwhile the evidence would seem to show\nthat at Ashtabula, as at Angola, at least two lives were sacrificed\nin the subsequent fire to each one lost in the immediate shock of\nthe disaster.[8]\n\n  [8] The Angola was probably the most impressively horrible of the\n  many "stove accidents."That which occurred near Prospect, N. Y.,\n  upon the Buffalo, Corry & Pittsburgh road, on December 24, 1872,\n  should not, however, be forgotten.In this case a trestle bridge\n  gave way precipitating a passenger train some thirty feet to the\n  bottom of a ravine, where the cars caught fire from the stoves.Nineteen lives were lost, mostly by burning.The Richmond Switch\n  disaster of April 19, 1873, on the New York, Providence & Boston\n  road was of the same character.Three passengers only were there\n  burned to death, but after the disaster the flames rushed "through\n  the car as quickly as if the wood had been a lot of hay," and, after\n  those who were endeavoring to release the wounded and imprisoned men\n  were driven away, their cries were for some time heard through the\n  smoke and flame.But a few days more than a year after the Ashtabula accident another\ncatastrophe, almost exactly similar in its details, occurred on\nthe Connecticut Western road.It is impossible to even estimate\nthe amount of overhauling to which bridges throughout the country\nhad in the meanwhile been subjected, or the increased care used\nin their examination.All that can be said is that during the\nyear 1877 no serious accident due to the inherent weakness of any\nbridge occcurred on the 70,000 miles of American railroad.Neither,\nso far as can be ascertained, was the Tariffville disaster to be\nreferred to that cause.It happened on the evening of January 15,\n1878.A large party of excursionists were returning from a Moody\nand Sankey revival meeting on a special train, consisting of two\nlocomotives and ten cars.Half a mile west of Tariffville the\nrailroad crosses the Farmington river.The bridge at this point was\na wooden Howe truss, with two spans of 163 feet each.It had been\nin use about seven years and, originally of ample strength and good\nconstruction, there is no evidence that its strength had since been\nunduly impaired by neglect or exposure.It should, therefore, have\nsufficed to bear twice the strain to which it was now subjected.Exactly as at Ashtabula, however, the west span of the bridge gave\nway under the train just as the leading locomotives passed onto the\ntressel-work beyond it: the ice broke under the falling wreck, and\nthe second locomotive with four cars were precipitated into the\nriver.The remaining cars were stopped by the rear end of the third\ncar, resting as it did on the centre pier of the bridge, and did\nnot leave the rails.The fall to the surface of the ice was about\nten feet.There was no fire to add to the horrors in this case, but\nthirteen persons were crushed to death or drowned, and thirty-three\nothers injured.[9]\n\n  [9] Of the same general character with the Tariffville and Ashtabula\n  accidents were those which occurred on November 1, 1855, upon the\n  Pacific railroad of Missouri at the bridge over the Gasconade, and\n  on July 27, 1875, upon the Northern Pacific at the bridge over the\n  Mississippi near Brainerd.In the first of these accidents the\n  bridge gave way under an excursion train, in honor of the opening\n  of the road, and its chief engineer was among the killed.The train\n  fell some thirty feet, and 22 persons lost their lives while over 50\n  suffered serious injuries.At Brainerd the train,--a "mixed" one,--went down nearly 80 feet\n  into the river.The locomotive and several cars had passed the span\n  which fell, in safety, but were pulled back and went down on top\n  of the train.There were but few passengers in it, of whom three\n  were killed.In falling the caboose car at the rear of the train,\n  in which most of the passengers were, struck on a pier and broke in\n  two, leaving several passengers in it.In the case of the Gasconade,\n  the disaster was due to the weakness of the bridge, which fell under\n  the weight of the train.There is some question as to the Brainerd\n  accident, whether it was occasioned by weakness of the bridge or the\n  derailment upon it of a freight car.Naturally the popular inference was at once drawn that this was\na mere repetition of the Ashtabula experience,--that the fearful\nearlier lesson had been thrown away on a corporation either\nunwilling or not caring to learn.The newspapers far and wide\nresounded with ill considered denunciation, and the demand was loud\nfor legislation of the crudest conceivable character, especially\na law prohibiting the passage over any bridge of two locomotives\nattached to one passenger train.The fact, however, seems to be\nthat, except in its superficial details, the Tariffville disaster\nhad no features in common with that at Ashtabula; as nearly as\ncan be ascertained it was due neither to the weakness nor to the\noverloading of the bridge.Though the evidence subsequently given\nis not absolutely conclusive on this point, the probabilities\nwould seem to be that, while on the bridge, the second locomotive\nwas derailed in some unexplained way and consequently fell on\nthe stringers which yielded under the sudden blow.The popular\nimpression, therefore, as to the bearing which the first of these\ntwo strikingly similar accidents had upon the last tended only to\nbring about results worse than useless.The bridge fell, not under\nthe steady weight of two locomotives, but under the sudden shock\nincident to the derailment of one.The remedy, therefore, lay in the\ndirection of so planking or otherwise guarding the floors of similar\nbridges that in case of derailment the locomotives or cars should\nnot fall on the stringers or greatly diverge from the rails so as\nto endanger the trusses.On the other hand the suggestion of a law\nprohibiting the passage over bridges of more than one locomotive\nwith any passenger train, while in itself little better than a legal\nrecognition of bad bridge building, also served to divert public\nattention from the true lesson of the disaster.Another newspaper\nprecaution, very favorably considered at the time, was the putting\nof one locomotive, where two had to be used, at the rear end of the\ntrain as a pusher, instead of both in front.Mary travelled to the bedroom.This expedient might\nindeed obviate one cause of danger, but it would do so only by\nsubstituting for it another which has been the fruitful source of\nsome of the worst railroad disasters on record.[10]\n\n  [10] "The objectionable and dangerous practice also employed on some\n  railways of assisting trains up inclines by means of pilot engines\n  in the rear instead of in front, has led to several accidents in\n  the past year and should be discontinued."Mary went to the office.--_General Report to the\n  Board of Trade upon the Accidents on the Railways of Great Britain\n  in 1878, p.Long, varied and terrible as the record of bridge disasters has\nbecome, there are, nevertheless, certain very simple and inexpensive\nprecautions against them, which, altogether too frequently,\ncorporations do not and will not take.At Ashtabula the bridge\ngave way.Sandra travelled to the kitchen.There was no derailment as there seems to have been\nat Tariffville.The sustaining power of a bridge is, of course,\na question comparatively difficult of ascertainment.A fatal\nweakness in this respect may be discernable only to the eye of a\ntrained expert.Derailment, however, either upon a bridge, or when\napproaching it, is in the vast majority of cases a danger perfectly\neasy to guard against.The precautions are simple and they are not\nexpensive, yet, taking the railroads of the United States as a\nwhole, it may well be questioned whether the bridges at which they\nhave been taken do not constitute the exception rather than the\nrule.Not only is the average railroad superintendent accustomed\nto doing his work and running his road under a constant pressure to\nmake both ends meet, which, as he well knows, causes his own daily\nbread to depend upon the economies he can effect; but, while he\nfinds it hard work at best to provide for the multifarious outlays,\nlong immunity from disaster breeds a species of recklessness even\nin the most cautious:--and yet the single mishap in a thousand\nmust surely fall to the lot of some one.Many years ago the\nterrible results which must soon or late be expected wherever the\nconsequences of a derailment on the approaches to a bridge are not\nsecurely guarded against, were illustrated by a disaster on the\nGreat Western railroad of Canada, which combined many of the worst\nhorrors of both the Norwalk and the New Hamburg tragedies; more\nrecently the almost forgotten lesson was enforced again on the\nVermont & Massachusetts road, upon the bridge over the Miller River,\nat Athol.The accident last referred to occurred on the 16th of\nJune, 1870, but, though forcible enough as a reminder, it was tame\nindeed in comparison with the Des Jardines Canal disaster, which\nis still remembered though it happened so long ago as the 17th of\nMarch, 1857.The Great Western railroad of Canada crossed the canal by a bridge\nat an elevation of about sixty feet.At the time of the accident\nthere were some eighteen feet of water in the canal, though, as\nis usual in Canada at that season, it was covered by ice some two\nfeet in thickness.On the afternoon of the 17th of March as the\nlocal accommodation train from Hamilton was nearing the bridge,\nits locomotive, though it was then moving at a very slow rate of\nspeed, was in some way thrown from the track and onto the timbers\nof the bridge.These it cut through, and then falling heavily on\nthe string-pieces it parted them, and instantly pitched headlong\ndown upon the frozen surface of the canal below, dragging after it\nthe tender, baggage car and two passenger cars, which composed the\nwhole train.There was nothing whatever to break the fall of sixty\nfeet; and even then two feet of ice only intervened between the\nruins of the train and the bottom of the canal eighteen feet below.Two feet of solid ice will afford no contemptible resistance to a\nfalling body; the locomotive and tender crushed heavily through\nit and instantly sank out of sight.In falling the baggage car\nstruck a corner of the tender and was thus thrown some ten yards\nto one side, and was followed by the first passenger car, which,\nturning a somersault as it went, fell on its roof and was crushed to\nfragments, but only partially broke through the ice, upon which the\nnext car fell endwise, and rested in that position.That every human\nbeing in the first car was either crushed or drowned seems most\nnatural; the only cause for astonishment is found in the fact that\nany one should have survived such a catastrophe,--a tumble of sixty\nfeet on ice as solid as a rock!Yet of four persons in the baggage\ncar three went down with it, and not one of them was more than\nslightly injured.The engineer and fireman, and the occupants of the\nsecond passenger car, were less fortunate.The former were found\ncrushed under the locomotive at the bottom of the canal; while of\nthe latter ten were killed, and not one escaped severe injury.Very\nrarely indeed in the history of railroad accidents have so large a\nportion of those on the train lost their lives as in this case, for\nout of ninety persons sixty perished, and in the number was included\nevery woman and child among the passengers, with a single exception.There were two circumstances about this disaster worthy of especial\nnotice.In the first place, as well as can now be ascertained in\nthe absence of any trustworthy record of an investigation into\ncauses, the accident was easily preventable.It appears to have\nbeen immediately caused by the derailment of a locomotive, however\noccasioned, just as it was entering on a swing draw-bridge.Thrown\nfrom the tracks, there was nothing in the flooring to prevent the\nderailed locomotive from deflecting from its course until it toppled\nover the ends of the ties, nor were the ties and the flooring\napparently sufficiently strong to sustain it even while it held to\nits course.Under such circumstances the derailment of a locomotive\nupon any bridge can mean only destruction; it meant it then,\nit means it now; and yet our country is to-day full of bridges\nconstructed in an exactly similar way.To make accidents from this\ncause, if not impossible at least highly improbable, it is only\nnecessary to make the ties and flooring of all bridges between the\ntracks and for three feet on either side of them sufficiently strong\nto sustain the whole weight of a train off the track and in motion,\nwhile a third rail, or strong truss of wood, securely fastened,\nshould be laid down midway between the rails throughout the entire\nlength of the bridge and its approaches.With this arrangement, as\nthe flanges of the wheels are on the inside, it must follow that in\ncase of derailment and a divergence to one side or the other of the\nbridge, the inner side of the flange will come against the central\nrail or truss just so soon as the divergence amounts to half the\nspace between the rails, which in the ordinary gauge is two feet and\nfour inches.The wheels must then glide along this guard, holding\nthe train from any further divergence from its course, until it\ncan be checked.Meanwhile, as the ties and flooring extend for the\nspace of three feet outside of the track, a sufficient support is\nfurnished by them for the other wheels.A legislative enactment\ncompelling the construction of all bridges in this way, coupled with\nadditional provisions for interlocking of draws with their signals\nin cases of bridges across navigable waters, would be open to\nobjection that laws against dangers of accident by rail have almost\ninvariably proved ineffective when they were not absurd, but in\nitself, if enforced, it might not improbably render disasters like\nthose at Norwalk and Des Jardines terrors of the past.CAR-COUPLINGS IN DERAILMENTS.Wholly apart from the derailment, which was the real occasion of\nthe Des Jardines disaster, there was one other cause which largely\ncontributed to its fatality, if indeed that fatality was not in\ngreatest part immediately due to it.The question as to what is the best method of coupling together\nthe several individual vehicles which make up every railroad\ntrain has always been much discussed among railroad mechanics.The decided weight of opinion has been in favor of the strongest\nand closest couplings, so that under no circumstances should the\ntrain separate into parts.Taking all forms of railroad accident\ntogether, this conclusion is probably sound.It is, however, at\nbest only a balancing of disadvantages,--a mere question as to\nwhich practice involves the least amount of danger.Yet a very\nterrible demonstration that there are two sides to this as to most\nother questions was furnished at Des Jardines.It was the custom\non the Great Western road not only to couple the cars together in\nthe method then in general use, but also, as is often done now, to\nconnect them by heavy chains on each side of the centre coupling.Accordingly when the locomotive broke through the Des Jardines\nbridge, it dragged the rest of the train hopelessly after it.This\ncertainly would not have happened had the modern self-coupler been\nin use, and probably would not have happened had the cars been\nconnected only by the ordinary link and pins; for the train was\ngoing very slowly, and the signal for brakes was given in ample time\nto apply them vigorously before the last cars came to the opening,\ninto which they were finally dragged by the dead weight before them\nand not hurried by their own momentum.On the other hand, we have not far to go in search of scarcely less\nfatal disasters illustrating with equal force the other side of the\nproposition, in the terrible consequences which have ensued from the\nseparation of cars in cases of derailment.Take, for instance, the\nmemorable accident of June 17, 1858, near Port Jervis, on the Erie\nrailway.As the express train from New York was running at a speed of about\nthirty miles an hour over a perfectly straight piece of track\nbetween Otisville and Port Jervis, shortly after dark on the evening\nof that day, it encountered a broken rail.The train was made up\nof a locomotive, two baggage cars and five passenger cars, all of\nwhich except the last passed safely over the fractured rail.The\nlast car was apparently derailed, and drew the car before it off the\ntrack.These two cars were then dragged along, swaying fearfully\nfrom side to side, for a distance of some four hundred feet, when\nthe couplings at last snapped and they went over the embankment,\nwhich was there some thirty feet in height.As they rushed down the\n<DW72> the last car turned fairly over, resting finally on its roof,\nwhile one of its heavy iron trucks broke through and fell upon the\npassengers beneath, killing and maiming them.The other car, more\nfortunate, rested at last upon its side on a pile of stones at the\nfoot of the embankment.Six persons were killed and fifty severely\ninjured; all of the former in the last car.In this case, had the couplings held, the derailed cars would\nnot have gone over the embankment and but slight injuries would\nhave been sustained.Modern improvements have, however, created\nsafeguards sufficient to prevent the recurrence of other accidents\nunder the same conditions as that at Port Jervis.The difficulty lay\nin the inability to stop a train, though moving at only moderate\nspeed, within a reasonable time.The wretched inefficiency of the\nold hand-brake in a sudden emergency received one more illustration.The train seems to have run nearly half a mile after the accident\ntook place before it could be stopped, although the engineer had\ninstant notice of it and reversed his locomotive.The couplings did\nnot snap until a distance had been traversed in which the modern\ntrain-brake would have reduced the speed to a point at which they\nwould have been subjected to no dangerous strain.The accident ten years later at Carr\'s Rock, sixteen miles west of\nPort Jervis, on the same road, was again very similar to the one\njust described: and yet in this case the parting of the couplings\nalone prevented the rear of the train from dragging its head to\ndestruction.Both disasters were occasioned by broken rails; but,\nwhile the first occurred on a tangent, the last was at a point where\nthe road skirted the hills, by a sharp curve, upon the outer side of\nwhich was a steep declivity of some eighty feet, jagged with rock\nand bowlders.It befell the night express on the 14th of April,\n1876.The train was a long one, consisting of the locomotive, three\nbaggage and express, and seven passenger cars, and it encountered\nthe broken rail while rounding the curve at a high rate of speed.Again all except the last car, passed over the fracture in safety;\nthis was snapped, as it were, off the track and over the embankment.At first it was dragged along, but only for a short distance; the\nintense strain then broke the coupling between the four rear cars\nand the head of the train, and, the last of the four being already\nover the embankment, the others almost instantly toppled over after\nit and rolled down the ravine.A passenger on this portion of the\ntrain, described the car he was in "as going over and over, until\nthe outer roof was torn off, the sides fell out, and the inner roof\nwas crushed in."Twenty-four persons were killed and eighty injured;\nbut in this instance, as in that at Des Jardines, the only occasion\nfor surprise was that there were any survivors.Accidents arising from the parting of defective couplings have of\ncourse not been uncommon, and they constitute one of the greatest\ndangers incident to heavy gradients; in surmounting inclines freight\ntrains will, it is found, break in two, and their hinder parts come\nthundering down the grade, as was seen at Abergele.The American\npassenger trains, in which each car is provided with brakes, are\nmuch less liable than the English, the speed of which is regulated\nby brake-vans, to accidents of this description.Indeed, it may be\nquestioned whether in America any serious disaster has occurred from\nthe fact that a portion of a passenger train on a road operated by\nsteam got beyond control in descending an incline.There have been,\nhowever, terrible catastrophes from this cause in England, and that\non the Lancashire & Yorkshire road near Helmshere, a station some\nfourteen miles north of Manchester, deserves a prominent place in\nthe record of railroad accidents.It occurred in the early hours of the morning of the 4th of\nSeptember, 1860.There had been a great _fête_ at the Bellevue\nGardens in Manchester on the 3d, upon the conclusion of which some\ntwenty-five hundred persons crowded at once upon the return trains.Of these there were, on the Lancashire & Yorkshire road, three; the\nfirst consisting of fourteen, the second of thirty-one, and the last\nof twenty-four carriages: and they were started, with intervals of\nten minutes between them, at about eleven o\'clock at night.The\nfirst train finished its journey in safety.The Helmshere station is at the top of a steep incline.This the second train, drawn by two locomotives, surmounted, and\nthen stopped for the delivery of passengers.While these were\nleaving the carriages, a snap as of fractured iron was heard, and\nthe guards, looking back, saw the whole rear portion of the train,\nconsisting of seventeen carriages and a brake-van, detached from\nthe rest of it and quietly slipping down the incline.The detached\nportion was moving so slowly that one of the guards succeeded in\ncatching the van and applying the brakes; it was, however, already\ntoo late.The velocity was greater than the brake-power could\novercome, and the seventeen carriages kept descending more and\nmore rapidly.Meanwhile the third train had reached the foot of\nthe incline and begun to ascend it, when its engineer, on rounding\na curve, caught sight of the descending carriages.He immediately\nreversed his engine, but before he could bring his train to a stand\nthey were upon him.Fortunately the van-brakes of the detached\ncarriages, though insufficient to stop them, yet did reduce their\nspeed; the collision nevertheless was terrific.The force of the\nblow, so far as the advancing train was concerned, expended itself\non the locomotive, which was demolished, while the passengers\nescaped with a fright.With them there was nothing to break the blow, and the two hindmost\ncarriages were crushed to fragments and their passengers scattered\nover the line.It was shortly after midnight, and the excursionists\nclambered out of the trains and rushed frantically about, impeding\nevery effort to clear away the _débris_ and rescue the injured,\nwhose shrieks and cries were incessant.The bodies of ten persons,\none of whom had died of suffocation, were ultimately taken out from\nthe wreck, and twenty-two others sustained fractures of limbs.At Des Jardines the couplings were too strong; at Port Jervis and\nat Helmshere they were not strong enough; at Carr\'s Rock they gave\nway not a moment too soon."There are objections to a plenum and\nthere are objections to a vacuum," as Dr.Johnson remarked, "but a\nplenum or a vacuum it must be."There are no arguments, however,\nin favor of putting railroad stations or sidings upon an inclined\nplane, and then not providing what the English call "catch-points"\nor "scotches" to prevent such disasters as those at Abergele or\nHelmshere.In these two instances alone the want of them cost\nover fifty lives.In railroad mechanics there are after all some\nprinciples susceptible of demonstration.That vehicles, as well as\nwater, will run down hill may be classed among them.That these\nprinciples should still be ignored is hardly less singular than it\nis surprising.THE REVERE CATASTROPHE.The terrible disaster which occurred in front of the little\nstation-building at Revere, six miles from Boston on the Eastern\nrailroad of Massachusetts, in August 1871, was, properly speaking,\nnot an accident at all; it was essentially a catastrophe--the\nlegitimate and almost inevitable final outcome of an antiquated and\ninsufficient system.As such it should long remain a subject for\nprayerful meditation to all those who may at any time be entrusted\nwith the immediate operating of railroads.It was terribly dramatic,\nbut it was also frightfully instructive; and while the lesson was by\nno means lost, it yet admits of further and advantageous study.For,\nlike most other men whose lives are devoted to a special calling,\nthe managers of railroads are apt to be very much wedded to their\nown methods, and attention has already more than once been called to\nthe fact that, when any new emergency necessitates a new appliance,\nthey not infrequently, as Captain Tyler well put it in his report\nto the Board of Trade for the year 1870, "display more ingenuity in\nfinding objections than in overcoming them."[Illustration: map]\n\nThe Eastern railroad of Massachusetts connects Boston with Portland,\nin the state of Maine, by a line which is located close along the\nsea-shore.Between Boston and Lynn, a distance of eleven miles, the\nmain road is in large part built across the salt marshes, but there\nis a branch which leaves it at Everett, a small station some miles\nout of Boston, and thence, running deviously through a succession\nof towns on the higher ground, connects with the main track again\nat Lynn; thus making what is known in England as a loop-road.At\nthe time of the Revere accident this branch was equipped with\nbut a single track, and was operated wholly by schedule without\nany reliance on the telegraph; and, indeed, there were not even\ntelegraphic offices at a number of the stations upon it.Revere,\nthe name of the station where the accident took place, was on the\nmain line about five miles from Boston and two miles from Everett,\nwhere the Saugus branch, as the loop-road was called, began.The\naccompanying diagram shows the relative position of the several\npoints and of the main and branch lines, a thorough appreciation of\nwhich is essential to a correct understanding of the disaster.The travel over the Eastern railroad is of a somewhat exceptional\nnature, varying in a more than ordinary degree with the different\nseasons of the year.During the winter months the corporation had,\nin 1871, to provide for a regular passenger movement of about\nseventy-five thousand a week, but in the summer what is known\nas the excursion and pleasure travel not infrequently increased\nthe number to one hundred and ten thousand, and even more.As a\nnatural consequence, during certain weeks of each summer, and more\nespecially towards the close of August, it was no unusual thing for\nthe corporation to find itself taxed beyond its utmost resources.It\nis emergencies of this description, periodically occurring on every\nrailroad, which always subject to the final test the organization\nand discipline of companies and the capacity of superintendents.A\nrailroad in quiet times is like a ship in steady weather; almost\nanybody can manage the one or sail the other.It is the sudden\nstress which reveals the undeveloped strength or the hidden\nweakness; and the truly instructive feature in the Revere accident\nlay in the amount of hidden weakness everywhere which was brought to\nlight under that sudden stress.During the week ending with that\nSaturday evening upon which the disaster occurred the rolling stock\nof the road had been heavily taxed, not only to accommodate the\nusual tide of summer travel, then at its full flood, but also those\nattending a military muster and two large camp-meetings upon its\nline.The number of passengers going over it had accordingly risen\nfrom about one hundred and ten thousand, the full summer average,\nto over one hundred and forty thousand; while instead of the one\nhundred and fifty-two trains a day provided for in the running\nschedule, there were no less than one hundred and ninety-two.It\nhad never been the custom with those managing the road to place any\nreliance upon the telegraph in directing the train movement, and no\nuse whatever appears to have been made of it towards straightening\nout the numerous hitches inevitable from so sudden an increase in\nthat movement.If an engine broke down, or a train got off the\ntrack, there had accordingly throughout that week been nothing\ndone, except patient and general waiting, until things got in\nmotion again; each conductor or station-master had to look out for\nhimself, under the running regulations of the road, and need expect\nno assistance from headquarters.This, too, in spite of the fact\nthat, including the Saugus branch, no less than ninety-three of the\nentire one hundred and fifteen miles of road operated by the company\nwere supplied only with a single track.The whole train movement,\nboth of the main line and of the branches, intricate in the extreme\nas it was, thus depended solely on a schedule arrangement and the\nwatchful intelligence of individual employés.Not unnaturally,\ntherefore, as the week drew to a close the confusion became so\ngreat that the trains reached and left the Boston station with an\nalmost total disregard of the schedule; while towards the evening\nof Saturday the employés of the road at that station directed their\nefforts almost exclusively to dispatching trains as fast as cars\ncould be procured, thus trying to keep it as clear as possible of\nthe throng of impatient travellers which continually blocked it up.Taken altogether the situation illustrated in a very striking manner\nthat singular reliance of the corporation on the individuality\nand intelligence of its employés, which in another connection is\nreferred to as one of the most striking characteristics of American\nrailroad management, without a full appreciation of which it is\nimpossible to understand its using or failing to use certain\nappliances.According to the regular schedule four trains should have left the\nBoston station in succession during the hour and a half between 6.30\nand eight o\'clock P.M.: a Saugus branch train for Lynn at 6.30; a\nsecond Saugus branch train at seven; an accommodation train, which\nran eighteen miles over the main line, at 7.15; and finally the\nexpress train through to Portland, also over the main line, at\neight o\'clock.The collision at Revere was between these last two\ntrains, the express overtaking and running into the rear of the\naccommodation train; but it was indirectly caused by the delays\nand irregularity in movement of the two branch trains.It will be\nnoticed that, according to the schedule, both of the branch trains\nshould have preceded the accommodation train; in the prevailing\nconfusion, however, the first of the two branch trains did not leave\nthe station until about seven o\'clock, thirty minutes behind its\ntime, and it was followed forty minutes later, not by the second\nbranch train, but by the accommodation train, which in its turn was\ntwenty-five minutes late.Thirteen minutes afterwards the second\nSaugus branch train, which should have preceded, followed it, being\nnearly an hour out of time.Then at last came the Portland express,\nwhich got away practically on time, at a few minutes after eight\no\'clock.All of these four trains went out over the same track as\nfar as the junction at Everett, but at that point the first and\nthird of the four were to go off on the branch, while the second and\nfourth kept on over the main line.Between these last two trains\nthe running schedule of the road allowed an ample time-interval of\nforty-five minutes, which, however, on this occasion was reduced,\nthrough the delay in starting, to some fifteen or twenty minutes.No causes of further delay, therefore, arising, the simple case\nwas presented of a slow accommodation train being sent out to run\neighteen miles in advance of a fast express train, with an interval\nof twenty minutes between them.Unfortunately, however, the accommodation train was speedily\nsubjected to another and very serious delay.It has been mentioned\nthat the Saugus branch was a single track road, and the rules of\nthe company were explicit that no outward train was to pass onto\nthe branch at Everett until any inward train then due there should\nhave arrived and passed off it.There was no siding at the junction,\nupon which an outward branch train could be temporarily placed to\nwait for the inward train, thus leaving the main track clear; and\naccordingly, under a strict construction of the rules, any outward\nbranch train while awaiting the arrival at Everett of an inward\nbranch train was to be kept standing on the main track, completely\nblocking it.The outward branch trains, it subsequently appeared,\nwere often delayed at the junction, but no practical difficulty had\narisen from this cause, as the employé in charge of the signals\nand switches there, exercising his common sense, had been in the\ncustom of moving any delayed train temporarily out of the way onto\nthe branch or the other main track, under protection of a flag,\nand thus relieving the block.The need of a siding to permit the\npassage of trains at this point had not been felt, simply because\nthe employé in charge there had used the branch or other main track\nas a siding.On the day of the accident this employé happened to be\nsick, and absent from his post.His substitute either had no common\nsense or did not feel called upon to use it, if its use involved\nany increase of responsibility.Accordingly, when a block took\nplace, the simple letter of the rule was followed;--and it is almost\nneedless to add that a block did take place on the afternoon of\nAugust 26th.The first of the branch trains, it will be remembered, had left\nBoston at about seven o\'clock, instead of at 6.30, its schedule\ntime.On arriving at Everett this train should have met and passed\nan inward branch train, which was timed to leave Lynn at six\no\'clock, but which, owing to some accident to its locomotive, and\npartaking of the general confusion of the day, on this particular\nafternoon did not leave the Lynn station until 7.30 o\'clock, or one\nhour and a half after its schedule time, and one half-hour after\nthe other train had left Boston.Accordingly, when the Boston train\nreached the junction its conductor found himself confronted by the\nrule forbidding him to enter upon the branch until the Lynn train\nthen due should have passed off it, and so he quietly waited on the\noutward track of the main line, blocking it completely to traffic.He had not waited long before a special locomotive, on its way from\nBoston to Salem, came up and stopped behind him.This was presently\nfollowed by the accommodation train.Then the next branch train came\nalong, and finally the Portland express.At such a time, and at that\nperiod of railroad development, there was something ludicrous about\nthe spectacle.Here was a road utterly unable to accommodate its\npassengers with cars, while a succession of trains were standing\nidle for hours, because a locomotive had broken down ten miles off.The telegraph was there, but the company was not in the custom of\nputting any reliance upon it.A simple message to the branch trains\nto meet and pass at any point other than that fixed in the schedule\nwould have solved the whole difficulty; but, no!--there were the\nrules, and all the rolling stock of the road might gather at Everett\nin solemn procession, but, until the locomotive at Lynn could be\nrepaired, the law of the Medes and Persians was plain; and in this\ncase it read that the telegraph was a new-fangled and unreliable\nauxiliary.And so the lengthening procession stood there long enough\nfor the train which caused it to have gone to its destination and\ncome back dragging the disabled locomotive from Lynn behind it to\nagain take its place in the block.At last, at about ten minutes after eight o\'clock, the long-expected\nLynn train made its appearance, and the first of the branch trains\nfrom Boston immediately went off the main line.The road was now\nclear for the accommodation train, which had been standing some\ntwelve or fifteen minutes in the block, but which from the moment\nof again starting was running on the schedule time of the Portland\nexpress.Every minute was vital,\nand yet he never thought to look at his watch.He had a vague\nimpression that he had been delayed some six or eight minutes, when\nin reality he had been delayed fifteen; and, though he was running\nwholly out of his schedule time, he took not a single precaution, so\npersuaded was he that every one knew where he was.The confusion among those in charge of the various engines and\ntrains was, indeed, general and complete.As the Portland express\nwas about to leave the Boston station, the superintendent of the\nroad, knowing by the non-arrival of the branch train from Lynn that\nthere must be a block at the Everett junction, had directed the\ndepot-master to caution the engineer to look out for the trains\nahead of him.The order, a merely verbal one, was delivered after\nthe train had started, the depot-master walking along by the side of\nthe slowly-moving locomotive, and was either incorrectly transmitted\nor not fully understood; the engine-driver supposed it to apply to\nthe branch train which had started just before him, out of both its\nschedule time and schedule place.Presently, at the junction, he was\nstopped by the signal man of this train.The course of reasoning he\nwould then have had to pass through to divine the true situation\nof affairs and to guide himself safely under the schedule in the\nlight of the running rules was complicated indeed, and somewhat as\nfollows: "The branch train," he should have argued to himself, "is\nstopped, and it is stopped because the train which should have left\nLynn at six o\'clock has not yet arrived; but, under the rules, that\ntrain should pass off the branch before the 6.30 train could pass\nonto it; if, therefore, the \'wild\' train before me is delayed not\nonly the 6.30 but all intermediate trains must likewise be delayed,\nand the accommodation train went out this afternoon after the 6.30\ntrain, so it, too, must be in the block ahead of me; unless, indeed,\nas is usually the case, the signal-master has got it out of the\nblock under the protection of a flag']

me, he being upon his voyage to\nPortugal, and for my letters to my Lord which are not ready.But I took\nhim to the Mitre and gave him a glass of sack, and so adieu, and then\nstraight to the Opera, and there saw "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," done\nwith scenes very well, but above all, Betterton\n\n     [Sir William Davenant introduced the use of scenery.The character\n     of Hamlet was one of Betterton\'s masterpieces.Mary went back to the kitchen.Downes tells us that\n     he was taught by Davenant how the part was acted by Taylor of the\n     Blackfriars, who was instructed by Shakespeare himself.]Hence homeward, and met with\nMr.Spong and took him to the Sampson in Paul\'s churchyard, and there\nstaid till late, and it rained hard, so we were fain to get home wet, and\nso to bed.At church in the morning, and dined at home alone with\nmy wife very comfortably, and so again to church with her, and had a very\ngood and pungent sermon of Mr.Mills, discoursing the necessity of\nrestitution.Home, and I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to look\nsomething askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them, and\nis not solicitous for their acquaintance, which I am not troubled at at\nall.By and by comes in my father (he intends to go into the country\nto-morrow), and he and I among other discourse at last called Pall up to\nus, and there in great anger told her before my father that I would keep\nher no longer, and my father he said he would have nothing to do with her.At last, after we had brought down her high spirit, I got my father to\nyield that she should go into the country with my mother and him, and stay\nthere awhile to see how she will demean herself.That being done, my\nfather and I to my uncle Wight\'s, and there supped, and he took his leave\nof them, and so I walked with [him] as far as Paul\'s and there parted, and\nI home, my mind at some rest upon this making an end with Pall, who do\ntrouble me exceedingly.This morning before I went out I made even with my maid Jane, who\nhas this day been my maid three years, and is this day to go into the\ncountry to her mother.The poor girl cried, and I could hardly forbear\nweeping to think of her going, for though she be grown lazy and spoilt by\nPall\'s coming, yet I shall never have one to please us better in all\nthings, and so harmless, while I live.So I paid her her wages and gave\nher 2s.over, and bade her adieu, with my mind full of trouble at her\ngoing.Hence to my father, where he and I and Thomas together setting\nthings even, and casting up my father\'s accounts, and upon the whole I\nfind that all he hath in money of his own due to him in the world is but\nL45, and he owes about the same sum: so that I cannot but think in what a\ncondition he had left my mother if he should have died before my uncle\nRobert.Hence to Tom Trice for the probate of the will and had it done to\nmy mind, which did give my father and me good content.From thence to my\nLady at the Wardrobe and thence to the Theatre, and saw the "Antipodes,"\nwherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.Bostock whom I met there (a clerk formerly of Mr.Phelps) to the Devil\ntavern, and there drank and so away.I to my uncle Fenner\'s, where my\nfather was with him at an alehouse, and so we three went by ourselves and\nsat talking a great while about a broker\'s daughter that he do propose for\na wife for Tom, with a great portion, but I fear it will not take, but he\nwill do what he can.So we broke up, and going through the street we met\nwith a mother and son, friends of my father\'s man, Ned\'s, who are angry at\nmy father\'s putting him away, which troubled me and my father, but all\nwill be well as to that.We have news this morning of my uncle Thomas and\nhis son Thomas being gone into the country without giving notice thereof\nto anybody, which puts us to a stand, but I fear them not.At night at\nhome I found a letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now very well again of\nhis feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was\ntwice let blood.This letter dated the 22nd July last, which puts me out\nof doubt of his being ill.In my coming home I called in at the Crane\ntavern at the Stocks by appointment, and there met and took leave of Mr.Fanshaw, who goes to-morrow and Captain Isham toward their voyage to\nPortugal.Here we drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr.Fanshaw\ntill he could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord\nHinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in\ntheir way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady\'s\nbedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu\'s disposing of\nthe L5000 for my Lord\'s departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will\nnot do it to my Lord\'s honour, and less to his profit, which I am to\nenquire a little after.Hence to the office, and there sat till noon, and\nthen my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.Pepys, the Executor, to\ndinner, where some ladies and my father and mother, where very merry, but\nmethinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests, though there was a\npoor venison pasty.Hence my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw\n"The Joviall Crew," where the King, Duke and Duchess, and Madame Palmer,\nwere; and my wife, to her great content, had a full sight of them all the\nwhile.Hence to my father\'s, and there staid to\ntalk a while and so by foot home by moonshine.In my way and at home, my\nwife making a sad story to me of her brother Balty\'s a condition, and\nwould have me to do something for him, which I shall endeavour to do, but\nam afeard to meddle therein for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands\nof him again, when I once concern myself for him.I went to bed, my wife\nall the while telling me his case with tears, which troubled me.At home all the morning setting papers in order.At noon to the\nExchange, and there met with Dr.Williams by appointment, and with him\nwent up and down to look for an attorney, a friend of his, to advise with\nabout our bond of my aunt Pepys of L200, and he tells me absolutely that\nwe shall not be forced to pay interest for the money yet.I spent the whole afternoon drinking with him and so home.This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief that\nstole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.At the office all the morning, and at noon my father, mother, and\nmy aunt Bell (the first time that ever she was at my house) come to dine\nwith me, and were very merry.After dinner the two women went to visit my\naunt Wight, &c., and my father about other business, and I abroad to my\nbookseller, and there staid till four o\'clock, at which time by\nappointment I went to meet my father at my uncle Fenner\'s.So thither I\nwent and with him to an alehouse, and there came Mr.Evans, the taylor,\nwhose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom, and then my\nfather, and there we sat a good while and talked about the business; in\nfine he told us that he hath not to except against us or our motion, but\nthat the estate that God hath blessed him with is too great to give where\nthere is nothing in present possession but a trade and house; and so we\nfriendly ended.There parted, my father and I together, and walked a\nlittle way, and then at Holborn he and I took leave of one another, he\nbeing to go to Brampton (to settle things against my mother comes)\ntomorrow morning.At noon my wife and I met at the Wardrobe, and there dined with the\nchildren, and after dinner up to my Lady\'s bedside, and talked and laughed\na good while.Then my wife end I to Drury Lane to the French comedy,\nwhich was so ill done, and the scenes and company and every thing else so\nnasty and out of order and poor, that I was sick all the while in my mind\nto be there.Here my wife met with a son of my Lord Somersett, whom she\nknew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great countenance, to avoyd\nfurther acquaintance.That done, there being nothing pleasant but the\nfoolery of the farce, we went home.At home and the office all the morning, and at noon comes Luellin\nto me, and he and I to the tavern and after that to Bartholomew fair, and\nthere upon his motion to a pitiful alehouse, where we had a dirty slut or\ntwo come up that were whores, but my very heart went against them, so that\nI took no pleasure but a great deal of trouble in being there and getting\nfrom thence for fear of being seen.From hence he and I walked towards\nLudgate and parted.I back again to the fair all alone, and there met\nwith my Ladies Jemimah and Paulina, with Mr.Pickering and Madamoiselle,\nat seeing the monkeys dance, which was much to see, when they could be\nbrought to do so, but it troubled me to sit among such nasty company.After that with them into Christ\'s Hospitall, and there Mr.Pickering\nbought them some fairings, and I did give every one of them a bauble,\nwhich was the little globes of glass with things hanging in them, which\npleased the ladies very well.After that home with them in their coach,\nand there was called up to my Lady, and she would have me stay to talk\nwith her, which I did I think a full hour.And the poor lady did with so\nmuch innocency tell me how Mrs.Crispe had told her that she did intend,\nby means of a lady that lies at her house, to get the King to be godfather\nto the young lady that she is in childbed now of; but to see in what a\nmanner my Lady told it me, protesting that she sweat in the very telling\nof it, was the greatest pleasure to me in the world to see the simplicity\nand harmlessness of a lady.Then down to supper with the ladies, and so\nhome, Mr.Moore (as he and I cannot easily part) leading me as far as\nFenchurch Street to the Mitre, where we drank a glass of wine and so\nparted, and I home and to bed.My maid Jane newly gone, and Pall left now to do all\nthe work till another maid comes, which shall not be till she goes away\ninto the country with my mother.My Lord\nSandwich in the Straits and newly recovered of a great sickness at\nAlicante.My father gone to settle at Brampton, and myself under much\nbusiness and trouble for to settle things in the estate to our content.But what is worst, I find myself lately too much given to seeing of plays,\nand expense, and pleasure, which makes me forget my business, which I must\nlabour to amend.No money comes in, so that I have been forced to borrow\na great deal for my own expenses, and to furnish my father, to leave\nthings in order.I have some trouble about my brother Tom, who is now\nleft to keep my father\'s trade, in which I have great fears that he will\nmiscarry for want of brains and care.At Court things are in very ill\ncondition, there being so much emulacion, poverty, and the vices of\ndrinking, swearing, and loose amours, that I know not what will be the end\nof it, but confusion.And the Clergy so high, that all people that I meet\nwith do protest against their practice.In short, I see no content or\nsatisfaction any where, in any one sort of people.The Benevolence\n\n     [A voluntary contribution made by the subjects to their sovereign.Upon this occasion the clergy alone gave L33,743: See May 31st,\n     1661.--B]\n\nproves so little, and an occasion of so much discontent every where;

DELLON, 1673."M. Dellon a French traveller, spending some time at Damaun, on the\nnorth-western coast of Hindostan, incurred the jealousy of the governor\nand a black priest, in regard to a lady, as he is pleased to call\nher, whom they both admired.He had expressed himself rather freely\nconcerning some of the grosser superstitions of Romanism, and thus\nafforded the priest, who was also secretary of the Inquisition, an\noccasion of proceeding against him as a heretic.The priest and the\ngovernor united in a representation to the chief inquisitor at Goa,\nwhich procured an order for his arrest.Like all other persons whom it\npleased the inquisitors or their servants to arrest, in any part of the\nPortuguese dominions beyond the Cape of Good Hope, he was thrown into\nprison with a promiscuous crowd of delinquents, the place and treatment\nbeing of the worst kind, even according to the colonial barbarism of\nthe seventeenth century.To describe his sufferings there, is not to our\npurpose, inasmuch as all prisoners fared alike, many of them perishing\nfrom starvation and disease.Many offenders against the Inquisition\nwere there at the same time,--some accused of Judaism, others, of\nPaganism--in which sorcery and witchcraft were included--and others of\nimmorality.In a field so wide and so fruitful, the "scrutators" of the\nfaith could not fail to gather abundantly.After an incarceration of at\nleast four months, he and his fellow-sufferers were shipped off for\nthe ecclesiastical metropolis of India, all of them being in irons.The\nvessel put into Bacaim, and the prisoners were transferred, for some\ndays, to the prison of that town, where a large number of persons were\nkept in custody, under charge of the commissary of the holy office,\nuntil a vessel should arrive to carry them to Goa."In due time they were again at sea, and a fair wind wafted their\nfleet into that port after a voyage of seven days.Until they could\nbe deposited in the cells of the Inquisition with the accustomed\nformalities, the Archbishop of Goa threw open HIS prison for their\nreception, which prison, being ecclesiastical, may be deemed worthy of\ndescription."The most filthy," says Dellon, "the most dark, and the most horrible\nthat I ever saw; and I doubt whether a more shocking and horrible prison\ncan be found anywhere.It is a kind of cave wherein there is no day seen\nbut by a very little hole; the most subtle rays of the sun cannot enter\ninto it, and there is never any true light in it.* * *\n\n"On the 16th of January 1674, at eight o\'clock in the morning, an\nofficer came with orders to take the prisoners to "the holy house."With\nconsiderable difficulty M. Dellon dragged his iron-loaded limbs thither.They helped him to ascend the stairs at the great entrance, and in the\nhall, smiths were waiting to take off the irons from all the prisoners.One by one, they were summoned to audience.Dellon, who was called the\nfirst, crossed the hall, passed through an ante-chamber, and entered\na room, called by the Portuguese "board of the holy office," where the\ngrand inquisitor of the Indies sat at one end of a very large table, on\nan elevated floor in the middle of the chamber.He was a secular priest\nabout forty years of age, in full vigor--a man who could do his work\nwith energy.At one end of the room was a large crucifix, reaching from\nthe floor almost to the ceiling, and near it, sat a notary on a folding\nstool.At the opposite end, and near the inquisitor, Dellon was placed,\nand, hoping to soften his judge, fell on his knees before him.But the\ninquisitor commanded him to rise, asked whether he knew the reason of\nhis arrest, and advised him to declare it at large, as that was the only\nway to obtain a speedy release.Dellon caught at the hope of release,\nbegan to tell his tale, mixed with tears and protestations, again\nfell at the feet of Don Francisco Delgado Ematos, the inquisitor, and\nimplored his favorable attention.Don Francisco told him, very coolly,\nthat he had other business on hand, and, nothing moved, rang a silver\nbell.The alcayde entered, led the prisoner out into a gallery, opened,\nand searched his trunk, stripped him of every valuable, wrote an\ninventory, assured him that all should be safely kept, and then led him\nto a cell about ten feet square, and left him there, shut up in utter\nsolitude.In the evening they brought him his first meal, which he ate\nheartily, and slept a little during the night following.Next morning he\nlearnt that he could have no part of his property, not even a breviary\nwas, in that place, allowed to a priest, for they had no form of\nreligion there, and for that reason he could not have a book.His hair\nwas cropped close; and therefore "he did not need a comb.""Thus began his acquaintance with the holy house, which he describes\nas "great and magnificent," on one side of the great space before the\nchurch of St Catharine.There were three gates in front; and, it was\nby the central, or largest, that the prisoners entered, and mounted a\nstately flight of steps, leading into the great hall.The side gates\nprovided entrance to spacious ranges of apartments, belonging to the\ninquisitors.Behind the principal building, was another, very spacious,\ntwo stories high, and consisting of double rows of cells, opening into\ngalleries that ran from end to end.The cells on the ground-floor were\nvery small, without any aperture from without for light or air.Those of\nthe upper story were vaulted, white-washed, had a small strongly grated\nwindow, without glass, and higher than the tallest man could reach.Towards the gallery every cell was shut with two doors, one on the\ninside, the other one outside of the wall.The inner door folded, was\ngrated at the bottom, opened towards the top for the admission of food\nand was made fast with very strong bolts.The outer door was not so\nthick, had no window, but was left open from six o\'clock every morning\nuntil eleven--a necessary arrangement in that climate, unless it were\nintended to destroy life by suffocation."To each prisoner was given as earthen pot with water wherewith to wash,\nanother full of water to drink, with a cup; a broom, a mat whereon\nto lie, and a large basin with a cover, changed every fourth day.The\nprisoners had three meals a day; and their health so far as food could\ncontribute to it in such a place, was cared for in the provision of\na wholesome, but spare diet.Sandra travelled to the office.Physicians were at hand to render all\nnecessary assistance to the sick, as were confessors, ready to wait\nupon the dying; but they gave no viaticum, performed no unction, said\nno mass.The place was under an impenetrable interdict.If any died,\nand that many did die is beyond question, his death was unknown to all\nwithout; he was buried within the walls without any sacred ceremony;\nand if, after death, he was found to have died in heresy, his bones were\ntaken up at the next Auto, to be burned.Unless there happened to be\nan unusual number of prisoners, each one was alone in his own cell.He\nmight not speak, nor groan, nor sob aloud, nor sigh.[Footnote: Limborch\nrelates that on one occasion, a poor prisoner was heard to cough; the\njailer of the Inquisition instantly repaired to him, and warned him to\nforbear, as the slightest noise was not tolerated in that house.The\npoor man replied that it was not in his power to forbear; a second time\nthey admonished him to desist; and when again, unable to do otherwise,\nhe repeated the offence, they stripped him naked, and cruelly beat him.This increased his cough, for which they beat him so often, that at last\nhe died through pain and anguish of the stripes he had received.]His\nbreathing might be audible when the guard listened at the grating, but\nnothing more.Four guards were stationed in each long gallery, open,\nindeed, at each end, but awfully silent, as if it were the passage of\na catacomb.If, however, he wanted anything, he might tap at the inner\ndoor, when a jailer would come to hear the request, and would report to\nthe alcayde, but was not permitted to answer.If one of the victims, in\ndespair, or pain, or delirium, attempted to pronounce a prayer, even to\nGod, or dared to utter a cry, the jailers would run to the cell, rush\nin, and beat him cruelly, for terror to the rest.Once in two months the\ninquisitor, with a secretary and an interpreter, visited the prisons,\nand asked each prisoner if he wanted anything, if his meat was regularly\nbrought, and if he had any complaint against the jailers.His want after\nall lay at the mercy of the merciless.His complaint, if uttered, would\nbring down vengeance, rather than gain redress.But in this visitation\nthe holy office professed mercy with much formality, and the\ninquisitorial secretary collected notes which aided in the crimination,\nor in the murder of their victims."The officers of Goa were;--the inquisidor mor or grand inquisitor, who\nwas always a secular priest; the second inquisitor, Dominican friar;\nseveral deputies, who came, when called for, to assist the inquisitors\nat trials, but never entered without such a summons; qualifiers,\nas usual, to examine books and writings, but never to witness an\nexamination of the living, or be present at any act of the kind; a\nfiscal; a procurator; advocates, so called, for the accused; notaries\nand familiars.The authority of this tribunal was absolute in Goa.There does not appear to have been anything peculiar in the manner of\nexamining and torturing at Goa where the practice coincided with that of\nPortugal and Spain."The personal narrative of Dellon affords a distinct exemplification of\nthe sufferings of the prisoners.He had been told that, when he desired\nan audience, he had only to call a jailer, and ask it, when it would be\nallowed him.But, notwithstanding many tears and entreaties, he could\nnot obtain one until fifteen days had passed away.Then came the alcayde\nand one of his guards.This alcayde walked first out of the cell; Dellon\nuncovered and shorn, and with legs and feet bare, followed him; the\nguard walked behind.The alcayde just entered the place of audience,\nmade a profound reverence, stepped back and allowed his charge to enter.The door closed, and Dellon remained alone with the inquisitor and\nsecretary.He knelt; but Don Fernando sternly bade him to sit on a\nbench, placed there for the use of the culprits.Near him, on a table,\nlay a missal, on which they made him lay his hand, and swear to keep\nsecrecy, and tell them the truth.They asked if he knew the cause of his\nimprisonment, and whether he was resolved to confess it.He told\nthem all he could recollect of unguarded sayings at Damaun, either in\nargument or conversation, without ever, that he knew, contradicting,\ndirectly or indirectly, any article of faith.He had, at some time\ndropped an offensive word concerning the Inquisition, but so light a\nword, that it did not occur to his remembrance.Don Fernando told him he\nhad done well in ACCUSING HIMSELF so willingly, and exhorted him in the\nname of Jesus Christ, to complete his self accusation fully, to the end\nthat he might experience the goodness and mercy which were used in\nthat tribunal towards those who showed true repentance by a sincere\nand UNFORCED confession.The secretary read aloud the confession and\nexhortation, Dellon signed it, Don Fernando rang a silver bell, the\nalcayde walked in, and, in a few moments, the disappointed victim was\nagain in his dungeon."At the end of another fortnight, and without having asked for it, he\nwas again taken to audience.After a repetition of the former questions,\nhe was asked his name, surname, baptism, confirmation, place of abode,\nin what parish?They made him kneel,\nand make the sign of the cross, repeat the Pater Noster, Hail Mary,\ncreed, commandments of God, commandments of the church, and Salve\nBegins.He did it all very cleverly, and even to their satisfaction;\nbut the grand inquisitor exhorted him, by the tender mercies of our Lord\nJesus Christ, to confess without delay, and sent him to the cell again.They required him to do what was impossible--to\nconfess more, after he had acknowledged ALL.In despair, he tried to\nstarve himself to death; \'but they compelled him to take food.\'Day and\nnight he wept, and at length betook himself to prayer, imploring pity\nof the \'blessed Virgin,\' whom he imagined to be, of all beings, the most\nmerciful, and the most ready to give him help."At the end of a month, he succeeded in obtaining another audience, and\nadded to his former confessions what he had remembered, for the first\ntime, touching the Inquisition.But they told him that that was not what\nthey wanted, and sent him back again.In a frenzy\nof despair he determined to commit suicide, if possible.Feigning\nsickness, be obtained a physician who treated him for a fever, and\nordered him to be bled.Never calmed by any treatment of the physician,\nblood-letting was repeated often, and each time he untied the bandage,\nwhen left alone, hoping to die from loss of blood, but death fled from\nhim.A humane Franciscan came to confess him, and, hearing his tale of\nmisery, gave him kind words, asked permission to divulge his attempt\nat self-destruction to the inquisitor, procured him a mitigation of\nsolitude by the presence of a fellow-prisoner, a <DW64>, accused of\nmagic; but, after five months, the <DW64> was removed, and his mind,\nbroken with suffering, could no longer bear up under the aggravated\nload.By an effort of desperate ingenuity he almost succeeded in\ncommitting suicide, and a jailer found him weltering in his blood and\ninsensible.Having restored him by cordials, and bound up his wounds,\nthey carried him into the presence of the inquisitor once more; where he\nlay on the floor, being unable to sit, heard bitter reproaches, had his\nlimbs confined in irons, and was thus carried back to a punishment that\nseemed more terrible than death.In fetters he became so furious, that\nthey found it necessary to take them off, and, from that time, his\nexaminations assumed another character, as he defended his positions\nwith citations from the Council of Trent, and with some passages of\nscripture, which he explained in the most Romish sense, discovering\na depth of ignorance in Don Fernando that was truly surprising.That\n\'grand Inquisitor,\' had never heard the passage which Dellon quoted to\nprove the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, \'Except a man be born\nof water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\'Neither did he know anything of that famous passage in the twenty-fifth\nsession of the Council of Trent, which declares that images are only to\nbe reverenced on account of the persons whom they represent.He\ncalled for a Bible, and for the acts of the council, and was evidently\nsurprised when he found them where Dellon told him they might be seen."The time for a general auto drew near.During the months of November\nand December, 1675, he heard every morning the cries of persons under\ntorture, and afterwards saw many of them, both men and women, lame and\ndistorted by the rack.On Sunday January 11th, 1676, he was surprised\nby the jailer refusing to receive his linen to be washed--Sunday being\nwashing-day in the \'holy house.\'While perplexing himself to think\nwhat that could mean, the cathedral bells rang for vespers, and then,\ncontrary to custom, rang again for matins.He could only account for\nthat second novelty by supposing that an auto would be celebrated the\nnext day.They brought him supper, which he refused, and, contrary to\ntheir wont at all other times, they did not insist on his taking it, but\ncarried it away.Assured that those were all portents of the horrible\ncatastrophe, and reflecting on often-repeated threats in the audience\nchamber that he should be burnt, he gave himself up to death, and\noverwhelmed with sorrow, fell asleep a little before midnight."Scarcely had he fallen asleep when the alcayde and guards entered the\ncell, with great noise, bringing a lamp, for the first time since his\nimprisonment that they had allowed a lamp to shine there.The alcayde,\nlaying down a suit of clothes, bade him put them on, and be ready to go\nout when he came again.At two o\'clock in the morning they returned, and\nhe issued from the cell, clad in a black vest and trowsers, striped with\nwhite, and his feet bare.About two hundred prisoners, of whom he\nwas one, were made to sit on the floor, along the sides of a spacious\ngallery, all in the same black livery, and just visible by the\ngleaming of a few lamps.A large company of women were also ranged in a\nneighboring gallery in like manner.But they were all motionless, and\nno one knew his doom.Every eye was fixed, and each one seemed benumbed\nwith misery."A third company Dellon perceived in a room not far distant, but they\nwere walking about, and some appeared to have long habits.Those were\npersons condemned to be delivered to the secular arm, and the long\nhabits distinguished confessors busily collecting confessions in order\nto commute that penalty for some other scarcely less dreadful.At four\no\'clock, servants of the house came, with guards, and gave bread and\nfigs to those who would accept the refreshment.One of the guards gave\nDellon some hope of life by advising him to take what was offered,\nwhich he had refused to do.\'Take your bread,\' said the man, \'and if you\ncannot eat it now, put it in your pocket; you will be certainly hungry\nbefore you return.\'This gave hope, that he should not end the day at\nthe stake, but come back to undergo penance."A little before sunrise, the great bell of the cathedral tolled, and\nits sound soon aroused the city of Goa.The people ran into the streets,\nlining the chief thoroughfares, and crowding every place whence a view\ncould be had of the procession.Day broke, and Dellon saw the faces\nof his fellow-prisoners, most of whom were Indians.He could only\ndistinguish, by their complexion, about twelve Europeans.Every\ncountenance exhibited shame, fear, grief, or an appalling blackness of\napathy, AS IF DIRE SUFFERING IN THE LIGHTLESS DUNGEONS UNDERNEATH HAD\nBEREFT THEM OF INTELLECT.The company soon began to move, but slowly,\nas one by one the alcayde led them towards the door of the great hall,\nwhere the grand inquisitor sat, and his secretary called the name of\neach as he came, and the name of a sponsor, who also presented himself\nfrom among a crowd of the bettermost inhabitants of Goa, assembled there\nfor that service.\'The general of the Portuguese ships in the Indies\'\nhad the honor of placing himself beside our Frenchman.As soon as the\nprocession was formed, it marched off in the usual order."First, the Dominicans, honored with everlasting precedence on all such\noccasions, led the way.Singing-boys also preceded, chanting a litany.The banner of the Inquisition was intrusted to their hands.After the\nbanner walked the penitents--a penitent and a sponsor, two and two.A\ncross bearer brought up the train, carrying a crucifix aloft, turned\ntowards them, in token of pity; and, on looking along the line, you\nmight have seen another priest going before the penitents with a\ncrucifix turned backwards, inviting their devotions.They to whom the\nInquisition no longer afforded mercy, walked behind the penitents, and\ncould only see an averted crucifix.These were condemned to be burnt\nalive at the stake!On this occasion there were but two of this class,\nbut sometimes a large number were sentenced to this horrible death, and\npresented to the spectator a most pitiable spectacle.Many of them\nbore upon their persons the marks of starvation, torture, terror, and\nheart-rending grief.Some faces were bathed in tears, while others\ncame forth with a smile of conquest on the countenance and words of\ntriumphant faith bursting from the lips.These, however, were known as\ndogmatizers, and were generally gagged, the month being filled with a\npiece of wood kept in by a strong leather band fastened behind the head,\nand the arms tied together behind the back.Two armed familiars walked\nor rode beside each of these, and two ecclesiastics, or some other\nclerks or regulars, also attended.After these, the images of heretics\nwho had escaped were carried aloft, to be thrown into the flames; and\nporters came last, tagging under the weight of boxes containing the\ndisinterred bodies on which the execution of the church had fallen, and\nwhich were also to be burnt."Poor Dellon went barefoot, like the rest, through the streets of Goa,\nrough with little flint stones scattered about, and sorely were his feet\nwounded during an hour\'s march up and down the principal streets.Weary,\ncovered with shame and confusion, the long train of culprits entered\nthe church of St.Francis, where preparation was made for the auto, the\nclimate of India not permitting a celebration of that solemnity\nunder the burning sky.They sat with their sponsors, in the galleries\nprepared, sambenitos, grey zamarras with painted flames and devils,\ncorozas, tapers, and all the other paraphernalia of an auto, made up a\nwoeful spectacle.The inquisitor and other personages having taken their\nseats of state, the provincial of the Augustinians mounted the pulpit\nand delivered the sermon.Dellon preserved but one note of it.The\npreacher compared the Inquisition to Noah\'s ark, which received all\nsorts of beasts WILD, but sent them out TAME.The appearance of hundreds\nwho had been inmates of that ark certainly justified the figure."After the sermon, two readers went up, one after the other, into the\nsame pulpit, and, between them, they read the processes and pronounced\nthe sentences, the person standing before them, with the alcayde, and\nholding a lighted taper in his hand.Dellon, in turn, heard the cause\nof his long-suffering.He had maintained the invalidity of baptismus\nflaminis, or desire to be baptised, when there is no one to administer\nthe rite of baptism by water.He had said that images ought not to be\nadored, and that an ivory crucifix was a piece of ivory.He had spoken\ncontemptuously of the Inquisition.And, above all, he had an ill\nintention.His punishment was to be confiscation of his property,\nbanishment from India, and five years\' service in the galleys in\nPortugal, with penance, as the inquisitors might enjoin.As all the\nprisoners were excommunicate, the inquisitor, after the sentence had\nbeen pronounced, put on his alb and stole, walked into the middle of the\nchurch, and absolved them all at once.Dellon\'s sponsor, who would not\neven answer him before, when he spoke, now embraced him, called him\nbrother, and gave him a pinch of snuff, in token of reconciliation."But there were two persons, a man and a woman, for whom the church had\nno more that they could do; and these, with four dead bodies, and the\neffigies of the dead, were taken to be burnt on the Campo Santo Lazaro,\non the river side, the place appointed for that purpose, that the\nviceroy might see justice done on the heretics, as he surveyed the\nexecution from his palace-windows."The remainder of Dellon\'s history adds nothing to what we have already\nheard of the Inquisition.He was taken to Lisbon, and, after working in\na gang of convicts for some time, was released on the intercession of\nsome friends in France with the Portuguese government.With regard to\nhis despair, and attempts to commit suicide, when in the holy house,\nwe may observe that, as he states, suicide was very frequent there.The contrast of his disconsolate impatience with the resignation and\nconstancy of Christian confessors in similar circumstances, is obvious.As a striking illustration of the difference between those who suffer\nwithout a consciousness of divine favor, and those who rejoice with joy\nunspeakable and full of glory, we would refer the reader to that noble\nband of martyrs who suffered death at the stake, at the Auto held in\nSeville, on Sunday, September 24, 1559.At that time twenty-one\nwere burnt, followed by one effigy, and eighteen penitents, who were\nreleased."One of the former was Don Juan Gonzales, Presbyter of Seville, an\neminent preacher.With admirable constancy he refused to make any\ndeclaration, in spite of the severe torture, saying that he had not\nfollowed any erroneous opinions, but that he had drawn his faith from\nthe holy Scriptures; and for this faith he pleaded to his tormentors in\nthe words of inspiration.He maintained that he was not a heretic, but\na Christian, and absolutely refused to divulge anything that would bring\nhis brethren into trouble.Two sisters of his were also brought out to\nthis Auto, and displayed equal faith.They would confess Christ, they\nsaid, and suffer with their brother, whom they revered as a wise and\nholy man.They were all tied to stakes on the quemadero, a piece of\npavement, without the walls of the city, devoted to the single use of\nburning human victims.Sometimes this quemadero [Footnote: Llorente, the\nhistorian of the Spanish Inquisition, says, "So many persons were to be\nput to death by fire, the governor of Seville caused a permanent raised\nplatform of masonry to be constructed outside the city, which has\nlasted to our time (until the French revolution) retaining its name of\nQuemadero, or burning-place, and at the four corners four large hollow\nstalutes of limestone, within which they used to place the impenitent\nalive, that they might die by slow fires."]was a raised platform of\nstone, adorned with pillows or surrounded with statues, to distinguish\nand beautify the spot.Just as the fire was lit, the gag, which had\nhitherto silenced Don Juan, was removed, and as the flames burst from\nthe fagots, he said to his sisters, \'Let us sing, Deus laudem meam ne\ntacueris.\'And they sang together, while burning, \'Hold not thy peace,\nO God of my praise; for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the\ndeceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a\nlying tongue.\'Thus they died in the faith of Christ, and of his holy\ngospel."INQUISITION OF GOA, CONCLUDED.The Inquisition of Goa continued its Autos for a century after the\naffair of Dellon.Claudius Buchanan visited\nthat city, and had been unexpectedly invited by Joseph a Doloribus,\nsecond and most active inquisitor, to lodge with him during his\nvisit.Buchanan found himself, heretic,\nschismatic, and rebel as he was, politely entertained by so dread a\npersonage.Regarding his English visitor merely as a literary man, or\nprofessing to do so, Friar Joseph, himself well educated, seemed to\nenjoy his company, and was unreservedly communicative on every subject\nnot pertaining to his own vocation.When that subject was first\nintroduced by an apparently incidental question, he did not hesitate\nto return the desired information, telling Dr.Buchanan that the\nestablishment was nearly as extensive as in former times.In the library\nof the chief inquisitor he saw a register containing the names of all\nthe officers, who still were numerous.John went to the hallway.On the second evening after his arrival, the doctor was surprised to see\nhis host come from his apartment, clothed in black robes from head to\nfoot, instead of white, the usual color of his order (Augustinian).He\nsaid that he was going to sit on the tribunal of the holy office, and it\ntranspired that, so far from his "august office" not occupying much of\nhis time, he had to sit there three or four days every week.After his\nreturn, in the evening, the doctor put Dellon\'s book into his hand,\nasking him if he had ever seen it.John went back to the garden.He had never seen it before, and,\nafter reading aloud and slowly, "Relation de l\'Inquisition de Goa,"\nbegan to peruse it with eagerness.Buchanan employed himself in writing, Friar Joseph devoured\npage after page; but as the narrative proceeded, betrayed evident\nsymptoms of uneasiness.He then turned to the middle, looked at the end,\nskimmed over the table of contents, fixed on its principal passages,\nand at one place exclaimed, in his broad Italian accent, "Mendacium!The doctor requested him to mark the passages that were\nuntrue, proposed to discuss them afterwards, and said he had other books\non the subject.The mention of other books startled him; he looked up\nanxiously at some books on the table, and then gave himself up to the\nperusal of Dellon\'s "Relation," until bedtime.Even then, he asked\npermission to take it to his chamber.The doctor had fallen asleep under the roof of the inquisitor\'s convent,\nconfident, under God, in the protection at that time guaranteed to\na British subject, his servants sleeping in the gallery outside\nthe chamber-door.About midnight, he was waked by loud shrieks and\nexpressions of terror from some one in the gallery.In the first moment\nof surprise, he concluded it must be the alguazils of the holy office\nseizing his servants to carry them to the Inquisition.But, on going\nout, he saw the servants standing at the door, and the person who\nhad caused the alarm, a boy of about fourteen, at a little distance,\nsurrounded by some of the priests, who had come out of their cells on\nhearing the noise.The boy said he had seen a spectre; and it was a\nconsiderable time before the agitations of his body and voice\nsubsided.Next morning at breakfast, the inquisitor apologized for\nthe disturbance, and said the boy\'s alarm proceeded from a phantasma\nanimi,--phantom of the imagination.Phantoms might well haunt such a place.As to\nDellon\'s book, the inquisitor acknowledged that the descriptions\nwere just; but complained that he had misjudged the motives of the\ninquisitors, and written uncharitably of Holy Church.Their conversation\ngrew earnest, and the inquisitor was anxious to impress his visitor with\nthe idea that the Inquisition had undergone a change in some respects,\nand that its terrors were mitigated.Buchanan plainly\nrequested to see the Inquisition, that he might judge for himself as to\nthe humanity shown to the inmates,--according to the inquisitor,--and\ngave, as a reason why he should be satisfied, his interest in the\naffairs of India, on which he had written, and his purpose to write on\nthem again, in which case he could scarcely be silent concerning the\nInquisition.The countenance of his host fell; but, after some further\nobservations, he reluctantly promised to comply.Next morning, after\nbreakfast, Joseph a Doloribus went to dress for the holy office, and\nsoon returned in his black robes.He said he would go half an hour\nbefore the usual time, for the purpose of showing him the Inquisition.The doctor fancied he looked more severe than usual, and that his\nattendants were not as civil as before.But the truth was, that the\nmidnight scene still haunted him.They had proceeded in their palanquins\nto the holy house, distant about a quarter of a mile from the convent,\nand the inquisitor said as they were ascending the steps of the great\nentrance, that he hoped the doctor would be satisfied with a transient\nview of the Inquisition, and would retire when he should desire him to\ndo so.The doctor followed with tolerable confidence, towards the\ngreat hall aforementioned, where they were met by several well-dressed\npersons, familiars, as it afterwards appeared, who bowed very low to the\ninquisitor, and looked with surprise at the stranger.Buchanan paced\nthe hall slowly, and in thoughtful silence; the inquisitor thoughtful\ntoo, silent and embarrassed.A multitude of victims seemed to haunt the\nplace, and the doctor could not refrain from breaking silence."Would\nnot the Holy Church wish, in her mercy, to have those souls back again,\nthat she might allow them a little further probation?"The inquisitor\nanswered nothing, but beckoned him to go with him to a door at one end\nof the hall.By that door he conducted him to some small rooms, and\nthence, to the spacious apartments of the chief inquisitor.Having\nsurveyed those, he brought him back again to the great hall, and seemed\nanxious that the troublesome visitor should depart; but only the very\nwords of Dr.B. can adequately describe the close of this extraordinary\ninterview.""Now, father," said I, "lead me to the dungeons below: I want to see the\ncaptives.""No," said he, "that cannot be."I now began to suspect that\nit had been in the mind of the inquisitor, from the beginning, to show\nme only a']

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['"I thought you\'d come to your senses," he said, in a tone of\nsatisfaction."Kape her safe, old woman, till she knows how to behave."In silent misery the little girl sat down and watched Mrs.Donovan as\nshe cleared away the table, and washed the dishes.It was dull and\nhopeless work for her.Mordaunt and Dan,\nand wished she could be with them again.The thought so saddened her that she burst into a low moan, which\nat once drew the attention of Mrs."I can\'t help it," moaned Althea.See here, now," and the woman displayed the whip\nwith which her husband had threatened the child."I\'ll give ye something\nto cry for.""Oh, don\'t--don\'t beat me!""Ye want to run away," said Mrs.John went to the bathroom.I mean I won\'t unless you let me."asked Althea, with her little heart\nsinking at the thought."No, Katy, you may go wid me when I go to the market," answered Mrs."Shure, if you\'ll be a good gal, I\'ll give you all the pleasure\nI can."Althea waited half an hour, and then was provided with a ragged\nsun-bonnet, with which, concealing her sad face, she emerged from the\nhouse, and walked to a small market, where Mrs.Donovan obtained her\nsupplies for dinner.Troubled as she was, Althea looked about her with a child\'s curiosity on\nher way through the strange streets.It served to divert her from her\nsorrow."Shure it\'s my little Katy," said the woman, with a significant wink\nwhich prevented further questioning.Althea wished to deny this, but she did not dare to.She had become\nafraid of her new guardians.She felt\nsure that he would take her away from these wicked people, but how was\nDan to know where she was.The poor child\'s lips quivered, and she could\nhardly refrain from crying.It was so late when Dan heard of Althea\'s disappearance that he felt it\nnecessary to wait till morning before taking any steps toward her\nrecovery."I\'ll find her, mother," he said, confidently."Do not lie awake\nthinking of her, for it won\'t do any good."I didn\'t know how much I loved the dear child\ntill I lost her.""I am not so hopeful as you, Dan.I fear that I shall never see her\nagain."Now, mother, I am going to bed, but I shall be up\nbright and early in the morning, and then to work.""You won\'t have any time, Dan.Rogers,\ntelling him my reasons, and he will be sure not to object.If Althea is\nto be found, I will find her within a week."Mordaunt some courage, but she could not\nfeel as sanguine of success as Dan.In the morning Dan sought out Nancy, and took down her account of how\nthe little girl had been spirited away."So she went away in a carriage, Nancy?""Can you tell me what sort of a looking man it was that took her away?"I was struck dumb, you see, wid hearing how your\nmother broke her leg, and I didn\'t think to look at him sharp.""You can tell if he was an old man or a young one."He was betwixt and betwane."Now, what kind of a carriage was it?""Jist a hack like them at the square.""No; shure they all look alike to me."Dan made more inquiries, but elicited nothing further that was likely to\nbe of service to him.After a little reflection he decided to go to Union Square and\ninterview some of the drivers waiting for passengers there.He did so, but the driver who had actually been employed by Hartley was\nabsent, and he learned nothing.One driver, however, remembered carrying\na gentleman and child to a house on Twenty-seventh street, between\nEighth and Ninth avenues.Dan thought the clew of sufficient importance to be followed up.His\ncourage rose when, on inquiring at the house mentioned, he learned that\na child had actually been brought there."May I see the child, madam?""If you like," answered the lady, in surprise.She appeared in a short time with a boy of about Althea\'s age."It is a little girl I am inquiring after," he said.John journeyed to the kitchen."You would\nhave saved me some trouble.""I begin to think I am not as good a detective as I thought," said Dan\nto himself."I am on a false scent, that is sure."When he had been asking questions of the cab-drivers he had not been\nunobserved.John Hartley, who knew Dan by sight, laughed in his sleeve\nas he noted our hero\'s inquiries."You may be a smart boy, my lad," he said to himself, "but I don\'t think\nyou\'ll find the child.I have a great mind to give you a hint."He approached Dan, and observed, in a friendly way:\n\n"Are you in search of your little sister?""Yes, sir," returned Dan, eagerly."I am not sure, but possibly I may.I occupy a room directly opposite\nthe house in which you board.""Did you see Althea carried away?""Yes; I was sitting at my window when I saw a hack stop at your door.The door-bell was rung by a man who descended from the hack, and shortly\nafterward your sister came out, and was put into the carriage.""What was the man\'s appearance, sir?"So much the better," thought Hartley, with satisfaction."He was a little taller than myself, I should say," he answered, "and I\nbelieve his hair was brown"--Hartley\'s was black."I am sorry I can\'t\nremember more particularly."I came down into the street before the cab\ndrove away, and I heard the gentleman referred to say, in a low voice,\n\'Drive to Harlem.\'""Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully."That puts me on the right\ntrack."I wish I could tell you more," said Hartley, with a queer smile."If you find your little sister, I should be glad if you would let me\nknow," continued Hartley, chuckling inwardly."I will, sir, if you will let me know your name and address.""My name is John Franklin, and I live in the house directly opposite\nyours, No."All right, sir; I will note it down."John Hartley looked after Dan with a smile."My dear young friend," he said to himself, "it goes to my heart to\ndeceive you, you are so innocent and confiding.I wish you much joy of\nyour search in Harlem.I think it will be some time before I receive\nintelligence of your success.Still I will keep my room here, and look\nafter you a little.I am really afraid your business will suffer while\nyou are wandering about."John Hartley had already written to London, and he was prepared to wait\nthree weeks or more for an answer to his proposition.Meanwhile he had\none source of uneasiness.His funds were getting low, and unless Harriet\nVernon responded favorably to his proposal, he was liable to be\nseriously embarrassed.He had on previous similar occasions had recourse\nto the gaming-table, but Fortune did not always decide in his favor.He\ndid not dare to hazard the small sum he had on hand, lest want of\nsuccess should imperil the bold scheme for obtaining an income at his\nchild\'s expense.At this critical point in his fortunes he fell in with a Western\nadventurer, who, by a sort of freemasonry, recognizing Hartley\'s want of\ncharacter, cautiously sounded him as to becoming a partner in a\nhazardous but probably profitable enterprise.It was to procure some\ngenuine certificates of stock in a Western railway for a small number of\nshares, say five or ten, and raise them ingeniously to fifty and a\nhundred, and then pledge them as collateral in Wall street for a\ncorresponding sum of money.John Hartley, if an honest man, would have indignantly declined the\novertures; but he was not endowed with Roman virtue.He made a cautious\ninvestigation to ascertain how great was the danger of detection, and\nhow well the enterprise would pay.The answer to the second question was\nso satisfactory that he made up his mind to run the necessary risk.Blake and he came to a definite understanding, and matters were put in\ntrain.Certificates were readily obtained, and by the help of a skillful\naccomplice, who did the work for a specified sum, were ingeniously\nraised tenfold.Then Blake, assuming the dress and manners of a thriving business man\nfrom Syracuse, negotiated a loan, pledging the raised certificate as\ncollateral.The private banker put it away among his securities without\na doubt or suspicion, and Blake and Hartley divided a thousand dollars\nbetween them.John Hartley was very much elated by his success.The pecuniary\nassistance came just in the nick of time, when his purse was very low."It\'s a good thing to have more than one string to your bow," he\nthought."Not but that my little game in getting hold of the child is\nlikely to pay well.Harriet Vernon will find that I have the whip-hand\nof her.She must come to my terms, sooner or later."At that very moment Harriet Vernon was embarking at Liverpool on a\nCunard steamer.She had received the letter of her brother-in-law, and\ndecided to answer it in person.DAN DISGUISES HIMSELF.For several days Dan strolled about Harlem, using his eyes to good\nadvantage.As a pretext he carried with him a few morning papers for\nsale.Armed with these he entered shops and saloons without exciting\nsurprise or suspicion.But he discovered not a trace of the lost girl.One day, as he was riding home in the Third avenue cars, there flashed\nupon his mind a conviction that he was on a wrong scent."Is it probable that the man who carried away Althea would give the\nright direction so that it could be overheard by a third party?No; it\nwas probably meant as a blind, and I have been just fool enough to fall\ninto the trap."Before the day was over they were wholly opened.He met John Hartley on\nBroadway toward the close of the afternoon."Well, have you heard anything of your sister?"he asked, with an\nappearance of interest."Keep on, you will find her in time."After they parted, Dan, happening to look back, detected a mocking\nglance in the face of his questioner, and a new discovery flashed upon\nhim.He had sent him to Harlem,\npurposely misleading him."Can he have had anything to do\nwith the abduction of Althea?"This was a question which he could not satisfactorily answer, but he\nresolved to watch Hartley, and follow him wherever he went, in the hope\nof obtaining some clew.Of course he must assume some disguise, as\nHartley must not recognize him.He hired a room on East Fourth street for a week, and then sought an\nItalian boy to whom he had occasionally given a few pennies, and with\nsome difficulty (for Giovanni knew but little English, and he no\nItalian) proposed that the Italian should teach him to sing and play\n"Viva Garibaldi."Dan could play a little on the violin, and soon\nqualified himself for his new business.At a second-hand shop on Chatham street he picked up a suit of tattered\nvelvet, obtained a liquid with which to stain his skin to a dark brown,\nand then started out as an Italian street musician.His masquerade suit\nhe kept in his room at East Fourth street, changing therefrom his street\ndress morning and evening.When in full masquerade he for the first time\nsang and played, Giovanni clapped his hands with delight.Giovanni was puzzled to understand why Dan took so much pains to enter\nupon a hard and unprofitable profession, but Dan did not enlighten him\nas to his motive.He thought it most prudent to keep his secret, even from his mother.One\nday he met her on the sidewalk, and began to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Mordaunt listened without a suspicion that it was her own son, and\ngave him two pennies, which he acknowledged by a low bow, and "Grazia,\nsignora.""I hope his padrone does not beat him," said Mrs."I hear these poor boys are much abused.I wonder if I can make him\nunderstand?"Si, signora, padrone," answered Dan."It is no use; he doesn\'t understand English.Here is some more money\nfor you," and she handed him a five-cent coin."Its a wise mother that knows her own child," thought Dan.Hartley boarded a University Place car, and Dan jumped on also.Italian boys so seldom ride that the conductor eyed Dan with some\nsuspicion."I thought you might be expecting to ride for nothing," said the\nconductor."Seems to me you\'re flush for an Italian fiddler.""And I don\'t understand your lingo."A charitable lady inside the car chanced to see Dan, and it occurred to\nher that she would do him a service."If the conductor doesn\'t object, you may sing while we are on our way."You can sing and play," said the conductor, good-naturedly.Dan was not at all desirous of doing this, for Hartley sat only three\nfeet from him, and he feared he might recognize him, but it would not be\nin character to refuse, so he began, and sang his one air, playing an\naccompaniment.Several of the passengers handed him small coins, among\nthem Hartley."I can\'t agree with you, ma\'am," said Hartley."I would rather give him\nmoney to stop.""His voice strikes me as very rich, and the Italian is such a beautiful\nlanguage.""I have heard a good deal better performers even among the street boys,"\nsaid Hartley."So have I," said Dan to himself."He doesn\'t suspect me; I am glad of\nthat."Hartley remained in the car till it reached the Astor House, and so, of\ncourse, did Dan.In fact, Hartley was on his way to Brooklyn to pay\nanother installment to the guardians of the little girl whom he had\ncarried off.Hartley kept on his way to Fulton Ferry, Dan following at a prudent\ndistance.Had Hartley looked back, he would have suspected nothing, for he had not\npenetrated Dan\'s disguise, and would therefore have been quite at a loss\nto understand any connection between the street musician and himself.They both boarded the same ferry-boat, and landed in Brooklyn together.At this moment Hartley turned round, and his glance fell upon Dan."Si, signor," answered Dan, bowing deferentially."I sing, I play," said our hero."It is lucky you don\'t, or you might not like my compliment.""Shall I sing \'Viva Garibaldi?\'"Here, take\nthis money, and don\'t sing.""Si, signor," answered Dan, assuming a look of bewilderment.Hartley prepared to board a car, which was not yet ready to start.Dan\nrapidly decided that it would not do for him to follow Hartley any\nfarther.Looking about him, his eye fell\non a bright-looking newsboy of about twelve."Do you want to make some money, Johnny?""Did you speak to me, Garibaldi?""Yes, but I am no Italian," said Dan, rapidly."I am on the track of\nthat man, but he suspects me.I will give you a dollar if you will jump\non the car and find out where he goes."Pay your expenses out of it, and I will pay you back when you\nreport to me."The newsboy ran, jumped on the car, and it moved on."It is the best thing I could do," thought Dan."I hope the boy is\nsharp, and won\'t lose sight of him.I feel sure that he had something\nto do with carrying off poor little Althea."For two hours Dan lingered near the ferry, playing occasionally by way\nof filling up the time.It seemed to be a good location, for he received\nfrom fifty to sixty cents from passers-by."When hard times come," thought Dan, "I shall know what to do.I will\nbecome an Italian street singer."After two hours the newsboy jumped off an incoming car, and approached\nDan.DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan\'s eyes sparkled with joy at the success of his plan."Now tell me," he said, drawing the newsboy aside to a place where they\nwould not be overheard."You\'ve made a fortun\' by fiddling, you have," said the newsboy, in\nsurprise.The newsboy described his following Hartley to Donovan\'s.Hartley went in, and he directly afterward."Perhaps he only went in for a drink," suggested Dan, uneasily.Mary travelled to the garden."No, he didn\'t call for nothing to drink.I saw him take out some money\nand give to the man and the woman."I axed old Donovan to buy a paper, and he wouldn\'t.Then I\nsat down for a minute, makin\' believe I was tired.They looked at me,\nbut I didn\'t appear to be noticin\' \'em, and they let me stay.""Did you see anything of a little girl?""Yes, there was a little gal came in.Donovan\'s daughter, he feared, not the\nchild he was seeking.He added a description of the little girl which quite revived Dan\'s\nhopes, for it answered in every respect to Althea."Did you hear the little girl say anything?""Yes, she told her mother she wanted to see Dan.""You needn\'t tell me any more."Have you found out what you want to know?"Have you anything to do for the next two hours?""Then I\'ll pay you another dollar to go to the place with me.I think I\ncould find it myself, but I can\'t take any chances.And don\'t say a word\nabout what you have seen.""She is my adopted sister, and she has been stolen from us.""Then I\'d be willing to help you for nothing.I\'ve got a little sister\nabout her size.If anybody stole her, I\'d mash him!"The two boys boarded a car, and in forty minutes got out."That\'s the place," said the newsboy, pointing out Donovan\'s, only a few\nrods away.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.You\'d better leave me now, or you may be remembered, and\nthat would lead them to suspect me.If I do, it\'ll be through your help."He stopped in the street, and began\nto sing "Viva Garibaldi."Two or three boys gathered about him, and finally a couple of men.One\nof them handed him a three-cent piece."Grazio, signor," said Dan, pulling off his hat."What part of Italy do you come from?""Si, signor, I come from Italy," answered Dan, not considering it\nprudent to understand too well."His hair doesn\'t look like that of most Italians."I\'d know him for an Italian boy anywhere."At this moment the door of the saloon opened, and Dan, putting his\nviolin under his arm, entered.One was an Irishman, the other a German.Both\nhad evidently drank more than was good for them.Dan looked in vain for\nAlthea."Well, boy, what do you want?"asked Dan, uncertain whether he was talking\nas an Italian boy might be expected to."No; I don\'t want to hear any fiddle-scraping.""Shure, let him play a little, Mister Donovan," said the Irishman."Just as you like," said Donovan, carelessly, "only I have no money for\nhim."Dan struck up his one tune--Viva Garibaldi--but the Irishman did not\nseem to care for that."Oh, bother ould Garibaldi!"Sandra journeyed to the garden.Accordingly he tried to play an air popular enough at the time, but\nmade bad work of it.exclaimed the German, who had a better musical ear\nthan the Irishman."Here, lend me your fiddle, boy."He took the violin, and in spite of his inebriety, managed to play a\nGerman air upon it."Shure you bate the boy at his own trade," said the Irishman.The German indicated his preference, and the Irishman called for whisky."I no drink," answered our hero, shaking his head."Shure you\'re an Italian wonder, and it\'s Barnum ought to hire you.""Then you\'re a haythen," said Pat Moriarty.He gulped down the whisky, and finding it more convenient to sit than to\nstand, fell back upon a settee."I wish Althea would come in," thought Dan.At that moment a heavy fall was heard in the room overhead, and a\nchild\'s shrill scream directly afterward."Something\'s happened to my wife," muttered Donovan.He hurried up stairs, and the German followed.This gave Dan an excuse\nfor running up, too.Donovan had been drinking more copiously than usual.While in this\ncondition she imprudently got upon a chair to reach a pitcher from an\nupper shelf.Her footing was uncertain, and she fell over, pitcher in\nhand, the chair sharing in the downfall.When her husband entered the room she was lying flat on her back,\ngrasping the handle of the pitcher, her eyes closed, and her breathing\nstertorious.Althea, alarmed, stood over her, crying and screaming."The old woman\'s taken too much," said Donovan.he\nshouted, leaning over his matrimonial partner."Ain\'t you ashamed of\nyourself, now?"Donovan opened her eyes, and stared at him vacantly."On your back, you old fool, where you deserve to be.""It\'s the whisky," murmured the fallen lady.Why can\'t you drink dacent like me?Shure it\'s a purty\nexample you\'re settin\' to the child.Ain\'t you ashamed to lie here in a\nhape before them gintlemen?"This called Althea\'s attention to the German and Dan.In spite of Dan\'s\ndisguise, she recognized him with a cry of joy.she exclaimed, dashing past\nDonovan, and clasping her arms round the supposed Italian.exclaimed Donovan, looking at the two in surprise."Oh, it\'s my brother Dan," exclaimed Althea."You\'ll take me away, won\'t\nyou, Dan?"So that\'s your game, my young chicken, is it?"demanded Donovan,\nseizing our hero roughly by the shoulder.Then pulling off Dan\'s hat, he\nadded: "You\'re no more Italian than I am."Dan saw that it would be useless to keep up the deceit any longer.He\nlooked Donovan full in the face, and said, firmly:\n\n"You are right, Mr.Donovan, I have come here for my sister."Donovan\'s red face turned fairly purple with rage.Why, I could crush you with my little\nfinger.""I have not insulted you," said Dan."I don\'t know anything about your sister."That little girl is my adopted sister," said Dan, pointing to Althea."Ask her if she doesn\'t know me.""That is my daughter, Katy Donovan," said the saloon keeper."No, I am not," said Althea, beginning to cry."I want to go away with\nmy brother Dan."Donovan," (by\nthis time she was on her feet, looking on in a dazed sort of way), "is\nnot this our little Katy?""You see, young man, you\'re mistaken.You can leave," and Donovan waved\nhis hand triumphantly.I can bring plenty of proof that Althea was until a week since\nliving with my mother."said Donovan, contemptuously snapping his\nfingers."I know who stole her, and who brought her to this house," continued\nDan."The same man has been here to-day," added Dan.How much does he pay you for taking\ncare of the girl?""I can\'t waste my time\ntalkin\' wid you."No, I won\'t, unless Althea goes with me," said Dan, firmly.We\'ll see about that," and Donovan, making a rush,\nseized Dan in his arms, and carried him down stairs, despite our hero\'s\nresistance."I\'ll tache you to come here insultin\' your betters!"Dan struggled to get away, but though a strong boy, he was not a match\nfor a powerful man, and could not effect his deliverance.The Irishman\nalready referred to was still upon the settee.he asked, as the saloon-keeper appeared with his\nburden."What\'s the lad been doin\'?""What\'s he been doin\', is it?He\'s been insultin\' me to my face--that\'s\nwhat the Donovans won\'t stand."Don\'t trouble me wid your questions, but do as I tell you.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,\nwith a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,\nback of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot\nfor several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for\nhours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in\nthis passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one\'s\nleisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old\ngentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they\nwere youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting\nfor the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this\nsmall "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the\nchildren of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their\nlittle, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three\nwho compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its\nservice--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows\nevery child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the\nhangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical\npersonages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a\ncareworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,\nyearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must\nlaugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the\nsous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known\nsince its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their\ngay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and\nmany of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and\nBrittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you\nsee a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very\nbelittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique\nFrancaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate\nfor the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at\nside, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the\nmoment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot\nnear the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his\nfiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under\nthis system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given\nin marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be\nfree, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an\nelopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]\n\nThe music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A\nfew linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady\nwho rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long\nshadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,\namong the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes\nthe great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,\nbehind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to\ndine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange\ncontrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its\nhabitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these\nhappy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking\ncourses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high\nrank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,\nwith that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of\ntheir race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of\ndarker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every\nclime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter\nand become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems\nout of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its\nexclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from\nthe East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back\nfrom their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they\nwill impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining\nthere nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of\nBohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary\'s porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon\ncamarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent\nnew-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few\ntrees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly\npolite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner\nis warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none\nthe less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she\nwill sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and\nthe other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]\n\nThis later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and\ngirls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come\nin and help shell the peas for to-morrow\'s dinner.And yet this is a\npublic place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what\none orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who\nare dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and\nwhat, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the\nlittle girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with\nRenould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to\nwelcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier\nbetween the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly\ncrowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette\nand the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and\nsculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these\nstrangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that\nqueer little \'type\' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually\nkissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,\nand besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a\nParisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered\nthrough the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but\nif those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You\nwill find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the\nlittle refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity\nand kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one\nwish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX\n\n"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"\n\n\nThere are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country\nvillage.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy\nslaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant\nlots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,\nsmoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if\npointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these\nragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for\nfootpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of\nstudios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their\never-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that\nany of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after\nwandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a\nfew bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the\ngentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the\nstudents were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and\nready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate\nand forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at\nthe fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear\nof such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of\nwar.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and\ngipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans\nat certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within\nthe Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]\n\nAnd very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of\nhalf a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these\nshiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil\ntorches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain\nthat hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,\nso short that the muzzle of one\'s rifle nearly rests upon the painted\nlady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a\nbull\'s-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,\nwhich is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of\nstudents--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a\ncircus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by\nthe enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de\nNeuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and\ncontinues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth\ncarousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within\nthe circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ\nshakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white\nwooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and\nswoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and\nshouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built\noriginally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a\nfellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"\nin a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an\nold circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and\nintelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no\nlanguage but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant\npersonality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and\nthe pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,\nand with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a\nnewspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of\nthe hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]\n\nHere we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no\ngreasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning\ncountenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,\nthere were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of\nFrench Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign\nabout the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown\nthe entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had\ngathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had\nleft their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves\nstranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the\nAfrican war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,\nto brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and\ngiving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,\nthe sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an\nunpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the\ncurtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and\nhigh-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the\nstage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with\nits high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems\nto penetrate one\'s whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill\nof the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled\nthe latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,\nand sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its\nlock.went the Signore\'s revolver, as he drove the snarling,\nroaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver\ndrifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked\nslowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he\napproached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the\nothers slunk into the opposite corner.Daniel went to the bathroom.The man\'s head was but half a\nfoot now from the lion\'s; he menaced the beast with the little\nriding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his\nblack nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped\nawkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the\nrest, into the corner.It was the little\nriding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the\nheavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken\nhis seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green\nstock, but a swell act, eh?I\'ve got a\ngirl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she\'s a\ndream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the\nwings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in\nfull fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a\npowerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of\nthe trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\n"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she\'s new to the\nshow business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a\nchocolate factory until she saw my \'ad\' last week and joined my show.We\ngave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She\'s\na good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in\nfront.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her\ntwo violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and\nafter that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby\nmustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have\nto excuse me.*     *     *     *     *\n\nThere are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are\nalive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public\ninstitutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking\ngarden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the\nBoulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it\nseems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from\nthere on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of\nmarket and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the\nLatin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed\na fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a\nBohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing\nsojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of\nthe Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]\n\nBut the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner\ngentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom\nFortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to\n"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a\nsource of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they\nhad been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they\nexpressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,\nfor it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and\nVienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every\nMinute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,\nleaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of\ndancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this\nin Chicago they\'d tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he\nwiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his\ntwenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between\nhis teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to\nhimself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in\nsmiles.he called to one of the \'copper twins,\' "did you get on\nto that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record\nof refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in\npassing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this\nto the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they\'ll\nhave"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and\nthe garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe\nglace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git \'em\na good drink.yes, that\'s it--whiskey--I see you\'re on,\nand two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,\nfriend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your\nhoop and git back with \'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c\'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"\nand he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The\ntaller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in\ntheir fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the\ncorners of her pretty mouth.The\nsmaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her\nhead as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed\nbut a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]\n\nThe "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging\nover the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two\npretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at\nfirst sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper\ntwins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic\nbrunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good\nevening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,\nuntil the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of\ngaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and\nearnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from\nDenver, and the two Parisiennes\' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing\nout past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on\nto the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze\nof dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the\nwaltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,\nand talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,\nwith his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern\ngrisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a\ncertain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that\njealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you\nthat these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all\nalike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of\nthe Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of\nthese--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all\nout-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying\n"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many\nof the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,\nexcept for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which\nsends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps\nand a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in\nthe Quarter.Sandra went back to the bedroom.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the\ncocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering\nthe two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a\nstreet-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a\npair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer\'s sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few\ndoors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived\non a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are\nhaving a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have\nbrought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,\nthree bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by\nseveral folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,\nand two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]\n\n"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband\ncorroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the\ncocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours\non the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French\npeople!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of\nthe Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;\nthen a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red\ncarrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his\nseat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the\nway.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning\nmarket--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the\nshutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock\ncrows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the\nLatin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your\ngate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court\na friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the\nyellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and\ncarry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching\ngratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your\ndejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X\n\nEXILED\n\n\nScores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer\nor shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them\nout into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all\nmarched and sung along the "Boul\' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";\nstarved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all\nbeen a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the\ndevelopment of their several geniuses, a development which in later life\nhas placed them at the head of their professions.These years of\ncamaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch\nwith everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the\npetty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a\nstraight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all\nthe while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the\nvery air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the\nworking-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived\nit he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have\nbeen broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and\nworked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed\nwithin these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it\nknow its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]\n\nPochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the\nopera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,\nand Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards\nand the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of\nyears gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at\nthe throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown\ntired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise\nof the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live\na life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an\nair-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who\nalways went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk\'s cowl, with his\nbare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these\neccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite\nstatuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in\nfull armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph\nin flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into\nthe stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely\ncarved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart\nof this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no\nbounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen\ndaily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the\none he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of\nhis vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with\nwindows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the\ntheaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject\nseemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a\nback flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a\n"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the\narena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of\nunfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast\ncircle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The\nold gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at\nthe end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which\nI dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his\nclothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man\nexcitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to\nget.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put\nin your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a\nvery busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:\n\n"I won\'t come any more, my friend.I\'ll send my boots around to-morrow\nby my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon\none with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents\nrelative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,\nbearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red\ntags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching\ndeparture, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge\'s\nwindow.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,\nyou are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";\nlooking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment\nwas ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,\nand madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the\nlittle street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"\naccompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois\nhas gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place\nfor trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find\none, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my\nvalise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel\ncourt.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three\ndaughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get\ndown.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come\nup to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to\nlose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,\nheaded by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search\nconsiderably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers\nand myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes\nde menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the\nFrench Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an\nassuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and\nchained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and\nsqueaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom\nhas been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,\nchanges his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently\nthinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,\nas the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Daniel went back to the hallway.Just as it\nreaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very\nmuch to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and\ntake a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in\npassing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for\nus!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment\nof careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling\naway, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I\nsee a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with\nan engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it\nreads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon\nvoyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned\nthe corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *\n\nBut why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow\nand picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they\ndo at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it\nis the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of\nadventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you\nwill--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and\nfor her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the\nsculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have\ninspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old\nwoman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for\nParis.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little\nfishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the\npretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to\nParis without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier\nLatin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L\'amour!--L\'amour!--L\'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]\n\n\n\n\n  TRANSCRIBER\'S AMENDMENTS:\n\n  Page 25: dejeuner

leddy"--"The woman would\ndrive ony reasonable being daft!"said Lady Margaret; then resuming her\ntone of authority and indifference, she concluded, "Weel, Mause, I\'ll\njust end where I sud hae begun--ye\'re ower learned and ower godly for me\nto dispute wi\'; sae I have just this to say,--either Cuddie must attend\nmusters when he\'s lawfully warned by the ground officer, or the sooner he\nand you flit and quit my bounds the better; there\'s nae scarcity o\' auld\nwives or ploughmen; but, if there were, I had rather that the rigs of\nTillietudlem bare naething but windle-straes and sandy lavrocks [Note:\nBent-grass and sand-larks.]than that they were ploughed by rebels to the\nking.""Aweel, my leddy," said Mause, "I was born here, and thought to die where\nmy father died; and your leddyship has been a kind mistress, I\'ll ne\'er\ndeny that, and I\'se ne\'er cease to pray for you, and for Miss Edith, and\nthat ye may be brought to see the error of your ways.But still"--"The\nerror of my ways!"interrupted Lady Margaret, much incensed--"The error\nof my ways, ye uncivil woman?""Ou, ay, my leddy, we are blinded that live in this valley of tears and\ndarkness, and hae a\' ower mony errors, grit folks as weel as sma\'--but,\nas I said, my puir bennison will rest wi\' you and yours wherever I am.I\nwill be wae to hear o\' your affliction, and blithe to hear o\' your\nprosperity, temporal and spiritual.But I canna prefer the commands of an\nearthly mistress to those of a heavenly master, and sae I am e\'en ready\nto suffer for righteousness\' sake.""It is very well," said Lady Margaret, turning her back in great\ndispleasure; "ye ken my will, Mause, in the matter.I\'ll hae nae whiggery\nin the barony of Tillietudlem--the next thing wad be to set up a\nconventicle in my very withdrawing room."Having said this, she departed, with an air of great dignity; and Mause,\ngiving way to feelings which she had suppressed during the\ninterview,--for she, like her mistress, had her own feeling of\npride,--now lifted up her voice and wept aloud.Cuddie, whose malady, real or pretended, still detained him in bed, lay\nperdu during all this conference, snugly ensconced within his boarded\nbedstead, and terrified to death lest Lady Margaret, whom he held in\nhereditary reverence, should have detected his presence, and bestowed on\nhim personally some of those bitter reproaches with which she loaded his\nmother.But as soon as he thought her ladyship fairly out of hearing, he\nbounced up in his nest."The foul fa\' ye, that I suld say sae," he cried out to his mother, "for\na lang-tongued clavering wife, as my father, honest man, aye ca\'d ye!Couldna ye let the leddy alane wi\' your whiggery?And I was e\'en as great\na gomeral to let ye persuade me to lie up here amang the blankets like a\nhurcheon, instead o\' gaun to the wappen-schaw like other folk.Odd, but I\nput a trick on ye, for I was out at the window-bole when your auld back\nwas turned, and awa down by to hae a baff at the popinjay, and I shot\nwithin twa on\'t.I cheated the leddy for your clavers, but I wasna gaun\nto cheat my joe.But she may marry whae she likes now, for I\'m clean dung\nower.This is a waur dirdum than we got frae Mr Gudyill when ye garr\'d me\nrefuse to eat the plum-porridge on Yule-eve, as if it were ony matter to\nGod or man whether a pleughman had suppit on minched pies or sour\nsowens.""O, whisht, my bairn, whisht," replied Mause; "thou kensna about thae\nthings--It was forbidden meat, things dedicated to set days and holidays,\nwhich are inhibited to the use of protestant Christians.""And now," continued her son, "ye hae brought the leddy hersell on our\nhands!--An I could but hae gotten some decent claes in, I wad hae spanged\nout o\' bed, and tauld her I wad ride where she liked, night or day, an\nshe wad but leave us the free house and the yaird, that grew the best\nearly kale in the haill country, and the cow\'s grass."my winsome bairn, Cuddie," continued the old dame, "murmur not at\nthe dispensation; never grudge suffering in the gude cause.""But what ken I if the cause is gude or no, mither," rejoined Cuddie,\n"for a\' ye bleeze out sae muckle doctrine about it?It\'s clean beyond my\ncomprehension a\'thegither.I see nae sae muckle difference atween the twa\nways o\'t as a\' the folk pretend.It\'s very true the curates read aye the\nsame words ower again; and if they be right words, what for no?A gude\ntale\'s no the waur o\' being twice tauld, I trow; and a body has aye the\nbetter chance to understand it.Every body\'s no sae gleg at the uptake as\nye are yoursell, mither.""O, my dear Cuddie, this is the sairest distress of a\'," said the anxious\nmother--"']
