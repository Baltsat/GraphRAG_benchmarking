EPISODIC MEMORY: ['John travelled to the hallway.John travelled to the office.Mary went back to the kitchen.Mary went back to the bathroom.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Daniel moved to the kitchen.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find the most recent information about Mary's location. I will look for sentences that mention Mary and her movement. There are two relevant sentences: 'Mary went back to the kitchen' and 'Mary went back to the bathroom'. Since 'Mary went back to the bathroom' is mentioned later in the text, it overrides the previous information.
