EPISODIC MEMORY: ['John travelled to the hallway.John travelled to the office.Mary went back to the kitchen.Mary went back to the bathroom.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Daniel moved to the kitchen.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find the most recent location of Mary. Looking at the relevant facts, I see that Mary went back to two different places - the kitchen and the bathroom. Since "went back" implies a change from a previous location, I should consider the order in which these events occurred. The texts mention that Mary's movements happened after John's and Daniel's movements. Specifically, it says "Mary went back to the kitchen" before mentioning "Mary went back to the bathroom". This suggests that Mary was in the kitchen first, then moved to the bathroom.

Direct answer: Bathroom

EPISODIC MEMORY: ['Sandra moved to the bathroom.Daniel moved to the bedroom.John went to the office.John went back to the kitchen.Mary travelled to the office.Daniel journeyed to the office.John went to the hallway.John went to the bathroom.']
AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I will look at all relevant facts about John's movements to determine his current location. The most recent fact about John is that he went back to the kitchen, but then there are also mentions of him going to the hallway and bathroom afterwards. However, since 'went back' implies a return from somewhere else, it can be assumed that 'went back to the kitchen' happened after 'went to the office'. Therefore, I will consider all facts about John's movements in reverse chronological order: 'bathroom', 'hallway', 'office', and 'kitchen'. Since there is no fact indicating him leaving the bathroom, this must be his current location.
