AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I recall that Sandra was mentioned in a few contexts. In one instance, it was stated that 'Sandra went to the garden', but later it was also mentioned that 'Sandra moved to the bedroom'. Since the latter statement seems more recent and specific, I will rely on this information.
Direct answer: Bedroom

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find information about Mary's location. I will look for sentences that mention Mary and a place she is going to or moving to. 
I found two relevant sentences: 'mary, goes to, hallway' and 'mary, moved to, kitchen'. Since the second sentence mentions "moved to", it implies a change of location, so I will use this information to answer the question.
Direct answer: kitchen
TRUE ANSWER: hallway

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find information about John's location. I will look for sentences that mention John and a place.

Direct answer: hallway

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I recall that there are two relevant facts about John's location. The first fact states that 'John, went back to, garden', and the second fact states that 'John, moved to, office'. Since both facts cannot be true at the same time, I will choose the most recent information.
Direct answer: Office
