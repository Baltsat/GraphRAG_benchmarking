AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find information about Daniel's location. I will look for sentences that mention Daniel and his movements. I found three relevant sentences: 'daniel, travelled to, garden', 'daniel, went back to, bedroom', 'daniel, travelled to, hallway'. Since the question asks where Daniel is now, I need to find the most recent information about his location.
Direct answer: hallway

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I need to find information about Daniel's location. I will look for sentences that mention Daniel and a place he went to or is currently at. 
I found two relevant sentences: 'daniel, travelled to, office' and 'daniel, journeyed to, hallway'. Since the second sentence mentions "journeyed to" which implies movement from one place to another, I will consider it as the most recent information about Daniel's location.
Direct answer: Hallway

AGENT ANSWER: CoT: I recall that Daniel went to several places - bedroom, hallway, office, and kitchen. However, since the question is asking for his current location, I will consider the most recent information about Daniel's movement. According to my memory, the last place Daniel moved to was the kitchen.
Direct answer: kitchen
TRUE ANSWER: hallway
