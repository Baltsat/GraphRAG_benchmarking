There was daring and resolution in the dark eye, but the other
features seemed to express a bashful timidity, mingled with good humor,
and obvious satisfaction at meeting with his old friends.Abstracted from the bashful expression, which was that of the moment,
the forehead of Henry Gow, or Smith, for he was indifferently so called,
was high and noble, but the lower part of the face was less happily
formed.The mouth was large, and well furnished with a set of firm and
beautiful teeth, the appearance of which corresponded with the air of
personal health and muscular strength which the whole frame indicated.A short thick beard, and mustachios which had lately been arranged with
some care, completed the picture.His age could not exceed eight and
twenty.The family appeared all well pleased with the unexpected appearance of
an old friend.Simon Glover shook his hand again and again, Dorothy made
her compliments, and Catharine herself offered freely her hand, which
Henry held in his massive grasp, as if he designed to carry it to his
lips, but, after a moment's hesitation, desisted, from fear lest the
freedom might be ill taken.Not that there was any resistance on the
part of the little hand which lay passive in his grasp; but there was a
smile mingled with the blush on her cheek, which seemed to increase the
confusion of the gallant.Her father, on his part, called out frankly, as he saw his friend's
hesitation: "Her lips, man--her lips!and that's a proffer I would not
make to every one who crosses my threshold.Valentine,
whose holyday will dawn tomorrow, I am so glad to see thee in the bonny
city of Perth again that it would be hard to tell the thing I could
refuse thee."The smith, for, as has been said, such was the craft of this sturdy
artisan, was encouraged modestly to salute the Fair Maid, who yielded
the courtesy with a smile of affection that might have become a sister,
saying, at the same time: "Let me hope that I welcome back to Perth a
repentant and amended man."He held her hand as if about to answer, then suddenly, as one who lost
courage at the moment, relinquished his grasp; and drawing back as
if afraid of what he had done, his dark countenance glowing with
bashfulness, mixed with delight, he sat down by the fire on the opposite
side from that which Catharine occupied."Come, Dorothy, speed thee with the food, old woman; and Conachar--where
is Conachar?""He is gone to bed, sir, with a headache," said Catharine, in a
hesitating voice."Go, call him, Dorothy," said the old glover; "I will not be used thus
by him: his Highland blood, forsooth, is too gentle to lay a trencher
or spread a napkin, and he expects to enter our ancient and honourable
craft without duly waiting and tending upon his master and teacher in
all matters of lawful obedience.Go, call him, I say; I will not be thus
neglected."Dorothy was presently heard screaming upstairs, or more probably up a
ladder, to the cock loft, to which the recusant apprentice had made
an untimely retreat; a muttered answer was returned, and soon after
Conachar appeared in the eating apartment.There was a gloom of
deep sullenness on his haughty, though handsome, features, and as he
proceeded to spread the board, and arrange the trenchers, with salt,
spices, and other condiments--to discharge, in short, the duties of
a modern domestic, which the custom of the time imposed upon all
apprentices--he was obviously disgusted and indignant with the mean
office imposed upon him.The Fair Maid of Perth looked with some anxiety at him, as if
apprehensive that his evident sullenness might increase her father's
displeasure; but it was not till her eyes had sought out his for a
second time that Conachar condescended to veil his dissatisfaction,
and throw a greater appearance of willingness and submission into the
services which he was performing.And here we must acquaint our reader that, though the private
interchange of looks betwixt Catharine Glover and the young mountaineer
indicated some interest on the part of the former in the conduct of the
latter, it would have puzzled the strictest observer to discover whether
that feeling exceeded in degree what might have been felt by a young
person towards a friend and inmate of the same age, with whom she had
lived on habits of intimacy."Thou hast had a long journey, son Henry," said Glover, who had always
used that affectionate style of speech, though no ways akin to the young
artisan; "ay, and hast seen many a river besides Tay, and many a fair
bigging besides St."But none that I like half so well, and none that are half so much worth
my liking," answered the smith."I promise you, father, that, when
I crossed the Wicks of Baiglie, and saw the bonny city lie stretched
fairly before me like a fairy queen in romance, whom the knight finds
asleep among a wilderness of flowers, I felt even as a bird when it
folds its wearied wings to stoop down on its own nest."so thou canst play the maker [old Scottish for poet] yet?""What, shall we have our ballets and our roundels again?our
lusty carols for Christmas, and our mirthful springs to trip it round
the maypole?""Such toys there may be forthcoming, father," said Henry Smith, "though
the blast of the bellows and the clatter of the anvil make but coarse
company to lays of minstrelsy; but I can afford them no better, since I
must mend my fortune, though I mar my verses.""Right again--my own son just," answered the glover; "and I trust thou
hast made a saving voyage of it?""Nay, I made a thriving one, father: I sold the steel habergeon that you
wot of for four hundred marks to the English Warden of the East Marches,
Sir Magnus Redman.He scarce scrupled a penny after I gave him leave to
try a sword dint upon it.The beggardly Highland thief who bespoke it
boggled at half the sum, though it had cost me a year's labour.""What dost thou start at, Conachar?"said Simon, addressing himself, by
way of parenthesis, to the mountain disciple; "wilt thou never learn to
mind thy own business, without listening to what is passing round
thee?What is it to thee that an Englishman thinks that cheap which a
Scottishman may hold dear?"Conachar turned round to speak, but, after a moment's consideration,
looked down, and endeavoured to recover his composure, which had been
deranged by the contemptuous manner in which the smith had spoken of his
Highland customer.Henry went on without paying any attention to him."I sold at high
prices some swords and whingers when I was at Edinburgh.They expect war
there; and if it please God to send it, my merchandise will be worth its
price.Dunstan make us thankful, for he was of our craft.In short,
this fellow (laying his hand on his purse); who, thou knowest, father,
was somewhat lank and low in condition when I set out four months since,
is now as round and full as a six weeks' porker.""And that other leathern sheathed, iron hilted fellow who hangs beside
him," said the glover, "has he been idle all this while?Come, jolly
smith, confess the truth--how many brawls hast thou had since crossing
the Tay?"Daniel travelled to the garden."Nay, now you do me wrong, father, to ask me such a question (glancing
a look at Catharine) in such a presence," answered the armourer: "I
make swords, indeed, but I leave it to other people to use them.No--no,
seldom have I a naked sword in my fist, save when I am turning them
on the anvil or grindstone; and they slandered me to your daughter
Catharine, that led her to suspect the quietest burgess in Perth of
being a brawler.I wish the best of them would dare say such a word at
the Hill of Kinnoul, and never a man on the green but he and I.""Ay--ay," said the glover, laughing, "we should then have a fine sample
of your patient sufferance.Out upon you, Henry, that you will speak so
like a knave to one who knows thee so well!You look at Kate, too, as if
she did not know that a man in this country must make his hand keep his
head, unless he will sleep in slender security.Come--come, beshrew me
if thou hast not spoiled as many suits of armour as thou hast made.""Why, he would be a bad armourer, father Simon, that could not with
his own blow make proof of his own workmanship.If I did not sometimes
cleave a helmet, or strike a point through a harness, I should not know
what strength of fabric to give them; and might jingle together such
pasteboard work as yonder Edinburgh smiths think not shame to put out of
their hands.""Aha, now would I lay a gold crown thou hast had a quarrel with some
Edinburgh 'burn the wind' upon that very ground?"["Burn the wind," an old cant term for blacksmith, appears in Burns:

Then burnewin came on like death, At every chaup, etc.]no, father," replied the Perth armourer, "but a measuring
of swords with such a one upon St.Leonard's Crags, for the honour of
my bonny city, I confess.Surely you do not think I would quarrel with a
brother craftsman?""Ah, to a surety, no.But how did your brother craftman come off?""Why, as one with a sheet of paper on his bosom might come off from the
stroke of a lance; or rather, indeed, he came not off at all, for, when
I left him, he was lying in the Hermit's Lodge daily expecting death,
for which Father Gervis said he was in heavenly preparation.""Why, truly, I fought an Englishman at Berwick besides, on the old
question of the supremacy, as they call it--I am sure you would not have
me slack at that debate?--and I had the luck to hurt him on the left
knee."said Simon, laughing at the exploits of his pacific friend."I fought a Scotchman in the Torwood," answered Henry Smith, "upon a
doubt which was the better swordsman, which, you are aware, could not be
known or decided without a trial."Pretty well for the most peaceful lad in Perth, who never touches a
sword but in the way of his profession."Little; for the drubbing of a Highlandman is a thing not worth
mentioning.""For what didst thou drub him, O man of peace?""For nothing that I can remember," replied the smith, "except his
presenting himself on the south side of Stirling Bridge.""Well, here is to thee, and thou art welcome to me after all these
exploits.Let the cans clink, lad, and thou shalt
have a cup of the nut brown for thyself, my boy."Conachar poured out the good liquor for his master and for Catharine
with due observance.But that done, he set the flagon on the table and
sat down.Fill to my guest, the
worshipful Master Henry Smith.""Master Smith may fill for himself, if he wishes for liquor," answered
the youthful Celt."The son of my father has demeaned himself enough
already for one evening.""That's well crowed for a cockerel," said Henry; "but thou art so far
right, my lad, that the man deserves to die of thirst who will not drink
without a cupbearer."But his entertainer took not the contumacy of the young apprentice with
so much patience."Now, by my honest word, and by the best glove I ever
made," said Simon, "thou shalt help him with liquor from that cup and
flagon, if thee and I are to abide under one roof."Conachar arose sullenly upon hearing this threat, and, approaching the
smith, who had just taken the tankard in his hand, and was raising it
to his head, he contrived to stumble against him and jostle him so
awkwardly, that the foaming ale gushed over his face, person, and dress.Good natured as the smith, in spite of his warlike propensities, really
was in the utmost degree, his patience failed under such a provocation.He seized the young man's throat, being the part which came readiest to
his grasp, as Conachar arose from the pretended stumble, and pressing
it severely as he cast the lad from him, exclaimed: "Had this been in
another place, young gallows bird, I had stowed the lugs out of thy
head, as I have done to some of thy clan before thee."Conachar recovered his feet with the activity of a tiger, and exclaimed:
"Never shall you live to make that boast again!"drew a short, sharp
knife from his bosom, and, springing on Henry Smith, attempted to plunge
it into his body over the collarbone, which must have been a mortal
wound.But the object of this violence was so ready to defend himself
by striking up the assailant's hand, that the blow only glanced on the
bone, and scarce drew blood.To wrench the dagger from the boy's hand,
and to secure him with a grasp like that of his own iron vice, was, for
the powerful smith, the work of a single moment.Conachar felt himself at once in the absolute power of the formidable
antagonist whom he had provoked; he became deadly pale, as he had been
the moment before glowing red, and stood mute with shame and fear,
until, relieving him from his powerful hold, the smith quietly said: "It
is well for thee that thou canst not make me angry; thou art but a boy,
and I, a grown man, ought not to have provoked thee.Conachar stood an instant as if about to reply, and then left the room,
ere Simon had collected himself enough to speak.Dorothy was running
hither and thither for salves and healing herbs.Catharine had swooned
at the sight of the trickling blood."Let me depart, father Simon," said Henry Smith, mournfully, "I might
have guessed I should have my old luck, and spread strife and bloodshed
where I would wish most to bring peace and happiness.Look to poor Catharine; the fright of such an affray hath killed her,
and all through my fault."It was the fault of yon Highland cateran, whom it
is my curse to be cumbered with; but he shall go back to his glens
tomorrow, or taste the tolbooth of the burgh.An assault upon the life
of his master's guest in his house!repeated the armourer--"look to Catharine.""Dorothy will see to her," said Simon; "surprise and fear kill not;
skenes and dirks do.And she is not more the daughter of my blood than
thou, my dear Henry, art the son of my affections.The skene occle is an ugly weapon in a Highland hand.""I mind it no more than the scratch of a wildcat," said the armourer;
"and now that the colour is coming to Catharine's cheek again, you shall
see me a sound man in a moment."Sandra moved to the garden.He turned to a corner in which hung a small mirror, and hastily took
from his purse some dry lint to apply to the slight wound he had
received.As he unloosed the leathern jacket from his neck and
shoulders, the manly and muscular form which they displayed was not more
remarkable than the fairness of his skin, where it had not, as in
hands and face, been exposed to the effects of rough weather and of his
laborious trade.He hastily applied some lint to stop the bleeding; and
a little water having removed all other marks of the fray, he buttoned
his doublet anew, and turned again to the table, where Catharine, still
pale and trembling, was, however, recovered from her fainting fit."Would you but grant me your forgiveness for having offended you in the
very first hour of my return?The lad was foolish to provoke me, and yet
I was more foolish to be provoked by such as he.Your father blames me
not, Catharine, and cannot you forgive me?""I have no power to forgive," answered Catharine, "what I have no title
to resent.If my father chooses to have his house made the scene of
night brawls, I must witness them--I cannot help myself.Perhaps it was
wrong in me to faint and interrupt, it may be, the farther progress of a
fair fray.My apology is, that I cannot bear the sight of blood.""And is this the manner," said her father, "in which you receive my
friend after his long absence?He
escapes being murdered by a fellow whom I will tomorrow clear this house
of, and you treat him as if he had done wrong in dashing from him the
snake which was about to sting him!""It is not my part, father," returned the Maid of Perth, "to decide who
had the right or wrong in the present brawl, nor did I see what happened
distinctly enough to say which was assailant, or which defender.Daniel went to the bathroom.But
sure our friend, Master Henry, will not deny that he lives in a perfect
atmosphere of strife, blood, and quarrels.He hears of no swordsman but
he envies his reputation, and must needs put his valour to the proof.He
sees no brawl but he must strike into the midst of it.Has he friends,
he fights with them for love and honour; has he enemies, he fights with
them for hatred and revenge.And those men who are neither his friends
nor foes, he fights with them because they are on this or that side of
a river.His days are days of battle, and, doubtless, he acts them over
again in his dreams.""Daughter," said Simon, "your tongue wags too freely.Quarrels and
fights are men's business, not women's, and it is not maidenly to think
or speak of them.""But if they are so rudely enacted in our presence," said Catharine, "it
is a little hard to expect us to think or speak of anything else.I will
grant you, my father, that this valiant burgess of Perth is one of the
best hearted men that draws breath within its walls: that he would walk
a hundred yards out of the way rather than step upon a worm; that
he would be as loth, in wantonness, to kill a spider as if he were a
kinsman to King Robert, of happy memory; that in the last quarrel before
his departure he fought with four butchers, to prevent their killing a
poor mastiff that had misbehaved in the bull ring, and narrowly escaped
the fate of the cur that he was protecting.I will grant you also,
that the poor never pass the house of the wealthy armourer but they are
relieved with food and alms.But what avails all this, when his
sword makes as many starving orphans and mourning widows as his purse
relieves?""Nay, but, Catharine, hear me but a word before going on with a string
of reproaches against my friend, that sound something like sense, while
they are, in truth, inconsistent with all we hear and see around us.What," continued the glover, "do our King and our court, our knights and
ladies, our abbots, monks, and priests themselves, so earnestly crowd to
see?Is it not to behold the display of chivalry, to witness the gallant
actions of brave knights in the tilt and tourney ground, to look upon
deeds of honour and glory achieved by arms and bloodshed?What is it
these proud knights do, that differs from what our good Henry Gow works
out in his sphere?Who ever heard of his abusing his skill and strength
to do evil or forward oppression, and who knows not how often it has
been employed as that of a champion in the good cause of the burgh?And
shouldst not thou, of all women, deem thyself honoured and glorious,
that so true a heart and so strong an arm has termed himself thy
bachelor?In what do the proudest dames take their loftiest pride, save
in the chivalry of their knight; and has the boldest in Scotland done
more gallant deeds than my brave son Henry, though but of low degree?Is
he not known to Highland and Lowland as the best armourer that ever made
sword, and the truest soldier that ever drew one?""My dearest father," answered Catharine, "your words contradict
themselves, if you will permit your child to say so.Let us thank God
and the good saints that we are in a peaceful rank of life, below the
notice of those whose high birth, and yet higher pride, lead them to
glory in their bloody works of cruelty, which haughty and lordly men
term deeds of chivalry.Your wisdom will allow that it would be absurd
in us to prank ourselves in their dainty plumes and splendid garments;
why, then, should we imitate their full blown vices?Why should we
assume their hard hearted pride and relentless cruelty, to which murder
is not only a sport, but a subject of vainglorious triumph?Let those
whose rank claims as its right such bloody homage take pride and
pleasure in it; we, who have no share in the sacrifice, may the better
pity the sufferings of the victim.Let us thank our lowliness, since it
secures us from temptation.But forgive me, father, if I have stepped
over the limits of my duty, in contradicting the views which you
entertain, with so many others, on these subjects.""Nay, thou hast even too much talk for me, girl," said her father,
somewhat angrily."I am but a poor workman, whose best knowledge is to
distinguish the left hand glove from the right.But if thou wouldst
have my forgiveness, say something of comfort to my poor Henry.There he
sits, confounded and dismayed with all the preachment thou hast heaped
together; and he, to whom a trumpet sound was like the invitation to a
feast, is struck down at the sound of a child's whistle."The armourer, indeed, while he heard the lips that were dearest to him
paint his character in such unfavourable colours, had laid his head
down on the table, upon his folded arms, in an attitude of the deepest
dejection, or almost despair."I would to Heaven, my dearest father," answered Catharine, "that it
were in my power to speak comfort to Henry, without betraying the sacred
cause of the truths I have just told you.And I may--nay, I must have
such a commission," she continued with something that the earnestness
with which she spoke and the extreme beauty of her features caused for
the moment to resemble inspiration."The truth of Heaven," she said, in a solemn tone, "was never committed
to a tongue, however feeble, but it gave a right to that tongue to
announce mercy, while it declared judgment.Arise, Henry--rise up, noble
minded, good, and generous, though widely mistaken man.Thy faults are
those of this cruel and remorseless age, thy virtues all thine own."While she thus spoke, she laid her hand upon the smith's arm, and
extricating it from under his head by a force which, however gentle, he
could not resist, she compelled him to raise towards her his manly face,
and the eyes into which her expostulations, mingled with other feelings,
had summoned tears."Weep not," she said, "or rather, weep on, but weep as those who have
hope.Abjure the sins of pride and anger, which most easily beset thee;
fling from thee the accursed weapons, to the fatal and murderous use of
which thou art so easily tempted.""You speak to me in vain, Catharine," returned the armourer: "I may,
indeed, turn monk and retire from the world, but while I live in it I
must practise my trade; and while I form armour and weapons for others,
I cannot myself withstand the temptation of using them.You would not
reproach me as you do, if you knew how inseparably the means by which I
gain my bread are connected with that warlike spirit which you impute
to me as a fault, though it is the consequence of inevitable necessity.While I strengthen the shield or corselet to withstand wounds, must I
not have constantly in remembrance the manner and strength with which
they may be dealt; and when I forge the sword, and temper it for war, is
it practicable for me to avoid the recollection of its use?""Then throw from you, my dear Henry," said the enthusiastic girl,
clasping with both her slender hands the nervous strength and weight
of one of the muscular armourer's, which they raised with difficulty,
permitted by its owner, yet scarcely receiving assistance from his
volition--"cast from you, I say, the art which is a snare to you.Abjure
the fabrication of weapons which can only be useful to abridge human
life, already too short for repentance, or to encourage with a
feeling of safety those whom fear might otherwise prevent from risking
themselves in peril.The art of forming arms, whether offensive or
defensive, is alike sinful in one to whose violent and ever vehement
disposition the very working upon them proves a sin and a snare.Resign
utterly the manufacture of weapons of every description, and deserve the
forgiveness of Heaven, by renouncing all that can lead to the sin which
most easily besets you.""And what," murmured the armourer, "am I to do for my livelihood, when
I have given over the art of forging arms for which Henry of Perth is
known from the Tay to the Thames?""Your art itself," said Catharine, "has innocent and laudable resources.If you renounce the forging of swords and bucklers, there remains to you
the task of forming the harmless spade, and the honourable as well as
useful ploughshare--of those implements which contribute to the support
of life, or to its comforts.Thou canst frame locks and bars to defend
the property of the weak against the stouthrief and oppression of the
strong.Men will still resort to thee, and repay thy honest industry--"

But here Catharine was interrupted.Her father had heard her declaim
against war and tournaments with a feeling that, though her doctrine
were new to him, they might not, nevertheless, be entirely erroneous.He felt, indeed, a wish that his proposed son in law should not commit
himself voluntarily to the hazards which the daring character and great
personal strength of Henry the Smith had hitherto led him to incur
too readily; and so far he would rather have desired that Catharine's
arguments should have produced some effect upon the mind of her lover,
whom he knew to be as ductile when influenced by his affections as he
was fierce and intractable when assailed by hostile remonstrances or
threats.But her arguments interfered with his views, when he heard her
enlarge upon the necessity of his designed son in law resigning a trade
which brought in more ready income than any at that time practised in
Scotland, and more profit to Henry of Perth in particular than to any
armourer in the nation.He had some indistinct idea that it would not be
amiss to convert, if possible, Henry the Smith from his too frequent use
of arms, even though he felt some pride in being connected with one
who wielded with such superior excellence those weapons, which in that
warlike age it was the boast of all men to manage with spirit.But when
he heard his daughter recommend, as the readiest road to this pacific
state of mind, that her lover should renounce the gainful trade in which
he was held unrivalled, and which, from the constant private differences
and public wars of the time, was sure to afford him a large income, he
could withhold his wrath no longer.The daughter had scarce recommended
to her lover the fabrication of the implements of husbandry, than,
feeling the certainty of being right, of which in the earlier part of
their debate he had been somewhat doubtful, the father broke in with:

"Locks and bars, plough graith and harrow teeth!and why not grates and
fire prongs, and Culross girdles, and an ass to carry the merchandise
through the country, and thou for another ass to lead it by the halter?Why, Catharine, girl, has sense altogether forsaken thee, or dost thou
think that in these hard and iron days men will give ready silver for
anything save that which can defend their own life, or enable them to
take that of their enemy?We want swords to protect ourselves every
moment now, thou silly wench, and not ploughs to dress the ground for
the grain we may never see rise.As for the matter of our daily bread,
those who are strong seize it, and live; those who are weak yield it,
and die of hunger.Happy is the man who, like my worthy son, has means
of obtaining his living otherwise than by the point of the sword which
he makes.Preach peace to him as much as thou wilt, I will never be he
will say thee nay; but as for bidding the first armourer in Scotland
forego the forging of swords, curtal axes, and harness, it is enough to
drive patience itself mad.and next morning I prithee
remember that, shouldst thou have the luck to see Henry the Smith, which
is more than thy usage of him has deserved, you see a man who has not
his match in Scotland at the use of broadsword and battle axe, and who
can work for five hundred marks a year without breaking a holyday."The daughter, on hearing her father speak thus peremptorily, made a low
obeisance, and, without further goodnight, withdrew to the chamber which
was her usual sleeping apartment.Whence cometh Smith, be he knight, lord, or squire,
      But from the smith that forged in the fire?The armourer's heart swelled big with various and contending sensations,
so that it seemed as if it would burst the leathern doublet under which
it was shrouded.He arose, turned away his head, and extended his hand
towards the glover, while he averted his face, as if desirous that his
emotion should not be read upon his countenance."Nay, hang me if I bid you farewell, man," said Simon, striking the flat
of his hand against that which the armourer expanded towards him."I
will shake no hands with you for an hour to come at least.Tarry but
a moment, man, and I will explain all this; and surely a few drops of
blood from a scratch, and a few silly words from a foolish wench's
lips, are not to part father and son when they have been so long without
meeting?Stay, then, man, if ever you would wish for a father's blessing
and St.Valentine's, whose blessed eve this chances to be."The glover was soon heard loudly summoning Dorothy, and, after some
clanking of keys and trampling up and down stairs, Dorothy appeared
bearing three large rummer cups of green glass, which were then esteemed
a great and precious curiosity, and the glover followed with a huge
bottle, equal at least to three quarts of these degenerate days."Here is a cup of wine, Henry, older by half than I am myself; my
father had it in a gift from stout old Crabbe, the Flemish engineer,
who defended Perth so stoutly in the minority of David the Second.We
glovers could always do something in war, though our connexion with
it was less than yours who work in steel and iron.And my father had
pleased old Crabbe, some other day I will tell you how, and also how
long these bottles were concealed under ground, to save them from the
reiving Southron.So I will empty a cup to the soul's health of my
honoured father--May his sins be forgiven him!Dorothy, thou shalt drink
this pledge, and then be gone to thy cock loft.I know thine ears are
itching, girl, but I have that to say which no one must hear save Henry
Smith, the son of mine adoption."Dorothy did not venture to remonstrate, but, taking off her glass, or
rather her goblet, with good courage, retired to her sleeping apartment,
according to her master's commands."It grieves me, friend Henry," said Simon, filling at the same time his
own glass and his guest's--"it grieves me from my soul that my daughter
retains this silly humor; but also methinks, thou mightst mend it.Why
wouldst thou come hither clattering with thy sword and dagger, when the
girl is so silly that she cannot bear the sight of these?Dost thou not
remember that thou hadst a sort of quarrel with her even before thy
last departure from Perth, because thou wouldst not go like other honest
quiet burghers, but must be ever armed, like one of the rascally jackmen
that wait on the nobility?Sure it is time enough for decent burgesses
to arm at the tolling of the common bell, which calls us out bodin in
effeir of war.""Why, my good father, that was not my fault; but I had no sooner quitted
my nag than I run hither to tell you of my return, thinking, if it
were your will to permit me, that I would get your advice about being
Mistress Catharine's Valentine for the year; and then I heard from
Mrs.Dorothy that you were gone to hear mass at the Black Friars.So I
thought I would follow thither, partly to hear the same mass with you,
and partly--Our Lady and St.Valentine forgive me!--to look upon one who
thinks little enough of me.And, as you entered the church, methought
I saw two or three dangerous looking men holding counsel together, and
gazing at you and at her, and in especial Sir John Ramorny, whom I knew
well enough, for all his disguise, and the velvet patch over his eye,
and his cloak so like a serving man's; so methought, father Simon, that,
as you were old, and yonder slip of a Highlander something too young to
do battle, I would even walk quietly after you, not doubting, with the
tools I had about me, to bring any one to reason that might disturb you
in your way home.You know that yourself discovered me, and drew me into
the house, whether I would or no; otherwise, I promise you, I would not
have seen your daughter till I had donn'd the new jerkin which was made
at Berwick after the latest cut; nor would I have appeared before her
with these weapons, which she dislikes so much.Although, to say truth,
so many are at deadly feud with me for one unhappy chance or another,
that it is as needful for me as for any man in Scotland to go by night
with weapons about me.""The silly wench never thinks of that," said Simon Glover: "she never
has sense to consider, that in our dear native land of Scotland every
man deems it his privilege and duty to avenge his own wrong.But, Harry,
my boy, thou art to blame for taking her talk so much to heart.I have
seen thee bold enough with other wenches, wherefore so still and tongue
tied with her?""Because she is something different from other maidens, father
Glover--because she is not only more beautiful, but wiser, higher,
holier, and seems to me as if she were made of better clay than we that
approach her.I can hold my head high enough with the rest of the lasses
round the maypole; but somehow, when I approach Catharine, I feel myself
an earthly, coarse, ferocious creature, scarce worthy to look on her,
much less to contradict the precepts which she expounds to me.""You are an imprudent merchant, Harry Smith," replied Simon, "and rate
too high the goods you wish to purchase.Catharine is a good girl, and
my daughter; but if you make her a conceited ape by your bashfulness and
your flattery, neither you nor I will see our wishes accomplished.""I often fear it, my good father," said the smith; "for I feel how
little I am deserving of Catharine."said the glover; "feel for me, friend Smith--for
Catharine and me.Think how the poor thing is beset from morning to
night, and by what sort of persons, even though windows be down and
doors shut.We were accosted today by one too powerful to be named--ay,
and he showed his displeasure openly, because I would not permit him
to gallant my daughter in the church itself, when the priest was saying
mass.I sometimes wish that
Catharine were some degrees less fair, that she might not catch that
dangerous sort of admiration, or somewhat less holy, that she might sit
down like an honest woman, contented with stout Henry Smith, who
could protect his wife against every sprig of chivalry in the court of
Scotland.""And if I did not," said Henry, thrusting out a hand and arm which might
have belonged to a giant for bone and muscle, "I would I may never bring
hammer upon anvil again!Ay, an it were come but that length, my fair
Catharine should see that there is no harm in a man having the trick of
defence.But I believe she thinks the whole world is one great minster
church, and that all who live in it should behave as if they were at an
eternal mass.""Nay, in truth," said the father, "she has strange influence over those
who approach her; the Highland lad, Conachar, with whom I have been
troubled for these two or three years, although you may see he has the
natural spirit of his people, obeys the least sign which Catharine makes
him, and, indeed, will hardly be ruled by any one else in the house.She
takes much pains with him to bring him from his rude Highland habits."Here Harry Smith became uneasy in his chair, lifted the flagon, set it
down, and at length exclaimed: "The devil take the young Highland whelp
and his whole kindred!What has Catharine to do to instruct such a
fellow as he?He will be just like the wolf cub that I was fool enough
to train to the offices of a dog, and every one thought him reclaimed,
till, in an ill hour, I went to walk on the hill of Moncrieff, when he
broke loose on the laird's flock, and made a havoc that I might well
have rued, had the laird not wanted a harness at the time.And I marvel
that you, being a sensible man, father Glover, will keep this Highland
young fellow--a likely one, I promise you--so nigh to Catharine, as
if there were no other than your daughter to serve him for a
schoolmistress.""Fie, my son--fie; now you are jealous," said Simon, "of a poor young
fellow who, to tell you the truth, resides here because he may not so
well live on the other side of the hill.""Ay--ay, father Simon," retorted the smith, who had all the narrow
minded feelings of the burghers of his time, "an it were not for fear
of offence, I would say that you have even too much packing and peiling
with yonder loons out of burgh.""I must get my deer hides, buckskins, kidskins, and so forth somewhere,
my good Harry, and Highlandmen give good bargains.""They can afford them," replied Henry, drily, "for they sell nothing but
stolen gear.""Well--well, be that as it may, it is not my business where they get
the bestial, so I get the hides.But as I was saying, there are certain
considerations why I am willing to oblige the father of this young man,
by keeping him here.And he is but half a Highlander neither, and wants
a thought of the dour spirit of a 'glune amie' after all, I have seldom
seen him so fierce as he showed himself but now.""You could not, unless he had killed his man," replied the smith, in the
same dry tone."Nevertheless, if you wish it, Harry, I'll set all other respects aside,
and send the landlouper to seek other quarters tomorrow morning.""Nay, father," said the smith, "you cannot suppose that Harry Gow cares
the value of a smithy dander for such a cub as yonder cat-a-mountain?I care little, I promise you, though all his clan were coming down the
Shoegate with slogan crying and pipes playing: I would find fifty blades
and bucklers would send them back faster than they came.But, to speak
truth, though it is a fool's speech too, I care not to see the fellow so
much with Catharine.Remember, father Glover, your trade keeps your eyes
and hands close employed, and must have your heedful care, even if this
lazy lurdane wrought at it, which you know yourself he seldom does.""And that is true," said Simon: "he cuts all his gloves out for the
right hand, and never could finish a pair in his life.""No doubt, his notions of skin cutting are rather different," said
Henry."But with your leave, father, I would only say that, work he or
be he idle, he has no bleared eyes, no hands seared with the hot iron,
and welked by the use of the fore hammer, no hair rusted in the smoke,
and singed in the furnace, like the hide of a badger, rather than what
is fit to be covered with a Christian bonnet.Now, let Catharine be
as good a wench as ever lived, and I will uphold her to be the best in
Perth, yet she must see and know that these things make a difference
betwixt man and man, and that the difference is not in my favour.""Here is to thee, with all my heart, son Harry," said the old man,
filling a brimmer to his companion and another to himself; "I see that,
good smith as thou art, thou ken'st not the mettle that women are made
of.Thou must be bold, Henry; and bear thyself not as if thou wert going
to the gallows lee, but like a gay young fellow, who knows his own worth
and will not be slighted by the best grandchild Eve ever had.Catharine
is a woman like her mother, and thou thinkest foolishly to suppose they
are all set on what pleases the eye.Their ear must be pleased too, man:
they must know that he whom they favour is bold and buxom, and might
have the love of twenty, though he is suing for theirs.Believe an
old man, woman walk more by what others think than by what they think
themselves, and when she asks for the boldest man in Perth whom can
she hear named but Harry Burn-the-wind?The best armourer that ever
fashioned weapon on anvil?The tightest dancer
at the maypole?The best wrestler, sword and buckler player, the
king of the weapon shawing, the breaker of mad horses, the tamer of
wild Highlandmen?Evermore it is thee--thee--no one but thee.And shall
Catharine prefer yonder slip of a Highland boy to thee?she
might as well make a steel gauntlet out of kid's leather.I tell thee,
Conachar is nothing to her, but so far as she would fain prevent the
devil having his due of him, as of other Highlandmen.God bless her,
poor thing, she would bring all mankind to better thoughts if she
could.""In which she will fail to a certainty," said the smith, who, as the
reader may have noticed, had no goodwill to the Highland race."I will
wager on Old Nick, of whom I should know something, he being indeed
a worker in the same element with myself, against Catharine on that
debate: the devil will have the tartan, that is sure enough.""Ay, but Catharine," replied the glover, "hath a second thou knowest
little of: Father Clement has taken the young reiver in hand, and he
fears a hundred devils as little as I do a flock of geese.""You are always making some new saint
in this godly city of St.Pray, who, for a devil's drubber,
may he be?One of your hermits that is trained for the work like
a wrestler for the ring, and brings himself to trim by fasting and
penance, is he not?""No, that is the marvel of it," said Simon: "Father Clement eats,
drinks, and lives much like other folks--all the rules of the church,
nevertheless, strictly observed.""Oh, I comprehend!--a buxom priest that thinks more of good living than
of good life, tipples a can on Fastern's Eve, to enable him to face
Lent, has a pleasant in principio, and confesses all the prettiest women
about the town?""You are on the bow hand still, smith.I tell you, my daughter and I
could nose out either a fasting hypocrite or a full one.But Father
Clement is neither the one nor the other.""But what is he then, in Heaven's name?""One who is either greatly better than half his brethren of St.Johnston
put together, or so much worse than the worst of them, that it is sin
and shame that he is suffered to abide in the country.""Methinks it were easy to tell whether he be the one or the other," said
the smith."Content you, my friend," said Simon, "with knowing that, if you judge
Father Clement by what you see him do and hear him say, you will think
of him as the best and kindest man in the world, with a comfort for
every man's grief, a counsel for every man's difficulty, the rich man's
surest guide, and the poor man's best friend.But if you listen to what
the Dominicans say of him, he is--Benedicite!--(here the glover crossed
himself on brow and bosom)--a foul heretic, who ought by means of
earthly flames to be sent to those which burn eternally."The smith also crossed himself, and exclaimed: "St.father Simon,
and do you, who are so good and prudent that you have been called the
Wise Glover of Perth, let your daughter attend the ministry of one
who--the saints preserve us!--may be in league with the foul fiend
himself!Why, was it not a priest who raised the devil in the Meal
Vennel, when Hodge Jackson's house was blown down in the great wind?Did not the devil appear in the midst of the Tay, dressed in a priest's
scapular, gambolling like a pellack amongst the waves, the morning when
our stately bridge was swept away?""I cannot tell whether he did or no," said the glover; "I only know I
saw him not.As to Catharine, she cannot be said to use Father Clement's
ministry, seeing her confessor is old Father Francis the Dominican, from
whom she had her shrift today.But women will sometimes be wilful, and
sure enough she consults with Father Clement more than I could wish; and
yet when I have spoken with him myself, I have thought him so good and
holy a man that I could have trusted my own salvation with him.There
are bad reports of him among the Dominicans, that is certain.But what
have we laymen to do with such things, my son?Let us pay Mother Church
her dues, give our alms, confess and do our penances duly, and the
saints will bear us out.""Ay, truly; and they will have consideration," said the smith, "for any
rash and unhappy blow that a man may deal in a fight, when his party was
on defence, and standing up to him; and that's the only creed a man can
live upon in Scotland, let your daughter think what she pleases.Marry,
a man must know his fence, or have a short lease of his life, in any
place where blows are going so rife.Five nobles to our altar have
cleared me for the best man I ever had misfortune with.""Let us finish our flask, then," said the old glover; "for I reckon the
Dominican tower is tolling midnight.And hark thee, son Henry; be at the
lattice window on our east gable by the very peep of dawn, and make
me aware thou art come by whistling the smith's call gently.I will
contrive that Catharine shall look out at the window, and thus thou wilt
have all the privileges of being a gallant Valentine through the rest of
the year; which, if thou canst not use to thine own advantage, I shall
be led to think that, for all thou be'st covered with the lion's hide,
nature has left on thee the long ears of the ass.""Amen, father," said the armourer, "a hearty goodnight to you; and God's
blessing on your roof tree, and those whom it covers.You shall hear the
smith's call sound by cock crowing; I warrant I put sir chanticleer to
shame."So saying, he took his leave; and, though completely undaunted, moved
through the deserted streets like one upon his guard, to his own
dwelling, which was situated in the Mill Wynd, at the western end of
Perth.What's all this turmoil crammed into our parts?Faith, but the pit-a-pat of poor young hearts.The sturdy armourer was not, it may be believed, slack in keeping the
appointment assigned by his intended father in law.He went through the
process of his toilet with more than ordinary care, throwing, as far as
he could, those points which had a military air into the shade.He was
far too noted a person to venture to go entirely unarmed in a town where
he had indeed many friends, but also, from the character of many of his
former exploits, several deadly enemies, at whose hands, should they
take him at advantage, he knew he had little mercy to expect.He
therefore wore under his jerkin a "secret," or coat of chain mail, made
so light and flexible that it interfered as little with his movements
as a modern under waistcoat, yet of such proof as he might safely depend
upon, every ring of it having been wrought and joined by his own hands.Above this he wore, like others of his age and degree, the Flemish
hose and doublet, which, in honour of the holy tide, were of the best
superfine English broadcloth, light blue in colour, slashed out with
black satin, and passamented (laced, that is) with embroidery of black
silk.His walking boots were of cordovan leather; his cloak of good
Scottish grey, which served to conceal a whinger, or couteau de chasse,
that hung at his belt, and was his only offensive weapon, for he carried
in his hand but a rod of holly.His black velvet bonnet was lined with
steel, quilted between the metal and his head, and thus constituted a
means of defence which might safely be trusted to.Upon the whole, Henry had the appearance, to which he was well entitled,
of a burgher of wealth and consideration, assuming, in his dress, as
much consequence as he could display without stepping beyond his own
rank, and encroaching on that of the gentry.Neither did his frank and
manly deportment, though indicating a total indifference to danger, bear
the least resemblance to that of the bravoes or swashbucklers of the
day, amongst whom Henry was sometimes unjustly ranked by those who
imputed the frays in which he was so often engaged to a quarrelsome and
violent temper, resting upon a consciousness of his personal strength
and knowledge of his weapon.On the contrary, every feature bore
the easy and good-humoured expression of one who neither thought of
inflicting mischief nor dreaded it from others.Having attired himself in his best, the honest armourer next placed
nearest to his heart (which throbbed at its touch) a little gift which
he had long provided for Catharine Glover, and which his quality of
Valentine would presently give him the title to present, and her to
receive, without regard to maidenly scruples.It was a small ruby
cut into the form of a heart, transfixed with a golden arrow, and was
inclosed in a small purse made of links of the finest work in steel, as
if it had been designed for a hauberk to a king.Round the verge of the
purse were these words:

Loves darts Cleave hearts Through mail shirts.This device had cost the armourer some thought, and he was much
satisfied with his composition, because it seemed to imply that his
skill could defend all hearts saving his own.He wrapped himself in his cloak, and hastened through the still silent
streets, determined to appear at the window appointed a little before
dawn.With this purpose he passed up the High Street, and turned down the
opening where St.John travelled to the bathroom.John's Church now stands, in order to proceed to
Curfew Street; when it occurred to him, from the appearance of the sky,
that he was at least an hour too early for his purpose, and that it
would be better not to appear at the place of rendezvous till nearer the
time assigned.Other gallants were not unlikely to be on the watch as
well as himself about the house of the Fair Maid of Perth; and he
knew his own foible so well as to be sensible of the great chance of a
scuffle arising betwixt them."I have the advantage," he thought, "by my father Simon's friendship;
and why should I stain my fingers with the blood of the poor creatures
that are not worthy my notice, since they are so much less fortunate
than myself?No--no, I will be wise for once, and keep at a distance
from all temptation to a broil.They shall have no more time to quarrel
with me than just what it may require for me to give the signal, and for
my father Simon to answer it.I wonder how the old man will contrive to
bring her to the window?I fear, if she knew his purpose, he would find
it difficult to carry it into execution."While these lover-like thoughts were passing through his brain, the
armourer loitered in his pace, often turning his eyes eastward, and
eyeing the firmament, in which no slight shades of grey were beginning
to flicker, to announce the approach of dawn, however distant, which, to
the impatience of the stout armourer, seemed on that morning to abstain
longer than usual from occupying her eastern barbican.He was now
passing slowly under the wall of St.Anne's Chapel (not failing to cross
himself and say an ace, as he trode the consecrated ground), when a
voice, which seemed to come from behind one of the flying buttresses of
the chapel, said, "He lingers that has need to run."said the armourer, looking around him, somewhat startled
at an address so unexpected, both in its tone and tenor."No matter who speaks," answered the same voice."Do thou make great
speed, or thou wilt scarce make good speed.Bandy not words, but
begone.""Saint or sinner, angel or devil," said Henry, crossing himself, "your
advice touches me but too dearly to be neglected.So saying, he instantly changed his loitering pace to one with which few
people could have kept up, and in an instant was in Couvrefew Street.He had not made three steps towards Simon Glover's, which stood in the
midst of the narrow street, when two men started from under the houses
on different sides, and advanced, as it were by concert, to intercept
his passage.The imperfect light only permitted him to discern that they
wore the Highland mantle."Clear the way, cateran," said the armourer, in the deep stern voice
which corresponded with the breadth of his chest.They did not answer, at least intelligibly; but he could see that they
drew their swords, with the purpose of withstanding him by violence.Conjecturing some evil, but of what kind he could not anticipate, Henry
instantly determined to make his way through whatever odds, and defend
his mistress, or at least die at her feet.He cast his cloak over his
left arm as a buckler, and advanced rapidly and steadily to the two men.The nearest made a thrust at him, but Henry Smith, parrying the blow
with his cloak, dashed his arm in the man's face, and tripping him at
the same time, gave him a severe fall on the causeway; while almost at
the same instant he struck a blow with his whinger at the fellow who was
upon his right hand, so severely applied, that he also lay prostrate
by his associate.Meanwhile, the armourer pushed forward in alarm,
for which the circumstance of the street being guarded or defended
by strangers who conducted themselves with such violence afforded
sufficient reason.He heard a suppressed whisper and a bustle under the
glover's windows--those very windows from which he had expected to be
hailed by Catharine as her Valentine.He kept to the opposite side of
the street, that he might reconnoitre their number and purpose.But
one of the party who were beneath the window, observing or hearing
him, crossed the street also, and taking him doubtless for one of the
sentinels, asked, in a whisper, "What noise was yonder, Kenneth?"Villain," said Henry, "you are discovered, and you shall die the
death."As he spoke thus, he dealt the stranger a blow with his weapon, which
would probably have made his words good, had not the man, raising his
arm, received on his hand the blow meant for his head.Mary journeyed to the hallway.The wound must
have been a severe one, for he staggered and fell with a deep groan.Without noticing him farther, Henry Smith sprung forward upon a party of
men who seemed engaged in placing a ladder against the lattice window
in the gable.Henry did not stop ether to count their numbers or to
ascertain their purpose.But, crying the alarm word of the town, and
giving the signal at which the burghers were wont to collect, he rushed
on the night walkers, one of whom was in the act of ascending the
ladder.The smith seized it by the rounds, threw it down on the
pavement, and placing his foot on the body of the man who had been
mounting, prevented him from regaining his feet.His accomplices struck
fiercely at Henry, to extricate their companion.But his mail coat stood
him in good stead, and he repaid their blows with interest, shouting
aloud, "Help--help, for bonny St.they break into our houses under cloud of
night."These words, which resounded far through the streets, were accompanied
by as many fierce blows, dealt with good effect among those whom the
armourer assailed.In the mean time, the inhabitants of the district
began to awaken and appear on the street in their shirts, with
swords and targets, and some of them with torches.Sandra went to the kitchen.The assailants now
endeavoured to make their escape, which all of them effected excepting
the man who had been thrown down along with the ladder.Him the intrepid
armourer had caught by the throat in the scuffle, and held as fast as
the greyhound holds the hare.The other wounded men were borne off by
their comrades."Here are a sort of knaves breaking peace within burgh," said Henry
to the neighbours who began to assemble; "make after the rogues.They
cannot all get off, for I have maimed some of them: the blood will guide
you to them.""Some Highland caterans," said the citizens; "up and chase, neighbours!"leave me to manage this fellow," continued the
armourer.The assistants dispersed in different directions, their lights flashing
and their cries resounding through the whole adjacent district.In the mean time the armourer's captive entreated for freedom, using
both promises and threats to obtain it."As thou art a gentleman," he
said, "let me go, and what is past shall be forgiven.""I am no gentleman," said Henry--"I am Hal of the Wynd, a burgess of
Perth; and I have done nothing to need forgiveness.""Villain, then hast done thou knowest not what!But let me go, and I
will fill thy bonnet with gold pieces.""I shall fill thy bonnet with a cloven head presently," said the
armourer, "unless thou stand still as a true prisoner.""What is the matter, my son Harry?"said Simon, who now appeared at the
window."I hear thy voice in another tone than I expected.What is all
this noise; and why are the neighbours gathering to the affray?""There have been a proper set of limmers about to scale your windows,
father Simon; but I am like to prove godfather to one of them, whom I
hold here, as fast as ever vice held iron.""Hear me, Simon Glover," said the prisoner; "let me but speak one word
with you in private, and rescue me from the gripe of this iron fisted
and leaden pated clown, and I will show thee that no harm was designed
to thee or thine, and, moreover, tell thee what will much advantage
thee.""I should know that voice," said Simon Glover, who now came to the door
with a dark lantern in his hand."Son Smith, let this young man speak
with me.There is no danger in him, I promise you.Stay but an instant
where you are, and let no one enter the house, either to attack or
defend.I will be answerable that this galliard meant but some St.So saying, the old man pulled in the prisoner and shut the door,
leaving Henry a little surprised at the unexpected light in which his
father-in-law had viewed the affray.he said; "it might have been a strange jest, if they had got
into the maiden's sleeping room!And they would have done so, had it not
been for the honest friendly voice from betwixt the buttresses, which,
if it were not that of the blessed saint--though what am I that the holy
person should speak to me?--could not sound in that place without her
permission and assent, and for which I will promise her a wax candle at
her shrine, as long as my whinger; and I would I had had my two handed
broadsword instead, both for the sake of St.Johnston and of the rogues,
for of a certain those whingers are pretty toys, but more fit for a
boy's hand than a man's.Oh, my old two handed Trojan, hadst thou been
in my hands, as thou hang'st presently at the tester of my bed, the legs
of those rogues had not carried their bodies so clean off the field.But
there come lighted torches and drawn swords.If friends to the bonny burgh, you are well come.""We have been but bootless hunters," said the townsmen."We followed by
the tracks of the blood into the Dominican burial ground, and we started
two fellows from amongst the tombs, supporting betwixt them a third, who
had probably got some of your marks about him, Harry.They got to the
postern gate before we could overtake them, and rang the sanctuary
bell; the gate opened, and in went they.So they are safe in girth and
sanctuary, and we may go to our cold beds and warm us.""Ay," said one of the party, "the good Dominicans have always some
devout brother of their convent sitting up to open the gate of the
sanctuary to any poor soul that is in trouble, and desires shelter in
the church.""Yes, if the poor hunted soul can pay for it," said another "but, truly,
if he be poor in purse as well as in spirit, he may stand on the outside
till the hounds come up with him."A third, who had been poring for a few minutes upon the ground by
advantage of his torch, now looked upwards and spoke.He was a
brisk, forward, rather corpulent little man, called Oliver Proudfute,
reasonably wealthy, and a leading man in his craft, which was that of
bonnet makers; he, therefore, spoke as one in authority."Canst tell us, jolly smith"--for they recognised each other by the
lights which were brought into the streets--"what manner of fellows they
were who raised up this fray within burgh?""The two that I first saw," answered the armourer, "seemed to me, as
well as I could observe them, to have Highland plaids about them.""Like enough--like enough," answered another citizen, shaking his head."It's a shame the breaches in our walls are not repaired, and that these
landlouping Highland scoundrels are left at liberty to take honest men
and women out of their beds any night that is dark enough.""But look here, neighbours," said Oliver Proudfute, showing a bloody
hand which he had picked up from the ground; "when did such a hand as
this tie a Highlandman's brogues?It is large, indeed, and bony, but
as fine as a lady's, with a ring that sparkles like a gleaming candle.Simon Glover has made gloves for this hand before now, if I am not much
mistaken, for he works for all the courtiers."The spectators here began to gaze on the bloody token with various
comments."If that is the case," said one, "Harry Smith had best show a clean pair
of heels for it, since the justiciar will scarce think the protecting a
burgess's house an excuse for cutting off a gentleman's hand.Sandra moved to the office."Fie upon you, that you will say so, Michael Webster," answered the
bonnet maker; "are we not representatives and successors of the stout
old Romans, who built Perth as like to their own city as they could?And
have we not charters from all our noble kings and progenitors, as being
their loving liegemen?And would you have us now yield up our rights,
privileges, and immunities, our outfang and infang, our handhaband,
our back bearand, and our blood suits, and amerciaments, escheats,
and commodities, and suffer an honest burgess's house to be assaulted
without seeking for redress?No, brave citizens, craftsmen, and
burgesses, the Tay shall flow back to Dunkeld before we submit to such
injustice!"said a grave old man, who stood leaning on a
two handed sword."Marry, Bailie Craigdallie, I wonder that you, of all men, ask the
question.I would have you pass like true men from this very place
to the King's Grace's presence, raise him from his royal rest, and
presenting to him the piteous case of our being called forth from our
beds at this season, with little better covering than these shirts, I
would show him this bloody token, and know from his Grace's own royal
lips whether it is just and honest that his loving lieges should be thus
treated by the knights and nobles of his deboshed court.And this I call
pushing our cause warmly."replied the old burgess; "why, so warmly, that we
shall all die of cold, man, before the porter turn a key to let us into
the royal presence.Come, friends, the night is bitter, we have kept
our watch and ward like men, and our jolly smith hath given a warning to
those that would wrong us, which shall be worth twenty proclamations of
the king.Tomorrow is a new day; we will consult on this matter on this
self same spot, and consider what measures should be taken for discovery
and pursuit of the villains.And therefore let us dismiss before the
heart's blood freeze in our veins.""Bravo--bravo, neighbour Craigdallie!Oliver Proudfute would still have spoken; for he was one of those
pitiless orators who think that their eloquence can overcome all
inconveniences in time, place, and circumstances.Daniel journeyed to the garden.But no one would
listen, and the citizens dispersed to their own houses by the light of
the dawn, which began now to streak the horizon.They were scarce gone ere the door of the glover's house opened, and
seizing the
