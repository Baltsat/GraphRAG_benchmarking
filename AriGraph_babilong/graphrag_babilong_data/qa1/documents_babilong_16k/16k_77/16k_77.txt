"I can't chuck up pals in that
free-and-easy way.Once I take a liking to anybody I'd do anything for
'em, and I've never met three chaps I like better than wot I do you.Three nicer, straight-forrad, free-'anded mates I've never met afore.""Why not take the pledge agin, Bill?""No, mate," ses Bill, with a kind smile; "it's just a weakness, and I
must try and grow out of it.I'll tie a bit o' string round my little
finger to-night as a re-minder."He got out of bed and began to wash 'is face, and Ginger Dick, who was
doing a bit o' thinking, gave a whisper to Sam and Peter Russet."All right, Bill, old man," he ses, getting out of bed and beginning to
put his clothes on; "but first of all we'll try and find out 'ow the
landlord is."ses Bill, puffing and blowing in the basin."Why, the one you bashed," ses Ginger, with a wink at the other two."He
'adn't got 'is senses back when me and Sam came away."Bill gave a groan and sat on the bed while 'e dried himself, and Ginger
told 'im 'ow he 'ad bent a quart pot on the landlord's 'ead, and 'ow the
landlord 'ad been carried upstairs and the doctor sent for.John travelled to the bathroom.He began to
tremble all over, and when Ginger said he'd go out and see 'ow the land
lay 'e could 'ardly thank 'im enough.He stayed in the bedroom all day, with the blinds down, and wouldn't eat
anything, and when Ginger looked in about eight o'clock to find out
whether he 'ad gone, he found 'im sitting on the bed clean shaved, and
'is face cut about all over where the razor 'ad slipped.Ginger was gone about two hours, and when 'e came back he looked so
solemn that old Sam asked 'im whether he 'ad seen a ghost.Ginger didn't
answer 'im; he set down on the side o' the bed and sat thinking."I s'pose--I s'pose it's nice and fresh in the streets this morning?"ses Bill, at last, in a trembling voice."I didn't notice, mate," he ses.Then
'e got up and patted Bill on the back, very gentle, and sat down again.[Illustration: "Patted Bill on the back, very gentle."]asks Peter Russet, staring at 'im."It's that landlord," ses Ginger; "there's straw down in the road
outside, and they say that he's dying.Pore old Bill don't know 'is own
strength.The best thing you can do, old pal, is to go as far away as
you can, at once.""I shouldn't wait a minnit if it was me," ses old Sam.Bill groaned and hid 'is face in his 'ands, and then Peter Russet went
and spoilt things by saying that the safest place for a murderer to 'ide
in was London.Bill gave a dreadful groan when 'e said murderer, but 'e
up and agreed with Peter, and all Sam and Ginger Dick could do wouldn't
make 'im alter his mind.He said that he would shave off 'is beard and
moustache, and when night came 'e would creep out and take a lodging
somewhere right the other end of London."It'll soon be dark," ses Ginger, "and your own brother wouldn't know you
now, Bill."Nobody must know that, mate," he ses."I must go
into hiding for as long as I can--as long as my money lasts; I've only
got six pounds left.""That'll last a long time if you're careful," ses Ginger."I want a lot more," ses Bill."I want you to take this silver ring as a
keepsake, Ginger.If I 'ad another six pounds or so I should feel much
safer.'Ow much 'ave you got, Ginger?""Not much," ses Ginger, shaking his 'ead."Lend it to me, mate," ses Bill, stretching out his 'and.Ah, I wish I was you; I'd be as 'appy as 'appy if I
hadn't got a penny.""I'm very sorry, Bill," ses Ginger, trying to smile, "but I've already
promised to lend it to a man wot we met this evening.A promise is a
promise, else I'd lend it to you with pleasure.""Would you let me be 'ung for the sake of a few pounds, Ginger?"ses
Bill, looking at 'im reproach-fully."I'm a desprit man, Ginger, and I
must 'ave that money."Afore pore Ginger could move he suddenly clapped 'is hand over 'is mouth
and flung 'im on the bed.Ginger was like a child in 'is hands, although
he struggled like a madman, and in five minutes 'e was laying there with
a towel tied round his mouth and 'is arms and legs tied up with the cord
off of Sam's chest."I'm very sorry, Ginger," ses Bill, as 'e took a little over eight pounds
out of Ginger's pocket."I'll pay you back one o' these days, if I can.If you'd got a rope round your neck same as I 'ave you'd do the same as
I've done."He lifted up the bedclothes and put Ginger inside and tucked 'im up.Ginger's face was red with passion and 'is eyes starting out of his 'ead."Eight and six is fifteen," ses Bill, and just then he 'eard somebody
coming up the stairs.Ginger 'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came
into the room 'e tried all 'e could to attract 'is attention by rolling
'is 'ead from side to side."Why, 'as Ginger gone to bed?""He's all right," ses Bill; "just a bit of a 'eadache."Peter stood staring at the bed, and then 'e pulled the clothes off and
saw pore Ginger all tied up, and making awful eyes at 'im to undo him."I 'ad to do it, Peter," ses Bill."I wanted some more money to escape
with, and 'e wouldn't lend it to me.I 'aven't got as much as I want
now.You just came in in the nick of time.Another minute and you'd ha'
missed me."Ah, I wish I could lend you some, Bill," ses Peter Russet, turning pale,
"but I've 'ad my pocket picked; that's wot I came back for, to get some
from Ginger.""You see 'ow it is, Bill," ses Peter, edging back toward the door; "three
men laid 'old of me and took every farthing I'd got.""Well, I can't rob you, then," ses Bill, catching 'old of 'im."Whoever's money this is," he ses, pulling a handful out o' Peter's
pocket, "it can't be yours.Now, if you make another sound I'll knock
your 'ead off afore I tie you up.""Don't tie me up, Bill," ses Peter, struggling."I can't trust you," ses Bill, dragging 'im over to the washstand and
taking up the other towel; "turn round."Peter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill 'ad done 'im
'e put 'im in alongside o' Ginger and covered 'em up, arter first tying
both the gags round with some string to prevent 'em slipping."Mind, I've only borrowed it," he ses, standing by the side o' the bed;
"but I must say, mates, I'm disappointed in both of you.John journeyed to the kitchen.If either of
you 'ad 'ad the misfortune wot I've 'ad, I'd have sold the clothes off my
back to 'elp you.And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither."He stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their
'eads and went downstairs.Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and
then they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to
talk with their eyes.Then Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e
might as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.The worst of it was
they couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter
Russet leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up
agin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.He banged
Peter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till
they'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair
and lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.And all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.He
sat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,
wondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.Ginger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into
the room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed
in a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.He thought it was Bill
carrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs
afore he stopped to take breath.He stood there trembling for about ten
minutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on
tiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made
that bed do everything but speak.ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready
to dash downstairs agin.There was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill
was dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.All 'e did know was
that 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.He shut the door gently and
went downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding
one, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead
agin the banisters, went to sleep.[Illustration: "Picked out the softest stair 'e could find."]It was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.He was
stiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped
softly upstairs and opened the door.Peter and Ginger was waiting for
'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their
'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with
bandages.He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped
into the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes."Wot d'ye mean by making sights of
yourselves like that?'Ave you took leave of your senses?"Ginger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam
see wot was the matter with 'em.Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is
knife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call
'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to."You wait a moment," he screams, 'arf crying with rage."You wait till I
get my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.The idea o' leaving us
like this all night, you old crocodile.He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet
called 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath."And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you," he ses."Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on
you."Sam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat
at the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.It wasn't the
fust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with
it.He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint."That'll do," he ses, at last; "another word and I shall put the
bedclothes over your 'ead.Afore I do anything more I want to know wot
it's all about."Peter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger
was past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was
at them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave
prevented it.He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is
own voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot
sorrow it caused their friends.Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes
over their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.[Illustration: "Old Sam said 'ow surprised he was at them for letting
Bill do it."]"_Are you going--to undo--us?_"  ses Ginger, at last."No, Ginger," ses old Sam; "in justice to myself I couldn't do it.Arter
wot you've said--and arter wot I've said--my life wouldn't be safe.Besides which, you'd want to go shares in my money."He took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an
hour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.As soon
as they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for
Sam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they
never set eyes on 'im again.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bill's Lapse, by W.W.Oh, the long, long centuries since that day!Oh, the agony, Oh, life's bitter cost
    Since that useless little fern was lost!There came a thoughtful man
      Searching Nature's secrets far and deep;
      From a fissure in a rocky steep
    He withdrew a stone, o'er which there ran
      Fairy pencilings, a quaint design,
      Veining, leafage, fibres, clear and fine,
      And the fern's life lay in every line.So, methinks, God hides some souls away,
    Sweetly to surprise us some sweet day.To show the importance of water to animal life, we give the opinions
of several travelers and scientific men who have studied the question
thoroughly.The Camel, with his pouch for storing water, can go longer without
drink than other animals.He doesn't do it from choice, any more than
you in a desert would prefer to drink the water that you have carried
with you, if you might choose between that and fresh spring water.Major A. G. Leonard, an English transport officer, claims that Camels
"should be watered every day, that they can not be trained to do
without water, and that, though they can retain one and a half gallons
of water in the cells of the stomach, four or five days' abstinence is
as much as they can stand, in heat and with dry food, without permanent
injury."Bryden, has observed
that the beasts and birds of the deserts must have private stores of
water of which we know nothing.Bryden, however, has seen the
Sand-Grouse of South America on their flight to drink at a desert pool."The watering process is gone through with perfect order and without
overcrowding"--a hint to young people who are hungry and thirsty at
their meals."From eight o'clock to close on ten this wonderful flight
continued; as birds drank and departed, others were constantly arriving
to take their places.I should judge that the average time spent by
each bird at and around the water was half an hour."To show the wonderful instinct which animals possess for discovering
water an anecdote is told by a writer in the _Spectator_, and the
article is republished in the _Living Age_ of February 5.The question
of a supply of good water for the Hague was under discussion in Holland
at the time of building the North Sea Canal.Some one insisted that
the Hares, Rabbits, and Partridges knew of a supply in the sand hills,
because they never came to the wet "polders" to drink.Then one of the local engineers suggested that
the sand hills should be carefully explored, and now a long reservoir
in the very center of those hills fills with water naturally and
supplies the entire town.All this goes to prove to our mind that if Seals do not apparently
drink, if Cormorants and Penguins, Giraffes, Snakes, and Reptiles seem
to care nothing for water, some of them do eat wet or moist food, while
the Giraffe, for one, enjoys the juices of the leaves of trees that
have their roots in the moisture.None of these animals are our common,
everyday pets.If they were, it would cost us nothing to put water
at their disposal, but that they never drink in their native haunts
"can not be proved until the deserts have been explored and the total
absence of water confirmed."--_Ex._




  [Illustration: From col.CHICAGO COLORTYPE CO.,
                 CHIC.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.Just how many species of Gulls there are has not yet been determined,
but the habits and locations of about twenty-six species have been
described.The American Herring Gull is found throughout North America,
nesting from Maine northward, and westward throughout the interior on
the large inland waters, and occasionally on the Pacific; south in
the winter to Cuba and lower California.This Gull is a common bird
throughout its range, particularly coast-wise.Goss in his "Birds of Kansas," writes as follows of the Herring
Gull:

"In the month of June, 1880, I found the birds nesting in large
communities on the little island adjacent to Grand Manan; many were
nesting in spruce tree tops from twenty to forty feet from the ground.It was an odd sight to see them on their nests or perched upon a limb,
chattering and scolding as approached."In the trees I had no difficulty in finding full sets of their eggs,
as the egg collectors rarely take the trouble to climb, but on the
rocks I was unable to find an egg within reach, the 'eggers' going
daily over the rocks.I was told by several that they yearly robbed the
birds, taking, however, but nine eggs from a nest, as they found that
whenever they took a greater number, the birds so robbed would forsake
their nests, or, as they expressed it, cease to lay, and that in order
to prevent an over-collection they invariably drop near the nest a
little stone or pebble for every egg taken."They do not leave their nesting grounds
until able to fly, though, half-grown birds are sometimes seen on the
water that by fright or accident have fallen.The nests are composed
of grass and moss.Some of them are large and elaborately made, while
others are merely shallow depressions with a slight lining.Three eggs
are usually laid, which vary from bluish-white to a deep yellowish
brown, spotted and blotched with brown of different shades.In many
cases where the Herring Gull has suffered persecution, it has been
known to depart from its usual habit of nesting on the open seashore.It is a pleasure to watch a flock of Gulls riding buoyantly upon the
water.They do not dive, as many suppose, but only immerse the head
and neck.They are omnivorous and greedy eaters; "scavengers of the
beach, and in the harbors to be seen boldly alighting upon the masts
and flying about the vessels, picking up the refuse matter as soon as
it is cast overboard, and often following the steamers from thirty
to forty miles from the land, and sometimes much farther."They are
ever upon the alert, with a quick eye that notices every floating
object or disturbance of the water, and as they herald with screams
the appearance of the Herring or other small fishes that often swim in
schools at the surface of the water, they prove an unerring pilot to
the fishermen who hastily follow with their lines and nets, for they
know that beneath and following the valuable catch in sight are the
larger fishes that are so intent upon taking the little ones in out of
the wet as largely to forget their cunning, and thus make their capture
an easy one.Very large flocks of Gulls, at times appearing many hundreds, are
seen on Lake Michigan.We recently saw in the vicinity of Milwaukee
a flock of what we considered to be many thousands of these birds,
flying swiftly, mounting up, and falling, as if to catch themselves,
in wide circles, the sun causing their wings and sides to glisten like
burnished silver.It is claimed that two hundred millions of dollars that should go to
the farmer, the gardner, and the fruit grower in the United States are
lost every year by the ravages of insects--that is to say, one-tenth of
our agricultural product is actually destroyed by them.The Department
of Agriculture has made a thorough investigation of this subject, and
its conclusions are about as stated.The ravages of the Gypsy Moth in
three counties in Massachusetts for several years annually cost the
state $100,000."Now, as rain is the natural check to drought, so birds
are the natural check to insects, for what are pests to the farmer
are necessities of life to the bird.It is calculated that an average
insectivorous bird destroys 2,400 insects in a year; and when it is
remembered that there are over 100,000 kinds of insects in the United
States, the majority of which are injurious, and that in some cases
a single individual in a year may become the progenitor of several
billion descendants, it is seen how much good birds do ordinarily
by simple prevention."All of which has reference chiefly to the
indispensableness of preventing by every possible means the destruction
of the birds whose food largely consists of insects.But many of our so-called birds of prey, which have been thought to
be the enemies of the agriculturist and have hence been ruthlessly
destroyed, are equally beneficial.Fisher, an authority on the
subject, in referring to the injustice which has been done to many of
the best friends of the farm and garden, says:

"The birds of prey, the majority of which labor night and day to
destroy the enemies of the husbandman, are persecuted unceasingly.This
has especially been the case with the Hawk family, only three of the
common inland species being harmful.These are the Goshawk, Cooper's
Hawk, and the Sharp-shinned Hawk, the first of which is rare in the
United States, except in winter.Cooper's Hawk, or the Chicken Hawk,
is the most destructive, especially to Doves.The other Hawks are of
great value, one of which, the Marsh Hawk, being regarded as perhaps
more useful than any other.It can be easily distinguished by its
white rump and its habit of beating low over the meadows.Meadow Mice,
Rabbits, and Squirrels are its favorite food.The Red-tailed Hawk, or
Hen Hawk, is another."It does not deserve the name, for according to
Dr.Fisher, while fully sixty-six per cent of its food consists of
injurious mammals, not more than seven per cent consists of poultry,
and that it is probable that a large proportion of the poultry and game
captured by it and the other Buzzard Hawks is made up of old, diseased,
or otherwise disabled fowls, so preventing their interbreeding with the
sound stock and hindering the spread of fatal epidemics.It eats Ground
Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice, and Rats.The Red-shouldered Hawk, whose picture we present to our readers, is
as useful as it is beautiful, in fact ninety per cent of its food is
composed of injurious mammals and insects.The Sparrow Hawk (See BIRDS, vol.107) is another useful member
of this family.In the warm months Grasshoppers, Crickets, and other
insects compose its food, and Mice during the rest of the year.Swainson's Hawk is said to be the great Grasshopper destroyer of the
west, and it is estimated that in a month three hundred of these birds
save sixty tons of produce that the Grasshopper would destroy.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.On account of the value of its skin, this interesting animal is much
sought after by those who take pride in their skill in securing it.It is commonly known by its abbreviated name of <DW53>, and as it is of
frequent occurrence throughout the United States, every country boy is
more or less acquainted with its habits.As an article of food there is
much diversity of opinion respecting its merits.It is hunted by some
for the sport alone, which is doubtless to be lamented, and by others
who enjoy also the pleasure of a palatable stew.As a pet it is also
much prized.The food of the Raccoon consists in the main of small animals and
insects.The succulent Oyster also is a favorite article of its diet.It bites off the hinge of the Oyster and scrapes out the animal in
fragments with its paws.Like the Squirrel when eating a nut, the
Raccoon usually holds its food between its fore paws pressed together
and sits upon its hind quarters when it eats.Poultry is also enjoyed
by it, and it is said to be as destructive in the farm yard as the Fox,
as it only devours the heads of the fowl.When taken young the <DW53> is easily tamed, but often becomes blind soon
after its capture.This is believed to be produced by the sensitiveness
of its eyes, which are intended only to be used by night.As it is
frequently awakened by day it suffers so much from the glare of light
that its eyes gradually lose their vision.If it must be confined
at all it should be in a darkened place.In zoological gardens we
have frequently seen several of these animals exposed to the glaring
sunlight, the result of ignorance or cruelty, or both.Unlike the Fox, the Raccoon is at home in a tree, which is the usual
refuge when danger is near, and not being very swift of foot, it is
well that it possesses this climbing ability.According to Hallock,
the <DW53>s' abode is generally in a hollow tree, oak or chestnut, and
when the "juvenile farmer's son comes across a _Coon tree_, he is
not long in making known his discovery to friends and neighbors, who
forthwith assemble at the spot to secure it."The "sport" is in no
sense agreeable from a humane point of view, and we trust it will cease
to be regarded as such by those who indulge in it."The Raccoon makes a
heroic struggle and often puts many of his assailants _hors de combat_
for many a day, his jaws being strong and his claws sharp."The young ones are generally from four to eight, pretty little
creatures at first and about as large as half-grown Rats.They are very
playful, soon become docile and tame, but at the first chance will
wander off to the woods and not return.The <DW53> is a night animal and
never travels by day; sometimes it is said, being caught at morning far
from its tree and being unable to return thither, it will spend the
hours of daylight snugly coiled up among the thickest foliage of some
lofty tree-top.It is adroit in its attempts to baffle Dogs, and will
often enter a brook and travel for some distance in the water, thus
puzzling and delaying its pursuers.A good sized Raccoon will weigh from fifteen to twenty pounds.The curiosity of the Raccoon is one of its most interesting
characteristics.It will search every place of possible concealment for
food, examine critically any object of interest, will rifle a pocket,
stand upright and watch every motion of man or animal, and indeed show
a marked desire for all sorts of knowledge.Raccoons are apparently
happy in captivity when properly cared for by their keepers.Their Number and Variety is Increasing Instead of Diminishing.Whether in consequence of the effective working of the Wild Birds'
Charter or of other unknown causes, there can be no doubt in the
minds of observant lovers of our feathered friends that of late years
there has been a great and gratifying increase in their numbers in
and around London, especially so, of course, in the vicinity of the
beautiful open spaces which do such beneficent work silently in this
province of houses.But even in long, unlovely streets, far removed
from the rich greenery of the parks, the shabby parallelograms, by
courtesy styled gardens, are becoming more and more frequently visited
by such pretty shy songsters as Linnets, Blackbirds, Thrushes, and
Finches, who, though all too often falling victims to the predatory
Cat, find abundant food in these cramped enclosures.Naturally some
suburbs are more favored than others in this respect, notably Dulwich,
which, though fast losing its beautiful character under the ruthless
grip of the builder, still retains some delightful nooks where one may
occasionally hear the Nightingale's lovely song in its season.But the most noticable additions to the bird population of London have
been among the Starlings.Their quaint gabble and peculiar minor
whistle may now be heard in the most unexpected localities.Even
the towering mansions which have replaced so many of the slums of
Westminster find favor in their eyes, for among the thick clustering
chimneys which crown these great buildings their slovenly nests may be
found in large numbers.In some districts they are so numerous that the
irrepressible Sparrow, true London gamin that he is, finds himself in
considerable danger of being crowded out.This is perhaps most evident
on the sequestered lawns of some of the inns of the court, Gray's Inn
Square, for instance, where hundreds of Starlings at a time may now
be observed busily trotting about the greensward searching for food.Several long streets come to mind where not a house is without its pair
or more of Starlings, who continue faithful to their chosen roofs, and
whose descendants settle near as they grow up, well content with their
surroundings.House Martins, too, in spite of repeated efforts on the
part of irritated landlords to drive them away by destroying their
nests on account of the disfigurement to the front of the dwelling,
persist in returning year after year and rebuilding their ingenious
little mud cells under the eaves of the most modern suburban villas or
terrace houses.--_Pall Mall Gazette._




  [Illustration: From col.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Pigmy Antelopes present examples of singular members of the family,
in that they are of exceedingly diminutive size, the smallest being
no larger than a large Rat, dainty creatures indeed.The Pigmy is an
inhabitant of South Africa, and its habits are said to be quite similar
to those of its brother of the western portion of North America.The Antelope is a very wary animal, but the sentiment of curiosity
is implanted so strongly in its nature that it often leads it to
reconnoitre too closely some object which it cannot clearly make out,
and its investigations are pursued until "the dire answer to all
inquiries is given by the sharp'spang' of the rifle and the answering
'spat' as the ball strikes the beautiful creatures flank."The Pigmy
Antelope is not hunted, however, as is its larger congener, and may
be considered rather as a diminutive curiosity of Natures' delicate
workmanship than as the legitimate prey of man.No sooner had the twilight settled over the island than new bird voices
called from the hills about us.The birds of the day were at rest, and
their place was filled with the night denizens of the island.They
came from the dark recesses of the forests, first single stragglers,
increased by midnight to a stream of eager birds, passing to and fro
from the sea.Many, attracted by the glow of the burning logs, altered
their course and circled about the fire a few times and then sped on.From their notes we identified the principal night prowlers as the
Cassin's Auklet, Rhinoceros Auk, Murrelet, and varieties of Petrel.All through the night our slumbers were frequently disturbed by birds
alighting on the sides of the tent, slipping down with great scratching
into the grass below, where our excited Dog took a hand in the matter,
daylight often finding our tent strewn with birds he had captured
during the night.When he found time to sleep I do not know.He was
after birds the entire twenty-four hours.In climbing over the hills of the island we discovered the retreats of
these night birds, the soil everywhere through the deep wood being
fairly honeycombed with their nesting burrows.The larger tunnels
of the Rhinoceros Auks were, as a rule, on the <DW72>s of the hill,
while the little burrows of the Cassin's Auklet were on top in the
flat places.We opened many of their queer abodes that ran back with
many turns to a distance of ten feet or more.One or both birds were
invariably found at the end, covering their single egg, for this
species, like many other sea birds, divide the duties of incubation,
both sexes doing an equal share, relieving each other at night.The Puffins nested in burrows also, but lower down--often just above
the surf.One must be very careful, indeed, how he thrusts his hand
into their dark dens, for should the old bird chance to be at home, its
vise-like bill can inflict a very painful wound.The rookeries of the
Murres and Cormorants were on the sides of steep cliffs overhanging the
sea.Mary travelled to the kitchen.Looking down from above, hundreds of eggs could be seen, gathered
along the narrow shelves and chinks in the rocks, but accessible only
by means of a rope from the top.--_Outing._




THE RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Blue Jay
imitated, as you will remember, in the story "The New Tenants,"
published in Birds._Kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, that is my cry, very loud and plaintive;
they say I am a very noisy bird; perhaps that is the reason why Mr.Blue Jay imitates me more than he does other Hawks.I am called Chicken Hawk, and Hen Hawk, also, though I don't deserve
either of those names.There are members of our family, and oh, what
a lot of us there are--as numerous as the Woodpeckers--who do drop
down into the barnyards and right before the farmer's eyes carry off
a Chicken.Red Squirrels, to my notion, are more appetizing than
Chickens; so are Mice, Frogs, Centipedes, Snakes, and Worms.A bird
once in a while I like for variety, and between you and me, if I am
hungry, I pick up a chicken now and then, that has strayed outside the
barnyard.But only _occasionally_, remember, so that I don't deserve
the name of Chicken Hawk at all, do I?Wooded swamps, groves inhabited by Squirrels, and patches of low timber
are the places in which we make our homes.Sometimes we use an old
crow's nest instead of building one; we retouch it a little and put in
a soft lining of feathers which my mate plucks from her breast.When
we build a new nest, it is made of husks, moss, and strips of bark,
lined as the building progresses with my mate's feathers.Young lady
Red-shouldered Hawks lay three and sometimes four eggs, but the old
lady birds lay only two.Blue Jay never sees a Hawk without giving the alarm, and on
he rushes to attack us, backed up by other Jays who never fail to go
to his assistance.They often assemble in great numbers and actually
succeed in driving us out of the neighborhood.Not that we are afraid
of them, oh no!We know them to be great cowards, as well as the crows,
who harass us also, and only have to turn on our foes to put them to
rout.Sometimes we do turn, and seizing a Blue Jay, sail off with him
to the nearest covert; or in mid air strike a Crow who persistently
follows us.But as a general thing we simply ignore our little
assailants, and just fly off to avoid them.RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Hawk family is an interesting one and many of them are beautiful.The Red-shouldered Hawk is one of the finest specimens of these birds,
as well as one of the most useful.Of late years the farmer has come to
know it as his friend rather than his enemy, as formerly.It inhabits
the woodlands where it feeds chiefly upon Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice,
Moles, and Lizards.It occasionally drops down on an unlucky Duck or
Bob White, though it is not quick enough to catch the smaller birds.It is said to be destructive to domestic fowls raised in or near the
timber, but does not appear to search for food far away from its
natural haunts.Sandra moved to the kitchen.As it is a very noisy bird, the birds which it might
destroy are warned of its approach, and thus protect themselves.During the early nesting season its loud, harsh _kee-oe_ is heard from
the perch and while in the air, often keeping up the cry for a long
time without intermission.Goss says that he collected at Neosho
Falls, Kansas, for several successive years a set of the eggs of this
species from a nest in the forks of a medium sized oak.In about nine
days after each robbery the birds would commence laying again, and
he allowed them to hatch and rear their young.One winter during his
absence the tree was cut down, but this did not discourage the birds,
or cause them to forsake the place, for on approach of spring he found
them building a nest not over ten rods from the old one, but this time
in a large sycamore beyond reach.This seemed to him to indicate that
they become greatly attached to the grounds selected for a home, which
they vigilantly guard, not permitting a bird of prey to come within
their limits.This species is one of the commonest in the United States, being
especially abundant in the winter, from which it receives the name of
Winter Falcon.The name of Chicken Hawk is often applied to it, though
it does not deserve the name, its diet being of a more humble kind.The eggs are usually deposited in April or May in numbers of three or
four--sometimes only two.The ground color is bluish, yellowish-white
or brownish, spotted, blotched and dotted irregularly with many shades
of reddish brown.According to
Davie, to describe all the shades of reds and browns which comprise the
variation would be an almost endless task, and a large series like this
must be seen in order to appreciate how much the eggs of this species
vary.The flight of the Red-shouldered Hawk is slow, but steady and strong
with a regular beat of the wings.They take delight in sailing in the
air, where they float lightly and with scarcely a notable motion of
the wings, often circling to a great height.During the insect season,
while thus sailing, they often fill their craws with grass-hoppers,
that, during the after part of the day, also enjoy an air sail.Venice, the pride of Italy of old, aside from its other numerous
curiosities and antiquities, has one which is a novelty indeed.Its
Doves on the San Marco Place are a source of wonder and amusement to
every lover of animal life.Their most striking peculiarity is that
they fear no mortal man, be he stranger or not.They come in countless
numbers, and, when not perched on the far-famed bell tower, are found
on the flags of San Marco Square.They are often misnamed Pigeons, but
as a matter of fact they are Doves of the highest order.They differ,
however, from our wild Doves in that they are fully three times as
large, and twice as large as our best domestic Pigeon.John went back to the hallway.Their plumage
is of a soft mouse color relieved by pure white, and occasionally
one of pure white is found, but these are rare.Hold out to them a
handful of crumbs and without fear they will come, perch on your hand
or shoulder and eat with thankful coos.To strangers this is indeed
a pleasing sight, and demonstrates the lack of fear of animals when
they are treated humanely, for none would dare to injure the doves of
San Marco.He would probably forfeit his life were he to injure one
intentionally.And what beggars these Doves of San Marco are!They will
crowd around, and push and coo with their soft soothing voices, until
you can withstand them no longer, and invest a few centimes in bread
for their benefit.Their bread, by the way, is sold by an Italian, who
must certainly be in collusion with the Doves, for whenever a stranger
makes his appearance, both Doves and bread vender are at hand to beg.The most remarkable fact in connection with these Doves is that they
will collect in no other place in large numbers than San Marco Square,
and in particular at the vestibule of San Marco Church.True, they are
found perched on buildings throughout the entire city, and occasionally
we will find a few in various streets picking refuse, but they never
appear in great numbers outside of San Marco Square.The ancient bell
tower, which is situated on the west side of the place, is a favorite
roosting place for them, and on this perch they patiently wait for a
foreigner, and proceed to bleed him after approved Italian fashion.There are several legends connected with the Doves of Venice, each of
which attempts to explain the peculiar veneration of the Venetian and
the extreme liberty allowed these harbingers of peace.The one which
struck me as being the most appropriate is as follows:

Centuries ago Venice was a free city, having her own government, navy,
and army, and in a manner was considered quite a power on land and sea.The city was ruled by a Senate consisting of ten men, who were called
Doges, who had absolute power, which they used very often in a despotic
and cruel manner, especially where political prisoners were concerned.On account of the riches the city contained, and also its values as
a port, Venice was coveted by Italy and neighboring nations, and, as
a consequence, was often called upon to defend itself with rather
indifferent success.In fact, Venice was conquered so often, first by
one and then another, that Venetians were seldom certain of how they
stood.They knew not whether they were slave or victor.It was during
one of these sieges that the incident of the Doves occurred.The city
had been besieged for a long time by Italians, and matters were coming
to such a pass that a surrender was absolutely necessary on account of
lack of food.Daniel went to the hallway.In fact, the Doges had issued a decree that on the morrow
the city should surrender unconditionally.All was gloom and sorrow, and the populace stood around in groups
on the San Marco discussing the situation and bewailing their fate,
when lo!in the eastern sky there appeared a dense cloud rushing upon
the city with the speed of the wind.At first consternation reigned
supreme, and men asked each other: "What new calamity is this?"As the
cloud swiftly approached it was seen to be a vast number of Doves,
which, after hovering over the San Marco Place for a moment, gracefully
settled down upon the flagstones and approached the men without fear.Then there arose a queer cry, "The Doves!It
appears that some years before this a sage had predicted stormy times
for Venice, with much suffering and strife, but, when all seemed lost,
there would appear a multitude of Doves, who would bring Venice peace
and happiness.And so it came to pass that the next day, instead of
attacking, the besiegers left, and Venice was free again.The prophet
also stated that, so long as the Doves remained at Venice prosperity
would reign supreme, but that there would come a day when the Doves
would leave just as they had come, and Venice would pass into
oblivion.That is why Venetians take such good care of their Doves.You will not find this legend in any history, but I give it just as it
was told me by a guide, who seemed well versed in hair-raising legends.Possibly they were manufactured to order by this energetic gentleman,
but they sounded well nevertheless.Even to this day the old men of
Venice fear that some morning they will awake and find their Doves gone.There in the shadow of the famous bell-tower, with the stately San
Marco church on one side and the palace of the cruel and murderous
Doges on the other, we daily find our pretty Doves coaxing for bread.Often you will find them peering down into the dark passage-way in the
palace, which leads to the dungeons underneath the Grand Canal.What
a boon a sight of these messengers of peace would have been to the
doomed inmates of these murder-reeking caves.But happily they are now
deserted, and are used only as a source of revenue, which is paid by
the inquisitive tourist.She never changes, and the Doves of San
Marco will still remain.May we hope, with the sages of Venice, that
they may remain forever.--_Lebert, in Cincinnati Commercial Gazette._




BUTTERFLIES.It may appear strange, if not altogether inappropriate to the season,
that "the fair fragile things which are the resurrection of the ugly,
creeping caterpillars" should be almost as numerous in October as in
the balmy month of July.Yet it is true, and early October, in some
parts of the country, is said to be perhaps the best time of the year
for the investigating student and observer of Butterflies.While not
quite so numerous, perhaps, many of the species are in more perfect
condition, and the variety is still intact.Many of them come and
remain until frost, and the largest Butterfly we have, the Archippus,
does not appear until the middle of July, but after that is constantly
with us, floating and circling on the wing, until October.How these
delicate creatures can endure even the chill of autumn days is one of
the mysteries.Very curious and interesting are the Skippers, says _Current
Literature_.They are very small insects, but their bodies are robust,
and they fly with great rapidity, not moving in graceful, wavy lines
as the true Butterflies do, but skipping about with sudden, jerky
motions.Their flight is very short, and almost always near the
ground.They can never be mistaken, as their peculiar motion renders
their identification easy.They are seen at their best in August and
September.All June and July Butterflies are August and September
Butterflies, not so numerous in some instances, perhaps, but still
plentiful, and vying with the rich hues of the changing autumnal
foliage.The "little wood brownies," or Quakers, are exceedingly interesting.Their colors are not brilliant, but plain, and they seek the quiet and
retirement of the woods, where they flit about in graceful circles over
the shady beds of ferns and woodland grasses.Many varieties of the Vanessa are often seen flying about in May, but
they are far more numerous and perfect in July, August, and September.A beautiful Azure-blue Butterfly, when it is fluttering over flowers
in the sunshine, looks like a tiny speck of bright blue satin.Several
other small Butterflies which appear at the same time are readily
distinguished by the peculiar manner in which their hind wings are
tailed.Their color is a dull brown of various shades, marked in some
of the varieties with specks of white or blue."Their presence in the gardens and meadows," says a recent writer,
"and in the fields and along the river-banks, adds another element
of gladness which we are quick to recognize, and even the plodding
wayfarer who has not the honor of a single intimate acquaintance among
them might, perhaps, be the first to miss their circlings about his
path.As roses belong to June, and chrysanthemums to November, so
Butterflies seem to be a joyous part of July.It is their gala-day,
and they are everywhere, darting and circling and sailing, dropping to
investigate flowers and overripe fruit, and rising on buoyant wings
high into the upper air, bright, joyous, airy, ephemeral.But July can
only claim the larger part of their allegiance, for they are wanderers
into all the other months, and even occasionally brave the winter with
torn and faded wings."[Illustration: BUTTERFLIES.--Life-size.Somehow people always say that when they see a Fox.I'd rather they
would call me that than stupid, however."Look pleasant," said the man when taking my photograph for Birds,
and I flatter myself I did--and intelligent, too.Look at my brainy
head, my delicate ears--broad below to catch every sound, and tapering
so sharply to a point that they can shape themselves to every wave
of sound.Note the crafty calculation and foresight of my low, flat
brow, the resolute purpose of my pointed nose; my eye deep set--like
a robber's--my thin cynical lips, and mouth open from ear to ear.You
couldn't find a better looking Fox if you searched the world over.I can leap, crawl, run, and swim, and walk so noiselessly that even the
dead leaves won't rustle under my feet.It takes a deal of cunning for
a Fox to get along in this world, I can tell you.I'd go hungry if I
didn't plan and observe the habits of other creatures.When I want one for my supper off I trot to the nearest
stream, and standing very quiet, watch till I spy a nice, plump trout
in the clear water.A leap, a snap, and it is all over with Mr.Another time I feel as though I'd like a crawfish.I see one snoozing
by his hole near the water's edge.I drop my fine, bushy tail into the
water and tickle him on the ear.That makes him furious--nobody likes
to be wakened from a nap that way--and out he darts at the tail; snap
go my jaws, and Mr.Crawfish is crushed in them, shell and all.Between you and me, I consider that a very clever trick, too.How I love the green fields,
the ripening grain, the delicious fruits, for then the Rabbits prick up
their long ears, and thinking themselves out of danger, run along the
hillside; then the quails skulk in the wheat stubble, and the birds hop
and fly about the whole day long.I am very fond of Rabbits, Quails,
and other Birds.For dessert I have
only to sneak into an orchard and eat my fill of apples, pears, and
grapes.You perceive I have very good reason for liking the summer.It's the merriest time of the year for me, and my cubs.They grow fat
and saucy, too.The only Foxes that are hunted (the others only being taken by means of
traps or poison) are the Red and Gray species.The Gray Fox is a more
southern species than the Red and is rarely found north of the state
of Maine.Indeed it is said to be not common anywhere in New England.In the southern states, however, it wholly replaces the Red Fox, and,
according to Hallock, one of the best authorities on game animals in
this country, causes quite as much annoyance to the farmer as does
that proverbial and predatory animal, the terror of the hen-roost and
the smaller rodents.The Gray Fox is somewhat smaller than the Red and
differs from him in being wholly dark gray "mixed hoary and black."He
also differs from his northern cousin in being able to climb trees.Although not much of a runner, when hard pressed by the dog he will
often ascend the trunk of a leaning tree, or will even climb an erect
one, grasping the trunk in his arms as would a Bear.Nevertheless the
Fox is not at home among the branches, and looks and no doubt feels
very much out of place while in this predicament.The ability to climb,
however, often saves him from the hounds, who are thus thrown off the
scent and Reynard is left to trot home at his leisure.Foxes live in holes of their own making, generally in the loamy soil
of a side hill, says an old Fox hunter, and the she-Fox bears four or
five cubs at a litter.When a fox-hole is discovered by the Farmers
they assemble and proceed to dig out the inmates who have lately, very
likely, been making havoc among the hen-roosts.An amusing incident,
he relates, which came under his observation a few years ago will
bear relating.A farmer discovered the lair of an old dog Fox by
means of his hound, who trailed the animal to his hole.This Fox had
been making large and nightly inroads into the poultry ranks of the
neighborhood, and had acquired great and unenviable notoriety on that
account.The farmer and two companions, armed with spades and hoes,
and accompanied by the faithful hound, started to dig out the Fox.The
hole was situated on the sandy <DW72> of a hill, and after a laborious
and continued digging of four hours, Reynard was unearthed and he and
Rep, the dog, were soon engaged in deadly strife.The excitement had
waxed hot, and dog, men, and Fox were all struggling in a promiscuous
melee.Soon a burly farmer watching his chance strikes wildly with his
hoe-handle for Reynard's head, which is scarcely distinguishable in the
maze of legs and bodies.a sudden movement
of the hairy mass brings the fierce stroke upon the faithful dog, who
with a wild howl relaxes his grasp and rolls with bruised and bleeding
head, faint and powerless on the hillside.Reynard takes advantage of
the turn affairs have assumed, and before the gun, which had been laid
aside on the grass some hours before, can be reached he disappears over
the crest of the hill.Hallock says that an old she-Fox with young, to supply them with food,
will soon deplete the hen-roost and destroy both old and great numbers
of very young chickens.They generally travel by night, follow regular
runs, and are exceedingly shy of any invention for their capture, and
the use of traps is almost futile.If caught in a trap, they will gnaw
off the captured foot and escape, in which respect they fully support
their ancient reputation for cunning.Copyright by

abounds everywhere; absolutely unmolested, they are as tame as a
poultry yard, making the country one vast aviary.Yellow-beaked Minas,
Ring-doves, Jays, Hoopoes, and Parrots take dust baths with the merry
Palm-squirrel in the roadway, hardly troubling themselves to hop out
of the way of the heavy bull-carts; every wayside pond and lake is
alive with Ducks, Wild Geese, Flamingoes, Pelicans, and waders of every
size and sort, from dainty red-legged beauties the size of Pigeons up
to the great unwieldy Cranes and Adjutants five feet high.We pass a
dead Sheep with two loathsome vultures picking over the carcass, and
presently a brood of fluffy young Partridges with father and mother in
charge look at us fearlessly within ten feet of our whirling carriage.Every village has its flock of sacred Peacocks pacing gravely through
the surrounding gardens and fields, and Woodpeckers and Kingfishers
flash about like jewels in the blazing sunlight."----

WARNING COLORS.--Very complete experiments in support of the theory
of warning colors, first suggested by Bates and also by Wallace, have
been made in India by Mr.He concludes
that there is a general appetite for Butterflies among insectivorous
birds, though they are rarely seen when wild to attack them; also that
many, probably most birds, dislike, if not intensely, at any rate
in comparison with other Butterflies, those of the Danais genus and
three other kinds, including a species of Papilio, which is the most
distasteful.The mimics of these Butterflies are relatively palatable.He found that each bird has to separately acquire its experience with
bad-tasting Butterflies, but well remembers what it learns.He also
experimented with Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the birds, they ate
the nauseous as well as other Butterflies.----

INCREASE IN ZOOLOGICAL PRESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES--The
establishment of the National Zoological Park, Washington, has led
to the formation of many other zoological preserves in the United
States.In the western part of New Hampshire is an area of 26,000
acres, established by the late Austin Corbin, and containing 74 Bison,
200 Moose, 1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different species, and 150 Wild
Boar, all of which are rapidly multiplying.In the Adirondacks, a
preserve of 9,000 acres has been stocked with Elk, Virginia Deer,
Muledeer, Rabbits, and Pheasants.The same animals are preserved by W.
C. Whitney on an estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire Hills, near
Lenox, Mass., where also he keeps Bison and Antelope.Other preserves
are Nehasane Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity Park,
near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve, near Tacoma,
Washington, 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St.Paul, Minn., 400 acres;
and Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.----

ROBINS ABUNDANT--Not for many years have these birds been so numerous
as during 1898.Once, under some wide-spreading willow trees, where the
ground was bare and soft, we counted about forty Red-breasts feeding
together, and on several occasions during the summer we saw so many in
flocks, that we could only guess at the number.When unmolested, few
birds become so tame and none are more interesting.East of the Missouri River the Gray Squirrel is found almost
everywhere, and is perhaps the most common variety.Wherever there is
timber it is almost sure to be met with, and in many localities is very
abundant, especially where it has had an opportunity to breed without
unusual disturbance.Its usual color is pale gray above and white or
yellowish white beneath, but individuals of the species grade from this
color through all the stages to jet black.Gray and black Squirrels
are often found associating together.They are said to be in every
respect alike, in the anatomy of their bodies, habits, and in every
detail excepting the color, and by many sportsmen they are regarded as
distinct species, and that the black form is merely due to melanism,
an anomaly not uncommon among animals.Whether this be the correct
explanation may well be left to further scientific observation.Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels feed in the early morning
just after sunrise and remain during the middle of the day in their
hole or nest.It is in the early morning or the late afternoon, when
they again appear in search of the evening meal, that the wise hunter
lies in wait for them.Then they may be heard and seen playing and
chattering together till twilight.Sitting upright and motionless
on a log the intruder will rarely be discovered by them, but at the
slightest movement they scamper away, hardly to return.This fact is
taken advantage of by the sportsmen, and, says an observer, be he
at all familiar with the runways of the Squirrels at any particular
locality he may sit by the path and bag a goodly number.Gray and Black
Squirrels generally breed twice during the spring and summer, and have
several young at a litter.We have been told that an incident of migration of Squirrels of a very
remarkable kind occurred a good many years ago, caused by lack of mast
and other food, in New York State.When the creatures arrived at the
Niagara river, their apparent destination being Canada, they seemed
to hesitate before attempting to cross the swift running stream.The
current is very rapid, exceeding seven miles an hour.They finally
ventured in the water, however, and with tails spread for sails,
succeeded in making the opposite shore, but more than a mile below the
point of entrance.They are better swimmers than one would fancy them
to be, as they have much strength and endurance.We remember when a
boy seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly throw a tame Squirrel
into deep water for the cruel pleasure of watching it swim ashore.The
"sport" was soon stopped, however, by a passerby, who administered a
rebuke that could hardly be forgotten.Squirrels are frequently domesticated and become as tame as any
household tabby.Unfortunately Dogs and Cats seem to show a relentless
enmity toward them, as they do toward all rodents.The Squirrel is
willing to be friendly, and no doubt would gladly affiliate with
them, but the instinct of the canine and the feline impels them to
exterminate it.We once gave shelter and food to a strange Cat and
was rewarded by seeing it fiercely attack and kill a beautiful white
Rabbit which until then had had the run of the yard and never before
been molested.Until we shall be able to teach the beasts of the field
something of our sentimental humanitarianism we can scarcely expect to
see examples of cruelty wholly disappear.I killed a Robin--the little thing,
    With scarlet breast on a glossy wing,
      That comes in the apple tree to sing.I flung a stone as he twittered there,
      I only meant to give him a scare,
      But off it went--and hit him square.A little flutter--a little cry--
      Then on the ground I saw him lie.I didn't think he was going to die.But as I watched him I soon could see
      He never would sing for you or me
      Any more in the apple tree.Never more in the morning light,
      Never more in the sunshine bright,
      Trilling his song in gay delight.And I'm thinking, every summer day,
      How never, never, I can repay
      The little life that I took away.--SYDNEY DAYRE, in The Youth's Companion.THE PECTORAL SANDPIPER.More than a score of Sandpipers are described in the various works
on ornithology.The one presented here, however, is perhaps the most
curious specimen, distributed throughout North, Central, and South
America, breeding in the Arctic regions.It is also of frequent
occurrence in Europe.Low, wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges
of shallow pools of water are its favorite resorts.The birds move
in flocks, but, while feeding, scatter as they move about, picking
and probing here and there for their food, which consists of worms,
insects, small shell fish, tender rootlets, and birds; "but at the
report of a gun," says Col.Goss, "or any sudden fright, spring into
the air, utter a low whistling note, quickly bunch together, flying
swift and strong, usually in a zigzag manner, and when not much hunted
often circle and drop back within shot; for they are not naturally
a timid or suspicious bird, and when quietly and slowly approached,
sometimes try to hide by squatting close to the ground."Of the Pectoral Sandpiper's nesting habits, little has been known until
recently.Nelson's interesting description, in his report upon
"Natural History Collections in Alaska," we quote as follows: "The
night of May 24, 1889, I lay wrapped in my blanket, and from the raised
flap of the tent looked out over as dreary a cloud-covered landscape as
can be imagined.As my eyelids began to droop and the scene to become
indistinct, suddenly a low, hollow, booming note struck my ear and
sent my thoughts back to a spring morning in northern Illinois, and
to the loud vibrating tones of the Prairie Chickens.[See BIRDS AND
ALL NATURE, Vol.Again the sound arose, nearer and more
distinct, and with an effort I brought myself back to the reality of my
position, and, resting upon one elbow, listened.A few seconds passed,
and again arose the note; a moment later I stood outside the tent.The
open flat extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living
creature near.Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance
revealed its author.Standing in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards
from me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest of
the bird, was a male Pectoral Sandpiper.The succeeding days afforded
opportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes, under
a variety of situations, and at various hours of the day, or during the
light Arctic night.The note is deep, hollow, and resonant, but at the
same time liquid and musical, and may be represented by a repetition of
the syllables _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_."The bird
may frequently be seen running along the ground close to the female,
its enormous sac inflated.Murdock says the birds breed in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,
and that the nest is always built in the grass, with a preference for
high and dry localities.The nest was like that of the other waders, a
depression in the ground, lined with a little dry grass.The eggs are
four, of pale purplish-gray and light neutral tint.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.Why was the sight
    To such a tender ball as th' eye confined,
    So obvious and so easy to be quenched,
    And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused;
    That she might look at will through every pore?--MILTON."But bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited."The reason we know anything at all is that various forms of vibration
are capable of affecting our organs of sense.These agitate the brain,
the mind perceives, and from perception arise the higher forms of
thought.Perhaps the most important of the senses is sight.It ranges
in power from the mere ability to perceive the difference between light
and darkness up to a marvelous means of knowing the nature of objects
of various forms and sizes, at both near and remote range.One the simplest forms of eyes is found in the Sea-anemone.It has a
 mass of pigment cells and refractive bodies that break up the
light which falls upon them, and it is able to know day and night.An examination of this simple organ leads one to think the scientist
not far wrong who claimed that the eye is a development from what was
once merely a particular sore spot that was sensitive to the action
of light.The protophyte, _Euglena varidis_, has what seems to be the
least complicated of all sense organs in the transparent spot in the
front of its body.We know that rays of light have power to alter the color of certain
substances.The retina of the eye is changed in color by exposure to
continued rays of light.Frogs in whose eyes the color of the retina
has apparently been all changed by sunshine are still able to take a
fly accurately and to recognize certain colors.Whether the changes produced by light upon the retina are all chemical
or all physical or partly both remains open to discussion.An interesting experiment was performed by Professor Tyndall proving
that heat rays do not affect the eye opt
