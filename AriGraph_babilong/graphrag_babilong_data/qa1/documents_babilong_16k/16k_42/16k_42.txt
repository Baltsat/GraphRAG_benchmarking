it's the divil's own lape," said an Irishman in the
company, and he crossed himself.The baffled troopers returned crestfallen and cross.Captain Conway was
so out of temper that even when the ladies asked him if his fall hurt
him, he answered angrily."Captain," said Alice, somewhat ruffled by his manner, "what is it
between that boy and you?He said he knew you, was in fact a dear friend
of yours, but you no sooner saw him than you shot at him; and Corporal
Smith says you called him by name, so you did know him.""Alice," replied the captain, "I do not intend to be rude, but I am all
put out.That boy is a spy, a mean, sneaking spy.It was he that discovered our plot at Lexington.""And I told him----" She stopped
suddenly.nothing, nothing; only what a good fellow you were."The captain looked at her sharply, and said: "It is well you gave away
no secrets."Fred made his way back to camp with a thankful heart.He told Colonel
Garrard of the intended attack, and then started back for the
headquarters of General Thomas.It was a long and hard ride, and it was
well in the small hours of the night when he arrived.The general was
aroused and the news of the expected attack told.He quietly wrote a
couple of orders, and went back to his bed.One order was to General
Schoepf to at once march his brigade to the relief of Colonel Garrard at
Rock Castle.The other was sent to Colonel Connell at Big Hill to move
his regiment to Rock Castle, instead of advancing toward London as
ordered.Both orders were obeyed, and both commands were in position on the 20th.General Zollicoffer made his expected attack on the 21st, and was easily
repulsed.The battle was a small one; nothing but a skirmish it would
have been called afterwards; but to the soldiers engaged at that time,
it looked like a big thing.It greatly encouraged the Federal soldiers,
and correspondingly depressed the soldiers of Zollicoffer's army.Fred got back to Rock Castle in time to see the battle.It was his first
sight of dead and wounded soldiers.And as he looked on the faces of the
dead, their sightless eyes upturned to heaven, and the groans of the
wounded sounding in his ears, he turned sick at heart, and wondered why
men created in the image of God would try to kill and maim each other.And yet, a few moments before, he himself was wild with the excitement
of battle, and could scarcely be restrained from rushing into it.The next day the army advanced, and passed the place where Fred met
with his adventure, and he thought he would make another visit to Miss
Alice Johnson.But that young lady gave him a cold reception.She called
him a "miserable, sneaking Yankee," and turned her back on him in
disgust.He didn't hear the last of his call on Miss Johnson.Fred pointed out the place where his horse had leaped the fence, and
officers and men were astonished, and Prince became as much a subject of
praise as his rider.It was a common saying among the soldiers as he
rode by, "There goes the smartest boy and best horse in Kentucky."When Fred returned to Camp Dick Robinson, he found a letter awaiting him
from General Nelson.The general was making a campaign against a portion
of the command of General Humphrey Marshall in the mountains of Eastern
Kentucky, and wrote that if Fred could possibly come to him to do so."Of course; go at once," said General Thomas, when the letter was shown
him."I am sorry to lose you, but I think Zollicoffer will be rather
quiet for a while, and General Nelson has the first claim on you.I
shall always be grateful to you for the service you have rendered me.I
trust that it is but the beginning of still closer relations in the
future."It was fated that General Thomas and Fred were to be much together
before the war closed.CHAPTER X.

IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.To his dismay, Fred noticed that the letter of General Nelson was dated
the 10th of October, and it was now the last of the month.For some
reason the letter had been greatly delayed.It was known that Nelson was already in the mountains of Eastern
Kentucky; therefore no time was to be lost if Fred joined him.Much to
his regret, Fred had to leave Prince behind.Afterwards he blessed his
stars that he did, for if he had taken the horse he would have lost him
forever.Fred traveled to Cincinnati by rail, and then by boat up the Ohio to
Maysville.He found that Nelson had not only been gone from Maysville
for some days, but that there was no direct line of communication with
his army.Nothing daunted, he determined to follow, and procuring a
horse, he started on his journey alone and unattended, and against the
advice of the officer in command at Maysville."Wait," said that officer, "until we send forward a train.It will be
strongly guarded, and you will escape all danger of capture."He believed it to be his duty to join Nelson
as soon as possible.By hard riding, he reached Hazel Green on the
evening of the second day, and without adventure.Here he learned that
Nelson's command had left the place only two days before, and was now
supposed to be at or near Prestonburg, and there were rumors of fighting
at that place.The next morning Fred pressed forward in high spirits, thinking he would
overtake at least the rear of Nelson's army by night.Along in the
afternoon four cavalrymen suddenly confronted him, blocking the road.As they all had on the blue Federal overcoat, Fred had not the remotest
idea but that they belonged to Nelson's army, and riding boldly up to
them asked how far the command was in advance.asked one of the party, who appeared to be the leader."Why, Nelson's command, of course," replied Fred, in surprise.But the
words were hardly out of his mouth before four revolvers were leveled on
him, and he was commanded to surrender.There was no alternative but to
submit as gracefully as possible."Now, boys," said the leader, "we will see what we have captured.It must be borne in mind that Fred was dressed in civilian clothes, and
therefore could not be taken prisoner as a soldier.The soldiers, after going through his pockets, handed the contents to
their leader."Ah," said that personage with a wicked grin, "young man, you may go
along with us to Colonel Williams.For aught I know, these letters may
hang you," and filing off from the Prestonburg road, they took a rough
mountain road for Piketon.Fred afterward found that the four soldiers were a scouting party that
had got in the rear of Nelson's army in the hopes of picking up some
stragglers, their only reward being himself.As was said, the party
consisted of four.The leader, Captain Bascom, was a hooked-nosed,
ferret-eyed man, who frequently took deep draughts from a canteen
containing what was familiarly known as "mountain dew"--whisky distilled
by the rough mountaineers.Being half-drunk all the time added intensity
to a naturally cruel, tyrannical disposition.One of the soldiers named Drake was a burly, red-faced fellow, who
seemed to be a boon companion of the captain; at least one took a drink
as often as the other.Another of the soldiers answered to the name of
Lyle; he was a gloomy, taciturn man, and said little.The remaining one
of Fred's captors was a mere boy, not older than himself.He was a
bright-eyed, intelligent looking fellow, tough and muscular, and from
his conversation vastly above the station in life of his comrades before
he enlisted.It was not long before Fred discovered that Captain Bascom
took delight in worrying the boy, whose name was Robert Ferror.In this
he was followed to a greater or less extent by Drake.Not only this,
but when they stopped for the night at the rude home of a mountaineer,
Fred noticed that Bob, as all called him, was the drudge of the party.He not only had to care for the captain's horse, but to perform menial
service, even to cleaning the mud from the captain's boots.As he was
doing this, Bob caught Fred looking at him, and coloring to the roots of
his hair, he trembled violently.It was evident that he felt himself
degraded by his work, but seeing a look of pity in Fred's eyes, he
fiercely whispered, "My mother's <DW65>s used to do this for me," and
then he cast such a look of hate on Captain Bascom that Fred shuddered.It was not until the evening of the second day of his capture that
Piketon was reached.Along in the afternoon, away to the left, firing
was heard, and every now and then, the deep boom of cannon reverberated
through the valleys and gorges.It made
Fred sick at heart to think that his friends were so near, and yet so
far.The knowledge that the Confederates were being driven seemed to anger
Bascom, and he drank oftener than usual.Noticing that Bob was talking
to Fred as they were riding along, he turned back and struck the boy
such a cruel blow in the face that he was knocked from his horse.By order of Bascom, Drake and Lyle dismounted, picked Bob up, wiped the
blood from his face, and after forcing some whisky down his throat,
placed him on his horse.At first he seemed dazed and could not guide
his horse.He gradually came to himself, and when he looked at Bascom
Fred saw that same murderous look come over his face which he had
noticed once before."Bascom has cause to fear that boy," thought Fred.When the party rode into Piketon they found everything in the utmost
confusion.Preparations were being made to evacuate the place.The
soldiers who had been in the fight came streaming back, bringing with
them their wounded and a few prisoners.They reported thousands and
thousands of Yankees coming.This added to the confusion and the
demoralization of the troops.The prisoners were thrown, for the night, in a building used as a jail.It was of hewn logs, without windows or doors, being entered through the
roof, access being had to the roof by an outside stairway, then by a
ladder down in the inside.When all were down, the ladder was drawn up,
and the opening in the roof closed.The place was indescribably filthy,
and Fred always wondered how he lived through the night.When morning
came and the ladder was put down for them to ascend, each and every one
thanked the Lord the rebels were to retreat, and that their stay in the
noisome hole was thus ended.With gratitude they drank in mouthfuls of
the fresh air.The whole place was in a frenzy of excitement.Commissary stores they
were not able to carry away were given to the flames.Every moment the
advance of Nelson's army was expected.But as time passed, and no army
appeared the panic somewhat subsided and something like order was
restored.That night, the retreating army camped in a pine forest at the base of a
mountain.Black clouds swept across the
sky, the wind howled mournfully through the forest, and the cold
pitiless rain chilled to the bone.Huge fires were kindled, and around
them the men gathered to dry their streaming clothes and to warm their
benumbed limbs.Just before the prisoners were made to lie down to sleep, the boy,
Robert Ferror, passed by Fred, and said in a low whisper:

"I will be on guard to-night.Was Robert Ferror going to aid him to escape?He
watched where the guard over the prisoners was stationed, and lay down
as close to him as possible.Soon he was apparently fast asleep, but he
was never wider awake.At eleven o'clock Robert Ferror came on guard.He
looked eagerly around, and Fred, to show him where he was slightly
raised his head.The boy smiled, and placed his finger on his lips.Slowly Ferror paced his beat, to and fro.Ferror's answer
was, "All is well."Another half-hour passed; still he paced to and
fro.After all, was Ferror to do nothing, or were his
words a hoax to raise false hopes?The camp had sunk to rest; the fires
were burning low.Then as Ferror passed Fred, he slightly touched him
with his foot.The next time Ferror passed
he stooped as if he had dropped something, and as he was fumbling on the
ground, whispered:

"Crawl back like a snake.About fifty yards to the rear is a large pine
tree.It is out of the range of the light of the fires.It would have taken a lynx's eye to
have noticed that one of the prisoners was missing, so silently had Fred
made his way back.One o'clock came, and Ferror was relieved.Five, ten, fifteen minutes
passed, and still Fred was waiting."I will wait a little longer," thought Fred, "and then if he does not
come, I will go by myself."Soon a light footstep was heard, and Fred whispered, "Here."A hand was stretched out, and Fred took it.It was as cold as death, and
shook like one with the palsy."He is quaking with fear," thought Fred."Have you got the revolver and cartridge belt?"asked Ferror, in a
hoarse whisper.He still seemed to be quaking as with ague.Silently Ferror led the way, Fred following.Slowly feeling their way
through the darkness, they had gone some distance when they were
suddenly commanded to halt.Ferror gave a start of surprise,
and then answered:

"A friend with the countersign.""Advance, friend, and give the countersign."Ferror boldly advanced, leaned forward as if to whisper the word in the
ear of the guard.Then there was a flash, a loud report, and with a moan
the soldier sank to the ground."Come," shrieked Ferror, and Fred, horrified, sprang forward.Through
the woods, falling over rocks, running against trees, they dashed, until
at last they had to stop from sheer exhaustion.Men
were heard crashing through the forest, escaping as they thought from an
unseen foe.But when no attack came, and no other shot was heard, the
confusion and excitement began to abate, and every one was asking, "What
is it?""The sound of the shot came from that direction," said the soldier who
had taken the place of Ferror as guard."There is where I stationed Drake," said the officer of the guard."I
discovered a path leading up the mountain, and I concluded to post a
sentinel on it.Sergeant, make a detail, and come with me."The detail was made, and they filed out in the darkness in the direction
that Drake was stationed."We must have gone far enough," said the officer."It was about here I
stationed him."It is not possible he has deserted, is
it?"He was groping around when he stumbled over something on the ground.He
reached out his hand, and touched the lifeless body of Drake.A cry of
horror burst from him.The body was taken up and carried back to camp.The officer bent over and examined it by the firelight."Shot through the heart," he muttered; "and, by heavens!Drake was shot not by some prowler, but by some one
inside the lines.The prisoners, who had all been aroused by the commotion, were huddled
together, quaking with fear.The sergeant soon reported: "Lieutenant, there is one missing; the boy
in citizen's clothes."Colonel Williams, who had been looking on with stern countenance, now
asked:

"Who was guarding the prisoners?"The colonel's tones were low and
ominous."Scott, sir," replied the sergeant of the guard."Colonel," said Scott, shaking so he could hardly talk, "before God, I
know nothing about the escape of the prisoner.I had not been on guard
more than ten or fifteen minutes before the shot was fired.Up to that
time, not a prisoner had stirred."I do not know whether he escaped before I came
on guard or after the alarm.The sergeant will bear me witness that
during the alarm I stayed at my post and kept the prisoners from
escaping.The boy might have slipped away in the confusion, but I do not
think he did."The sergeant soon returned with the information that Ferror could not be
found.He cast his eye over the group of officers
standing around him, and then suddenly asked: "Where is Captain Bascom?"The officers looked blank, then inquiringly into each other's faces.No
one had seen him during or since the alarm.The sergeant of the guard hurriedly went to a rude tent where the
captain slept.Pulling aside a blanket which served as a door he entered
the tent.A moment, and he reappeared with face as white as a sheet.his ashen lips shaped the words, but they died away in a
gurgle in his throat.Captain Bascom had been stabbed through the heart.The whole turmoil in camp was heard by Fred and Robert Ferror, as they
stood panting for breath.Fred shuddered as the horrified cry of the
officer of the day was borne to his ears when he stumbled on the dead
body of the guard.The boys were bruised and bleeding, and their
clothing was torn in shreds from their flight through the forest."It is all right now," said Ferror."They can never find us in the
darkness, but some of the frightened fools may come as far as this; so
we had better be moving."The boys slowly and painfully worked their way up the mountain, and at
last the roar of the camp was no longer heard.They came to a place
where the jutting rocks formed a sort of a cave, keeping out the rain,
and the ground and leaves were comparatively dry.The place was also
sheltered from the wind."Let us stay here," said Fred, "until it gets a little light.We can
then more easily make our way.We are entirely out of danger for
to-night."To this Ferror assented, and the two boys crept as far back as they
could and snuggled down close together.Fred noticed that Ferror still
trembled, and that his hands were still as cold as ice.The storm had ceased, but the wind sobbed and moaned through the trees
like a thing of life, sighing one moment like a person in anguish, and
then wailing like a lost soul.An owl near by added its solemn hootings
to the already dismal night.Fred felt Ferror shudder and try to creep
still closer to him.Both boys remained silent for a long time, but at
length Fred said:

"Ferror, shooting that sentinel was awful.I had almost rather have
remained a prisoner."I did not know the sentinel was there," answered Ferror, "or I could
have avoided him.As it was, it had to be done.It was a case of life or
death.Fred, do you know who the sentinel was?""It was Drake; I saw his face by the flash of my pistol, just for a
second, but it was enough.I can see it now," and he shuddered."No, Ferror; if I had been in your place, I might have done the same,
but that would have made it none the less horrible.""Fred, you will despise me; but I must tell you.""Drake is not the first man I have killed to-night."Fred sprang up and involuntarily drew away from him."After I was relieved from guard, and before I joined you, I stabbed
Captain Bascom through the heart."A low cry of horror escaped Fred's lips."Listen to my story, Fred, and then despise me as a murderer if you
will.My mother is a widow, residing in Tazewell county, Virginia.I am
an only son, but I have two lovely sisters.I was always headstrong,
liking my own way.John went to the office.Of course, I was humored and petted.When the war
broke out I was determined to enlist.My mother and sisters wept and
prayed, and at last I promised to wait.But about two months ago I was
down at Abingdon, and was asked to take a glass of wine.I think it was
drugged, for when I came to myself I found that I was an enlisted
soldier.Worse than all, I found that this man Bascom was an officer in
the company to which I belonged.Bascom is a low-lived, drunken brute.Mother had him arrested for theft
and sent to jail.When he got out, he left the neighborhood, but swore
he would have revenge on every one of the name.I think he was in hopes that by brutal treatment he could make me
desert, so he could have me shot if captured.When he struck me the
other day, when I spoke to you, I resolved then and there to kill him.""I know," replied Fred, in a low tone."God only knows what I have suffered from the hands of that man during
the last two months.I have had provocation enough to kill him a
thousand times.""I know, I know," replied Fred; "but to kill him in his sleep.I would
not have blamed you if you had shot him down when he gave you that blow."It would have been best," sobbed Ferror, for the first time giving way
to his feelings."Oh, mother, what will you think of your boy!"Then he
said, chokingly: "Fred, don't desert me, don't despise me; I can't bear
it.I believe if you turn from me now, I shall become one of the most
desperate of criminals.""No, Ferror," said Fred; "I will neither desert nor judge you.You have
done something I had rather lose my life than do.But for the present
our fortunes are linked together.If we are captured, both will suffer
an ignominious death.Therefore, much as I abhor your act, I cannot
divorce myself from the consequences.Then let us resolve, come what
may, we will never be taken alive."Ferror grasped Fred's hand, and pressing it fervently, replied: "If we
are captured, it will only be my dead body which will be taken, even if
I have to send a bullet through my own heart."After this the boys said little, and silently waited for the light.With the first gleam of the morning, they started on their way, thinking
only of getting as far as possible from the scene of that night of
horror.As the sun arose, the mountains and then the valleys were flooded with
its golden light.At any other time the glorious landscape spread out
before them would have filled Fred's soul with delight; but as it was,
he only eagerly scanned the road which ran through the valley, hoping to
catch sight of Nelson's advancing columns."They will surely come before long," said Fred."By ten o'clock we
should be inside of the Federal lines and safe."But if Fred had heard what was passing in the Rebel camp he would not
have been so sanguine.Lieutenant Davis, officer of the guard, and Colonel Williams were in
close consultation."Colonel," said the lieutenant, "I do not believe the Yankees are
pursuing us.Those boys will take it for granted that we will continue
our retreat, and will soon come down off the mountains into the road.Let me take a couple of companies of cavalry, and I will station men in
ambush along the road as far back as it is safe to go.In this way I
believe we stand a chance to catch them."The colonel consented, and, therefore, before the sun had lighted up the
valley, pickets had been placed along the road for several miles back.The boys trailed along the mountain side until nearly noon, but the
sides of the mountain were so seamed and gashed they made slow progress.Gaining a high point, they looked towards Piketon, and in the far
distance saw an advancing column of cavalry."There is nothing to be seen to the south," said Fred."I think we can
descend to the road in safety."So they cautiously made their way down
to the road."Let us look well to our arms," said Fred."We must be prepared for any
emergency."So their revolvers were carefully examined, fresh caps put in, and every
precaution taken.They came out on the road close to a little valley
farm.In front of the cabin stood a couple of horses hitched.After
carefully looking at the horses, Ferror said: "Fred, one of those horses
belongs to Lieutenant Davis.He has ridden back to see if he could not
catch sight of us.Nelson's men will soon send him back flying."Then a wild idea took possession of the boys.It was no less than to try
and get possession of the horses.Wouldn't it be grand to enter the
Federal lines in triumph, riding the horses of their would-be captors!Without stopping to think of the danger, they at once acted on the idea.From the cabin came sounds of laughter mingled with the music of women's
voices.Getting near the horses, the boys made a dash, were on their backs in a
twinkling, and with a yell of triumph were away.The astonished
officers rushed to the door, only to see them disappear down the road.Then they raged like madmen, cursing their fortunes, and calling down
all sorts of anathemas on the boys."Never mind," at last said Sergeant Jones, who was the lieutenant's
companion in misfortune, "the squad down the road will catch them.""Poor consolation for the disgrace of having our horses stolen," snapped
the lieutenant.The elation of the boys came to a sudden ending.In the road ahead of
them stood a squad of four horsemen.Involuntarily the boys checked the
speed of their horses.They looked into each other's faces, they read
each other's thoughts."It can only be death," said Fred."It can only be death," echoed Ferror, "and I welcome it.I know, Fred,
you look on me as a murderer.I want to show you how I can die in a fair
fight."Fred hardly realized what Ferror was saying; he was debating a plan of
attack."Ferror," he said, "let us ride leisurely forward until we get within
about fifty yards of them.No doubt they know the horses, and will be
nonplused as to who we are.It will be
all over in a moment--safety or death."He was as pale as his victims of the night before, but
his eyes blazed, his teeth were set hard, every muscle was strained.Just as Fred turned to say, "Now!"Ferror shouted, "Good-bye, Fred,"
and dashed straight for the horsemen.The movement was so sudden it left
Fred slightly behind.The revolvers of the four Confederates blazed, but
like a thunderbolt Ferror was on them.The first man and horse went down
like a tenpin before the ball of the bowler; the second, and boy and man
and both horses went down in an indistinguishable mass together.As for Fred, not for a second did he lose command of himself or his
horse.He saw what was coming, and swerved to the right.Here a single
Confederate confronted him.This man's attention had been attracted for
a moment to the fate of his comrades in the road, and before he knew it
Fred was on him.He raised his smoking revolver to fire, but Fred's
revolver spoke first, and the soldier reeled and fell from his saddle.The road was now open for Fred to escape, but he wheeled his horse and
rode back to see what had become of his comrade.One Confederate still
sat on his horse unhurt.Seeing Fred, he raised his pistol and fired.Fred felt his left arm grow numb, and then a sensation like that of hot
water running down the limb.Before the soldier could fire the second
time, a ball from Fred's pistol crashed through his brain, and he fell,
an inert mass, in the road.Of the two Confederates overthrown in the wild charge of Ferror, one was
dead, the other was untouched by bullets, but lay groaning with a
broken leg and arm.He lay partly
under his horse, his eyes closed, his bosom stained with blood.[Illustration: Fred raised his Head, "Ferror!"It's all right, Fred--all right,"
he gasped."That was no murder--that was a fair fight, wasn't it?""It is better as it is, Fred.He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again it was with a far-away
look."Yes, mother," he whispered, and then
his eyes closed forever.The clatter of horses' hoofs, and the clang of sabers were now heard.Fred looked up; a party of Federal cavalry was bearing down upon him.They looked on the bloody scene in astonishment.A dashing young captain
rode up.Fred pointed to young Ferror's lifeless body, and said: "Bring
his body back to Piketon with you.I am one of
General Nelson's scouts."Then everything grew black before him, and he knew no more.He had
fainted from the loss of blood.The rough troopers bound up his arm, staunched the flow of blood, and
soon Fred was able to ride to Piketon.General Nelson received him with
astonishment; yet he would not let him talk, but at once ordered him to
the hospital.As for Robert Ferror, he was given a soldier's burial.A year after the war closed, Frederic Shackelford, a stalwart young man,
sought out the home of Mrs.He found a gray-haired,
brokenhearted mother and two lovely young ladies, her daughters.They
had mourned the son and brother, not only as dead, but as forever
disgraced, for they had been told that Robert had been shot for
desertion.Fred gave them the little mementoes he had kept through the years for
them.He told them how Robert had given his life to try and save him,
and that the last word that trembled on his lips was "Mother."The gray-haired mother lifted her trembling hands, and thanked God that
her son had at least died the death of a soldier.Learning that the family had been impoverished by the war, when Fred
left, he slipped $1,000 in Mrs.Ferror's hand, and whispered, "For
Robert's sake;" and the stricken mother, through tear-dimmed eyes,
watched his retreating form, and murmured: "And Robert would have been
just such a man if he had lived."CRAZY BILL SHERMAN.The ball had gone through the
fleshy part of the arm, causing a great loss of blood; but no bones were
broken, and it was only a question of a few weeks before he would be as
well as ever.The story of the two boys charging four Confederate cavalrymen, killing
three, and disabling the fourth was the wonder of the army.But Fred
modestly disclaimed any particular bravery in the affair."It is to poor Bob Ferror that the honor should be given," he would say;
"the boy that knowingly rode to his death that I might be saved."Fred gave General Nelson the particulars of his capture and escape, and
the general looked grave and said:

"If I had known I was going to place you in such extreme danger, I
should not have sent for you.On account of the crime of young Ferror,
you would have met with a most ignominious death if you had been
recaptured; yet the charging on those four cavalrymen was one of the
pluckiest things I have heard of during the war.You deserve and shall
have a good rest.I have just finished making up some dispatches for
General Sherman, and you shall be my messenger.A dispatch boat leaves
in the morning, and you shall go with it.When you get to Catlettsburg,
you can take an Ohio river steamer for Louisville.The trip being all by
water, will be an easy one, and as a number of sick and wounded will be
sent away on the same boat, you will have good surgical attendance for
your wounded arm.Here is a paper that will admit you to the officers'
hospital when you get to Louisville.I do
not think it will be long before I, with my command, will be ordered
back to Louisville.The enemy has retreated through Pound Gap into
Virginia, and there is nothing more for me to do here.Stay in
Louisville until you hear from me."The next morning found Fred on his way down the Big Sandy.The whole
voyage was uneventful, and after a quick trip Fred once more found
himself in Louisville.The rest and quiet of the voyage had almost cured
the ill-effects of his experience, and with the exception of his wounded
arm, which he was compelled to carry in a sling, he was feeling about as
well as ever.Once in Louisville, he lost no time in turning over his dispatches to
General Sherman.He found the general surrounded by a delegation of the
prominent Union men of the city.They seemed to be arguing with Sherman
about something, and as for the general, he was in a towering rage, and
was swearing in a manner equal to General Nelson in one of his outbreaks
of anger.Fred was surprised to find the usually mild and gentlemanly officer in
such a passion, but there was no mistake, he was angry clear through."There is no use talking, gentlemen," he was saying, as he paced the
room with quick nervous tread, "I am not only going to resign, but I
have already sent in my resignation.I will not remain in command of the
Department of Kentucky another day; the command of the armies of the
United States would not induce me to remain and be insulted and outraged
as I have been.""We are very sorry to hear it, General," replied the spokesman of the
delegation."We had great hopes of what you would accomplish when you
were appointed to the command of the department, and our confidence in
you is still unabated.""I am thankful," replied the general, "for that confidence, but what can
you expect of a man bound hand and foot.They seem to know a great deal
better in Washington what we need here than we do who are on the ground.This, in a measure, is to be expected; but to be reviled and insulted is
more than I can stand.But if I had not resigned, I should be removed, I
know that.Just let the newspapers begin howling at a general, and
denouncing him, and every official at Washington begins shaking in his
boots.What can be expected of a general with every newspaper in the
land yelping at his heels like a pack of curs?If I wanted to end this
war quickly, I would begin by hanging every editor who would publish a
word on how the war should be conducted."Are you not a little too severe on the newspaper fraternity, General?"mildly put in one of the citizen delegates.They think
they know more about war, and how to conduct campaigns than all the
military men of the country combined.Not satisfied with telling me how
and when to conduct a campaign, they attack me most unjustly and
cruelly, attack me in such a manner I cannot reply.Just listen to
this," and the general turned and took up a scrapbook in which numerous
newspaper clippings had been pasted."Here is an editorial from that
esteemed and influential paper, _The Cincinnati Commerce_," and the
general read:

"'It is a lamentable fact that many of our generals are grossly
incompetent, but when incipient insanity is added to incompetency, it is
time to cry a halt.Right here at home, the general who commands the
Department of Kentucky and therefore has the safety of our city in his
hands, is W. T. Sherman.We have it on the most reliable evidence that
he is of unsound mind.Not only do many of his sayings excite the pity
of his friends and ridicule of his enemies, but they are positively
dangerous to the success of our cause.The Government should at least
put the department in charge of a general of sound mind.'"Now, if that is not enough," continued the general, with a touch of
irony in his tones, "I will give you a choice clipping from the great
_New York Tricate_."'It is with sorrow that we learn that General W. T. Sherman, who is in
command of the Department of Kentucky, is not in his right mind.It is
said that the authorities at Washington have been aware of this for some
time, but for political reasons fear to remove him.He is a brother of
John Sherman, one of the influential politicians of Ohio, and United
States Senator-elect.While the affair is to be regretted, the
Government should not hesitate on account of political influence.That he is mentally unsound
is admitted, even by his best friends.The whole company was smiling at the absurdity of the affair."I will read once more," said the general."It is from the _Chicago
Timer_, and hits others as well as myself.Here it is:

"'General Bill Sherman, in command of the Department of Kentucky, is
said to be insane.In our mind the whole Lincoln
Government, from President down, is insane--insane over the idea that
they can coerce the South back into the Union.The only difference that
we can see is that Bill Sherman may be a little crazier than the rest;
that's all.'"There," continued the general, "are only a few of the scores of
extracts which I have from the most influential papers in the land.Of
course the smaller papers have taken their cue from the larger ones, and
now the whole pack of little whiffets are after me, snapping at my
heels; and the good people believe the story because it is published.Hundreds of letters are being received at Washington, asking for my
removal.My brother writes that he is overwhelmed with inquiries
concerning me.I believe the War Department more than half believes I am
of unsound mind.They are only waiting for an excuse to get rid of me,
and I know that my resignation will be received with joy.""General," asked one of the citizens present, "have you any idea of how
the story of your insanity started?""When Secretary of War Cameron was here,
I laid before him the wants of Kentucky, and among other things said
that I needed 60,000 men for defensive work, but for offensive
operations I should need 200,000.The Secretary spoke of it as an
'insane request.'Some reporter got hold of it, and then it went.The
Secretary has never taken the pains to correct the impressions.""Were you not a little extravagant in your demands?"The politicians at Washington have never yet recognized
the magnitude of the war in which we are engaged.Then their whole life
is office, and they are afraid of doing something that will lose them a
vote.As for the newspapers, they would rather print a sensation than
have us win a victory.They have called me crazy so much they
have alarmed my wife," and the general again indulged in another burst
of anger.When he became calmer, he said: "Gentlemen, I thank you for
your expressions of sympathy and confidence.I trust my successor will
be more worthy than I," and he bowed the delegation out.The general noticed him, and asked: "Well, my
boy, what is it?Why, bless my soul, it's Fred Shackelford!"Yes, General, with dispatches," and he handed them to him."I will read them when I cool off a little; I have been rather warm.I
see your arm is in a sling; been in a skirmish?"The wound didn't amount to much; it is
nearly well.""You should be thankful it is no worse.Come in in the morning, Fred; I
will have the dispatches read by that time."Fred called, as requested, the next morning, and found the general calm
and courteous as ever."General Nelson writes good news," said Sherman."He reports he has
entirely driven the Rebels out of the valley of the Big Sandy.He also
tells me in a private letter of your capture and escape.He speaks of
the desperate conflict that you and your comrade had with four Rebel
cavalrymen.My boy, I shall keep my
eye on you.I surely should ask for your services myself if I were going
to remain in command of the department.""General, I am sorry to have you resign," answered Fred, hardly knowing
what to say.The general's face darkened, and then he answered lightly: "I do not
think they will be sorry at Washington."And they were not; his resignation was gladly accepted, and the general
who afterward led his victorious army to Atlanta, and then made his
famous march to the sea, and whose fame filled the world, retired under
a cloud.And the injustice of it rankled in his breast and imbittered
his heart for months.The general appointed to succeed Sherman was Don Carlos Buell, a
thorough soldier, and, like McClellan, a splendid organizer; but, like
that general, he was unsuccessful in the field, and during what is known
as the "Bragg-Buell campaign" in Kentucky in the fall of 1862, he
entirely lost the confidence of his soldiers.Buell's first attention was given to the organization of his army and
the drilling of his soldiers.His labors in this direction were very
successful, and the "Army of the Cumberland" became famous for its
_esprit de corps_.General Nelson, according to his predictions, was ordered back with his
command to Louisville.Fred, now entirely well, was greatly rejoiced to
once more see his old commander.But there was little prospect of active
service, for the division was ordered into camp for the purpose of
drilling and being perfected in military duties.Idleness was irksome to
Fred, so he asked and obtained permission to join General Thomas, and
remain until such time as Nelson might need his services.General Thomas gave Fred a most cordial reception.There was something
about the handsome, dashing boy that greatly endeared him to the staid,
quiet general.Just now, Fred's presence was very desirable, for
Zollicoffer was proving very troublesome, threatening first one point
and then another, and it was almost impossible to tell which place was
in the most danger.General Thomas' forces were greatly scattered,
guarding different points, and he feared that at some of these places
his troops might be attacked and overpowered.He had asked permission of
Buell time and again to be allowed to concentrate his forces and strike
Zollicoffer a telling blow, but each and every time had met with a
refusal.Instead of being allowed to concentrate his force, he was
ordered to move portions of his command here and there, and the orders
of one day might be countermanded the next.Being December, the roads
were in a horrible condition, and it was almost impossible to move
trains, so that his army was being reduced by hard service which did no
good.He would sit for
hours buried in thought or poring over maps.All this time, Zollicoffer was ravaging the middle southern counties of
Kentucky, threatening first London, then Somerset, then Columbia, then
some intermediate point.The outposts of the army were often attacked,
and frequent skirmishes took place.In the midst of this activity, Fred
found congenial employment.He was kept busy carrying dispatches from
one post to another, or on scouting expeditions, trying to gain
information of the movements of the enemy.He frequently met squads of
the enemy, and had many narrow escapes from capture; but the fleetness
of his horse always saved him.Of all General Thomas' scouts, Fred obtained the most valuable
information.While not venturing into the enemy's lines, he had a way of
getting information out of the inhabitants friendly to the South that
surprised even the general.Fred hardly ever made a mistake as to the
movements of the opposing army.If there was one thing that he loved more than another it was his horse.He had trained him to do anything that a horse could do.At a word he
would lie down and remain as motionless as if dead.He would go anywhere
he was told without hesitating, and his keen ear would detect the
presence of an enemy quicker than the ear of his master.Fred had also
perfected himself in the use of a revolver until he was one of the best
shots in the army.He could ride by a tree at full gallop, and put three
balls in a three-inch circle without checking his speed."My life," he would say, "may depend on my being able to shoot quickly
and accurately."On some of his scouts Fred would take a party with him, and there was
not a soldier who did not consider it one of the greatest honors to be
thus chosen.One day near the close of the year Fred was scouting with a picked
force of five men a few miles to the east and south of Somerset.As they
were riding through a piece of wood, Prince suddenly stopped, pricked up
his ears, listened a moment, and then turned and looked at his master,
as if to say, "Danger ahead!""To cover, boys," said Fred, in a low tone.The party turned aside into the wood, and was soon completely hidden
from view."Steady now," said Fred; "no noise.""Are you sure your horse is as wise as you think?""Perfectly sure; Prince never makes a mistake.The trampling of horses, and the jingling of sabers could plainly be
heard, and soon a party of nine Confederate cavalrymen came riding by.They had no thought of danger, and were laughing and talking, thinking
not that death lurked so near them."The old traitor lives right ahead," they heard one say."We will learn him to harbor East Tennessee bridge-burners," said the
leader with a coarse laugh."Will it be hanging or shooting, Sergeant?"It's such fun to see a Lincolnite hanging by the neck
and dancing on air.Never shoot a man if you can hang him, is my motto."Fred's men heard this conversation with lowering brows, and the
muttered curses were deep if not loud, and five carbines were raised,
but with a gesture Fred motioned them down.His men looked at him in
astonishment, and there was disappointment on every face.As soon as the Confederates were out of hearing, so it was safe to
speak, one of the men said with a sigh:

"Capt'in,"--the soldiers always called Fred captain when they were out
with him--"I would hev give five dollars for a shot.I would hev fetched
that feller that loved to see hangin', sure.""I have strict orders," replied Fred, "to avoid fighting when I am out
on these scouting expeditions.It is the part of a good scout never to
get into a fight except to avoid capture.A scout is sent out to get
information, not to fight; a conflict defeats the very object he has in
view.""That's so, capt'in, but it goes agin the grain to let them fellers
off.""I may have made a mistake," replied Fred, "in letting those fellows
off.Come to think about it, I do not like what they said."Worse than that, capt'in.""We will follow them up," said Fred, "as far as we can unobserved.You
remember we passed a pretty farmhouse some half a mile back; that may be
the place they were talking about.We can ride within three hundred
yards of it under cover of the forest."Riding carefully through the wood, they soon came in sight of the
place.Surely enough, the Confederates had stopped in front of the
house.Four of them were holding the horses, while the other five were
not to be seen.As they sat looking the muffled sound of two shots were
heard, and then the shrieking of women."Boys," said Fred, in a strained voice, "I made a mistake in not letting
you shoot.There are
nine of them; we are six.shouted every one, their eyes blazing with excitement."Then for God's sake, forward, or we will be too late!"for the frenzied
shrieks of women could still be heard.They no sooner broke cover, than the men holding the horses discovered
them, and gave the alarm.The five miscreants who were in the house came
rushing out, and all hastily mounting their horses, rode swiftly away.The Federals, with yells of vengeance, followed in swift pursuit; yet in
all probability the Confederates would have escaped if it had not been
for the fleetness of Prince.Fred soon distanced all of his companions,
and so was comparatively alone and close on the heels of the enemy.They noticed this, and conceived the idea that they could kill or
capture him.Fred was watching for this very
thing, and as they stopped he fired, just as the leader's horse was
broadside to him.Then at the word, Prince turned as quick as a flash,
and was running back.The movement was so unexpected to the Confederates
that the volley they fired went wild.As for the horse of the Confederate leader, it reared and plunged, and
then fell heavily, pinning its rider to the ground.Two of his men
dismounted to help him.When he got to his feet, he saw that Fred's
companions had joined him and that they all were coming on a charge.John journeyed to the bedroom.Now, boys, stand firm; there are only six of them.But it takes men of iron nerve to stand still and receive a charge, and
the Federals were coming like a whirlwind.The Confederates emptied their revolvers at close range, and then half
of them turned to flee.It was too late; the Federals were among them,
shooting, sabering, riding them down.When it was over, eight Confederates lay dead or desperately wounded.Of
the six Federals, two were dead and two were wounded.Only one
Confederate had escaped to carry back the story of the disaster.[Illustration: The Federals were among them, shooting, sabering, riding
them down.]One of the wounded Confederates lay groaning and crying with pain, and
Fred going up to him, asked if he could do anything for him.The man looked up, and then a scowl of hate came over his face.he groaned, and then with an oath said: "I will have
you if I die for it," and attempted to raise his revolver, which he
still clutched.As quick as a flash Fred knocked it out of his hand, and as quick one of
Fred's men had a revolver at the breast of the desperate Confederate.Fred knocked the weapon up, and the shot passed harmlessly over the head
of the wounded man."None of that, Williams," said Fred."We cannot afford to kill wounded
men in cold blood.""But the wretch would have murdered you, capt'in," said Williams, and
then a cry went up from all the men.Fred looked at the man closely, and then said: "You are Bill Pearson,
the man I struck with my riding-whip at Gallatin.""You miserable wretch," said Fred, contemptuously."By good rights I
ought to blow your brains out, but your carcass is not worth the powder.Just then Fred noticed a countryman who had been attracted by the sound
of the firing, and motioned to him to approach.He came up trembling,
and looked with wonder on the dead men and horses."My good man," said Fred, "here are some wounded men that should be
looked after.Can you not do it, or get word to their command?""I reckon I kin," slowly replied the countryman."Yes," replied Fred; "and this reminds me, boys, we had better get away
from here.We do not know how many of the enemy may be near."The wounds of the two Federals who had been hurt were bound up, and they
were helped on their horses.The bodies of the two dead were then
tenderly placed on two of the Confederate horses which were unhurt, and
the mournful cavalcade slowly moved away.Going back to the house which the Confederates had entered, a
distressing sight met their view.On a bed, the master of the house lay dead, shot to death by the
murderers.By the bedside stood the wife and two daughters, weeping and
wringing their hands.The face of the widow was covered with blood, and
there was a deep gash on her head where one of the wretches had struck
her with the butt of his revolver, as she clung to him imploring him not
to murder her husband.The pitiful sight drove Fred's men wild, and he had all that he could do
to prevent them from going back and finishing the wounded murderers."You did wrong, capt'in, in not letting me finish that red-handed
villain who tried to shoot you," said Williams.With broken sobs the woman told her story.Her husband had a brother in
East Tennessee, who had been accused by the Confederate authorities of
helping burn railroad bridges.He escaped with a number of Union men,
and was now a captain in one of the Tennessee regiments."They came here," said the woman, "and found my husband sick in bed, so
sick he could not raise a finger to help himself.They accused him of
harboring his brother, and of furnishing information, and said that they
had come to hang him, but as he was sick they would shoot him.And
then," sobbed the woman, "notwithstanding our prayers, they shot him
before our eyes.and the stricken wife broke
completely down, and the daughters hung over the body of their murdered
father, weeping as if their hearts would break.He told the sobbing women that he would at once
report the case, and have her husband's brother come out with his
company."We will also," said Fred, "leave the bodies of our two dead
comrades here.If you wish, I will send a chaplain, that all may have
Christian burial.And, my poor woman, your wrongs have been fearfully
avenged.Of the nine men in the party that murdered your husband, but
one escaped.said the women, raising their streaming eyes to
heaven.Even the presence of death did not take away their desire for
revenge.Such is poor human nature, even in gentle woman."War makes demons of us all," thought Fred.The story of that fight was long a theme around the camp fire, and the
three soldiers who survived never tired of telling it.As for Fred, he
spoke of it with reluctance, and could not think of it without a
shudder.Fifteen men never engaged in a bloodier conflict, even on the
"dark and bloody ground" of Kentucky.THE MEETING OF THE COUSINS.General Thomas sat in his headquarters at Lebanon looking over some
dispatches which Fred had just brought from General Schoepf at Somerset.His face wore a look of anxiety as he read, for the dispatches told him
that General Zollicoffer had crossed to the north side of the Cumberland
river and was fortifying his camp at Beech Grove."I may be attacked at any moment," wrote General Schoepf, "and you know
how small my force is.For the love of heaven, send me reinforcements."The general sat with his head bowed in his hands thinking of what could
be done, when an orderly entered with dispatches from Louisville.Thomas
opened them languidly, for he expected nothing but the old story of
keeping still and doing nothing.Suddenly his face lighted up; his whole
countenance beamed with satisfaction, and turning to Fred he said:

"My boy, here is news for us, indeed.General Buell has at last
consented to advance.He has given orders for me to concentrate my army
and attack Zollicoffer at the earliest possible moment.""General," he exclaimed, "I already see Zollicoffer defeated, and hurled
back across the Cumberland.""Don't be too sanguine, Fred," he said; "none of
us know what the fortune of war may be; we can only hope for the best.But this means more work for you, my boy.You will at once have to
return with dispatches to General Schoepf.Somerset must be held at all hazards.""I am ready to start this minute with such tidings," gayly responded
Fred."Prince, poor fellow, will have it the hardest, for the roads are
awful.""That is what I am afraid of," replied the general."I hope to be with
Schoepf within a week, but, owing to the condition of the roads, it may
take me much longer."Within an hour Fred was on his way back to Somerset.It was a terrible
journey over almost impassable roads; streams, icy cold, had to be
forded; but boy and horse were equal to the occasion, and in three days
reached Somerset.He
commenced his march from Lebanon on December 31st; it was January 18th
before he reached his destination.The
rain poured in torrents, and small streams were turned into raging
rivers.Bridges were swept away, and had to be rebuilt.The soldiers,
benumbed with chilling rain, toiled on over the sodden roads, cheerful
in the thought that they were soon to meet the enemies of their country.General Schoepf received the news of General Thomas' advance with great
satisfaction."If I can only hold on," he said, "until Thomas comes, everything will
be all right.""We must show a bold front, General," replied Fred, "and make the enemy
believe we have a large force.""It's the enemy that is showing a bold front nowadays," replied General
Schoepf, with a faint smile."They have been particularly saucy lately.They have in the last few days, cut off two or three small scouting
parties.But what worries me the most is that there is hardly a night
but that every man on some one of our picket posts is missing.There is
no firing, not the least alarm of any kind, but the men in the morning
are gone.It is a mystery we have tried to solve in vain.At first we
thought the men had deserted, but we have given that idea up.The men
are getting superstitious over the disappearance of so many of their
comrades, and are actually becoming demoralized.""General, will you turn this picket business over to me?""I have heard much of your ability in
ferreting out secret matters.Your success as a scout I am well
acquainted with, as you know.I hope you will serve me as well in this
matter of the pickets, for I am at my wits' end.""Well, General, to-morrow I will be at your service, and I trust you
will lose no more pickets before that time," and so saying Fred took his
leave, for he needed rest badly.The next morning, when Fred went to pay his respects to the general, he
found him with a very long face."Another post of four men disappeared
last night," he said."Well, General, if possible, I will try and
solve the problem, but it may be too hard for me.""Have you any idea yet how they are captured?"I must first look over the ground carefully, see how the
men are posted, talk with them, and then I may be able to form an idea."Fred's first business was to ride out to where the post had been
captured during the night.This he did, noting the lay of the ground,
carefully looking for footprints not only in front, but in the rear of
where the men had been stationed.He then visited all the picket posts,
talked with the men, learned their habits on picket, whether they were
as watchful as they should be--in fact, not the slightest thing of
importance escaped his notice.On his return from his tour of inspection, Fred said to General
Schoepf, "Well, General, I have my idea.""Your pickets have been captured from the rear, not the front.""I mean that some of the pickets are so placed that a wary foe could
creep in between the posts and come up in the rear, completely
surprising the men.I think I found evidence that the men captured last
night were taken in that way.I found, at least, six posts of which I
believe an enemy could get in the rear without detection, especially if
the land had been spied out.""You astonish me," said the general."But even if this is so, why does
not the sentinel give the alarm?""He may be in such a position that he dare not," answered Fred."That a double force be put on the posts, half to watch the rear.It
will be my business to-night to see to that.""Very well," replied General Schoepf."I shall be very curious to see
how the plan works, and whether your idea is the correct one or not.""I will not warrant it, General," replied Fred, "but there will be no
harm in trying."Just before night Fred made a second round of the picket posts, and
made careful inquiry whether any one of the posts had been visited
during the day by any one from the outside.All of the posts answered in the negative save one.The corporal of that
post said: "Why, a country boy was here to sell us some vegetables and
eggs.""Was he a bright boy, and did he seem to notice
things closely?""On the contrary," said the corporal, "he appeared to be remarkably dull
and ignorant.""Has the same boy been in the habit of selling vegetables to the
pickets?"Come to think about it, the corporal believed he had heard such a boy
spoken of.Then one of the men spoke up and said:

"You know Rankin was on the post that was taken in last night.He had a
letter come yesterday, and I took it out to him, and he told me of what
a fine supper they were going to have, saying they had bought some eggs
and a chicken of a boy."suddenly exclaimed the corporal, "that boy to-day walked to
the rear some little distance--made an excuse for going; he might not
have been such a fool as he looked.""Corporal, I will be here a little after dark
with a squad of men to help you keep watch.In the mean time keep a
sharp lookout.""That I will," answered the corporal."Do you think that boy was a
spy?"But if any
trouble occurs on the picket line to-night, it will be at this post."That night Fred doubled the pickets on six posts which he considered the
most exposed.But the extra men were to guard the rear instead of the
front.The most explicit instructions were given, and they were
cautioned that they were to let no alarm at the front make them relax
their vigilance in the rear.Thirty yards in the rear of the post where
he was to watch Fred had noticed a small ravine which led down into a
wood.It was through this ravine that he concluded the enemy would creep
if they should try to gain the rear of the post.Fred posted his men so
as to watch this ravine.To the corporal who had charge of the post, he
said:

"My theory is, that some one comes up to your sentinel, and attracts his
attention by pretending to be a friend, or perhaps a deserter.This, of
course, will necessitate the sentinel's calling for you, and naturally
attract the attention of every man awake.While this is going on, a
party that has gained the rear unobserved will rush on you and be in
your midst before you know it, and you will be taken without a single
gun being fired."said one, "I believe it could be done.""Now," continued Fred, "if you are hailed from the front to-night act
just as if you had not heard of this.When everything was prepared the soldiers, wrapped in their blankets,
sat down to wait for what might come.So intently did they listen that
the falling of a leaf would startle them.There was a half-moon, but dark clouds swept across the sky, and only
now and then she looked forth, hiding her face again in a moment.Once
in a while a dash of cold rain would cause the sentinels to shiver and
sink their chins deeper into the collars of their great coats.Midnight came, and still all was quiet.The soldiers not on guard lay
wrapped in their blankets, some of them in the land of dreams.Off in the woods the hoot of an owl was heard.A few minutes passed, and again the dismal "Whoo!Instantly they were all
attention, and every sense alert.whispered the sergeant, next to him."Nothing but the suspicious hooting of an owl," whispered back Fred.Then to the soldiers, "Perfectly still, men; not a sound."So still were they that the beatings of their hearts could be heard.Again the dismal hoot was heard, this time so near that it startled
them.Then from the sentinel out in front came the short, sharp challenge,
"Who comes there?""A deserter who wishes to come into the
lines and give himself up."The corporal went forward to receive the deserter.Now there came the
sound of swiftly advancing footsteps in front of the rear post, and dim
figures were seen through the darkness.Seven rifles belched forth their contents, and for a moment the flashes
of the guns lighted up the scene, and then all was dark.There were cries of pain, hoarse yells of surprise and anger, and then a
scattering volley returned."Use your revolvers," shouted Fred, and a rapid fire was opened.There were a few more
scattering shots, and all was still.The deserter, who was so anxious to give himself up, the moment the
alarm was given fired at the sentinel and vanished in the darkness.The sound of the firing created the wildest commotion in camp.The long
roll was beaten; the half-dressed, frightened soldiers came rolling out
of their tents, some without their guns, others without their cartridge
boxes; excited officers in their night clothes ran through the camp,
waving their bare swords and shouting: "Fall in, men, for God's sake,
fall in."It was some minutes before the excitement abated, and every one was
asking, "What is it?The officer of the day, with a strong escort, came riding out to where
the firing was heard.Being challenged, he gave the countersign, and
then hurriedly asked what occasioned the firing."Oh," cheerfully responded Fred, "they tried to take us in, and got
taken in themselves."An examination of the ground in front of where Fred's squad was
stationed revealed two Confederates still in death, and trails of blood
showed that others had been wounded."You can go to your quarters," said Fred to his men."You will not be
needed again to-night; and, Lieutenant," said he, turning to the officer
of the day, "each and every one of these men deserves thanks for his
steadiness and bravery.""I hardly think, General," said Fred, the next morning, as he made his
report, "that your pickets will be disturbed any more."As for General Schoepf, he was delighted, and could not thank Fred
enough.For three or four days things were comparatively quiet.Then a small
scouting party was attacked and two men captured.The next day a larger
party was attacked and driven in, with a loss of one killed and three
wounded.The stories were the same; the leader of the Confederates was a
young lieutenant, who showed the utmost bravery and handled his men with
consummate skill."I wish," said General Schoepf to Fred, "that you would teach this
young lieutenant the same kind of a lesson that you taught those fellows
who were capturing our pickets.""I can try, General, but I am afraid the job will not only be harder,
but much more dangerous than that one," answered Fred."This same young lieutenant," continued the general, "may have had a
hand in that picket business, and since he received his lesson there has
turned his attention to scouting parties.""In that case," replied Fred, "it will take the second lesson to teach
him good manners.Well, General, I will give it to him, if I can."The next morning, with eight picked men from Wolford's cavalry, Fred
started out in search of adventure."Don't be alarmed, General," said Fred, as he rode away, "if we do not
come back to-night.Many of their comrades, with longing eyes, looked after them, and wished
they were of the number; yet they did not know but that every one was
riding to death or captivity.Yet such is the love of adventure in the
human breast that the most dangerous undertakings will be gladly risked.After riding west about three miles Fred turned south and went about the
same distance.He then halted, and after a careful survey of the country
ahead, said: "I think, boys, it will be as well for us to leave the road
and take to the woods; we must be getting dangerously near the enemy's
country."The party turned from the road and entered a wood.Working their way
through this, skirting around fields, and dashing across open places,
after making a careful observation of the front, they managed to proceed
about two miles further, when they came near the crossing of two main
roads.Here they stopped and fed their horses, while the men
