But I swear to you by God, Jeanne!--Belgium
will live.Weep, sob, you are a mother.I too am crying with
you--But I swear by God: Belgium will live!God has given me the
light to see, and I can see.A new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with
blossoms--I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with
blossoms!And mothers will caress their children, and the sun
will shine upon their heads, upon their golden-haired little
heads!I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm
leaves to meet God who has come to earth again.Weep, Jeanne,
you are a mother!Weep, unfortunate mother--God weeps with you.But there will be happy mothers here again--I see a new world,
Jeanne, I see a new life!His opinion was, that as great rocks were continually rolling down the
side of the mountain at the foot of which the entrance to the cave
was, some one or more of these huge boulders had fallen into the
opening and completely closed it up.But that such a cave did exist, he was perfectly satisfied, and that
it would in all probability be again discovered at some future day, by
persons making excavations in the side of the mountain.And lucky he
thought would be the man who should make the discovery, for unheard of
treasures he had no doubt would be found stowed away in the chinks and
crevices of the rocks.So much by way of introduction; as we have no intention to describe
the cave until the proper time comes, we shall leave that part of the
subject for the present, while we introduce the reader to a few of the
principal personages of our narrative.At a distance of some fifteen or twenty miles from the City of New
York, on the Hudson river in the shadow of the rocks known as the
Palisades, something near two hundred years ago, lay a small vessel at
anchor.Not more than fifty or sixty
tons burden, and what would be considered a lumbering craft now a days
with our improved knowledge of ship building, would at that time be
called a very fast sailor.This vessel was schooner rigged, and every thing about her deck trim
and in good order.On the forecastle sat two men, evidently sailors, belonging to the
vessel.We say sailors, but in saying so we do not mean to imply that they
resembled your genuine old _salt_, but something between a sailor
and a landsman.They could hardly be called land lubbers, for I doubt
if a couple of old salts could have managed their little craft better
than they, while they, when occasion required, could work on land as
well as water.In fact they belonged to the class known as river boatmen, though they
had no hesitation to venturing out to sea on an emergency.The elder of these men, who might have seen some fifty years or more,
was a short, thick set man with dark complexion, and small grey eyes
overshadowed by thick, shaggy brows as black as night.His mouth was large when he chose to open it, but his lips were thin
and generally compressed.He looked at you from under his eyebrows like one looking at you from
a place of concealment, and as if he was afraid he would be seen by
you.His name was David Rider, but was better known among his associates
under the title of Old Ropes.The other was a man of about twenty-five or thirty, and was a taller
and much better-looking man, but without anything very marked in his
countenance."I tell you what, Joe," said his companion, "I don't like the
captain's bringin' of this gal; there can't no good come of it, and it
may bring us into trouble."everything that's done out of the common
track, accordin' to you's a goin' to bring us into trouble.I'd like
to know how bringing a pretty girl among us, is goin' to git us into
trouble?""A pretty face is well enough in its way," said Old Ropes, "but a
pretty face won't save a man from the gallows, especially if that face
is the face of an enemy.""By the 'tarnal, Ropes, if I hadn't see you fight like the very devil
when your blood was up, I should think you was giten' to be a coward.How in thunder is that little baby of a girl goin' to git us into
trouble?""Let me tell you," said Ropes, "that one pretty gal, if she's so
minded, can do you more harm than half a dozen stout men that you can
meet and fight face to face, and if you want to know the harm that's
goin' to come to us in this case I'll show you.""The gal, you know's the only daughter of old Rosenthrall.Why the
captain stole her away, I don't know.Out of revenge for some slight
or insult or other, I s'pose.Now the old man, as you're aware, knows
more about our business than is altogether safe for us.As I said
before, the gal's his only daughter, and he'll raise Heaven and earth
but he'll have her again, and when he finds who's got her, do you
suppose there'll be any safety for us here?if I was in the
captain's place, I'd either send her back again, or make her walk the
plank, as he did, you know who, and so get rid of her at once.""As for walking the plank," said the young man, laying his hand on his
companion's shoulder, danger or no danger, the man who makes that girl
walk the plank, shall walk after, though it should be Captain Flint
himself, or my name is not Jones Bradley.""You talk like a boy that had fallen dead in love," said the other;
"but anyhow, I don't like the captain's bringing the young woman among
us, and so I mean to tell him the first chance I have.""Well, now's your time," said Bradley, "for here comes the captain."As he spoke, a man coming up from the cabin joined them.His figure,
though slight, was firm and compact.He was of medium height; his
complexion naturally fair, was somewhat bronzed by the weather, his
hair was light, his eyes grey, and his face as a whole, one which many
would at first sight call handsome.Yet it was one that you could not
look on with pleasure for any length of time.There was something in
his cold grey eye that sent a chill into your blood, and you could not
help thinking that there was deceit, and falsehood in his perpetual
smile.Although his age was forty-five, there was scarcely a wrinkle on his
face, and you would not take him to be over thirty.Such was Captain Flint, the commander and owner of the little schooner
_Sea Gull_."Captain," said Rider, when the other had joined the group; "Joe and I
was talking about that gal just afore you came up, and I was a sayin'
to him that I was afeard that she would git us into trouble, and I
would speak to you about it.""Well," said Captain Flint, after a moment's pause, "if this thing was
an affair of mine entirely, I should tell you to mind your own
business, and there the matter would end, but as it concerns you as
well as me, I suppose you ought to know why it was done."The girl's father, as you know, has all along been one of our best
customers.And we suppose that he was too much interested in our
success to render it likely that he would expose any of our secrets,
but since he's been made a magistrate, he has all at once taken it
into his head to set up for an honest man, and the other day he not
only told me that it was time I had changed my course and become a
fair trader, but hinted that he had reason to suspect that we were
engaged in something worse than mere smuggling, and that if we did not
walk pretty straight in future, he might be compelled in his capacity
of magistrate to make an example of us."I don't believe that he has got any evidence against us in regard to
that last affair of ours, but I believe that he suspects us, and
should he even make his suspicions public, it would work us a great
deal of mischief, to say the least of it."I said nothing, but thinks I, old boy, I'll see if I can't get the
upper hand of you.For this purpose I employed some of our Indian
friends to entrap, and carry off the girl for me.I took care that it
should be done in such a manner as to make her father believe that she
was carried off by them for purposes of their own."Now, he knows my extensive acquaintance with all the tribes along the
river, and that there is no one who can be of as much service to him
in his efforts to recover his daughter, as I, so that he will not be
very likely to interfere with us for some time to come."I have seen him since the affair happened, and condoled with him, of
course."He believes that the Indian who stole his daughter was the chief
Fire Cloud, in revenge for some insult received a number of years ago."This opinion I encouraged, as it answered my purpose exactly, and I
promised to render all the assistance I could in his efforts to
recover his child."This part of the country, as we all know, is getting too hot for us;
we can't stand it much longer; if we can only stave off the danger
until the arrival of that East Indiaman that's expected in shortly
there'll be a chance for us that don't come more than once or twice in
a lifetime."Let us once get the pick out of her cargo, and we shall have enough
to make the fortunes of all of us, and we can retire to some country
where we can enjoy our good luck without the danger of being
interfered with.And then old Rosenthrall can have his daughter again
and welcome provided he can find her."So you see that to let this girl escape will be as much as your necks
are worth."So saying, Captain Flint left his companions and returned to the
cabin."Just as I thought," said Old Ropes, when the captain had gone, "if we
don't look well to it this unlucky affair will be the ruin of us all."Carl Rosenthrall was a wealthy citizen of New York.That is, rich when
we consider the time in which he lived, when our mammoth city was
little more than a good-sized village, and quite a thriving trade was
carried on with the Indians along the river, and it was in this trade
chiefly, that Carl Rosenthrall and his father before him, had made
nearly all the wealth which Carl possessed.But Carl Rosenthrall's business was not confined to trading with the
Indians alone, he kept what would now be called a country store.A
store where everything almost could be found, from a plough to a paper
of needles.Some ten years previous to the time when the events occurred which are
recorded in the preceding chapter, and when Hellena Rosenthrall was
about six years old, an Indian chief with whom Rosenthrall had
frequent dealings, and whose name was Fire Cloud, came in to the
merchant's house when he was at dinner with his family, and asked for
something to eat, saying that he was hungry.Now Fire Cloud, like the rest of his race, had an unfortunate liking
for strong drink, and was a little intoxicated, and Rosenthrall not
liking to be intruded upon at such a time by a drunken savage, ordered
him out of the house, at the same time calling him a drunken brute,
and making use of other language not very agreeable to the Indian.The chief did as he was required, but in doing so, he put his hand on
his tomahawk and at the same time turned on Rosenthrall a look that
said as well as words could say, "Give me but the opportunity, and
I'll bury this in your skull."The chief, on passing out, seated himself for a moment on the stoop in
front of the house.While he was sitting there, little Hellena, with whom he had been a
favorite, having often seen him at her father's store, came running
out to him with a large piece of cake in her hand, saying:

"Here, No-No, Hellena will give you some cake."No-No was the name by which the Indian was known to the child, having
learned it from hearing the Indian make use of the name no, no, so
often when trading with her father.Sandra went to the kitchen.The Indian took the proffered cake with a smile, and as he did so
lifted the child up in his arms and gazed at her steadily for a few
moments, as if he wished to impress every feature upon his memory, and
then sat her down again.He was just in the act of doing this when the child's father came out
of the dining-room.Rosenthrall, imagining that the Indian was about to kidnap his
daughter, or do her some violence, rushed out ordering him to put the
child down, and be off about his business.It was the recollection of this circumstance, taken in connection with
the fact that Fire Cloud had been seen in the city on the day on which
his daughter had disappeared, which led Rosenthrall to fix upon the
old chief as the person who had carried off Hellena.This opinion, as we have seen, was encouraged by Captain Flint for
reasons of his own.Rosenthrall, as Captain Flint had said, although for a long time one
of his best customers, knowing to, and winking at his unlawful doings,
having been elected a magistrate took it in to his head to be honest.He had made money out of his connection with the smuggler and pirate,
and he probably thought it best to break off the connection before it
should be too late, and he should be involved in the ruin which he
foresaw Captain Flint was certain to bring upon himself if he
continued much longer in the reckless course he was now pursuing.All this was understood by Captain Flint, and it was as he explained
to his men, in order to get the upper hand of Rosenthrall, and thus
prevent the danger which threatened him from that quarter, he had
caused Hellena to be kidnapped, and conveyed to their grand hiding
place, the cave in the side of the mountain.Rosenthrall at this time resided in a cottage on the banks of the
river, a short distance from his place of business, the grounds
sloping down to the water.These grounds were laid out into a flower garden where there was an
arbor in which Hellena spent the greater part of her time during the
warm summer evenings.It was while lingering in this arbor rather later than usual that she
was suddenly pounced upon by the two Indians employed by Captain Flint
for the purpose, and conveyed to his vessel, which lay at anchor a
short distance further up the river.Captain Flint immediately set sail with his unwilling passenger, and
in a few hours afterwards she was placed in the cave under the safe
keeping of the squaw who presided over that establishment.If the reader would like to know what kind of a looking girl Hellena
Rosenthrall was at this time, I would say that a merrier, more
animated, if not a handsomer face he never looked upon.She was the
very picture of health and fine spirits.Her figure was rather slight, but not spare, for her form was compact
and well rounded, and her movements were as light and elastic as those
of a deer.Her complexion was fair, one in which you might say without any streak
of fancy, the lily was blended with the rose.Her eyes were blue and her hair auburn, bordering on the golden, and
slightly inclined to wave rather than to curl.Her nose was of moderate size and straight, or nearly so.Some would say that her mouth was rather large, but the lips were so
beautifully shaped, and then when she smiled she displayed such an
exquisite set of the purest teeth, setting off to such advantage the
ruby tinting of the lips, you felt no disposition to find fault with
it.We have spoken of Hellena's look as being one of animation and high
spirits, and such was its general character, but for some time past a
shadow of gloom had come over it.Hellena was subject to the same frailties which are common to her sex.The object of her affections was a young man some two or three years
older than herself, and at first nothing occurred to mar their
happiness, for the parents of both were in favor of the match.As they were both young, however, it was decided to postpone their
union for a year.In the meantime, Henry Billings, the intended bridegroom, should make
a voyage to Europe in order to transact some business for his father,
who was a merchant trading with Amsterdam.The vessel in which he sailed never reached her place of destination.It was known that she carried out a large amount of money sent by
merchants in New York, as remittances to those with whom they had
dealings in Europe.This, together with certain facts which transpired
shortly after the departure of the vessel, led some people to suspect
that she had met with foul play somewhere on the high seas; and that
not very far from port either.Hellena, who happened to be in her father's store one day when Captain
Flint was there, saw on his finger a plain gold ring which she was
sure had belonged to her lover.This fact she mentioned to her father after the captain had gone.But he afterwards
remembered circumstances connected with the departure of the vessel,
and the movements of Captain Flint about the same time, which taken in
connection with the discovery made by his daughter, did seem to
justify the dark suspicions created in the mind of his daughter.But how was he to act under the circumstance?As a magistrate, it was
his business to investigate the matter.But then there was the danger
should he attempt to do so, of exposing his own connection with the
pirate.And he did move cautiously, yet not so cautiously but he aroused the
suspicions of Captain Flint, who, as we have seen, in order to secure
himself against the danger which threatened him in that quarter, had
carried off the daughter of the merchant.When the vessel in which young Billings set sail started she had a
fair wind, and was soon out in the open sea.Just as night began to set in, a small craft was observed approaching
them, and being a much faster sailor than the larger and heavily
ladened ship, she was soon along-side.When near enough to be heard, the commander of the smaller vessel
desired the other to lay too, as he had important dispatches for him
which had been forgotten.The commander of the ship not liking to stop his vessel while under
full sail merely for the purpose of receiving dispatches, offered to
send for them, and was about lowering a boat for that purpose, when
the other captain, who was none other than Captain Flint, declared
that he could only deliver them in person.The captain of the ship, though in no very good humor, finally
consented to lay too, and the two vessels were soon lying along side
of each other.Now although while lying at, or about the wharves of New York, the two
men already introduced to the reader apparently constituted the whole
crew of Captain Flint's vessel, such was by no means the fact, for
there were times when the deck of the little craft would seem fairly
to swarm with stout, able-bodied fellows.And the present instance,
Captain Flint had no sooner set foot upon the deck of the ship, than
six or eight men fully armed appeared on the deck of the schooner
prepared to follow him.The first thing that Captain Flint did on reaching the deck of the
ship was to strike the captain down with a blow from the butt of a
large pistol he held in his hand.His men were soon at his side, and
as the crew of the other vessel were unarmed, although defending
themselves as well as they could, they were soon overpowered.Several of them were killed on the spot, and those who were not killed
outright, were only reserved for a more cruel fate.The fight being over, the next thing was to secure the treasure.This was a task of but little difficulty, for Flint had succeeded in
getting one of his men shipped as steward on the ill-fated vessel.One of those who had escaped the massacre was James Bradley.He had,
by order of Captain Flint, been lashed to the mast at the commencement
of the fight.All the others who were not killed were
more or less badly hurt.These were unceremoniously compelled to walk the plank, and were
drowned.When it came to Billings' turn, there seemed to be some hesitation
among the pirates subjecting him to the same fate as the others.Daniel travelled to the garden.Jones Bradley, in a particular manner, was for sparing his life on
condition that he would pledge himself to leave the country, never to
return, and bind himself to eternal secrecy.But this advice was overruled by Captain Flint himself, who declared
he would trust no one, and that the young man should walk the plank as
the others had done.From this decision there was no appeal, and Henry Billings resigned
himself to his fate.Before going he said he would, as a slight favor, to ask of one of his
captors.And then pulling a plain gold ring off his finger, he said:

"It is only to convey this to the daughter of Carl Rosenthrall, if he
can find means of doing so, without exposing himself to danger.I can
hardly wish her to be made acquainted with my fate."When he had finished, Captain Flint stepped up saying that he would
undertake to perform the office, and taking the ring he placed it upon
his own finger.With a firm tread Billings stepped upon the
plank, and the next moment was floundering in the sea.The next thing for the pirates to do was to scuttle the ship, which
they did after helping themselves to so much of the most valuable
portion of the cargo as they thought they could safely carry away with
them.In about an hour afterwards the ship sank, bearing down with her the
bodies of her murdered crew, and burying, as Captain Flint supposed,
in the depths of the ocean all evidences of the fearful tragedy which
had been enacted upon her deck.The captain now directed his course homeward, and the next day the
little vessel was lying in port as if nothing unusual had happened,
Captain Flint pretending that he had returned from one of his usual
trading voyages along the coast.The intercourse between the new and the old world was not so frequent
in those days as now.The voyages, too, were much longer than at
present.So that, although a considerable time passed, bringing no
tidings of the ill-fated vessel without causing any uneasiness.But when week after week rolled by, and month followed month, and
still nothing was heard from her, the friends of those on board began
to be anxious about their fate.At length a vessel which had sailed some days later than the missing
ship, had reported that nothing had been heard from her.The only hope now was that she might have been obliged by stress of
weather to put in to some other port.But after awhile this hope also was abandoned, and all were
reluctantly compelled to come to the conclusion that she had foundered
at sea, and that all on board had perished.After lying a short time in port, Captain Flint set sail up the river
under pretence of going on a trading expedition among the various
Indian tribes.But he ascended the river no further than the Highlands, and come to
anchor along the mountain familiarly known as Butterhill, but which
people of more romantic turn call Mount Tecomthe, in honor of the
famous Indian chief of that name.Having secured their vessel close to the shore, the buccaneers now
landed, all save one, who was left in charge of the schooner.Each carried with him a bundle or package containing a portion of the
most valuable part of the plunder taken from the ship which they had
so recently robbed.Having ascended the side of the mountain for about two hundred yards,
they came to what seemed to be a simple fissure in the rocks about
wide enough to admit two men abreast.This cleft or fissure they entered, and having proceeded ten or
fifteen feet they came to what appeared to be a deep well or pit.Here the party halted, and Captain Flint lighted a torch, and
producing a light ladder, which was concealed in the bushes close by,
the whole party descended.On reaching the bottom of the pit, a low, irregular opening was seen
in the side, running horizontally into the mountain.This passage they entered, Indian file, and bending almost double.As they proceeded the opening widened and grew higher, until it
expanded into a rude chamber about twelve feet one way by fifteen feet
the other.Here, as far as could be seen, was a bar to all further progress, for
the walls of the chamber appeared to be shut in on every side.But on reaching the further side of the apartment, they stopped at a
rough slab of stone, which apparently formed a portion of the floor of
the cave.Upon one of the men pressing on one end of the slab, the other rose
like a trap door, disclosing an opening in the floor amply sufficient
to admit one person, and by the light of the torch might be seen a
rude flight of rocky stairs, descending they could not tell how far.These were no doubt in part at least artificial.John went to the hallway.The slab also had been placed over the hole by the pirates, or by some
others like them who had occupied the cave before this time, by way of
security, and to prevent surprise.Captain Flint descended these steps followed by his men.About twenty steps brought them to the bottom, when they entered
another horizontal passage, and which suddenly expanded into a wide
and lofty chamber.Here the party halted, and the captain shouted at the top of his
voice:

"What ho!there, Lightfoot, you she devil, why don't you light up!"This rude summons was repeated several times before it received any
answer.At length an answer came in what was evidently a female voice, and
from one who was in no very good humor: "Oh, don't you get into a
passion now.How you s'pose I know you was coming back so soon.""Didn't I tell you I'd be back to-day!""Well, what if you did," replied the voice."Do you always come when
you says you will?""Well, no matter, let's have no more of your impudence.We're back
bow, and I want you to light up and make a fire."The person addressed was now heard retiring and muttering to herself.In a few moments the hall was a blaze of light from lamps placed in
almost every place where a lamp could be made to stand.The scene that burst upon the sight was one of enchantment.The walls and ceiling of the cavern seemed to be covered with a
frosting of diamonds, multiplying the lamps a thousand fold, and
adding to them all the colors of the rainbow.Some of the crystals which were of the purest quartz hanging from the
roof, were of an enormous size, giving reflections which made the
brilliancy perfectly bewildering.The floor of the cavern was covered, not with Brussels or Wilton
carpets, but with the skins of the deer and bear, which to the tread
were as pleasant as the softest velvet.Around the room were a number of frames, rudely constructed to be
sure, of branches, but none the less convenient on that account, over
which skins were stretched, forming comfortable couches where the men
might sleep or doze away their time when not actively employed.Near the center of the room was a large flat stone rising about two
feet above the floor.The top of this stone had been made perfectly
level, and over it a rich damask cloth had been spread so as to make
it answer all the purposes of a table.Boxes covered with skins, and
packages of merchandise answered the purpose of chairs, when chairs
were wanted."Where is the king, I should like to know?"said Captain Flint,
looking with pride around the cavern now fully lighted up; "who can
show a hall in his palace that will compare with this?""And where is the king that is half so independent as we are?""And kings we are," said Captain Flint; "didn't they call the
Buccaneers Sea Kings in the olden time?""But this talking isn't getting our supper ready.Where has that
Indian she-devil taken herself off again?"The person here so coarsely alluded to, now made her appearance again,
bearing a basket containing a number of bottles, decanters and
drinking glasses.She was not, to be sure, so very beautiful, but by no means so ugly as
to deserve the epithet applied to her by Captain Flint.She was an Indian woman, apparently thirty, or thirty-five years of
age, of good figure and sprightly in her movements, which circumstance
had probable gained for her among her own people, the name of
Lightfoot.She had once saved Captain Flint's life when a prisoner among the
Indians, and fearing to return to her people, she had fled with him.It was while flying in company with this Indian woman, that Captain
Flint had accidently discovered this cave.And here the fugitives had
concealed themselves for several days, until the danger which then
threatened them had passed.It was on this occasion that it occurred to the captain, what a place
of rendezvous this cave would be for himself and his gang; what a
place of shelter in case of danger; what a fine storehouse for the
plunder obtained in his piratical expeditions!He immediately set about fixing it up for the purpose; and as it would
be necessary to have some one to take charge of things in his absence,
he thought of none whom he could more safely trust with the service,
than the Indian woman who had shared his flight.From that time, the cave became a den of pirates, as it had probably
at one time been a den of wild beasts.Which was the better condition, we leave it for the reader to decide.The only other occupant of the cave was a <DW64> boy of about fourteen
or fifteen years of age, known by the name of Black Bill.He seemed to be a simple, half-witted, harmless fellow, and assisted
Lightfoot in doing the drudgery about the place."What have you got in your basket, Lightfoot?""Away with your wine," said the captain; "we must have something
stronger than that.Give us some brandy; some fire-water."In de kitchen fixin' de fire," said Lightfoot."All right, let him heat some water," said the captain; "and now,
boys, we'll make a night of it," he said, turning to his men.The place here spoken of by Lightfoot as the kitchen, was a recess of
several feet in the side of the cave, at the back of which was a
crevice or fissure in the rock, extending to the outside of the
mountain.This crevice formed a natural chimney through which the smoke could
escape from the fire that was kindled under it.The water was soon heated, the table was covered with bottles,
decanters and glasses of the costliest manufacture.Cold meats of
different kinds, and an infinite variety of fruits were produced, and
the feasting commenced.Yes, the pirate and his crew were now seated round the table for the
purpose as he said, of making a night of it.And a set of more perfect
devils could hardly be found upon the face of the earth.And yet there was nothing about them so far as outward appearance was
concerned, that would lead you to suppose them to be the horrible
wretches that they really were.With the exception of Jones Bradley, there was not one among them who
had not been guilty of almost every crime to be found on the calender
of human depravity.For some time very little was said by any of the party, but after a
while as their blood warmed under the influence of the hot liquor,
their tongues loosened, and they became more talkative.And to hear
them, you would think that a worthier set of men were no where to be
found.Not that they pretended to any extraordinary degree of virtue, but
then they had as much as anyone else.And he who pretended to any
more, was either a hypocrite or a fool.To be sure, they robbed, and murdered, and so did every one else, or
would if they found it to their interest to do so.Tim," shouted one of the men to another who sat at the
opposite side of the table; "where is that new song that you learned
the other day?""I've got it here," replied the person referred to, putting his finger
on his forehead."Let's have it," said the other.The request being backed by the others Tim complied as follows.Fill up the bowl,
    Through heart and soul,
        Let the red wine circle free,
    Here's health and cheer,
    To the Buccaneer,
        The monarch of the sea!The king may pride,
    In his empire wide,
        A robber like us is he,
    With iron hand,
    He robs on land,
        As we rob on the sea.The priest in his gown,
    Upon us may frown,
        The merchant our foe may be,
    Let the judge in his wig,
    And the lawyer look big,
        They're robbers as well as we!Then fill up the bowl,
    Through heart and through soul,
        Let the red wine circle free,
    Drink health and cheer,
    To the Buccaneer."I like that song," said one of the men, whose long sober face and
solemn, drawling voice had gained for him among his companions the
title of Parson.John journeyed to the garden."I like that song; it has the ring of the true metal,
and speaks my sentiments exactly.It's as good as a sermon, and better
than some sermons I've heard.""It preaches the doctrine I've always preached, and that is that the
whole world is filled with creatures who live by preying upon each
other, and of all the animals that infest the earth, man is the worst
and cruelest."said one of the men, "you don't mean to say that the
whole world's nothing but a set of thieves and murderers!""Yes; I do," said the parson; "or something just as bad.""I'd like to know how you make that out," put in Jones Bradley."I had
a good old mother once, and a father now dead and gone.I own I'm bad
enough myself, but no argument of yours parson, or any body else's can
make me believe that they were thieves and murderers.""I don't mean to be personal," said the parson, "your father and
mother may have been angels for all I know, but I'll undertake to show
that all the rest of the world, lawyers, doctors and all, are a set of
thieves and murderers, or something just as bad.""Well Parson, s'pose you put the stopper on there," shouted one of the
men; "if you can sing a song, or spin a yarn, it's all right; but this
ain't a church, and we don't want to listen to one of your long-winded
sermons tonight."came from the voices of nearly all present.The Parson thus rebuked, was fain to hold his peace for the rest of
the evening.After a pause of a few moments, one of the men reminded Captain Flint,
that he had promised to inform them how he came to adopt their
honorable calling as a profession."Well," said the captain, "I suppose I might as well do it now, as at
any other time; and if no one else has anything better to offer, I'll
commence; and to begin at the beginning, I was born in London.About
my schooling and bringing up, I haven't much to say, as an account of
it would only be a bore."My father was a merchant and although I suppose one ought not to
speak disrespectfully of one's father, he was, I must say, as
gripping, and tight-fisted a man as ever walked the earth."I once heard a man say, he would part with anything he had on earth
for money, but his wife.My father, I believe, would have not only
parted with his wife and children for money, but himself too, if he
had thought he should profit by the bargain."As might be expected, the first thing he tried to impress on the
minds of his children was the necessity of getting money."To be sure, he did not tell us to steal, as the word is generally
understood; for he wanted us to keep clear of the clutches of the law.Could we only succeed in doing this, it mattered little to him, how
the desired object was secured."He found in me an easy convert to his doctrine, so far as the getting
of money was concerned; but in the propriety of hoarding the money as
he did when it was obtained, I had no faith."The best use I thought that money could be put too, was to spend it.Sandra travelled to the office."Here my father and I were at swords' points, and had it not been that
notwithstanding this failing, as he called it, I had become useful to
him in his business, he would have banished me long before I took into
my head to be beforehand with him, and become a voluntary exile from
the parental roof.As I have intimated, according to my father's
notions all the wealth in the world was common property, and every one
was entitled to all he could lay his hands on."Now, believing in this doctrine, it occurred to me that my father had
more money than he could ever possibly make use of, and that if I
could possess a portion of it without exposing myself to any great
danger, I should only be carrying out his own doctrine."Acting upon this thought, I set about helping myself as opportunity
offered, sometimes by false entries, and in various ways that I need
not explain."This game I carried on for some time, but I knew that it would not
last forever.I should be found out at last, and I must be out of the
way before the crash came."My father, in connection with two or three other merchants, chartered
a vessel to trade among the West India islands."I managed to get myself appointed supercargo.I should now be out of
the way when the discovery of the frauds which I had been practicing I
knew must be made."As I had no intention of ever returning, my mind was perfectly at
ease on this score.Daniel went back to the office."We found ready sale for our cargo, and made a good thing of it."As I have said, when I left home, it was with the intention of never
returning, though what I should do while abroad I had not decided, but
as soon as the cargo was disposed of, my mind was made up.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom."I had observed on our outward passage, that our vessel, which was a
bark of about two hundred tons burden, was a very fast sailor, and
with a little fitting up, could be made just the craft we wanted for
our purpose."During the voyage, I had sounded the hands in regard to my intention
of becoming a Buccaneer.I found them all ready to join me excepting
the first mate and the steward or cook, rather, a <DW64> whose views I
knew too well beforehand, to consult on the matter."As I knew that the ordinary crew of the vessel would not be
sufficient for our purpose, I engaged several resolute fellows to join
us, whom I prevailed on the captain to take on board as passengers."When we had been about a week out at sea and all our plans were
completed, we quietly made prisoners of the captain and first mate,
put them in the jolly boat with provisions to last them for several
days, and sent them adrift.The cook, with his son, a little boy,
would have gone with them, but thinking that they might be useful to
us, we concluded to keep them on board."What became of the captain and mate afterwards, we never heard."We now put in to port on one of the islands where we knew we could do
it in safety, and fitted our vessel up for the purpose we intended to
use her."This was soon done, and we commenced operations."The game was abundant, and our success far exceeded our most sanguine
expectations."There would be no use undertaking to tell the number of vessels,
French, English, Spanish and Dutch, that we captured and sunk, or of
the poor devils we sent to a watery grave."But luck which had favored us so long, at last turned against as."The different governments became alarmed for the safety of their
commerce in the seas which we frequented, and several expeditions were
fitted out for our special benefit.Mary travelled to the bedroom."For a while we only laughed at all this, for we had escaped so many
times, that we began to think we were under the protection of old
Neptune himself.But early one morning the man on the look-out
reported a sail a short distance to the leeward, which seemed trying
to get away from us."It was a small vessel, or brig, but as the weather was rather hazy,
her character in other respects he could not make out."We thought, however, that it was a small trading vessel, which having
discovered us, and suspecting our character, was trying to reach port
before we could overtake her."Acting under this impression, we made all sail for her."As the strange vessel did not make very great headway, an hour's
sailing brought as near enough to give us a pretty good view of her,
yet we could not exactly make out her character, yet we thought that
she had a rather suspicious look.And still she appeared rather like a
traveling vessel, though if so, she could not have much cargo on
board, and as the seemed built for speed, we wondered why she did not
make better headway."But we were not long left in doubt in regard to her real character,
for all at once her port-holes which had been purposely concealed were
unmasked, and we received a broadside from her just as we were about
to send her a messenger from our long tom."This broadside, although doing us little other damage, so cut our
rigging as to render our escape now impossible if such had been our
intention.So after returning the salute we had received, in as
handsome a manner as we could, I gave orders to bear down upon the
enemy's ship, which I was glad to see had been considerably disabled
by our shot.But as she had greatly the advantage of us in the weight
of material, our only hope was in boarding her, and fighting it out
hand to hand on her own deck."The rigging of the two vessels was soon so entangled as to make it
impossible to separate them."In spite of all the efforts of the crew of the enemy's vessel to
oppose us we were soon upon her deck.We found she was a Spanish
brigantine sent out purposely to capture us."Her apparent efforts to get away from us had been only a ruse to draw
us on, so as to get us into a position from which there could be no
escape."I have been in a good many fights, but never before one like that."As we expected no quarter, we gave none.The crew of the Spanish
vessel rather outnumbered us, but not so greatly as to make the
contest very unequal.And in our case desperation supplied the place
of numbers."The deck was soon slippery with gore, and there were but few left to
fight on either side.The captain of the Spanish vessel was one of the
first killed.Some were shot down, some were hurled over the deck in
the sea, some had their skulls broken with boarding pikes, and there
was not a man left alive of the Spanish crew; and of ours, I at first
thought that I was the only survivor, when the <DW64> cook who had been
forgotten all the while, came up from the cabin of our brig, bearing
in his arms his little son, of course unharmed, but nearly frightened
to death.Strange as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that with
the exception of a few slight scratches, I escaped without a wound."To my horror I now discovered that both vessels were fast sinking.But the cook set me at my ease on that score, by informing me that
there was one small boat that had not been injured.Into this we
immediately got, after having secured the small supply of provisions
and water within our reach, which from the condition the vessels were,
was very small."We had barely got clear of the sinking vessels, when they both went
down, leaving us alone upon the wide ocean without compass or chart;
not a sail in sight, and many a long, long league from the nearest
coast."For more than a week we were tossing about on the waves without
discovering a vessel.At last I saw that our provisions were nearly
gone.We had been on short allowance from the first.At the rate they
were going, they would not last more than two days longer.Self preservation, they say is the first law of human nature;
to preserve my own life, I must sacrifice my companions.The moment
the thought struck me it was acted upon."Sam, the black cook, was sitting a straddle the bow of the boat; with
a push I sent him into the sea.I was going to send his boy after him,
but the child clung to my legs in terror, and just at that moment a
sail hove in sight and I changed my purpose."Such a groan of horror as the father gave on striking the water I
never heard before, and trust I shall never hear again.""At that instant the whole party sprang to their feet as if started by
a shock of electricity, while most fearful groan resounded through the
cavern, repeated by a thousand echos, each repetition growing fainter,
and fainter until seeming to lose itself in the distance."That's it, that's it," said the captain, only louder, and if anything
more horrible.he demanded of Lightfoot, who had
joined the astonished group."Here I is," said the boy crawling out from a recess in the wall in
which he slept."No; dis is me," innocently replied the darkey."S'pose 'twas de debble comin' after massa," said the boy."What do you mean, you wooley-headed imp," said the captain; "don't
you know that the devil likes his own color best?Away to bed, away,
you rascal!""Well, boys," said Flint, addressing the men and trying to appear very
indifferent, "we have allowed ourselves to be alarmed by a trifle that
can be easily enough accounted for."These rocks, as you see, are full of cracks and crevices; there may
be other caverns under, or about as, for all we know.The wind
entering these, has no doubt caused the noise we have beard, and which
to our imaginations, somewhat heated by the liquor we have been
drinking, has converted into the terrible groan which has so startled
us, and now that we know what it is, I may as well finish my story."As I was saying, a sail hove in sight.It was a vessel bound to this
port.I and the boy were taken on board and arrived here in safety."This boy, whether from love or fear, I can hardly say, has clung to
me ever since."I have tried to shake him off several times, but it was no use, he
always returns."The first business I engaged in on arriving here, was to trade with
the Indians; when having discovered this cave, it struck me that it
would make a fine storehouse for persons engaged in our line of
business.Acting upon this hint, I fitted it up as you see."With a few gold pieces which I had secured in my belt I bought our
little schooner.From that time to the present, my history it as well
known to you as to myself.And now my long yarn is finished, let us go
on with our sport."But to recall the hilarity of spirits with which the entertainment had
commenced, was no easy matter.Whether the captain's explanation of the strange noise was
satisfactory to himself or not, it was by no means so to the men.Every attempt at singing, or story telling failed.The only thing that
seemed to meet with any favor was the hot punch, and this for the most
part, was drank in silence.After a while they slunk away from the table one by one, and fell
asleep in some remote corner of the cave, or rolled over where they
sat, and were soon oblivious to everything around them.The only wakeful one among them was the captain himself, who had drank
but little.Could he have dozed and been
dreaming?In a more suppressed voice than before, and not repeated so many
times, but the same horrid groan; he could not be mistaken, he had
never heard anything else like it.CHAPTER V.


Although it was nearly true, as Captain Flint had told his men, that
they were about as well acquainted with his history since he landed in
this country as he was himself, such is not the case with the reader.And in order that he may be as well informed in this matter as they
were, we shall now endeavor to fill up the gap in the narrative.To the crew of the vessel who had rescued him and saved his life,
Captain Flint had represented himself as being one of the hands of a
ship which had been wrecked at sea, and from which the only ones who
had escaped, were himself and two <DW64>s, one of whom was the father
of the boy who had been found with him.The father of the boy had
fallen overboard, and been drowned just before the vessel hove in
sight.This story, which seemed plausible enough, was believed by the men
into whose hands they had fallen, and Flint and the <DW64>, received
every attention which their forlorn condition required.And upon
arriving in port, charitable people exerted themselves in the
captain's behalf, procuring him employment, and otherwise enabling him
to procure an honest livelihood, should he so incline.But honesty was not one of the captain's virtues.He had not been long in the country before he determined to try his
fortune among the Indians.He adopted this course partly because he saw in it a way of making
money more rapidly than in any other, and partly because it opened to
him a new field of wild adventure.Having made the acquaintance of some of the Indians who were in the
habit of coming to the city occasionally for the purpose of trading,
he accompanied them to their home in the wilderness, and having
previously made arrangements with merchants in the city, among others
Carl Rosenthrall, to purchase or dispose of his furs, he was soon
driving a thriving business.In a little while he became very popular
with the savages, joined one of the tribes and was made a chief.This state of things however, did not last long.The other chiefs
became jealous of his influence, and incited the minds of many of the
people against him.They said he cheated them in his dealings, that his attachment to the
red men was all pretence.That he was a paleface at heart, carrying on
trade with the palefaces to the injury of the Indians.Killing them
with his fire water which they gave them for their furs.In all this there was no little truth, but Flint, confident of his
power over his new friends, paid no attention to it.One of the chiefs who had been made drunk by whiskey which he had
received from Flint in exchange for a lot of beaver skins, accused the
latter of cheating him; called him a paleface thief who had joined the
Indians only for the purpose of cheating them.Flint forgetting his usual caution took the unruly savage by the
shoulders and thrust him out of the lodge.In a few moments the enraged Indian returned accompanied by another,
when the two attacked the white man with knives and tomahawks.Flint saw no way but to defend himself single-handed as he was,
against two infuriated savages, and to do to if possible without
killing either.The only weapon he had at
command was a hunting knife, and he had two strong men to contend
against.Fortunately for him, one of them was intoxicated.As it was, the savage who had begun the quarrel, was killed, and the
other so badly wounded that he died a few hours afterwards.The enmity of the whole tribe was now aroused against Flint, by the
unfortunate termination of this affair.It availed him nothing to contend that he had killed the two in self
defence, and that they begun the quarrel.He was a white man, and had killed two Indians, and that was enough.Besides, how did they know whether he told the truth or not?He was a paleface, and palefaces had crooked tongues, and their words
could not be depended upon.Besides their brethren were dead, and
could not speak for themselves.Finally it was decided in the grand council of the tribe that he
should suffer death, and although they called him a paleface, as he
had joined the tribe he should be treated as an Indian, and suffer
death by torture in order that he might have an opportunity of showing
how he could endure the most horrible torment without complaining.The case of Flint now seemed to be a desperate one.He was bound hand
and foot, and escape seemed out of the question.Relief came from a quarter he did not anticipate.The place where this took place was not on the borders of the great
lakes where the tribe to which Flint had attached himself belonged,
but on the shores of the Hudson river a few miles above the Highlands,
where a portion of the tribe had stopped to rest for a few days, while
on their way to New York, where they were going for the purpose of
trading.It happened that there was among them a woman who had originally
belonged to one of the tribes inhabiting this part of the country, but
who while young, had been taken prisoner in some one of the wars that
were always going on among the savages.She was carried away by her
captors, and finally adopted into their tribe.To this woman Flint had shown some kindness, and had at several times
made her presents of trinkets and trifles such as he knew would
gratify an uncultivated taste.He little thought when making these trifling presents the service he
was doing himself.Late in the night preceding the day on which he was to have been
executed, this woman came into the tent where he lay bound, and cut
the thongs with which he was tied, and telling him in a whisper to
follow her, she led the way out.With stealthy and cautious steps they made their way through the
encampment, but when clear of this, they traveled as rapidly as the
darkness of the night and the nature of the ground would admit of.All night, and a portion of the next day they continued their journey.The rapidity with which she traveled, and her unhesitating manner,
soon convinced Flint that she was familiar with the country.Upon reaching Butterhill, or Mount Tecomthe, she led the way to the
cave which we have already described.After resting for a few moments in the first chamber, the Indian
woman, who we may as well inform the reader was none other than our
friend Lightfoot, showed Flint the secret door and the entrance to the
grand chamber, which after lighting a torch made of pitch-pine, they
entered."Here we are safe," said Lightfoot; "Indians no find us here."The moment Flint entered this cavern it struck him as being a fine
retreat for a band of pirates or smugglers, and for this purpose he
determined to make use of it.Lightfoot's knowledge of this cave was owing to the fact, that she
belonged to a tribe to whom alone the secrets of the place were known.It was a tribe that had inhabited that part of the country for
centuries.Mary moved to the office.But war and privation had so reduced them, that there was
but a small remnant of them left, and strangers now occupied their
hunting grounds.The Indians in the neighborhood knew of the existence of the cave, but
had never penetrated farther than the first chamber, knowing nothing
of the concealed entrance which led to the other.Having as they said,
seen Indians enter it who never came out again, and who although
followed almost immediately could not be found there, they began to
hold it in a kind of awe, calling it the mystery or medicine cave, and
saying that it was under the guardianship of spirits.Although the remnants of the once powerful tribe to whom this cave had
belonged, were now scattered over the country, there existed between
them a sort of masonry by which the different members could recognise
each other whenever they met.Fire Cloud, the Indian chief, who has already been introduced to the
reader, was one of this tribe.Although the existence of the cave was known to the members of the
tribe generally, the whole of its secrets were known to the medicine
men, or priests only.In fact it might be considered the grand temple where they performed
the mystic rites and ceremonies by which they imposed upon the people,
and held them in subjection.Flint immediately set about fitting up the place for the purpose which
he intended it.To the few white trappers who now and then visited the district, the
existence of the cave was entirely unknown, and even the few Indians
who hunted and fished in the neighborhood, were acquainted only with
the outer cave as before stated.When Flint was fully satisfied that all danger from pursuit was over,
he set out for the purpose of going to the city in order to perfect
the arrangements for carrying out the project he had in view.On passing out, the first object that met his view was his faithful
follower Black Bill, siting at the entrance."Follered de Ingins what was a comin' arter massa," replied the boy.Bill had followed his master into the wilderness, always like a body
servant keeping near his person when not prevented by the Indians,
which was the case while his master was a prisoner.When the escape of Flint was discovered, he was free from restraint,
and he, unknown to the party who had gone in pursuit, had followed
them.From the <DW64>, Flint learned that the Indians had tracked him to the
cave, but not finding him there, and not being able to trace him any
further, they had given up the pursuit.Flint thinking that the boy might be of service to him in the business
he was about to enter upon, took him into the cave and put him in
charge of Lightfoot.On reaching the city, Flint purchased the schooner of which he was in
command when first introduced to the reader.It is said that, "birds of a feather flock together," and Flint having
no difficulty gathering about him a number of kindred spirits, was
soon in a condition to enter upon the profession as he called it, most
congenial to his taste and habits.When the crew of the schooner woke up on the morning following the
night in which we have described in a previous chapter, they were by
no means the reckless, dare-devil looking men they were when they
entered the cave on the previous evening.For besides the usual effects produced on such characters by a night's
debauch, their countenances wore the haggard suspicious look of men
who felt judgment was hanging over them; that they were in the hands
of some mysterious power beyond their control.Some power from which
they could not escape, and which sooner or later, would mete out to
them the punishment they felt that they deserved.They had all had troubled dreams, and several of them declared that
they had heard that terrible groan during the night repeated if
possible, in a more horrible manner than before.To others the ghosts of the men they had lately murdered, appeared
menacing them with fearful retribution.As the day advanced, and they had to some extent recovered their
spirits by the aid of their favorite stimulants, they attempted to
laugh the matter off as a mere bugbear created by an imagination over
heated by too great an indulgence in strong drink.Although this opinion was not shared by Captain Flint, who had
carefully abstained from over-indulgence, for reasons of his own, he
encouraged it in his men.But even they, while considering it necessary to remain quiet for a
few days, to see whether or not, any harm should result to them, in
consequence of their late attack on the merchant ship, none of them
showed a disposition to pass another night in the cave.Captain Flint made no objection to his men remaining outside on the
following night, as it would give him the opportunity to investigate
the matter, which he desired.On the next night, when there was no one in the cavern but himself and
the two who usually occupied it, he called Lightfoot to him, and asked
her if she had ever heard any strange noises in the place before."Sometime heard de voices of the Indian braves dat gone to the spirit
land," said the woman."Did you ever hear anything like the groan we heard last night?""Tink him de voice ob the great bad spirit," was the reply.Captain Flint, finding that he was not likely to learn anything in
this quarter that would unravel the mystery, now called the <DW64>."Bill," he said, "did you ever hear that noise before?""When you trow my--"

"Hold your tongue, you black scoundrel, or I'll break every bone in
your body!"roared his master, cutting off the boy's sentence in the
middle.The boy was going to say:

"When you trow'd my fadder into the sea."The captain now examined every portion of the cavern, to see if he
could discover anything that could account for the production of the
strange sound.In every part he tried his voice, to see if he could produce those
remarkable echoes, which had so startled him, on the previous night,
but without success.The walls, in various parts of the cavern, gave back echoes, but
nothing like those of the previous night.There were two recesses in opposite sides of the cave.The larger one
of these was occupied by Lightfoot as a sleeping apartment.The other,
which was much smaller, Black Bill made use of for the same purpose.From these two recesses, the captain had everything removed, in order
that he might subject them to a careful examination.He tried his voice here, as in other parts of the cavern, but the
walls gave back no unusual echoes.He was completely baffled, and, placing his lamp on the table, he sat
down on one of the seats, to meditate on what course next to pursue.Lightfoot and Bill soon after, at his request, retired.He had been seated, he could not tell how long, with his head resting
on his hands, when he was aroused by a yell more fearful, if possible,
even than the groan that had so alarmed him on the previous night.The yell was repeated in the same horrible and mysterious manner that
the groan had been.Flint sprang to his feet while the echoes were still ringing in his
ears, and rushed to the sleeping apartment, first, to that of the
Indian woman, and then, to that of the <DW64>.They both seemed to be sound asleep, to all appearance, utterly
unconscious of the fearful racket that was going on around them.Captain Flint, more perplexed and bewildered than ever, resumed his
seat by the table; but not to sleep again that night, though the
fearful yell was not repeated.The captain prided himself on being perfectly free from all
superstition.He held in contempt the stories of ghosts of murdered men coming back
to torment their murderers.In fact, he was very much inclined to disbelieve in any hereafter at
all, taking it to be only an invention of cunning priests, for the
purpose of extorting money out of their silly dupes.But here was
something, which, if not explained away, would go far to stagger his
disbelief.He was glad that the last exhibition had only been witnessed by
himself, and that the men for the present preferred passing their
nights outside; for, as he learned from Lightfoot, the noises were
only during the night time.This would enable him to continue his investigation without any
interference on the part of the crew, whom he wished to keep in utter
ignorance of what he was doing, until he had perfectly unraveled the
mystery.For this purpose, he gave Lightfoot and Black Bill strict charges not
to inform the men of what had taken place during the night.He was determined to pass the principal portion of the day in sleep,
so as to be wide awake when the time should come for him to resume his
investigations.On the day after the first scene in the cave, late in the afternoon,
three men sat on the deck of the schooner, as she lay in the shadow of
forest covered mountain.These were Jones Bradley, Old Ropes, and the man who went by the name
of the Parson.They were discussing the occurrences of the previous
night."I'm very much of the captains opinion," said the Parson, "that the
noises are caused by the wind rushing through the chinks and crevices
of the rocks.""Yes; but, then, there wan't no wind to speak of, and how is the wind
to make that horrible groan, s'pose it did blow a hurricane?""Just so," said Old Ropes; "that notion about the wind makin' such a
noise at that, is all bosh.My opinion is, that it was the voice of a
spirit.I know that the captain laughs at all such things, but all his
laughin' don't amount to much with one that's seen spirits."you don't mean to say that you ever actually see a live ghost?""That's jist what I do mean to say," replied Old Ropes."Hadn't you been takin' a leetle too much, or wasn't the liquor too
strong?"Daniel went to the bedroom."Well, you may make as much fun about it as you please," said Old
Ropes; "but I tell you, that was the voice of a spirit, and, what's
more, I believe it's either the spirit of some one that's been
murdered in that cave, by some gang that's held it before, and buried
the body over the treasure they've stowed away there, or else the
ghost of some one's that's had foul play from the captain.""Well," said the Parson, "if I thought there was any treasure there
worth lookin' after, all the ghosts you could scare up wouldn't hinder
me from trying to get at it.""But, no matter about that; you say you see a live ghost once."I suppose," said Old Ropes, "that there aint no satisfaction in a
feller's tellin' of things that aint no credit to him; but,
howsomever, I might as well tell this, as, after all, it's only in the
line of our business."You must know, then, that some five years ago, I shipped on board a
brig engaged in the same business that our craft is."I needn't tell you of all the battles we were in, and all the prizes
we made; but the richest prize that ever come in our way, was a
Spanish vessel coming from Mexico, With a large amount of gold and
silver on board."We attacked the ship, expecting to make an easy prize of her, but we
were disappointed."The Spaniards showed fight, and gave us a tarnal sight of trouble."This made our captain terrible wrothy.He swore that every soul that
remained alive on the captured vessel should be put to death."Now, it so happened that the wife and child (an infant,) of the
captain of the Spanish vessel, were on board.When the others had all
been disposed of, the men plead for the lives of these two.But our
captain would not listen to it; but he would let us cast lots to see
which of us would perform the unpleasant office."As bad luck would have it, the lot fell upon me."It must be done; so, the plank was got ready.She took the baby in
her arms, stepped upon the plank, as I ordered her, and the next
moment, she, with the child in her arms, sank to rise no more; but the
look she gave me, as she went down, I shall never forget."It haunts me yet, and many and many is the time that Spanish woman,
with the child in her arms, has appeared to me, fixing upon me the
same look that she gave me, as she sank in the sea."Luck left us from that time; we never took a prize afterwards."Our Vessel was captured by a Spanish cruiser soon afterwards.I, with
one other, succeeded in making our escape."The captain, and all the rest, who were not killed in the battle,
were strung out on the yard-arm.""I suppose that's because she's a Spaniard, and thinks you don't
understand her language," remarked the Parson, sne
