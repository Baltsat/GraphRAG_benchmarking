While they are at
work, we will nab them.""Yes, sir; I want to be there.""I don't know about that, sir.But if anything is going on to-night, I
want to be in it."Talbot sends me with a large check to the bank,
what shall I do?""He may make off with the money during the day.""I will set another detective to watch him, and have him arrested in
that event.""This is going to be an exciting day," said Dan to himself, as he set
out for the store.TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.As Dan entered the store he noticed that Talbot looked excited and
nervous.Ordinarily the book-keeper would have reprimanded him sharply
for his late arrival, but he was not disposed to be strict this morning."I'm a little late this morning, Mr."Oh, well, you can be excused for once," said Talbot.He wished to disarm suspicion by extra good humor.Besides, he intended
to send Dan to the bank presently for a heavy sum, and thought it best
to be on friendly terms with him.About ten o'clock a messenger entered the store with a note from Mr.It was to this effect:


     "I am feeling rather out of sorts this morning, and shall not come
     to the store.Should you desire to consult me on any subject, send
     a messenger to my house."The only obstacle to
carrying out his plans was the apprehended presence and vigilance of his
employer.About one o'clock he called Dan into the office."Here, Dan," he said, "I want you to go to the bank at once.""Here is a check for twelve thousand dollars--rather a heavy amount--and
you must be very careful not to lose any of it, or to let any one see
that you have so much with you."You may get one hundred dollars in fives and tens, and the remainder in
large bills.""He means to make a big haul," said Dan to himself, as he left the
store."I hope our plans won't miscarry.Rogers to
lose so large a sum."As Dan left the store a man of middle size, who was lounging against a
lamp-post, eyed him sharply.As Dan was turning the corner of the street
he left his post, and, walking rapidly, overtook him."You are in the employ of Barton & Rogers, are you not?""I am a detective, on watch here by order of Mr."He is the book-keeper, is he not?"There is no need of watching till you bring
back the money.Where do you think Talbot will put the money?""In the safe, I think, sir."I believe he will retain the greater part on his
own person.If the men who are to rob the safe got hold of all the money
they would be likely to keep it, and not limit themselves to the sum he
agrees to pay them.""I shall take care to keep Talbot in view.He means to have it understood that all this money has been taken
by the burglars, whereas but a tithe of the sum will be deposited in the
safe.""It seems to me there is a risk of losing the money," he said."Don't be afraid," he said, confidentially."Talbot won't leave the
city.His words inspired confidence, and Dan entered the bank without
misgivings.The check was so large that the bank officials scrutinized it carefully.There was no doubt about its being correct, however."Be very careful, young man," said the disbursing clerk."You've got too
much to lose."Dan deposited one roll of bills in the left inside pocket of his coat,
and the balance in the right pocket, and then buttoned up the coat."I'm a boy of fortune for a short time," he said to himself."I hope
the time will come when I shall have as much money of my own."Dan observed that the detective followed him at a little distance, and
it gave him a feeling of security.Some one might have seen the large
sum of money paid him, and instances had been known where boys in such
circumstances had suddenly been set upon in the open street at midday
and robbed.He felt that he had a friend near at hand who would
interfere in such a case.asked an ill-looking man, suddenly accosting
him."I don't carry one," said Dan, eying the questioner suspiciously."Nor I. I have been very unfortunate.Can't you give me a quarter to buy
me some dinner?""Ask some one else; I'm in a hurry," said Dan, coldly."I'm not as green as you take me for," said Dan to himself.He thought his danger was over, but he was mistaken.Suddenly a large man, with red hair and beard, emerging from Dan knew
not where, laid his hand on his shoulder."Boy," said he, in a fierce undertone, "give me that money you have in
your coat-pocket, or I will brain you.""You forget we are in the public street," said Dan."And you would be--stunned, perhaps killed!""Look here,
boy, I am a desperate man.I know how much money you have with you.Dan looked out of the corner of his eye, to see the detective close at
hand.This gave him courage, for he recognized that the villain was only
speaking the truth, and he did not wish to run any unnecessary risk.He
gave a nod, which brought the detective nearer, and then slipped to one
side, calling:

"Stop thief!"The ruffian made a dash for him, his face distorted with rage, but his
arm was grasped as by an iron vise.exclaimed the detective, and he signaled to
a policeman."You are up to your old tricks again, as I expected.""I have taken nothing," he
added, sullenly.I heard you threatening the boy, unless he gave
up the money in his possession."Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully.Talbot, whose conscience was uneasy, and with good cause, awaited Dan's
arrival very anxiously."No; he was recognized by a policeman, who arrested him as he was on the
point of attacking me."Talbot asked no further questions, considerably to Dan's relief, for he
did not wish to mention the detective if it could be avoided.The book-keeper contented himself with saying, in a preoccupied tone, as
he received the money:

"You can't be too careful when you have much money about you.I am
almost sorry I sent for this money," he proceeded.Sandra went back to the garden."I don't think I
shall need to use it to-day.""Shall I take it back to the bank, sir?""No; I shall put it in the safe over night.I don't care to risk you or
the money again to-day.""He won't put it in the safe."TALBOT'S SCHEME FAILS.Talbot went into the office where he was alone.But the partition walls
were of glass, and Dan managed to put himself in a position where he
could see all that passed within.The book-keeper opened the package of bills, and divided them into two
parcels.One he replaced in the original paper and labeled it "$12,000."The other he put into another paper, and put into his own pocket.Dan
saw it all, but could not distinguish the denominations of the bills
assigned to the different packages.He had no doubt, however, that the
smaller bills were placed in the package intended to be deposited in the
safe, so that, though of apparently equal value, it really contained
only about one-tenth of the money drawn from the bank.Indeed, he was not observed,
except by Dan, whose business it was to watch him.The division being made, he opened the safe and placed the package
therein.He was anxious to communicate his discovery to the detective outside,
but for some time had no opportunity.About an hour later he was sent out on an errand.He looked about him in
a guarded manner till he attracted the attention of the outside
detective.The latter, in answer to a slight nod, approached him
carelessly."Well," he asked, "have you any news?"Talbot has divided the money into two
packages, and one of them he has put into his own pocket."He means to appropriate the greater part to his own
use.""Is there anything more for me to do?"Does the book-keeper suspect that he
is watched?""I am afraid he will get away with the money," said Dan, anxiously.Do you know whether there's any woman in the case?""He visits a young lady on Lexington avenue."It is probably on her account that he wishes to
become suddenly rich."This supposition was a correct one, as we know.It did not, however,
argue unusual shrewdness on the part of the detective, since no motive
is more common in such cases.Dan returned to the office promptly, and nothing of importance occurred
during the remainder of the day.Talbot was preparing to leave, he called in the janitor."You may lock the safe," he said."By the way, you may use the word 'Hartford' for the combination.""Be particularly careful, as the safe contains a package of
money--twelve thousand dollars.""Wouldn't it have been better to deposit it in the bank, Mr."Yes, but it was not till the bank closed that I decided not to use it
to-day.However, it is secure in the safe," he added, carelessly."I have no doubt of that, Mr.In turning a street corner, he brushed against a rough-looking man who
was leaning against a lamp-post."I beg your pardon," said the book-keeper, politely."Hartford," said Talbot, in a low tone."They've got the word," said Talbot to himself."Now the responsibility
rests with them.His face flushed, and his eyes lighted up with joy, as he uttered her
name.He was deeply in love, and he felt that at last he was in a
position to win the consent of the object of his passion.He knew, or,
rather, he suspected her to be coldly selfish, but he was infatuated.It
was enough that he had fulfilled the conditions imposed upon him.In a
few days he would be on his way to Europe with the lady of his love.Matters were so arranged that the loss of the twelve thousand dollars
would be credited to the burglars.If his
European journey should excite a shadow of suspicion, nothing could be
proved, and he could represent that he had been lucky in stock
speculations, as even now he intended to represent to Miss Conway.He was not afraid that she would be deeply shocked by his method of
obtaining money, but he felt that it would be better not to trust her
with a secret, which, if divulged, would compromise his safety.Yes, Miss Conway was at home, and she soon entered the room, smiling
upon him inquiringly.Sandra went to the hallway."Well," she said, "have you any news to tell me?""Virginia, are you ready to fulfill your promise?"asked Talbot,
eagerly."I make so many promises, you know," she said, fencing."Suppose that the conditions are fulfilled, Virginia?"I dared everything, and I have
succeeded.""As you might have done before, had you listened to me."Ten thousand dollars--the amount you required.""We will make the grand
tour?"She stooped and pressed a kiss lightly upon his cheek.It was a mercenary kiss, but he was so much in love that he felt repaid
for the wrong and wickedness he had done.It would not always be so,
even if he should never be detected, but for the moment he was happy."Now let us form our plans," he said."Will you marry me to-morrow
evening?"We will call on a clergyman, quietly, to-morrow
evening, and in fifteen minutes we shall be man and wife.On Saturday a
steamer leaves for Europe.I can hardly believe that I shall so soon
realize the dreams of years."How can you be spared from your business?""No; not till you are almost ready to start.""It is better that there should be no gossip about it.Besides, your
aunt would probably be scandalized by our hasty marriage, and insist
upon delay.That's something we should neither of us be willing to
consent to.""No, for it would interfere with our European trip.""You consent, then, to my plans?""Yes; I will give you your own way this time," said Virginia, smiling."And you will insist on having your own way ever after?""Of course," she said; "isn't that right?""I am afraid I must consent, at any rate; but, since you are to rule,
you must not be a tyrant, my darling."Talbot agreed to stay to dinner; indeed, it had been his intention from
the first.He remained till the city clocks struck eleven, and then took
leave of Miss Conway at the door.He set out for his boarding-place, his mind filled with thoughts of his
coming happiness, when a hand was laid on his arm.He wheeled suddenly, and his glance fell on a quiet man--the detective."You are suspected
of robbing the firm that employs you."exclaimed Talbot, putting on a bold face,
though his heart sank within him."I hope so; but you must accompany me, and submit to a search.If my
suspicions are unfounded, I will apologize."I will give you into
custody."The detective put a whistle to his mouth, and his summons brought a
policeman."Take this man into custody," he said.exclaimed Talbot; but he was very pale."You will be searched at the station-house, Mr."I hope nothing will be found to criminate you.Talbot, with a swift motion, drew something from his pocket, and hurled
it into the darkness.The detective darted after it, and brought it back."This is what I wanted," he said."Policeman, you will bear witness
that it was in Mr.I fear we shall have to detain
you a considerable time, sir."Fate had turned against him, and he was
sullen and desperate.he asked himself; but no answer suggested
itself.In the house on Houston street, Bill wasted little regret on the absence
of his wife and child.Neither did he trouble himself to speculate as to
where she had gone."I'm better without her," he said to his confederate, Mike."She's
always a-whinin' and complainin', Nance is.If I speak a rough word to her, and it stands to reason a chap can't
always be soft-spoken, she begins to cry.I like to see a woman have
some spirit, I do.""They may have too much," said Mike, shrugging his shoulders."My missus
ain't much like yours.If I speak rough to
her, she ups with something and flings it at my head."Oh, I just leave her to get over it; that's the best way.""Why, you're not half a man, you ain't.Do
you want to know what I'd do if a woman raised her hand against me?""I'd beat her till she couldn't see!"said Bill, fiercely; and he looked
as if he was quite capable of it.Daniel went back to the garden."You haven't got a wife like mine.""Just you take me round there some time, Mike.If she has a tantrum,
turn her over to me."He was not as great a ruffian as Bill, and the
proposal did not strike him favorably.His wife was certainly a virago, and though strong above the average, he
was her superior in physical strength, but something hindered him from
using it to subdue her.So he was often overmatched by the shrill-voiced
vixen, who knew very well that he would not proceed to extremities.Had
she been Bill's wife, she would have had to yield, or there would have
been bloodshed."I say, Bill," said Mike, suddenly, "how much did your wife hear of our
plans last night?""If she had she would not dare to say a word," said Bill, carelessly."She knows I'd kill her if she betrayed me," said Bill."There ain't no
use considerin' that.""Well, I'm glad you think so.It would be awkward if the police got wind
of it.""What do you think of that chap that's puttin' us up to it?""I don't like him, but I like his money.""Five hundred dollars a-piece ain't much for the risk we run.""If we don't find more in the safe, we'll bleed him when all's over.It was true that Bill was the leading spirit.He was reckless and
desperate, while Mike was apt to count the cost, and dwell upon the
danger incurred.They had been associated more than once in unlawful undertakings; and
though both had served a short term of imprisonment, they had in
general escaped scot-free.It was Bill who hung round the store, and who received from Talbot at
the close of the afternoon the "combination," which was to make the
opening of the safe comparatively easy."It's a good thing to have a friend inside," he said to his confederate."There'll be the janitor to dispose of," suggested Mike."Don't kill him if you can help it, Bill.Murder has an ugly look, and
they'll look out twice as sharp for a murderer as for a burglar.He can wake up when we're
gone, but we'll tie him so he can't give the alarm."Obey
orders, and I'll bring you out all right."So the day passed, and darkness came on.The janitor, or watchman, was a sturdy old man, who in early life had
been a sailor.Some accident had made him lame, and this incapacitated
him for his early vocation.It had not, however, impaired his physical
strength, which was very great, and Mr.Rogers was glad to employ him in
his present capacity.When Jack Green--Jack was the name he generally went by--heard of the
contemplated burglary, he was excited and pleased.It was becoming
rather tame to him to watch night after night without interruption, and
he fancied he should like a little scrimmage.He even wanted to
withstand the burglars single-handed."What's the use of callin' in the police?""It's only two men,
and old Jack is a match for two.""You're a strong man, Jack," said Dan, "but one of the burglars is as
strong as you are.He's broad-shouldered and
big-chested.""I ain't afraid of him," said Jack, defiantly."Perhaps not, but there's another man, too.But Jack finally yielded, though reluctantly, and three policemen were
admitted about eight o'clock, and carefully secreted, to act when
necessary.Jack pleaded for the privilege of meeting the burglars first,
and the privilege was granted, partly in order that they might be taken
in the act.Old Jack was instructed how to act, and though it was a part
not wholly in accordance with his fearless spirit, he finally agreed to
do as he was told.It is not necessary to explain how the burglars effected their entrance.This was effected about twelve o'clock, and by the light of a
dark-lantern Bill and Mike advanced cautiously toward the safe.At this point old Jack made his appearance, putting on an air of alarm
and dismay.he demanded, in a tone which he partially succeeded in
making tremulous."Keep quiet, and we will do you no harm."All right; I'll do it myself.The word agreed with the information
they had received from Talbot.It served to convince them that the
janitor had indeed succumbed, and could be relied upon.There was no
suspicion in the mind of either that there was any one else in the
establishment, and they felt moderately secure from interruption."Here, old fellow, hold the lantern while we go to work.Just behave
yourself, and we'll give you ten dollars--shall we, Mike?""Yes," answered Mike; "I'm agreed.""It'll look as if I was helpin' to rob my master," objected Jack."Oh, never mind about that; he won't know it.When all is over we'll tie
you up, so that it will look as if you couldn't help yourself.Jack felt like making a violent assault upon the man who was offering
him a bribe, but he controlled his impulse, and answered:

"I'm a poor man, and ten dollars will come handy.""All right," said Bill, convinced by this time that Jack's fidelity was
very cheaply purchased.He plumed himself on his success in converting
the janitor into an ally, and felt that the way was clear before him."Mike, give the lantern to this old man, and come here and help me."Old Jack took the lantern, laughing in his sleeve at the ease with which
he had gulled the burglars, while they kneeled before the safe.It was then that, looking over his shoulder, he noticed the stealthy
approach of the policemen, accompanied by Dan.Setting down the lantern, he sprang upon the back of Bill as
he was crouching before him, exclaiming:

"Now, you villain, I have you!"The attack was so sudden and unexpected that Bill, powerful as he was,
was prostrated, and for an instant interposed no resistance."You'll repent this, you old idiot!"he hissed between his closed teeth,
and, in spite of old Jack's efforts to keep him down, he forced his way
up.At the same moment Mike, who had been momentarily dazed by the sudden
attack, seized the janitor, and, between them both, old Jack's life was
likely to be of a very brief tenure.But here the reinforcements
appeared, and changed the aspect of the battle.One burly policeman seized Bill by the collar, while Mike was taken in
hand by another, and their heavy clubs fell with merciless force on the
heads of the two captives.In the new surprise Jack found himself a free man, and, holding up the
lantern, cried, exultingly:

"If I am an old idiot, I've got the better of you, you scoundrels!It was hard for him to give in, but the
fight was too unequal."Mike," said he, "this is a plant.I wish I had that cursed book-keeper
here; he led us into this.""Yes," answered Bill; "he put us up to this."No need to curse him," said Jack, dryly; "he meant you to succeed.""Didn't he tell you we were coming to-night?""How did you find it out, then?""It wasn't enough; but we should have got more out of him.""Before you go away with your prisoners," said Jack to the policeman, "I
wish to open the safe before you, to see if I am right in my suspicions.Talbot drew over ten thousand dollars from the bank to-day, and led
us to think that he deposited it in the safe.I wish to ascertain, in
the presence of witnesses, how much he placed there, and how much he
carried away.""She is going to be my little sister, mother," said Dan, gayly.said Althea, releasing Dan's hand, and putting
her own confidingly in that of Mrs."Yes, my dear," said the widow, her heart quite won by the little girl's
innocent confidence, and she bent over and kissed her."It means that Althea is to board with us, and be company for you.I
have agreed with her aunt that you will take her.""But does her aunt know that we live in such a poor place?"asked his
mother in a tone of hesitation."Yes, mother, but that makes no difference, as we shall move up town
to-morrow.""I am sure you have acted for the best, Dan, but it seems so strange.""Will it seem strange to receive fifty dollars a month for Althea's
board?"I didn't suppose we ought to charge more."Are you a great eater,
Althea?""Sometimes I am," said the little girl, naively."Never mind, I guess there will be enough."I didn't know there
would be two, but I will go cut and buy some more meat, if you can
wait.""I have had supper, mother, or dinner rather.I dined with Althea and
her aunt at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.""Has Althea been stopping there, Dan?""Then how can she stay even one night in this poor place?"Althea, do you mind stopping here just one night?We
will go to a better place to-morrow.""No, Dan, I don't care.""There, mother, I told you so, Althea is a brick.""What a funny boy you are, Dan!A brick is red and
ugly, and I am not.""No, Althea, you are not ugly, but your cheeks are red.""They don't look like a brick, Dan.""I had got your supper all ready, Dan," said his mother, regretfully."You didn't have any meat, I'll warrant.Now, like a good mother, sit
down and eat the steak."Assured that Dan had supped well, Mrs.Mordaunt didn't resist his
advice.Dan looked on, and saw with pleasure that his mother relished the meat."We will be able to live better hereafter, mother," he said."There
won't be any stinting.Fifty dollars will go a good ways, and then,
besides, there will be my earnings.I forgot to tell you, mother, that I
have probably got a place.""Our good fortune is coming all at once, Dan," said Mrs.I think it has come to stay, too.""I feel so tired," said Althea, at this point.In twenty minutes the little girl was in a sound sleep.Dan was not
sorry, for he wanted to tell his mother about the days adventures, and
he could do so more freely without any one to listen."So, mother," he concluded, "we are going to turn over a new leaf.We
can't go back to our old style of living just yet, but we can get out of
this tenement-house, and live in a respectable neighborhood.""God has been good to us, Dan."I know it, mother, but somehow I don't think of that as quick as you.Who do you think I saw in the supper-room at the Fifth Avenue?He was wonderfully puzzled to know how I happened to be
there.He told the party he was with that I was a common newsboy.""He is a very mean boy," said Mrs."After being
so intimate with you too."He can't do me any harm, and I don't care for his
friendship.The time may come when I can meet him on even terms."I shall work along, and if I get rich I
sha'n't be the first rich man that has risen from the ranks."Early the next morning Dan started out in search of a new home.He and his mother decided that they would like to live somewhere near
Union Square, as that would be a pleasant afternoon resort for their
young boarder."No, Dan, I have not time this morning."Very well, mother; I will do my best."Dan crossed Broadway, and took a horse-car up town.In West Sixteenth street his attention was drawn to the notice,
"Furnished Rooms to Let," upon a good-looking brick house.He rang the bell, and asked to see the lady of the house.A stout, matronly looking woman, with a pleasant face, answered the
servant's call."I called to inquire for rooms," said Dan."For my mother, and sister, and myself.""I have a large back room on the third floor, and a small room on the
fourth floor."It was neatly carpeted and furnished, and had a cheerful outlook."This will do for mother and Althea," he said."Yes, ma'am, but I am sure that will suit.It is for me, and I am not
particular.But there's one thing that may trouble us.""I will give her the privilege of using my kitchen.I don't care to
take boarders, as it would be too much care, but your mother is welcome
to use my kitchen stove.""Leave that to your mother and myself," said Mrs."How much do you want for your rooms?""Of course; that is all I ask."We will pay it," said Dan, quite relieved, for he feared he should have
to pay more."I generally ask a week's rent in advance," said Mrs.Brown, "but in
your case I won't insist upon it.""Oh, it is perfectly convenient," said Dan, and he drew out his
pocket-book containing the money--over a hundred dollars--which Althea's
aunt had given him.Brown's respect for Dan was considerably increased by this display
of wealth, and she congratulated herself on securing such substantial
lodgers.This business accomplished Dan went down town, and informed his mother
of the arrangement he had made.Mordaunt, Althea, and
he were installed in their new home, much to the regret of Mrs.Rafferty, who regretted losing so good a neighbor.Before this, however,
Dan sought the counting-room of Barton & Rogers.DAN BECOMES A DETECTIVE.Barton & Rogers evidently did business in a large way.They occupied an
imposing-looking building of five stories, the greater part being used
to store goods.A spare,
dark-complexioned man of about thirty-five, with a pen behind his ear,
was issuing orders to a couple of workmen."No, he is not," said the dark man, curtly."You might be more civil," thought our hero.He stood his ground, feeling authorized to do so because he had come by
appointment.Observing this, the book-keeper turned and said, sharply:

"Didn't you hear?"I heard you," said Dan, quietly."Not at all, sir; but Mr."Thank you, but I don't think that would do."The book-keeper eyed him sharply, and his face lighted up with a sudden
discovery."You sell papers in front of the Astor House,
don't you?""I thought so; I have bought papers of you."Rogers wants me, I suppose, or he would not have asked me to call,"
returned Dan."Not always," said Dan, with a smile."Some hot days I am far from
cool."Rogers wishes you to supply him with an evening paper?""Perhaps he does," returned Dan, with a smile."In the supper-room of the Fifth Avenue Hotel."demanded Talbot, the book-keeper, in
surprise."I was taking supper," said Dan, rather enjoying the others surprise,
"and Mr.Do you often take supper at the Fifth Avenue Hotel?""I'm willing to change places with you."you are here before me, Dan," he remarked, pleasantly."No, sir; only about five minutes.""I must keep you waiting a few minutes longer while I look at my
letters.The letters have arrived, have they not, Mr."Amuse yourself as you like while you are waiting, Dan," said the
merchant.Talbot, the book-keeper, followed the merchant into the
counting-room, and Dan was left alone.He looked about him with
interest, thinking it probable that this was to be his future business
home.It would certainly be a piece of good fortune to become attached
to so large and important a house, and he felt in very good spirits,
though he foresaw that Mr.Talbot would not make it very pleasant for
him.But with his employer on his side he need not be alarmed."I have to go out a few minutes," he said to Dan."Come with me, and we
can talk on the way."Talbot followed the two with a frown upon his brow."How on earth has that boy managed to get round Mr."I hope he won't be foolish enough to take him in here."Talbot had a nephew whom he was anxious to get into the business, and
Dan's engagement would interfere with his little plan.This partly
accounts for his brusque reception of Dan on his first arrival."Well, how do you like our place of business, Dan?""Would you rather sell papers or take employment with me?""I should like very much to be in your employ, sir.""How much did you earn as a newsboy?""When I was lucky I made a dollar a day.""Then I ought to give you six dollars a week."It is more than boys generally get at the
start, but I am willing to pay a good sum to a boy who suits me.""I will try to suit you, sir.""Do you know why I take you into my employ?""I feel kindly disposed to you, Dan, but that is not my chief reason."Dan was puzzled, and waited to hear more."My attention was drawn to you on the ferry-boat.I observed your
detection of the mean scamp who cheated a poor flower-girl by offering
her bad money, and I inferred that you were sharp and keen.""That is the sort of boy I want just now."I don't think he admires me much," he answered."He wanted to clear me
out before you came in.""Yes; he recognized me as a newsboy."He has a nephew whom he wishes me to
engage."Perhaps his nephew would suit you better, sir," said Dan, modestly."Are you willing to resign in his favor?""I prefer to leave that to you, sir."The nephew is a disagreeable boy, who would not
suit me at all.He thinks more of dress than of duty, and, if I read him
aright, is lazy and incompetent.Talbot has spoken to
me about taking him.""Perhaps he doesn't know his nephew's faults.""He knows them well enough, but is desirous of promoting his interests.He won't look upon you very favorably when he learns that I have engaged
you.""If you are satisfied, I won't care for that."And now for a few words in confidence," and Mr."Our business is a large one, and the sums of
money handled are necessarily large.Three months since I ascertained
that somewhere in my establishment there was a leak.We are losing money
in some unexplained way.I believe that some one in whom I repose
confidence is betraying me."Talbot," he said, in the same low voice."It seems strange, perhaps, that I should speak so confidentially to
you--a mere boy--but I am impressed with the idea that you can help me.""If I can, sir, I will," said Dan, earnestly.My first injunction is to say no word, even to your
nearest relations, of what I have told you."I want to know what are his habits,
whether he uses money freely, with whom he associates.Can you, without
betraying to him that he is watched, find out some information for me on
these points?""If you secure any information, never communicate it to me in the
office.Either come to my house, or write me there.""You understand that I am employing you in a detective capacity, and
that your time will partly be taken up out of business hours.I intend
to pay you extra, according to results.Rogers, but I am afraid you will be disappointed in
me.""Have you any directions to give me, sir, as to how to go to work?""No; I am nothing of a detective myself.I might,
of course, employ a professional detective, but Talbot is sharp, and he
would suspect.He won't dream of my employing a
boy.That is all I have to say for the present."To-morrow let it be, then.Rogers shook hands with our hero, and walked away."I am afraid I have a hard job on my hands," thought Dan, "but I will do
my best."DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan's mother was much pleased with her new quarters.The large room,
occupied by Althea and herself, was bright and cheerful, and well
furnished.Besides the ordinary chamber furniture, there was a
comfortable arm-chair and a lounge.Mordaunt felt that she would
not be ashamed now to receive a visit from some of her former friends.She had anticipated some trouble about the preparation of meals, but
Mrs.Brown made a proposition which wonderfully removed all
difficulties.Mordaunt," she said, "your family is about the same as mine.I
have a son who is employed in a newspaper office down town, and you have
two young children.Now, suppose we club together, and each pay half of
the table supplies.Then one day you can superintend the cooking--you
will only have to direct my servant Maggie--and the next day I will do
it.Then, every other day, each of us will be a lady of leisure, and not
have to go into the kitchen at all."The arrangement will be so much to my advantage that I can say only
one thing--I accept with thanks.But won't you be doing more than your
share?You will be furnishing the fuel, and pay Maggie's wages.""I should have to do that at any rate.The plan is perfectly
satisfactory to me, if it suits you."Mordaunt found that the expense was not beyond her means.Her
income for the care of Althea was fifty dollars a month, and Dan paid
her four dollars a week out of his wages, reserving the balance as a
fund to purchase clothes.She went herself to market and selected
articles for the table, and, for the first time since her husband's
failure, found herself in easy circumstances.There was no need now to make vests at starvation prices.She had
thought of continuing, but Dan insisted upon her giving it up entirely."If you want to sew, mother," he said, "you can make some of Althea's
clothes, and pay yourself out of the ten dollars a month allowed for her
clothes."Mordaunt decided to follow Dan's
advice.She lost no time in obtaining books for the little girl, and
commencing her education.Althea knew her letters, but nothing more.She
was bright and eager to learn, and gained rapidly under her new teacher.Naturally, Dan and his mother were curious as to Althea's early
history, but from the little girl they obtained little information."Do you remember your mother, Althea?"Only a little while before you brought me here.""Your mother isn't dead, is she?"Poor mamma cried very much
when she went away.She kissed me, and called me her darling.""Perhaps her lungs are affected, and she has gone to a warmer climate,"
suggested Mrs."She may have gone to Florida, or even to
Italy."asked Dan, turning to Althea."Father is a bad man," said the child, positively."He came back once, and then mamma cried again.I think he wanted mamma
to give him some money."Dan and his mother talked over the little girl's revelations, and
thought they had obtained a clew to the mystery in which the child's
history was involved.Althea's mother might have married a man of bad
habits, who wanted to get possession of her fortune, and rendered a
separation necessary.Ill health might have required her to leave home
and shift the care of the little girl upon strangers.It seemed rather
odd that she should have been handed over to utter strangers, but there
might have been reasons of which they knew nothing."We won't trouble ourselves about it," said Dan."It's good luck for us,
even if it was bad luck for Althea's mother.I like the idea of having a
little sister."Althea's last name was not known to her new protector.When Dan
inquired, he was told that she could pass by his name, so Althea
Mordaunt she became.Both Dan and his mother had feared that she might become homesick, but
the fear seemed groundless.She was of a happy disposition, and almost
immediately began to call Mrs."I call you mother," she said, "but I have a mamma besides; but she has
gone away.""You must not forget your mamma, my dear," said the widow.She will come back some day; she said she would.""And I will take care of you till she does, Althea.""I am glad I came to you, for now I have
a brother Dan.""And I have a little sister," said Dan.While Dan was away, and now he was away after supper regularly, Althea
was a great deal of company for Mrs.In the pleasant afternoons she took the little girl out to walk,
frequently to Union Square Park, where she made acquaintance with other
little girls, and had a merry time, while her new mother sat on one of
the benches.One day a dark-complexioned gentleman, who had been looking earnestly at
Althea, addressed Mrs."That is a fine little girl of yours, madam," he said."She does not resemble you much," he said, inquiringly."No; there is very little resemblance," answered Mrs.Mordaunt, quietly,
feeling that she must be on her guard.Mordaunt did not reply, and the stranger thought she was offended."I beg your pardon," he said, "but she resembles a friend of mine, and
that called my attention to her."Mordaunt bowed, but thought it wisest not to protract the
conversation.She feared that the inquirer might be a friend of the
father, and hostile to the true interests of the child.For a week to come she did not again bring Althea to the park, but
walked with her in a different direction.When, after a week, she
returned to the square, the stranger had disappeared.At all events, he
was not to be seen.Talbot heard of his engagement with anything but satisfaction.He
even ventured to remonstrate with Mr."Do you know that this boy whom you have engaged is a common newsboy?""I have bought a paper more than once of him, in front of the
Astor House.""It is none of my business, but I think you could easily get a better
boy.There is my nephew----"

"Your nephew would not suit me, Mr."Won't you give him a trial?""If Dan should prove unsatisfactory, would you try my nephew?"It was an incautious concession, for it was an inducement to the
book-keeper to get Dan into trouble.It was Dan's duty to go to the post-office, sometimes to go on errands,
and to make himself generally useful about the warehouses.As we know,
however, he had other duties of a more important character, of which Mr.The first discovery Dan made was made through the book-keeper's
carelessness.Rogers was absent in Philadelphia, when Talbot received a note which
evidently disturbed him.Dan saw him knitting his brows, and looking
moody.Finally he hastily wrote a note, and called Dan."Take that to -- Wall street," he said, "and don't loiter on the way."On reaching the address, Dan found that Jones & Robinson were stock
brokers."Tell him we will carry the stocks for him a week longer, but can't
exceed that time.""Perhaps you had better write him a note," suggested Dan, "as he may not
like to have me know his business.""I believe I have made a discovery," he said to himself.Talbot is
speculating in Wall street.I wonder if he speculates with his own money
or the firm's?"His face, however, betrayed nothing as he handed the note to the
book-keeper, and the latter, after a searching glance, decided that
there was nothing to fear in that quarter.Talbot's operations, if the reader
will accompany him to a brownstone house on Lexington avenue, on the
evening of the day when Dan was sent to the office of the Wall street
brokers.Talbot ascended the steps, not with the elastic step of a man with
whom the world is prospering, but with the slow step of a man who is
burdened with care.he inquired of the servant who answered the
bell."Will you tell her I should like to speak with her?"Talbot walked in with the air of one who was familiar with the house,
and entering a small front room, took a seat.The furniture was plain, and the general appearance was that of a
boarding-house.Talbot seemed immersed in thought, and only raised his eyes from the
carpet when he heard the entrance of a young lady.His face lighted up,
and he rose eagerly."My dear Virginia," he said, "it seems a long time since I saw you.""It is only four days," returned the young lady, coolly."Four days without seeing you is an eternity."It was easy to see that Talbot was in love, and
she was not."Not good news," said he, soberly.Before going further, it may be as well to describe briefly the young
lady who had so enthralled the book-keeper.She had the advantage of youth, a complexion clear red and white, and
decidedly pretty features.If there was a defect, it was the expression
of her eyes.There was nothing soft or winning in her glance.She
seemed, and was, of a cold, calculating, unsympathetic nature.She was
intensely selfish, and was resolved only to marry a man who could
gratify her taste for finery and luxurious living.Sinclair, who kept the boarding-house, and
though living in dependence upon her aunt, did nothing to relieve her
from the care and drudgery incidental to her business."It's too provoking," she said, pouting."So it is, Virginia;" and Talbot tried to take her hand, but she quietly
withdrew it."You told me that you would have plenty of money by this time, Mr."I expected it, but a man can't foresee the fluctuations of Wall street.I am afraid I shall meet with a loss.""I don't believe you are as smart as Sam Eustis--he's engaged to my
cousin.He made ten thousand dollars last month on Lake Shore.""It's the fools that blunder into luck," said Talbot, irritated."Then you'd better turn fool; it seems to pay," said Virginia, rather
sharply."No need of that--I'm fool enough already," said Talbot, bitterly."Oh, well, if you've only come here to make yourself disagreeable, I'm
sure you'd better stay away," said the young lady, tossing her head."I came here expecting sympathy and encouragement," said Talbot."Instead, you receive me with taunts and coldness.""I will be cheerful
and pleasant when you bring me agreeable news.""Why will you require
impossibilities of me?I have an income of two thousand
dollars a year.We can live comfortably on that, and be happy in a snug
little home.""Thank you; I'd
rather not.It means that I am to be a
household drudge, afraid to spend an extra sixpence--perhaps obliged to
take lodgers, like my aunt.""I am sure you cannot love me when you so coolly give me up for money.""I haven't given you up, but I want you to get money.""Where there's a will, there's a way, Mr.If you really care so
much for me, you will try to support me as I want to live.""Tell me, in a word, what you want.""Well," said Virginia, slowly, "I want to go to Europe for my
honey-moon.I've heard so much of Paris, I know I should like it ever
so much.Then I want to live _respectably_ when I get back.""Well, we must have a nice little house to ourselves, and I think, just
at first, I could get along with three servants; and I should want to go
to the opera, and the theater, and to concerts.""You have not been accustomed to live in that way, Virginia.""No; and that's why I have made up my mind not to marry unless my
husband can gratify me.""Yes, I think so," said Virginia, coolly."And you would desert me for a richer suitor?""Of course I would rather marry you--you know that," said Virginia, with
perfect self-possession; "but if you can't meet my conditions, perhaps
it is better that we should part.""No; only sensible," she returned, calmly."I don't mean to marry you
and be unhappy all my life; and I can't be happy living in the stuffy
way my aunt does.We should both be sorry for such a marriage when it
was too late.""I will take the risk, Virginia," said Talbot, fixing his eyes with
passionate love on the cold-hearted girl."But I will not," said Virginia, decidedly."I am sure you needn't take
it to heart, Mr.Why don't you exert yourself and win a fortune,
as other people do?I am sure plenty of money is made in Wall street."Come now, smooth your face, and tell me you will
try," she said, coaxingly."Yes, Virginia, I will try," he answered, his face clearing."And if I
try----"

"You will succeed," she said, smiling."And now don't let us talk about disagreeable things.Do you know, sir,
it is a week since you took me to any place of amusement?And here I
have been moping at home every evening with my aunt, who is terribly
tiresome, poor old soul!""I would rather spend the evening here with you, Virginia, than go to
any place of amusement.""I don't--if you call by that name being in the company of one you
love.""You would, if you had as little variety as I have.""Tell me one thing, Virginia--you love me, don't you?"asked Talbot, in
whose mind sometimes there rose an unpleasant suspicion that his love
was not returned."Why, of course I do, you foolish man," she said, carelessly."And now,
where are you going to take me?""Where do you want to go, my darling?"To-morrow they play 'The Huguenots.'""I thought you didn't care for music, Virginia?"I want to go because it's fashionable, and I want
to be seen.So, be a good boy, and get some nice seats for to-morrow
evening.""And you'll try to get rich, for my sake?""As soon as you can tell me you have ten thousand dollars, and will
spend half of it on a trip to Europe, I will marry you.""Then I hope to tell you so soon."When Talbot left the house it was with the determination to secure the
sum required by any means, however objectionable.Virginia Conway followed his retreating form with her cool, calculating
glance."I'll give him
two months to raise the money, and if he fails, I think I can captivate
Mr.Cross was a middle-aged grocer, a widower, without children, and
reputed moderately wealthy.Talbot had entered the house, Dan was not far off.Later, he
saw him at the window with Virginia."I suppose that's his young lady," thought Dan.I guess he's
safe for this evening."Stocks took an upward turn, so that Talbot's brokers were willing to
carry them for him longer without an increase of margin.The market
looked so uncertain, however, that he decided to sell, though he only
made himself whole.To escape loss hardly satisfied him, when it was so
essential to make money.He was deeply in love with Virginia Conway, but there was no hope of
obtaining her consent to a marriage unless he could raise money enough
to gratify her desires.He was returning to his boarding-house at a late hour one night, when,
in an unfrequented street, two figures advanced upon him from the
darkness, and, while one seized him by the throat, the other rifled his
pockets.Talbot was not a coward, and having only a few dollars in his
pocket-book, while his watch, luckily, was under repair at Tiffany's, he
submitted quietly to the examination.The pocket-book was opened and its contents eagerly scanned.An exclamation of disgust mingled with profanity followed."Why don't you carry money, like a gentleman?""Ain't you ashamed to carry such a lean wallet as that there?""Really, gentlemen, if I had expected to meet you, I would have provided
myself better," said Talbot, not without a gleam of humor."He's chaffing us Bill," said Mike."You'd better not, if you know what's best for yourself," growled Bill.You ought to have waited till next week, when I'd have
had it for you.""Yes; but they are small, and not worth much."Sandra moved to the kitchen."You've took us in reg'lar!A gent like you ought to have diamond studs,
or a pin, or something of value.""I know it, and I'm sorry I haven't, for your sakes."I look upon you as gentlemen, and treat you
accordingly.In fact, I'm glad I've met with you.""I may be able to put something in your way.""I can't tell you in the street.Is there any quiet place, where we
shall not be disturbed or overheard?""This may be a plant," said Mike, suspiciously."If it is," growled Bill, "you'd better make your will.""I know the risk, and am not afraid.In short, I have a job for you."The men consulted, and finally were led to put confidence in Talbot."We'll hear what you have to say.The three made their way to a dilapidated building on Houston street,
and ascended to the fourth floor.Bill kicked open the door of a room with his foot and strode in.A thin, wretched-looking woman sat in a wooden chair, holding a young
child."Just clear out into the other
room.She meekly obeyed the command of her lord, glancing curiously at Talbot
as she went out.Mike she knew only too well, as one of her husband's
evil companions.The door was closed, but the wife bent her ear to the keyhole and
listened attentively.Suspecting nothing, the conspirators spoke in louder tones than they
were aware of, so that she obtained a pretty clear idea of what was
being planned."Now go ahead," said Bill, throwing himself on the chair his wife had
vacated."We might,'specially if we knowed the combination."Talbot gave the name of his employer and the number of his store."What have you got to do with it?"What are you going to make out of it?"I'll guarantee that you'll find four hundred dollars
there to pay you for your trouble.""If we're caught, it'll be Sing Sing for seven years.""We might do it for five hundred apiece," said Bill.There was a little discussion, but finally this was acceded to.Various
details were discussed, and the men separated."I'm goin' your way," said Mike."All right, thank you, but we'd better separate at the street door."Are you too fine a gentleman to be seen with the likes of me?""Not at all, my friend; but if we were seen together by any of the
police, who know me as book-keeper, it would excite suspicion later."I shouldn't dare to tamper with men like you and Bill.You might find a way to get even with me."said the miserable wife to herself, as she heard through
the keyhole the details of the plan."Bill is getting worse and worse
every day."Here, Nancy, get me something to eat," said Bill, when his visitors had
departed."Yes, Bill, I will get you all there is."The wife brought out from a small closet a slice of bread and a segment
of cheese.said the burly ruffian, turning up his nose."It's all I've got, Bill.""You and your brat have eaten it!"If you will give money, I will provide better."I'll teach you to
complain of me.and he struck the woman two brutal
blows with his fist.One, glancing, struck the child, who began to cry.This further irritated Bill, who, seizing his wife by the shoulders,
thrust her out on the landing."There, stay there with the cursed brat!""I mean to have
one quiet night."The wretched wife crept down stairs, and out into the street, scarcely
knowing what she did.She was not wholly destitute of spirit, and
though she might have forgiven personal injury, felt incensed by the
treatment of her innocent child.she said, pitifully, "must you suffer because your
father is a brute?She sat down on some steps near by; the air was chilly, and she shivered
with the cold, but she tried to shelter her babe as well as she could.She attracted the attention of a boy who was walking slowly by.It was Dan, who had at a distance witnessed Talbot's encounter with the
burglars, and his subsequent friendly companionship with them, and was
trying to ascertain the character of the place which he visited.asked Dan, in a tone of sympathy.[Illustration: "What's the matter with you?"asked Dan, in a tone of
sympathy.Page 148]

"My husband has thrust me out of doors with my poor baby.""I can let you have enough for that.I'll
take you to it, and pay for your lodging, and pay for it in advance."Supported by Dan, the poor woman rose and walked to an humble tavern not
far away."She may know something about Talbot's visit.DAN AS A GOOD SAMARITAN."What made your husband treat you so badly?""Rum has been sinking him lower and lower,
and it's easy to see the end.""You are taking too dark a view of your husband," said Dan, soothingly."He won't go as far as that.""I know him only too well," she said."This very evening he has been
planning a burglary."Dan started, and a sudden suspicion entered his mind."Yes; it is a store on Pearl street."Dan felt that he was on the track of a discovery.He was likely to be
repaid at last for the hours he had spent in detective service.he asked, fixing his eyes intently on the woman."I don't know his name; he is a well-dressed man."Was it a man who came to your rooms this evening?"Here Dan gave a rapid description of
Talbot.He is the book-keeper of the firm."He is to pay a thousand dollars for the job."Bill, I suppose, is your husband?"Mary journeyed to the bedroom.By this time they had reached a small public-house, of humble exterior,
but likely to afford his companion better accommodations than she had at
home.The woman followed him, with the child in her arms.A stout German, who
appeared to be the proprietor of the establishment, was sitting in an
arm-chair, smoking a pipe.asked the German, with a broad grin."No; she is an acquaintance of mine.Her husband has driven her out of
his house in a fit of drunkenness.asked the Dutchman, shrewdly."Fifty cents a night for the lodging."asked the landlord, upon whom the silver
half-dollar produced a visible impression."Yes," said the woman; "my poor baby is tired.""You had better stay here two nights," said Dan."Don't let your husband
know where you are just yet.Here is money to pay for another night's
lodging, and enough to buy food besides.""But for you I should have
had to stay out all night.""Oh, no; some one would have taken you in.""You don't know this neighborhood; the policeman would have found me,
and taken me to the station-house.For myself I care little; but my poor
babe, who is worse than fatherless----" and she burst into tears.Brighter days may be in store," said Dan,
cheerfully."I will come and see you day after to-morrow," said Dan.Our hero must not be awarded too great credit for his generosity.Rogers would willingly defray all expenses connected with
the discovery, and that the money he had advanced to his unfortunate
companion would be repaid.Had it been otherwise, however, his generous
heart would have prompted him to relieve the woman's suffering.Very early the next morning Dan rang the bell at Mr."The master won't be up for an hour," said the servant."Tell him Dan wishes to see him on business of importance.""I don't think he'll see you.He was up late last night," she said."It's very important you make yourself," said Susan, crossly."I _am_ a person of great importance," said Dan, smiling.Rogers
will see me, you'll find."Two minutes later Susan descended the stairs a little bewildered."You're to walk into the parlor," she said.Rogers came down stairs almost
directly in dressing-gown and slippers."The store is to be broken open to-night and the safe robbed!""By two men living in Houston street--at least, one lives there.""Yes, sir; they are employed by Mr.Dan rehearsed the story, already familiar to our readers, combining with
it some further information he had drawn from the woman."I didn't think Talbot capable of this," said Mr."He has been
in our employ for ten years.Mary journeyed to the garden.I don't like to think of his treachery,
but, unhappily, there is no reason to doubt it.John went to the kitchen.Now, Dan, what is your
advice?"Mary travelled to the office."I am afraid my advice wouldn't be worth much, Mr.Rogers," said Dan,
modestly.I am indebted to you for this important
discovery.I won't promise to follow your
advice, but I should like to hear it.""Then, sir, I will ask you a question.Do you want to prevent the
robbery, or to catch the men in the act?""I wish to catch the burglars in the act.""Then, sir, can you stay away from the store to-day?"But how can I take measures to guard
against loss?""No; but Talbot is authorized to sign checks.He will draw money if I am
not at the store."He is to tell the burglars the combination.He will
get it from the janitor.""I will see the janitor, and ask him to give the book-keeper the wrong
word.""I will secretly notify the police, whom he will admit and hide till the
time comes.""Then," continued Dan, flushing with excitement, "we'll wait till the
burglars come, and let them begin work on the safe.While they are at
work, we will nab them.""Yes, sir; I want to be there.""I don't know about that, sir.But if anything is going on to-night, I
want to be in it."Talbot sends me with a large check to the bank,
what shall I do?""He may make off with the money during the day.""I will set another detective to watch him, and have him arrested in
that event.""This is going to be an exciting day," said Dan to himself, as he set
out for the store.TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.As Dan entered the store he noticed that Talbot looked excited and
nervous.Ordinarily the book-keeper would have reprimanded him sharply
for his late arrival, but he was not disposed to be strict this morning."I'm a little late this morning, Mr."Oh, well, you can be excused for once," said Talbot.He wished to disarm suspicion by extra good humor.Besides, he intended
to send Dan to the bank presently for a heavy sum, and thought it best
to be on friendly terms with him.About ten o'clock a messenger entered the store with a note from Mr.It was to this effect:


     "I am feeling rather out of sorts this morning, and shall not come
     to the store.Should you desire to consult me on any subject, send
     a messenger to my house."The only obstacle to
carrying out his plans was the apprehended presence and vigilance of his
employer.About one o'clock he called Dan into the office."Here, Dan," he said, "I want you to go to the bank at once.""Here is a check for twelve thousand dollars--rather a heavy amount--and
you must be very careful not to lose any of it, or to let any one see
that you have so much with you."You may get one hundred dollars in fives and tens, and the remainder in
large bills.""He means to make a big haul," said Dan to himself, as he left the
store."I hope our plans won't miscarry.Rogers to
lose so large a sum."As Dan left the store a man of middle size, who was lounging against a
lamp-post, eyed him sharply.As Dan was turning the corner of the street
he left his post, and, walking rapidly, overtook him."You are in the employ of Barton & Rogers, are you not?""I am a detective, on watch here by order of Mr."He is the book-keeper, is he not?"There is no need of watching till you bring
back the money.Where do you think Talbot will put the money?""In the safe, I think, sir."I believe he will retain the greater part on his
own person.If the men who are to rob the safe got hold of all the money
they would be likely to keep it, and not limit themselves to the sum he
agrees to pay them.""I shall take care to keep Talbot in view.He means to have it understood that all this money has been taken
by the burglars, whereas but a tithe of the sum will be deposited in the
safe.""It seems to me there is a risk of losing the money," he said."Don't be afraid," he said, confidentially."Talbot won't leave the
city.His words inspired confidence, and Dan entered the bank without
misgivings.The check was so large that the bank officials scrutinized it carefully.There was no doubt about its being correct, however."Be very careful, young man," said the disbursing clerk."You've got too
much to lose."Dan deposited one roll of bills in the left inside pocket of his coat,
and the balance in the right pocket, and then buttoned up the coat."I'm a boy of fortune for a short time," he said to himself."I hope
the time will come when I shall have as much money of my own."Dan observed that the detective followed him at a little distance, and
it gave him a feeling of security.Some one might have seen the large
sum of money paid him, and instances had been known where boys in such
circumstances had suddenly been set upon in the open street at midday
and robbed.He felt that he had a friend near at hand who would
interfere in such a case.asked an ill-looking man, suddenly accosting
him."I don't carry one," said Dan, eying the questioner suspiciously."Nor I. I have been very unfortunate.Can't you give me a quarter to buy
me some dinner?""Ask some one else; I'm in a hurry," said Dan, coldly."I'm not as green as you take me for," said Dan to himself.He thought his danger was over, but he was mistaken.Suddenly a large man, with red hair and beard, emerging from Dan knew
not where, laid his hand on his shoulder."Boy," said he, in a fierce undertone, "give me that money you have in
your coat-pocket, or I will brain you.""You forget we are in the public street," said Dan."And you would be--stunned, perhaps killed!""Look here,
boy, I am a desperate man.I know how much money you have with you.Dan looked out of the corner of his eye, to see the detective close at
hand.This gave him courage, for he recognized that the villain was only
speaking the truth, and he did not wish to run any unnecessary risk.He
gave a nod, which brought the detective nearer, and then slipped to one
side, calling:

"Stop thief!"The ruffian made a dash for him, his face distorted with rage, but his
arm was grasped as by an iron vise.exclaimed the detective, and he signaled to
a policeman."You are up to your old tricks again, as I expected.""I have taken nothing," he
added, sullenly.I heard you threatening the boy, unless he gave
up the money in his possession."Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully.Talbot, whose conscience was uneasy, and with good cause, awaited Dan's
arrival very anxiously."No; he was recognized by a policeman, who arrested him as he was on the
point of attacking me."Talbot asked
