Jessica did find it possible to spare a dollar or
so to her father weekly, and there had been a nebulous understanding
that this was to be applied to raiment; but the only change in his
appearance effected by this so far had been a sporadic accession of
startlingly white paper collars.There were other minor disappointments--portions of her plan, so to
speak, which had failed to materialize--but the net result of a month’s
trial was distinctly hopeful.Although most of such work as had come to
her was from the factory-girls, not a few ladies had visited the little
store, and made purchases or given orders.Among these she liked best
of all the one who owned the house; a very friendly old person, with
corkscrew curls and an endless tongue--Miss Tabitha Wilcox.She had
already made two bonnets for her, and the elderly lady had been so
pleasant and talkative that she had half resolved, when next she came
in, to unfold to her the scheme which now lay nearest to her heart.This was nothing less than securing permission to use a long-deserted
and roomy building which stood in the yard, at the back of the one she
occupied, as a sort of evening club for the working-girls of the town.Jessica had never been in this building, but so far as she could see
through the stained and dismantled windows, where the drifts did not
render approach impossible, it had formerly been a dwelling-house, and
later had been used in part as a carpenter’s shop.To get this, and to fit it up simply but comfortably as a place where
the tired factory and sewing girls could come in the evening, to read or
talk or play games if they liked, to merely sit still and rest if they
chose, but in either case to be warm and contented and sheltered from
the streets and the deadly boredom of squalid lodgings, became little by
little her abiding ambition.She had spoken tentatively to some of the
girls about it, and they were all profoundly enthusiastic over the plan.It remained to enlist the more fortunate women whose assistance could
alone make the plan feasible.Jessica had essayed to get at the parson’s
wife, Mrs.Turner; but that lady, after having been extremely cordial,
had unaccountably all at once turned icy cold, and cut the girl dead in
the street.I said “unaccountably,” but Jessica was not at all at a loss
to comprehend the change, and the bitterness of the revelation had
thrown her into an unusually deep fit of depression.For a time it had
seemed to her hopeless to try to find another confidante in that class
which despised and shrank from her.Then Miss Tabitha’s pleasant words
and transparent good-heartedness had lifted her out of her despondency,
and she was almost resolved now to approach her on the subject of the
house iii the back yard.CHAPTER XVI.--A GRACIOUS FRIEND RAISED UP.The opportunity which Jessica sought came with unlooked-for
promptness--in fact, before she had quite resolved what to ask for, and
how best to prefer her request.It was a warm, sunny winter morning, with an atmosphere which suggested
the languor of May rather than the eagerness of early spring, and
which was already in these few matutinal hours playing havoc with the
snowbanks.The effects of the thaw were unpleasantly visible on the
sidewalks, where deep puddles were forming as the drifts melted away,
and the back yard was one large expanse of treacherous slush.Jessica
had hoped that her father would come, in order that he might cut away
the ice and snow in front, and thus drain the walk for passers-by.But
as the mild morning air rendered it unnecessary to seek the comfort of a
seat by the stove, Ben preferred to lounge about on the outskirts of the
hay-market, exchanging indolent jokes with kindred idlers, and vaguely
enjoying the sunshine.Samantha, however, chose this forenoon for her first visit to the
milliner’s shop, and showed a disposition to make herself very much at
home.The fact that encouragement was plainly wanting did not in any way
abash her.Lucinda told her flatly that she had only come to see what
she could pick up, and charged her to her face with having instigated
her friends to offer them annoyance and affront.Samantha denied both
imputations with fervor, the while she tried on before the mirror a
bronze-velvet toque with sage-green feathers.“I don’t know that I ever quite believed that of you, Samantha,” said
Jessica, turning from her dismayed contemplation of the water on the
sidewalk.“And if you really want to be friendly, why, you are welcome
to come here.But I have heard of things you have said that were not at
all nice.”

“All lies!” remarked Samantha, studying the effect of the hat as nearly
in a profile view as she could manage with a single glass.“You can’t
believe a word you hear here in Thessaly.Wouldn’t this go better if
there was some yellow put in there, close by the feathers?”

“I didn’t want to believe it,” said Jessica.“I’ve never done you any
harm, and never wished anything but well by you, and I couldn’t see why
you should want to injure me.”

“Don’t I tell you they lied?” responded Samantha, affably.“‘Cindy,
here, is always blackguarding me.You know you always did,” she added,
in passing comment upon Lucinda’s indignant snort, “but I don’t bear no
malice.I suppose a hat like this comes pretty
high, don’t it?”

As she spoke, a sleigh was driven up with some difficulty through the
yielding snowbanks, and stopped close to the sidewalk in front of the
shop.It was by far the most distinguished-looking sleigh Jessica had
seen in Thessaly.The driver on the front seat bore a cockade proudly
in his high hat, and the horses he controlled were superbly matched
creatures, with glossy silver-mounted harness, and with tails neatly
braided and tied up in ribbons for protection from the slush.A costly
silver-fox wrap depended over the back of the cutter, and a robe of some
darker but equally sumptuous fur enfolded the two ladies who sat in the
second seat.Jessica was glad that so splendid an equipage should have drawn up
at her door, with a new-born commercial instinct, even before she
recognized either occupant of the sleigh.“That’s Kate Minster,” said Samantha, still with the hat of her dreams
on her head, “the handsomest girl in Thessaly, and the richest, and the
stuck-up-edest.but you’re in luck!”

Jessica did not know much about the Minsters, but she now saw that the
other lady, who was already preparing to descend, and stood poised on
the rail of the cutter looking timorously at the water on the walk, was
no other than Miss Tabitha Wilcox.“I will give you that hat you’ve got on,” she said in a hurried tone,
“if you’ll go with Lucinda clear back into the kitchen and shut both
doors tight after you, and stay there till I call you.”

At this considerable sacrifice the store was cleared for the reception
of these visitors--the most important who had as yet crossed its
threshold.Miss Tabitha did not offer to introduce her companion--whom Jessica
noted furtively as a tall, stately, dark girl, with a wonderfully
handsome face, who stood silently by the little showcase and was wrapped
in furs worth the whole stock of millinery she confronted--but bustled
about the store, while she plunged into the middle of an explanation
about hats she had had, hats she thought of having, and hats she might
have had, of which the milliner understood not a word.It was not,
indeed, essential that she should, for presently Tabitha stopped short,
looked about her triumphantly, and asked:

“Now, wasn’t I right?Aren’t they the nicest in town?”

The tall girl smiled, and inclined her dignified head.“They are very pretty, indeed,” she answered, and Jessica remarked to
herself what a soft, rich voice it was, that made even those commonplace
words so delightful to the ear.“I don’t know that we wanted to look at anything in particular,” rattled
on Miss Tabitha.“We were driving by” (O Tabitha!as if Miss Kate had
not commanded this excursion for no other purpose than this visit!)“and
I just thought we’d drop in, for I’ve been telling Miss Minster about
what excellent taste you had.”

A momentary pause ensued, and then Jessica, conscious of blushes and
confusion, made bold to unburden her mind of its plan.“I wanted to speak to you,” she said, falteringly at first, but with a
resolution to have it all out, “about that vacant house in the back yard
here.It looks as if it had been a carpenter’s shop last, and it seems
in very bad repair.”

“I suppose it might as well come down,” broke in Miss Wilcox.“Still,
I--”

“Oh, no!that wasn’t what I meant!” protested Jessica.“I--I wanted
to propose something about it to you.If--if you will be seated, I can
explain what I meant.”

The two ladies took chairs, but with a palpable accession of reserve on
their countenances.The girl went on to explain:

“To begin with, the factory-girls and sewing-girls here spend too much
time on the streets--I suppose it is so everywhere--the girls who were
thrown out when the match factory shut down, particularly.Then they get into trouble, or at any
rate they learn slangy talk and coarse ways.But you can’t blame them,
for their homes, when they have any, are not pleasant places, and where
they hire rooms it is almost worse still.Now, I’ve been thinking of
something--or, rather, it isn’t my own idea, but I’ll speak about that
later on.This is the idea: I have come to know a good many of the best
of these girls--perhaps you would think they were the worst, too, but
they’re not--and I know they would be glad of some good place where they
could spend their evenings, especially in the winter, where it would be
cosey and warm, and they could read or talk, or bring their own sewing
for themselves, and amuse themselves as they liked.And I had thought
that perhaps that old house could be fixed up so as to serve, and they
could come through the shop here after tea, and so I could keep track of
them, don’t you see?”

“I don’t quite think I do,” said Miss Tabitha, with distinct
disapprobation.The plan had seemed so excellent to her,
and yet it was to be frowned down.“Perhaps I haven’t made it clear to you,” she ventured to say.“Oh, yes, you have,” replied Miss Tabitha.“I don’t mind pulling the
house down, but to make it a rendezvous for all the tag-rag and bob-tail
in town--I simply couldn’t think of it!These houses along here have
seen their best days, perhaps, but they’ve all been respectable,
always!”

“I don’t think myself that you have quite grasped Miss Lawton’s
meaning.”

It was the low, full, quiet voice of the beautiful fur-clad lady that
spoke, and Jessica looked at her with tears of anxious gratitude in her
eyes.Miss Minster seemed to avoid returning the glance, but went on in the
same even, musical tone:

“It appears to me that there might be a great deal of much-needed
good done in just that way, Tabitha.The young lady says--I think I
understood her to say--that she had talked with some of these girls, and
that that is what they would like.It seems to me only common-sense, if
you want to help people, to help them in their own way, and not insist,
instead, that it shall be in your way--which really is no help at all!”

“Nobody can say, I hope, that I have ever declined to extend a helping
hand to anybody who showed a proper spirit,” said Miss Wilcox, with
dignity, putting up her chin.“I know that, ma’am,” pleaded Jessica.“That is why I felt sure you
would like my plan.I ought to tell you--it isn’t quite my plan.Fairchild, at Tecumseh, who used to teach the Burfield school, who
suggested it.She is a very, very good woman.”

“And I think it is a very, very good idea,” said Miss Kate, speaking for
the first time directly to Jessica.“Of course, there would have to be
safeguards.”

“You have no conception what a rough lot they are,” said Miss Tabitha,
in more subdued protest.“There is no telling who they would bring here,
or what they wouldn’t do.”

“Indeed, I am sure all that could be taken care of,” urged Jessica,
taking fresh courage, and speaking now to both her visitors.“Only those
whom I knew to mean well by the undertaking should be made members, and
they would agree to very strict rules, I feel certain.”

“Why, child alive!where would you get the money for it, even if it
could be done otherwise?” Miss Tabitha wagged her curls conclusively,
but her smile was not unkind.It would not be exact to say that Jessica had not considered this, but,
as it was now presented, it seemed like a new proposition.Miss Wilcox did not wait over long for a reply, but proceeded to point
out, in a large and exhaustive way, the financial impossibilities of the
plan.Jessica had neither heart nor words for an interruption, and Miss
Kate listened in an absent-minded manner, her eyes on the plumes and
velvets in the showcase.The interruption did come in a curiously unexpected fashion.A loud
stamping of wet feet was heard on the step outside; then the door from
the street was opened.The vehemence of the call-bell’s clamor seemed to
dismay the visitor, or perhaps it was the presence of the ladies.At
all events, he took off his hat, as if it had been a parlor instead of a
shop, and made an awkward inclusive bow, reaching one hand back for the
latch, as if minded to beat a retreat.Tracy!” exclaimed Tabitha, rising from her chair.Reuben advanced now and shook hands with both her and Jessica.For an
instant the silence threatened to be embarrassing, and it was not wholly
relieved when Tabitha presented him to Miss Minster, and that young lady
bowed formally without moving in her chair.But the lawyer could not
suspect the disagreeable thoughts which were chasing one another behind
these two unruffled and ladylike fronts, and it was evident enough that
his coming was welcome to the mistress of the little shop.“I have wanted to look in upon you before,” he said to Jessica, “and
I am ashamed to think that I haven’t done so.I have been very much
occupied with other matters.It doesn’t excuse me to myself, but it may
to you.”

“Oh, certainly, Mr.Tracy,” Jessica answered, and then realized how
miserably inadequate the words were.“It’s very kind of you to come at
all,” she added.Tabitha shot a swift glance at her companion, and the two ladies rose,
as by some automatic mechanical device, absolutely together.“We must be going, Miss Lawton,” said the old maid, primly.A woman’s intuition told Jessica that something had gone wrong.If she
did not entirely guess the nature of the trouble, it became clear enough
on the instant to her that these ladies misinterpreted Reuben’s visit.Perhaps they did not like him--or perhaps--She stepped toward them and
spoke eagerly, before she had followed out this second hypothesis in her
mind.“If you have a moment’s time to spare,” she pleaded, “I _wish_ you would
let me explain to Mr.Tracy the plan I have talked over with you.He was
my school-teacher; he is my oldest friend--the only friend I had when
I was--a--a girl, and I haven’t seen him before since the day I arrived
home here.I should _so_ much like to have you hear his opinion.The
lady I spoke of--Mrs.Perhaps he knows
of the plan already from her.”

Reuben did not know of the plan, and the two ladies consented to take
seats again while it should be explained to him.Tabitha assumed a
distant and uneasy expression of countenance, and looked straight ahead
of her out through the glass door until the necessity for relief by
conversation swelled up within her to bursting point; for Kate had
rather flippantly deserted her, and so far from listening with haughty
reserve under protest, had actually joined in the talk, and taken up the
thread of Jessica’s stumbling explanation.The three young people seemed to get on extremely well together.Reuben
fired up with enthusiasm at the first mention of the plan, and showed
so plainly the sincerity of his liking for it that Miss Minster felt
herself, too, all aglow with zeal.Thus taken up by friendly hands, the
project grew apace, and took on form and shape like Aladdin’s palace.Tabitha listened with a swiftly mounting impatience of her speechless
condition, and a great sickening of the task of watching the cockade of
the coachman outside, which she had imposed upon herself, as the talk
went on.She heard Reuben say that he would gladly raise a subscription
for the work; she heard Kate ask to be allowed to head the list with
whatever sum he thought best, and then to close the list with whatever
additional sum was needed to make good the total amount required;
she heard Jessica, overcome with delight, stammer out thanks for this
unlooked-for adoption and endowment of her poor little plan, and then
she could stand it no longer.“Have you quite settled what you will do with my house?” she asked,
still keeping her face toward the door.“There are some other places
along here belonging to me--that is, they always have up to now--but of
course if you have plans about them, too, just tell me, and--”

“Don’t be absurd, Tabitha,” said Miss Minster, rising from her chair as
she spoke.“Of course we took your assent for granted from the start.I
believe, candidly, that you are more enthusiastic about it this moment
than even we are.”

Reuben thought that the old lady dissembled her enthusiasm skilfully,
but at least she offered no dissent.A few words more were exchanged,
the lawyer promising again his aid, and Miss Minster insisting that she
herself wanted the task of drawing up, in all its details, the working
plan for the new institution, and, on second thoughts, would prefer to
pay for it all herself.“I have been simply famishing for something to do all these years,”
 she said, in smiling confidence, to Tracy, “and here it is at last.You
can’t guess how happy I shall be in mapping out the whole thing--rules
and amusements and the arrangements of the rooms and the furnishing,
and--everything.”

Perhaps Jessicas face expressed too plainly the thought that this
bantling of hers, which had been so munificently adopted, bade fair to
be taken away from her altogether, for Miss Minster added: “Of course,
when the sketch is fairly well completed, I will show it to _you_, and
we will advise together,” and Jessica smiled again.When the two ladies were seated again in the sleigh, and the horses had
pranced their way through the wet snow up to the beaten track once more,
Miss Tabitha said:

“I never knew a girl to run on so in all my born days.Here you are,
seeing these two people for the very first time half an hour ago, and
you’ve tied yourself up to goodness only knows what.One would think
you’d known them all your life, the way you said ditto to every random
thing that popped into their heads.And a pretty penny they’ll make
it cost you, too!And what will your mother say?” Miss Minster smiled
good-naturedly, and patted her companion’s gloved hand with her own.“Never you worry, Tabitha,” she said, softly.“Don’t talk, please, for a
minute.I want to think.”

It was a very long minute.The young heiress spent it in gazing
abstractedly at the buttons on the coachman’s back, and the rapt
expression on her face seemed to tell more of a pleasant day-dream than
of serious mental travail.Miss Wilcox was accustomed to these moods
which called for silence, and offered no protest.At last Kate spoke, with a tone of affectionate command.“When we get to
the house I will give you a book to read, and I want you to finish every
word of it before you begin anything else.It is called ‘All Sorts and
Conditions of Men,’ and it tells how a lovely girl with whole millions
of pounds did good in England, and I was thinking of it all the while we
sat there in the shop.Only the mortification of it is, that in the
book the rich girl originated the idea herself, whereas I had to have
it hammered into my head by--by others.But you must read the book, and
hurry with it, because--or no: I will get another copy to read again
myself.And I will buy other copies; one for _her_ and one _for him_,
and one--”

She lapsed suddenly into silence again.The disparity between the
stupendous dream out of which the People’s Palace for East London’s
mighty hive of millions has been evolved, and the humble project of a
sitting-room or two for the factory-girls of a village, rose before her
vision, and had the effect of making her momentarily ridiculous in her
own eyes.The familiarity, too, with which she had labelled these two
strangers, this lawyer and this milliner, in her own thoughts, as “him”
 and “her,” jarred just a little upon her maidenly consciousness.Perhaps
she had rushed to embrace their scheme with too much avidity.It was
generally her fault to be over-impetuous.“Of course, what we can do here”--she began with less eagerness of tone,
thinking aloud rather than addressing Tabitha--“must at best be on
a very small scale.You must not be frightened by the book, where
everything is done with fairy prodigality, and the lowest figures dealt
with are hundreds of thousands.I only want you to read it that you may
catch the spirit of it, and so understand how I feel.And you needn’t
worry about my wasting money, or doing anything foolish, you dear, timid
old soul!”

Miss Wilcox, in her revolving mental processes, had somehow veered
around to an attitude of moderate sympathy with the project, the while
she listened to these words.“I’m sure you won’t, my dear,” she replied,
quite sweetly.“And I daresay there can really be a great deal of good
done, only, of course, it will have to be gone at cautiously and by
degrees.And we must let old Runkle do the papering and whitewashing;
don’t forget that.He’s had ever so much sickness in his family all the
winter, and work is so slack.”

“Do you know, I like your Mr.Tracy!” was Kate’s irrelevant reply.She
made it musingly, as if the idea were new to her mind.“You can see for yourself there couldn’t have been anything at all
in that spiteful Sarah Cheese-borough’s talk about him and her,” said
Tabitha, who now felt herself to have been all along the champion of
this injured couple.“How on earth a respectable woman can invent such
slanders beats my comprehension.”

Kate Minster laughed merrily aloud.“It’s lucky you weren’t made of
pancake batter, Tabitha,” she said with mock gravity; “for, if you had
been, you never could have stood this being stirred both ways.You would
have turned heavy and been spoiled.”

“Instead of which I live to spoil other people, eh?” purred the
gratified old lady, shaking her curls with affectionate pride.“If we weren’t out in the street, I believe I should kiss you, Tabitha,”
 said the girl.“You can’t begin to imagine how delightfully you have
behaved today!”




CHAPTER XVII.--TRACY HEARS STRANGE THINGS.REUBEN’S first impulse, when he found himself alone in the little shop
with his former pupil, was to say good-by and get out as soon as he
could.To the best of his recollection, he had never before been in a
store consecrated entirely to the fashions and finery of the opposite
sex, and he was oppressed by a sense of being an intruder upon an
exclusively feminine domain.The young girl, too, whom he had been
thinking of all this while as an unfortunate child whom he must watch
over and be good to, stood revealed before him as a self-controlled and
sophisticated woman, only a few years younger than himself in actual
age, and much wiser than himself in the matters of head-gear and
textures and colors which belonged to this place.He could have talked
freely to her in his law-office, with his familiar accessories of papers
and books about him.A background of bonnets was disconcerting.“How beautiful she is!” were Jessica’s first words, and they pleasurably
startled the lawyer from his embarrassed revery.“She is, indeed,” he answered, and somehow found himself hoping that the
conversation would cling to this subject a good while.“I had never met
her before, as you saw, but of course I have known her by sight a long
time.”

“I don’t think I ever saw her before to-day,” said Jessica.“How
wonderful it seems that she should have come, and then that you came,
too, and that you both should like the plan, and take it up so, and make
a success of it right at the start.”

Reuben smiled.“In your eagerness to keep up with the procession I fear
you are getting ahead of the band,” he said.“I wouldn’t quite call it
a success, at present.But, no doubt, it’s a great thing to have her
enlisted in it.I’m glad she likes you; her friendship will make all the
difference in the world to you, here in Thessaly.”

The girl did not immediately answer, and Tracy, looking at her as she
walked across to the showcase, was surprised to catch the glisten of
tears on her eyelashes.He had no idea what to say, but waited in pained
puzzlement for her to speak.“‘Friendship’ is not quite the word,” she said at last, looking up at
him and smiling with mournful softness through her tears.“I shall be
glad if she likes me--as you say, it will be a great thing if she helps
me--but we shall hardly be ‘friends,’ you know._She_ would never call
it that.oh, no!”

Her voice trembled audibly over these last words, and she began
hurriedly to re-arrange some of the articles in the showcase, with the
obvious design of masking her emotion.“You can do yourself no greater harm than by exaggerating that kind of
notion, my girl,” said Reuben Tracy, in his old gravely kind voice.“You
would put thoughts into her head that way which she had never dreamt of
otherwise; that is, if she weren’t a good and sensible person.Why, she
is a woman like yourself--”

“Oh, no, no!_Not_ like _me!_”

Tracy was infinitely touched by the pathos of this deprecating wail,
but he went on as if he had not heard it: “A woman like yourself, with
a heart turned in mercy and charity toward other women who are not so
strong to help themselves.Why on earth should you vex your soul with
fears that she will be unkind to you, when she showed you as plain
as the noonday sun her desire _to_ be kind?You mustn’t yield to such
fancies.”

“Kind, yes!But you don’t understand--you _can’t_ understand.I
shouldn’t have spoken as I did.It was a mere question of a word,
anyway.”

Jessica smiled again, to show that, though the tears were still there,
the grief behind them was to be regarded as gone, and added, “Yes, she
was kindness itself.”

“She is very rich in her own right, I believe, and if her interest
in your project is genuine--that is, of the kind that lasts--you will
hardly need any other assistance.Of course you must allow for the
chance of her dropping the idea as suddenly as she picked it up.Rich
women--rich people generally, for that matter--are often flighty about
such things.‘Put not your trust in princes,’ serves as a warning about
millionnaires as well as monarchs.The rest of us are forced to be
more or less continuous in what we think and do.We have to keep at the
things we’ve started, because a waste of time would be serious to us.We have to keep the friends and associates we’ve got, because others
are not to be had for the asking.But these favored people are more
free--their time doesn’t matter, and they can find new sets of friends
ready made whenever they weary of the others.Still, let us hope she
will be steadfast.She has a strong face, at all events.”

The girl had listened to this substantial dissertation with more or less
comprehension, but with unbounded respect.Anything that Reuben Tracy
said she felt must be good.Besides, his conclusion jumped with her
hopes.“I’m not afraid of her losing interest in the thing itself,” she
answered.Mary went to the garden.“What worries me is--or, no--” She stopped herself with a
smile, and made haste to add, “I forgot.Tell me about her.”

“She owns a share of the works, I think.Daniel moved to the bathroom.I don’t know how big a share,
or, in fact, much else about her.I’ve heard my partner, Horace Boyce,
talk lately a good deal--”

Tracy did not finish his sentence, for Jessica had sunk suddenly into
the chair behind the case, and was staring at him over the glass-bound
row of bonnets with wide-open, startled eyes.“_Your partner!_ Yours, did you say?That man?”

Her tone and manner very much surprised Reuben.Sandra went to the bedroom.“Why, yes, he’s my
partner,” he said, slowly and in wonderment.“Didn’t you know that?We’ve been together since December.”

She shook her head, and murmured something hastily about having been
very busy, and being cooped up on a back street.This did not explain her agitation, which more and more puzzled Reuben
as he thought upon it.He stood looking down upon her where she sat, and
noted that her face, though it was turned away from him now, was both
pale and excited.“Do you know him?” he asked finally.She shook her head again, and the lawyer fancied she was biting her
lips.He did not know well what else to say, and was speculating whether
it would not be best to say nothing, when all at once she burst forth
vehemently.“I _won’t_ lie to you!” she exclaimed.“I _did_ know him, very much to
my cost.Don’t you trust him, I say!He’s
not fit to be with you.Oh, my God!--_don’t_ I know Horace Boyce!”

Reuben stood silent, still looking down gravely into the girl’s flashing
eyes.What she had said annoyed and disturbed him, but what he thought
chiefly about was how to avoid bringing on an explanation which must
wound and humiliate her feelings.It was clear enough what she meant,
and he compassionately hoped she would not feel it necessary to add
anything.Above all things he felt that he wanted to spare her pain.“I understand,” he said at last, as the frankest way out of the dilemma.“Don’t say any more.” He pondered for a minute or so upon the propriety
of not saying anything more himself, and then with decision offered her
his hand across the showcase, and held hers in his expansive clasp with
what he took to be fatherly sympathy, as he said:

“I must go now.And I shall hear from you soon about the
project?” He smiled to reassure her, and added, still holding her hand,
“Now, don’t you let worry come inside these doors at all.You have made
a famous start, and everything will go well, believe me.”

Then he went out, and the shrill clamor of the bell hung to jangle
when the door was opened woke Jessica from her day-dream, just as the
sunbeams had begun to drive away the night.She rose with a start, and walked to the door to follow his
retiring figure through the glass.She stood there, lost in another
revery--vague, languorous, half-bright, half-hideous--until the door
from the back room was opened, and Samantha’s sharp voice fell on the
silence of the little shop.“I ain’t going to set in that poky old kitchen any longer for all
the bonnets in your whole place,” she remarked, with determination,
advancing to the mirror with the toque on her truculently poised head.“Besides, you said you’d call us when they were all gone.”

Lucinda stole up to her sister-employer, and murmured in a side-long
whisper: “I couldn’t keep her from listening a little.She heard what you said about that Boyce chap.”

The tidings angered Jessica even more than they alarmed her.With an
impulse equally illogical and natural, she frowned at Samantha, and
stiffened her fingers claw-wise, with a distinct itching to tear that
arrangement of bronze velvet and sage-green feathers from her perfidious
sister’s head.Curiously enough, it was the usually aggressive Lucinda who counselled
prudence.“If I was you, I’d ask her to stay to dinner,” she said,
in the same furtive undertone.“I’ve been talking to her, and I guess
she’ll be all right if we make it kind o’ pleasant for her when she
comes.But if you rub her the wrong way, she’ll scratch.”

Samantha was asked to dinner, and stayed, and later, being offered her
choice of three hat-pins with heads of ornamented jet, took two.*****

Reuben walked slowly back to the office, and then sat through a solitary
meal at a side-table in the Dearborn House dining-room, although his
customary seat was at the long table down the centre, in order that he
might think over what he had heard.It is not clear that the isolated fact disclosed to him in the
milliner’s shop would, in itself, have been sufficient to awaken in his
mind any serious distrust of his partner.As the sexes have different
trainings and different spheres, so they have different standards.Men
set up the bars, for instance, against a brother who cheats at cards, or
divulges what he has heard in his club, or borrows money which he cannot
repay, or pockets cigars at feasts when he does not himself smoke.But
their courts of ethics do not exercise jurisdiction over sentimental or
sexual offences, as a rule.These the male instinct vaguely refers to
some other tribunal, which may or may not be in session somewhere else.And this male instinct is not necessarily co-existent with immoral
tendencies, or blunted sensibilities, or even indifference: it is the
man’s way of looking at it--just as it is his way to cross a muddy
street on his toes, while his sisters perform the same feat on their
heels.Reuben Tracy was a good man, and one with keen aspirations toward
honorable and ennobling things; but still he was a man, and it may
be that this discovery, standing by itself, would not seriously have
affected his opinion of Horace.In an indefinite kind of way, he was conscious of being less attracted
by the wit and sparkling smalltalk of Horace than he had been at first.Somehow, the young man seemed to have exhausted his store; he began to
repeat himself, as if he had already made the circuit of the small ring
around which his mind travelled.Reuben confronted a suspicion that the
Boyce soil was shallow.Mary went back to the kitchen.This might not be necessarily an evil thing, he said to himself.Lawyers
quite often achieved notable successes before juries, who were not
deep or well-grounded men.Horace was versatile, and versatility was
a quality which Reuben distinctly lacked.From that point of view the
combination ought, therefore, to be of value.Versatility of that variety was not so
admirable.Reuben could count
on his fingers now six separate falsehoods that his partner had already
told him.They happened not to be upon vital or even important subjects,
but that did not render them the more palatable.He knew from other sources
that Horace had been intrusted with the papers left to Mr.Clarke’s
executors.The young man had taken them to his father’s house, and had
never mentioned so much as a syllable about them to his partner.No
doubt, Horace felt that he ought to have this as his personal business,
and upon the precedent Reuben himself had set with the railroad work,
this was fair enough.But there was something underhanded in his secrecy
about the matter.Reuben’s thoughts from this drifted to the Minsters themselves, and
centred reverently upon the luminous figure of that elder daughter
whom he had met an hour before.He did not dwell much upon her
beauty--perhaps he was a trifle dull about such things--but her
graciousness, her sweet interest in the charity, her womanly commingling
of softness and enthusiasm, seemed to shine about him as he mused.Thessaly unconsciously assumed a brighter and more wholesome aspect,
with much less need of reform than before, in his mind’s eye, now that
he thought of it as her home.The prosperous and respected lawyer was still a country boy
in his unformed speculations as to what that home might be like.The
Minster house was the most splendid mansion in Dearborn County, it was
said, but his experience with mansions was small.A hundred times it had
been said to him that he could go anywhere if he liked, and he gave the
statement credence enough.But somehow it happened that he had not gone.To “be in society,” as the phrase went, had not seemed important to him.Now, almost for the first time, he found himself regretting this.Then
he smiled somewhat scowlingly at his plate as the vagrant reflection
came up that his partner contributed social status as well as
versatility and mendacity to the outfit of the firm.Horace Boyce had a
swallowtail coat, and visited at the Minsters’.The reflection was not
altogether grateful to him.Reuben rose from the table, and stood for a few moments by the window
overlooking the veranda and the side street.The sunny warmth of the
thawing noon-day had made it possible to have the window open, and the
sound of voices close at hand showed that there were people already
anticipating pneumonia and the springtime by sitting on the porch
outside.These voices conveyed no distinct impression at first to Reuben’s mind,
busy as he was with his own reflections.But all at once there was a
scraping of feet and chair-legs on the floor, signifying that the party
had risen, and then he heard two remarks which made a sharp appeal to
his attention and interest.The first voice said: “Mind, I’m not going to let you put me into a
hole.What I do, I do only when it has been proved to me to be to my
own interest, and not at all because I’m afraid of you.Understand that
clearly!”

The other voice replied: “All that you need be afraid of is that you
will kick over your own bucket of milk.You’ve got the whole game in
your hands, if you only listen to me and don’t play it like a fool.Shall we go up to your house and put the thing into shape?We can be alone there.”

The voices ceased, and there was a sound of footsteps descending from
the porch to the sidewalk.The two men passed before the window,
ducking their heads for protection against the water dripping from the
overflowed eaves on the roof of the veranda, and thus missing sight of
the man who had overheard them.Reuben had known at once by the sound of the voice that the first
speaker was Horace Boyce.He recognized his companion now as Schuyler
Tenney, and the sight startled him.Just why it should have done so, he could not have explained.He had
seen this Schuyler Tenney almost every day for a good many years,
putting them all together, and had never before been troubled, much less
alarmed, by the spectacle.But coming now upon what Jessica had
told him, and what his own thoughts had evolved, and what he had
inadvertently overheard, the figure of the rising hardware merchant
loomed darkly in his perturbed fancy as an evil and threatening thing.A rustic client with a grievance sought Tracy out in the seclusion
of the dining-room, and dragged him back to his office and into the
intricacies of the law of trespass; but though he did his best to listen
and understand, the farmer went away feeling that his lawyer was a
considerably overrated man.For, strive as he might, Reuben could not get the sound of those words,
“you’ve got the whole game in your hands,” out of his ears, or restrain
his mind from wearying itself with the anxious puzzle of guessing what
that game could be.CHAPTER XVIII.--A SIMPLE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.Schuyler Tenney had never before been afforded an opportunity of
studying a young gentleman of fashion and culture in the intimacy of
his private apartments, and he looked about Horace’s room with lively
curiosity and interest, when the two conspirators had entered the
General’s house, gone up-stairs, and shut doors behind them.“It looks like a ninety-nine-cent store, for all the world,” was his
comment when he had examined the bric-à-brac on the walls and mantels,
“hefted” a bronze trifle or two on the table, and taken a comprehensive
survey of the furniture and hangings.“It’s rather bare than otherwise,” said Horace, carelessly.“I got
a tolerably decent lot of traps together when I had rooms in Jermyn
Street, but I had to let most of them go when I pulled up stakes to come
home.”

“German Street?I suppose that is in Germany?”

“No--London.”

“Oh!Sold ’em because you got hard up?”

“Not at all.But this damned tariff of yours--or ours--makes it cost too
much to bring decent things over here.”

“Protection to American industry, my boy,” said Mr.“We
couldn’t get on a fortnight without it.Just think what--”

“Oh, hang it all, man!We didn’t come here to talk tariff!” Horace broke
in, with a smile which was half annoyance.“No, that’s so,” assented Mr.Tenney, settling himself in the low,
deep-backed easy-chair, and putting the tips of his lean fingers
together.“No, we didn’t, for a fact.” He added, after a moment’s pause:
“I guess I’ll have to rig up a room like this myself, when the thing
comes off.” He smiled icily to himself at the thought.“Meanwhile, let us talk about the ‘thing,’ as you call it.Will you have
a drink?”

“Never touch it,” said Mr.Tenney, and he looked curiously on while
Horace poured out some brandy, and then opened a bottle of soda-water to
go with it.He was particularly impressed by the little wire frame-work
stand made to hold the round-bottomed bottle, and asked its cost, and
wondered if they wouldn’t be a good thing to keep in the store.“Now to business!” said Horace, dragging out from under a sofa the black
tin box which held the Minster papers, and throwing back its cover.“I’ve told you pretty well what there is in here.”

Mr.Tenney took from his pocket-book the tabular statement Horace had
made of the Minster property, and smoothed it out over his pointed knee.“It’s a very pretty table,” he said; “no bookkeeper could have done it
better.I know it by heart, but we’ll keep it here in sight while you
proceed.”

“There’s nothing for me to proceed with,” said Horace, lolling back
in his chair in turn.“I want to hear _you!_ Don’t let us waste time.Broadly, what do you propose?”

“Broadly, what does everybody propose?To get for himself what somebody
else has got.It’s every kind of nature, down to
the little chickens just hatched who start to chase the chap with the
worm in his mouth before they’ve fairly got their tails out of the
shell.”

“You ought to write a book, Schuyler,” said Horace, using this
familiar name for the first time: “‘Tenney on Dynamic Sociology’!What particular worm have you got in your
bill’s eye?”

“We are all worms, so the Bible says.I suppose even those scrumptious
ladies there come under that head, like we ordinary mortals.” Mr.Tenney
pointed his agreeable metaphor by touching the paper on his knee with
his joined finger-tips, and showed his small, sharpened teeth in a
momentary smile.“I follow you,” said Horace, tentatively.“Go on!”

“That’s a heap of money that you’ve ciphered out there, on that paper.”

“Yes.True, it isn’t ours, and we’ve got nothing to do with it.Go on!”

“A good deal of it can be ours, if you’ve got the pluck to go in with
me.”

Horace frowned.Sandra went to the bathroom.“Upon my word, Tenney,” he said, impatiently, “what do
you mean?”

“Jest what I said,” was the sententious and collected response.The younger man laughed with an uneasy assumption of scorn.“Is it
a burglary you do me the honor to propose, or only common or garden
robbery?Ought we to manage a little murder in the thing, or what do you
say to arson?Upon my word, man, I believe that you don’t realize that
what you’ve said is an insult!”

“No, I don’t.You’re right there,” said the hardware merchant, in no
wise ruffled.“But I do realize that you come pretty near being the
dod-blamedest fool in Dearborn County.”

“Much obliged for the qualification, I’m sure,” retorted Horace, who
felt the mists of his half-simulated, half-instinctive anger fading away
before the steady breath of the other man’s purpose.Pray go on.”

“There ain’t no question of dishonesty about the thing, not the
slightest.I ain’t that kind of a man!” Horace permitted himself a
shadowy smile, emphasized by a subdued little sniff, which Tenney caught
and was pleased to appear to resent, “Thessaly knows me!” he said, with
an air of pride.“They ain’t a living man--nor a dead one nuther--can
put his finger on me.I’ve lived aboveboard, sir, and owe no man a red
cent, and I defy anybody to so much as whisper a word about my
character.”

“‘Tenney on Faith Justified by Works,’” commented Horace, softly,
smiling as much as he dared, but in a less aggressive manner.“Works--yes!” said the hardware merchant, “the Minster iron-works, in
particular.” He seemed pleased with his little joke, and paused to dwell
upon it in his mind for an instant.Then he went on, sitting upright in
his chair now, and displaying a new earnestness:

“Dishonesty is wrong, and it is foolish.It gets a man disgraced, and
it gets him in jail.A smart
man can get money in a good many ways without giving anybody a chance
to call him dishonest.I have thought out several plans--some of
them strong at one point, others at another, but all pretty middlin’
good--how to feather our own nests out of this thing.”

“Well?” said Horace, interrogatively.Tenney did not smile any more, and he had done with digressions.“First of all,” he said, with his intent gray eyes fixed on the young
man’s face, “what guarantee have I that you won’t give me away?”

“What guarantee _can_ I give you?” replied Horace, also sitting up.“Perhaps you are right,” said Tenney, thinking in his own swift-working
mind that it would be easy enough to take care of this poor creature
later on.“Well, then, you’ve been appointed Mrs.Minster’s lawyer in
the interest of the Thessaly Manufacturing Company--this company
here marked ‘D,’ in which the family has one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars.”

“I gathered as much.Perhaps you wouldn’t mind telling me what it is all
about.”

“I’m as transparent as plate-glass when I think a man is acting square
with me,” said the hardware merchant.Wendover and
me got hold of a little rolling-mill and nail-works at Cadmus, down on
the Southern Tier, a few years ago.Some silly people had put up the
money for it, and there was a sort of half-crazy inventor fellow running
it.They were making ducks and drakes of the whole thing, and I saw
a chance of getting into the concern--I used to buy a good deal of
hardware from them, and knew how they stood--and I spoke to Wendover,
and so we went in.”

“That means that the other people were put out, I suppose,” commented
Horace.“Well, no; but they kind o’ faded away like.I wouldn’t exactly say they
were put out, but after a while they didn’t seem to be able to stay in.The iron fields
around there had pretty well petered out, and we were way off the main
line of transportation.Business was fair enough; we made a straight ten
per cent, year in and year out, because the thing was managed carefully;
but that was in spite of a lot of drawbacks.So I got a scheme in my
head to move the whole concern up here to Thessaly, and hitch it up with
the Minster iron-works.We could save one dollar a ton, or forty-five
thousand dollars in all, in the mere matter of freight alone, if we
could use up their entire output.I may tell you, I didn’t appear in the
business at all.Minster don’t know to this day that I’m
a kind of partner of hers.It happened that Wendover used to know her
when she was a girl--they both come from down the Hudson somewhere--and
so he worked the thing with her, and we moved over from Cadmus, hook,
line, bob, and sinker, and we’re the Thessaly Manufacturing Company.Do
you see?”

“So far, yes.She and her daughters have one hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars cash in it.What is the rest of the company like?”

“It’s stocked at four hundred thousand dollars.We put in all our plant
and machinery and business and good-will and so on at one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, and then we furnished seventy-five thousand
dollars cash.So we hold two hundred and twenty-five shares to their one
hundred and seventy-five.”

“Who are the ‘we’?”

“Well, Pete Wendover and me are about the only people you’re liable to
meet around the premises, I guess.There are some other names on the
books, but they don’t amount to much.We can wipe them off whenever we
like.”

“I notice that this company has paid no dividends since it was formed.”

“That’s because of the expense of building.And we ain’t got what you
may call fairly to work yet.There is big money in
it.”

“I daresay,” observed Horace.“But, if you will excuse the remark, I
seem to have missed that part of your statement which referred to _my_
making something out of the company.”

The hardware merchant allowed his cold eyes to twinkle for an instant.“You’ll be taken care of,” he said, confidentially.“Don’t fret your
gizzard about _that!_”

Horace smiled.It seemed to be easier to get on with Tenney than he had
thought.“But what am I to do; that is, if I decide to do anything?” he
asked.“I confess I don’t see your scheme.”

“Why, that’s curious,” said the other, with an air of candor.“And you
lawyers have the name of being so ’cute, too!”

“I don’t suppose we see through a stone wall much farther than other
people.Our chief advantage is in being able to recognize that it is a
wall.And this one of yours seems to be as thick and opaque as most, I’m
bound to say.”

“We don’t want you to do anything, just now,” Mr.“Things may turn up in which you can be of assistance, and then we want
to count on you, that’s all.”

This was a far less lucid explanation than Horace had looked for.Tenney
had been so anxious for a confidential talk, and had hinted of such
dazzling secrets, that this was a distinct disappointment.“What did you mean by saying that I had the whole game in my hands?”
 he demanded, not dissembling his annoyance.“Thus far, you haven’t even
dealt me any cards!”

Mr.Tenney lay back in his chair again, and surveyed Horace over his
finger-tips.Mary moved to the bathroom.“There is to be a game, young man, and you’ve been put in
a position to play in it when the time comes.But I should be a
particularly simple kind of goose to tell you about it beforehand; now,
wouldn’t I?”

Thus candidly appealed to, Horace could not but admit that his
companion’s caution was defensible.“Please yourself,” he said.“I daresay you’re right enough.I’ve got the
position, as you say.Perhaps it is through you that it came to me; I’ll
concede that, for argument’s sake.You are not a man who expects people
to act from gratitude alone.Therefore you don’t count upon my doing
things for you in this position, even though you put me there, unless
you first convince me that they will also benefit me.That is clear
enough, isn’t it?When the occasion
arises that you need me, you can tell me what it is, and what I am to
get out of it, and then we’ll talk business.”

Mr.Tenney had not lifted his eyes for a moment from his companion’s
face.Had his own countenance been one on which inner feelings were
easily reflected, it would just now have worn an expression of amused
contempt.“Well, this much I might as well tell you straight off,” he said.“A
part of my notion, if everything goes smoothly, is to have Mrs.Minster
put you into the Thessaly Manufacturing Company as her representative
and to pay you five thousand dollars a year for it, which might be fixed
so as to stand separate from the other work you do for her.Daniel moved to the kitchen.Wendover
can arrange that with her.And then I am counting now on declaring
myself up at the Minster works, and putting in my time up there; so that
your father will be needed again in the store, and it might be so that
I could double his salary, and let him have back say a half interest
in the business, and put him on his feet.I say these things _might_ be
done.I don’t say I’ve settled on them, mind!”

“And you still think it best to keep me in the dark; not to tell me what
it is I’m to do?” Horace leant forward, and asked this question eagerly.“No-o--I’ll tell you this much.Your business will be to say ditto to
whatever me and Wendover say.”

A full minute’s pause ensued, during which Mr.Tenney gravely watched
Horace sip what remained of his drink.Do you go in with us?” he asked, at last.“I’d better think it over,” said Horace.“Give me, say, till
Monday--that’s five days.And of course, if I do say yes, it will
be understood that I am not to be bound to do anything of a shady
character.”

“Certainly; but you needn’t worry about that,” answered Tenney.“Everything will be as straight as a die.There will be nothing but a
simple business transaction.”

“What did you mean by saying that we should take some of the Minster
money away?That had a queer sound.”

“All business consists in getting other people’s money,” said the
hardware merchant, sententiously.“Where do you suppose Steve Minster
got his millions?Didn’t every dollar
pass through some other fellow’s pocket before it reached his?The
only difference was that when it got into his pocket it stuck there.Everybody is looking out to get rich; and when a man succeeds, it only
means that somebody else has got poor.That’s plain common-sense!”

The conversation practically ended here."The mind's a curious thing, isn't it.In the
instant since Miss Page went through that window I've been to Berlin and
back!K. struck a match with his steady hands.Now that the thing had come, he
was glad to face it.In the flare, his quiet profile glowed against the
night."Perhaps my voice took you back to Berlin."Blackness had descended on them again, except
for the dull glow of K.The neighbors next door have a bad habit of sitting just inside the
curtains."Sidney will be back in a moment.I'll talk to you, if you'll
sit still."I've been here--in the city, I mean--for a year.Don't
forget it--Le Moyne.I've got a position in the gas office, clerical.I have reason to think I'm going to be moved
up.That will be twenty, maybe twenty-two."Wilson stirred, but he found no adequate words.Only a part of what K.
said got to him.For a moment he was back in a famous clinic, and this
man across from him--it was not believable!"It's not hard work, and it's safe.If I make a mistake there's no life
hanging on it.Once I made a blunder, a month or two ago.It cost me three dollars out of my own pocket.Wilson's voice showed that he was more than incredulous; he was
profoundly moved.When a year
went by--the Titanic had gone down, and nobody knew but what you were on
it--we gave up.I--in June we put up a tablet for you at the college.I
went down for the--for the services.""Let it stay," said K. quietly."I'm dead as far as the college goes,
anyhow.And, for Heaven's sake,
don't be sorry for me.I'm more contented than I've been for a long
time."The wonder in Wilson's voice was giving way to irritation.Why, good Heavens, man, I did your
operation to-day, and I've been blowing about it ever since."When that
happened I gave up.All a man in our profession has is a certain method,
knowledge--call it what you like,--and faith in himself.I lost my
self-confidence; that's all.For about a year I was
damned sorry for myself."If every surgeon gave up because he lost cases--I've just told you I
did your operation to-day.There was just a chance for the man, and I
took my courage in my hands and tried it.K. rose rather wearily and emptied his pipe over the balcony rail.Pipe in hand, he stood staring out at the ailanthus tree with its crown
of stars.Instead of the Street with its quiet houses, he saw the men
he had known and worked with and taught, his friends who spoke his
language, who had loved him, many of them, gathered about a bronze
tablet set in a wall of the old college; he saw their earnest faces and
grave eyes.He heard--

He heard the soft rustle of Sidney's dress as she came into the little
room behind them.CHAPTER XIII


A few days after Wilson's recognition of K., two most exciting things
happened to Sidney.One was that Christine asked her to be maid of honor
at her wedding.She was accepted, and
given her cap.Because she could not get home that night, and because the little house
had no telephone, she wrote the news to her mother and sent a note to Le
Moyne:

DEAR K.,--I am accepted, and IT is on my head at this minute.I am as
conscious of it as if it were a halo, and as if I had done something to
deserve it, instead of just hoping that someday I shall.I am writing
this on the bureau, so that when I lift my eyes I may see It.I am
afraid just now I am thinking more of the cap than of what it means.Very soon I shall slip down and show it to the ward.I shall go to the door when the night nurse is busy somewhere, and
turn all around and let them see it, without saying a word.You have been very good to me, dear K. It is you who have made possible
this happiness of mine to-night.I am promising myself to be very good,
and not so vain, and to love my enemies--, although I have none now.Miss Harrison has just congratulated me most kindly, and I am sure poor
Joe has both forgiven and forgotten.K. found the note on the hall table when he got home that night, and
carried it upstairs to read.Whatever faint hope he might have had that
her youth would prevent her acceptance he knew now was over.With the
letter in his hand, he sat by his table and looked ahead into the empty
years.But more and more the life of the hospital would engross her.He
surmised, too, very shrewdly, that, had he ever had a hope that she
might come to care for him, his very presence in the little house
militated against him.There was none of the illusion of separation;
he was always there, like Katie.When she opened the door, she called
"Mother" from the hall.If Anna did not answer, she called him, in much
the same voice.He had built a wall of philosophy that had withstood even Wilson's
recognition and protest.But enduring philosophy comes only with time;
and he was young.Now and then all his defenses crumbled before a
passion that, when he dared to face it, shook him by its very strength.And that day all his stoicism went down before Sidney's letter.Its very
frankness and affection hurt--not that he did not want her affection;
but he craved so much more.He threw himself face down on the bed, with
the paper crushed in his hand.Mary travelled to the bedroom.Sidney's letter
