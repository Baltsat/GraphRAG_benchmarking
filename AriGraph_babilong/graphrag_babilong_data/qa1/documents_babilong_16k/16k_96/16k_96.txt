for Mother Bunch than
Agricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her infirmity
had been the cause of that quarrel.Notwithstanding his strength and
resolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how painful
that thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his eyes, and,
holding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, "Forgive my
heedlessness!And he gave her thin, pale cheeks two
hearty kisses.Sandra journeyed to the garden.The poor girl's lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her heart
beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the
table."Come, you forgive me, do you not?"she said, trying to subdue her emotion; "but the recollection
of that quarrel pains me--I was so alarmed on your account; if the crowd
had sided with that man!"said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl's relief, without knowing
it, "I was never so afraid in all my life!""Oh, mother," rejoined Agricola, trying to change a conversation which
had now become disagreeable for the sempstress, "for the wife of a horse
grenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much courage.Oh, my brave
father; I can't believe he is really coming!The very thought turns me
topsy-turvy!""Heaven grant he may come," said Frances, with a sigh.Lord knows, you
have had masses enough said for his return.""Agricola, my child," said Frances, interrupting her son, and shaking her
head sadly, "do not speak in that way.Besides, you are talking of your
father.""Well, I'm in for it this evening.'Tis your turn now; positively, I am
growing stupid, or going crazy.That's the
only word I can get out to-night.You know that, when I do let out on
certain subjects, it is because I can't help it; for I know well the pain
it gives you.""You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.""It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to offend
one's mother; and, with respect to what I said about father's return, I
do not see that we have any cause to doubt it.""But we have not heard from him for four months.""You know, mother, in his letter--that is, in the letter which he
dictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he
told us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,
in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he
expected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,
three or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I
might go and meet him.""True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.""The greater reason why we should wait patiently.But I'll tell you more:
I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back about the
same time.His last letter from America makes me hope so.What pleasure,
mother, should all the family be together!""And that day will soon come, trust me.""Do you remember your father, Agricola?""To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier's shako and
moustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the red ribbon
of his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and the
shining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother?What he must suffer at being separated from us at
his age--sixty and past!my child, my heart breaks, when I think
that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another."Isn't there a room here for you and for him;
and a table for you too?Only, my good mother, since we are talking of
domestic affairs," added the blacksmith, imparting increased tenderness
to his tone, that he might not shock his mother, "when he and Gabriel
come home, you won't want to have any more masses said, and tapers burned
for them, will you?Well, that saving will enable father to have tobacco
to smoke, and his bottle of wine every day.Then, on Sundays, we will
take a nice dinner at the eating-house."Instead of doing so, some one half-opened the door,
and, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the
blacksmith."'Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers," said Agricola; "come in, Daddy,
no ceremony.""Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I should
cover missus's floor with green."It will remind me of the fields I like so much.""Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately."Oh, be easy; what's he to us?""No; I think he's gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can't see him.But that's not it--come, come quickly!It is very important," said the
dyer, with a mysterious look; "and only concerns you.""Go and see, my child," said Frances."Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out."And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.In five minutes Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated--his
eyes glistened with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance
expressed extraordinary happiness and emotion.He stood at the door for a
moment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances's sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
change her son's countenance had undergone."Well, my child--what is it?"Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more
discernment, exclaimed: "Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!"Mother," said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the
sempstress,--"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me
you will be calm."Mother Bunch was
right--you are quite pale."and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her
hands in his--"you must--you do not know,--but--"

The blacksmith could not go on.'What is the matter?--you
terrify me!""Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary," said Agricola, drying
his eyes--"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command
your feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.""Did I not say true, when I said he would come?"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and
emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its
beating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and
assisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a
distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances
changed color more and more."Come, courage, mother," said the blacksmith; "now the shock is over, you
have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father."Oh, I cannot believe it,"
said Frances, bursting into tears."So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will
tell you when you may see him.""He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day."Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.""He--he is--" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to
apprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the
surprise might hurt you.""And now," cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--"he
is there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely
been able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy."And running
to the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband's arms, Frances fell on her knees in
prayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
prayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of
this scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of
respect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did
not dare to fall on his father's neck.He waited with constrained
impatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they
understood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son
expressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who
in the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the
creature for the Creator.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the
kneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at
the thought of Agricola's happiness, withdrew into the most obscure
corner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out
of place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards
her husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn
silence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but
a few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked
up, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete
enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish
and violent agitation."My children," said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the
orphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them
with astonishment, "this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the
daughters of General Simon what I have been to them.""Then, madame, you will treat us as your children," said Rose,
approaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert's wife, more and more
astonished."Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some
difficulty; but I will tell you that by and by."One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as
admiration."Now--for us," cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and
his son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted
only to look in Agricola's face; while he rested his hands on the young
blacksmith's broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his
frank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand
again, exclaiming, "He's a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted
look he has!"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola's happiness; but
she feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his
son were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes
from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything
so winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased
her surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,
Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,
unfortunately, the fire is out," said Frances, She tried to warm the
orphans' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to
the feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to
make herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the
cupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small
pieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few
embers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw
and blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,
presuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did
all this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so
forgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely
occupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its
warmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the
coffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish
Dagobert's wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she
could lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her
notice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.there's Spoil-sport," said Dagobert, letting in his dog; "he
wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too."The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After
having rubbed Dagobert's hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet
Rose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they
took but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood
apart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular
saying, "the friends of our friends are our friends," he went and licked
the hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By
a singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted
her long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent
dog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done
all the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome
flower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so
discreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of
mutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the
realities of life."Poor Frances," said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, "you did
not expect such a pretty surprise!""I am only sorry, my friend," replied Frances, "that the daughters of
General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for
with Agricola's garret--"

"It composes our mansion," interrupted Dagobert; "there are handsomer, it
must be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into
not being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm
and arm, and I'll answer for it he won't walk the more upright and
straight of the two, and find out General Simon's father, at M. Hardy's
factory, to talk about business.""To-morrow," said Agricola to Dagobert, "you will not find at the factory
either M. Hardy or Marshall Simon's father.""What is that you say, my lad?"cried Dagobert, hastily, "the Marshal!""To be sure; since 1830, General Simon's friends have secured him the
title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny."cried Dagobert, with emotion, "but that ought not to surprise
me; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the
least they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my
heart; it makes me jump again."Addressing the sisters, he said: "Do you hear that, my children?You
arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would
hardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little
duchesses!Ah, father Simon must have
been very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his
son again; for it was during the general's absence that his friends
obtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,
for the last letter from India announced his departure."At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes
filled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we
not find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?""Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established
in the south; but we expect them back every day."that's vexing; I relied on seeing the general's father, to
talk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where
to write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his
granddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children," added the
soldier, to Rose and Blanche, "my good wife will give you her bed and you
must put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse
off here than they were on the journey.""You know we shall always be well off with you and madame," said Rose."Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,
since here we are to find our father," added Blanche."That hope gives you patience, I know," said Dagobert, "but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my
children.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,
by any means.But, patience, patience; you'll find Paris not so bad as it
looks.""Besides," said Agricola, "I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in
Paris will change it for you into a golden city.""You are right, Agricola," said Rose, with a smile, "you have, indeed,
guessed us.""Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and
latterly, too, with Gabriel," added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time."Yes," replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,
"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other
things, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,
in his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of
saying'my boy'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my
brave, brave wife!"said Dagobert, with emotion, "you did a good thing,
poor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with
your own.""Don't talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.""You are right; but I'll make you amends for it by and by.'Tis down to
your account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow
morning."cried the blacksmith; "who'll say, after
this, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to
meet him, father?""I'll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if
you expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You'll give me half your room, and
a fine chat we'll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is
accustomed to sleep at the children's door.""Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the
young ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the
cook-shop.""No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.""You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm
you a little, my dear young ladies," said Frances; "unfortunately, I have
nothing else to offer you.""You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to
bed; while they do so, I'll go to my boy's room, and, before Rose and
Blanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give
Agricola a respite."It took the shaking of
the web to decide them to attack.Perhaps the grey colour of the Locust is not sufficiently conspicuous
to attract attention by itself.Then let us try red, the brightest
colour to our retina and probably also to the Spiders'.None of the
game hunted by the Epeirae being clad in scarlet, I make a small bundle
out of red wool, a bait of the size of a Locust.As long as the parcel is stationary, the Spider
is not roused; but, the moment it trembles, stirred by my straw, she
runs up eagerly.There are silly ones who just touch the thing with their legs and,
without further enquiries, swathe it in silk after the manner of the
usual game.They even go so far as to dig their fangs into the bait,
following the rule of the preliminary poisoning.Then and then only the
mistake is recognized and the tricked Spider retires and does not come
back, unless it be long afterwards, when she flings the lumbersome
object out of the web.Like the others, these hasten to the
red-woollen lure, which my straw insidiously keeps moving; they come
from their tent among the leaves as readily as from the centre of the
web; they explore it with their palpi and their legs; but, soon
perceiving that the thing is valueless, they are careful not to spend
their silk on useless bonds.Still, the clever ones, like the silly ones, run even from a distance,
from their leafy ambush.Before recognizing their mistake, they have to hold the object between
their legs and even to nibble at it a little.At a hand's-breadth's distance, the lifeless prey,
unable to shake the web, remains unperceived.Besides, in many cases,
the hunting takes place in the dense darkness of the night, when sight,
even if it were good, would not avail.If the eyes are insufficient guides, even close at hand, how will it be
when the prey has to be spied from afar?In that case, an intelligence
apparatus for long-distance work becomes indispensable.We have no
difficulty in detecting the apparatus.Let us look attentively behind the web of any Epeira with a daytime
hiding-place: we shall see a thread that starts from the centre of the
network, ascends in a slanting line outside the plane of the web and
ends at the ambush where the Spider lurks all day.Except at the
central point, there is no connection between this thread and the rest
of the work, no interweaving with the scaffolding-threads.Free of
impediment, the line runs straight from the centre of the net to the
ambush-tent.The Angular Epeira,
settled high up in the trees, has shown me some as long as eight or
nine feet.There is no doubt that this slanting line is a foot-bridge which allows
the Spider to repair hurriedly to the web, when summoned by urgent
business, and then, when her round is finished, to return to her hut.In fact, it is the road which I see her follow, in going and coming.No; for, if the Epeira had no aim in view but a means
of rapid transit between her tent and the net, the foot-bridge would be
fastened to the upper edge of the web.The journey would be shorter and
the <DW72> less steep.Why, moreover, does this line always start in the centre of the sticky
network and nowhere else?Daniel went to the garden.Because that is the point where the spokes
meet and, therefore, the common centre of vibration.Anything that
moves upon the web sets it shaking.All then that is needed is a thread
issuing from this central point to convey to a distance the news of a
prey struggling in some part or other of the net.The slanting cord,
extending outside the plane of the web, is more than a foot-bridge: it
is, above all, a signalling-apparatus, a telegraph-wire.Caught in the
sticky toils, he plunges about.Forthwith, the Spider issues
impetuously from her hut, comes down the foot-bridge, makes a rush for
the Locust, wraps him up and operates on him according to rule.Soon
after, she hoists him, fastened by a line to her spinneret, and drags
him to her hiding-place, where a long banquet will be held.So far,
nothing new: things happen as usual.I leave the Spider to mind her own affairs for some days before I
interfere with her.I again propose to give her a Locust; but this time
I first cut the signalling-thread with a touch of the scissors, without
shaking any part of the edifice.Complete success: the entangled insect struggles, sets the net
quivering; the Spider, on her side, does not stir, as though heedless
of events.The idea might occur to one that, in this business, the Epeira stays
motionless in her cabin since she is prevented from hurrying down,
because the foot-bridge is broken.Let us undeceive ourselves: for one
road open to her there are a hundred, all ready to bring her to the
place where her presence is now required.The network is fastened to
the branches by a host of lines, all of them very easy to cross.Well,
the Epeira embarks upon none of them, but remains moveless and
self-absorbed.Because her telegraph, being out of order, no longer tells her of
the shaking of the web.The captured prey is too far off for her to see
it; she is all unwitting.A good hour passes, with the Locust still
kicking, the Spider impassive, myself watching.Nevertheless, in the
end, the Epeira wakes up: no longer feeling the signalling-thread,
broken by my scissors, as taut as usual under her legs, she comes to
look into the state of things.The web is reached, without the least
difficulty, by one of the lines of the framework, the first that
offers.The Locust is then perceived and forthwith enswathed, after
which the signalling-thread is remade, taking the place of the one
which I have broken.Along this road the Spider goes home, dragging her
prey behind her.My neighbour, the mighty Angular Epeira, with her telegraph-wire nine
feet long, has even better things in store for me.One morning I find
her web, which is now deserted, almost intact, a proof that the night's
hunting has not been good.With a piece of
game for a bait, I hope to bring her down from her lofty retreat.I entangle in the web a rare morsel, a Dragon-fly, who struggles
desperately and sets the whole net a-shaking.The other, up above,
leaves her lurking-place amid the cypress-foliage, strides swiftly down
along her telegraph-wire, comes to the Dragon-fly, trusses her and at
once climbs home again by the same road, with her prize dangling at her
heels by a thread.The final sacrifice will take place in the quiet of
the leafy sanctuary.A few days later I renew my experiment under the same conditions, but,
this time, I first cut the signalling-thread.In vain I select a large
Dragon-fly, a very restless prisoner; in vain I exert my patience: the
Spider does not come down all day.Her telegraph being broken, she
receives no notice of what is happening nine feet below.The entangled
morsel remains where it lies, not despised, but unknown.At nightfall
the Epeira leaves her cabin, passes over the ruins of her web, finds
the Dragon-fly and eats him on the spot, after which the net is
renewed.The Epeirae, who occupy a distant retreat by day, cannot do without a
private wire that keeps them in permanent communication with the
deserted web.All of them have one, in point of fact, but only when age
comes, age prone to rest and to long slumbers.In their youth, the
Epeirae, who are then very wide awake, know nothing of the art of
telegraphy.Besides, their web, a short-lived work whereof hardly a
trace remains on the morrow, does not allow of this kind of industry.It is no use going to the expense of a signalling-apparatus for a
ruined snare wherein nothing can now be caught.Only the old Spiders,
meditating or dozing in their green tent, are warned from afar, by
telegraph, of what takes place on the web.To save herself from keeping a close watch that would degenerate into
drudgery and to remain alive to events even when resting, with her back
turned on the net, the ambushed Spider always has her foot upon the
telegraph-wire.Of my observations on this subject, let me relate the
following, which will be sufficient for our purpose.An Angular Epeira, with a remarkably fine belly, has spun her web
between two laurustine-shrubs, covering a width of nearly a yard.The
sun beats upon the snare, which is abandoned long before dawn.The
Spider is in her day manor, a resort easily discovered by following the
telegraph-wire.It is a vaulted chamber of dead leaves, joined together
with a few bits of silk.The refuge is deep: the Spider disappears in
it entirely, all but her rounded hind-quarters, which bar the entrance
to her donjon.With her front half plunged into the back of her hut, the Epeira
certainly cannot see her web.Even if she had good sight, instead of
being purblind, her position could not possibly allow her to keep the
prey in view.Does she give up hunting during this period of bright
sunlight?One of her hind-legs is stretched outside the leafy cabin;
and the signalling-thread ends just at the tip of that leg.Whoso has
not seen the Epeira in this attitude, with her hand, so to speak, on
the telegraph-receiver, knows nothing of one of the most curious
instances of animal cleverness.Let any game appear upon the scene; and
the slumberer, forthwith aroused by means of the leg receiving the
vibrations, hastens up.A Locust whom I myself lay on the web procures
her this agreeable shock and what follows.If she is satisfied with her
bag, I am still more satisfied with what I have learnt.The different parts
of the framework, tossed and teased by the eddying air-currents, cannot
fail to transmit their vibration to the signalling-thread.Nevertheless, the Spider does not quit her hut and remains indifferent
to the commotion prevailing in the net.Her line, therefore, is
something better than a bell-rope that pulls and communicates the
impulse given: it is a telephone capable, like our own, of transmitting
infinitesimal waves of sound.Clutching her telephone-wire with a toe,
the Spider listens with her leg; she perceives the innermost
vibrations; she distinguishes between the vibration proceeding from a
prisoner and the mere shaking caused by the wind.A wasp-like garb of motley black and yellow; a slender and graceful
figure; wings not spread out flat, when resting, but folded lengthwise
in two; the abdomen a sort of chemist's retort, which swells into a
gourd and is fastened to the thorax by a long neck, first distending
into a pear, then shrinking to a thread; a leisurely and silent flight;
lonely habits.There we have a summary sketch of the Eumenes.My part
of the country possesses two species: the larger, Eumenes Amedei, Lep.,
measures nearly an inch in length; the other, Eumenes pomiformis,
Fabr., is a reduction of the first to the scale of one-half.(I include
three species promiscuously under this one name, that is to say,
Eumenes pomiformis, Fabr., E. bipunctis, Sauss., and E. dubius, Sauss.As I did not distinguish between them in my first investigations, which
date a very long time back, it is not possible for me to ascribe to
each of them its respective nest.But their habits are the same, for
which reason this confusion does not injuriously affect the order of
ideas in the present chapter.--Author's Note.)Similar in form and colouring, both possess a like talent for
architecture; and this talent is expressed in a work of the highest
perfection which charms the most untutored eye.The Eumenes follow the profession of arms, which is
unfavourable to artistic effort; they stab a prey with their sting;
they pillage and plunder.They are predatory Hymenoptera, victualling
their grubs with caterpillars.It will be interesting to compare their
habits with those of the operator on the Grey Worm.(Ammophila hirsuta,
who hunts the Grey Worm, the caterpillar of Noctua segetum, the Dart or
Turnip Moth.--Translator's Note.)Though the quarry--caterpillars in
either case--remain the same, perhaps instinct, which is liable to vary
with the species, has fresh glimpses in store for us.Besides, the
edifice built by the Eumenes in itself deserves inspection.The Hunting Wasps whose story we have described in former volumes are
wonderfully well versed in the art of wielding the lancet; they astound
us with their surgical methods, which they seem to have learnt from
some physiologist who allows nothing to escape him; but those skilful
slayers have no merit as builders of dwelling-houses.What is their
home, in point of fact?An underground passage, with a cell at the end
of it; a gallery, an excavation, a shapeless cave.It is miner's work,
navvy's work: vigorous sometimes, artistic never.They use the pick-axe
for loosening, the crowbar for shifting, the rake for extracting the
materials, but never the trowel for laying.Now in the Eumenes we see
real masons, who build their houses bit by bit with stone and mortar
and run them up in the open, either on the firm rock or on the shaky
support of a bough.Hunting alternates with architecture; the insect is
a Nimrod or a Vitruvius by turns.(Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman
architect and engineer.--Translator's Note.)And, first of all, what sites do these builders select for their homes?Should you pass some little garden-wall, facing south, in a
sun-scorched corner, look at the stones that are not covered with
plaster, look at them one by one, especially the largest; examine the
masses of boulders, at no great height from the ground, where the
fierce rays have heated them to the temperature of a Turkish bath; and,
perhaps, if you seek long enough, you will light upon the structure of
Eumenes Amedei.The insect is scarce and lives apart; a meeting is an
event upon which we must not count with too great confidence.It is an
African species and loves the heat that ripens the carob and the date.It haunts the sunniest spots and selects rocks or firm stones as a
foundation for its nest.Sometimes also, but seldom, it copies the
Chalicodoma of the Walls and builds upon an ordinary pebble.(Or
Mason-bee.--Translator's Note.)Eumenes pomiformis is much more common and is comparatively indifferent
to the nature of the foundation whereon she erects her cells.She
builds on walls, on isolated stones, on the wood of the inner surface
of half-closed shutters; or else she adopts an aerial base, the slender
twig of a shrub, the withered sprig of a plant of some sort.Less
chilly than her African cousin, she does not shun the unprotected
spaces exposed to every wind that blows.When erected on a horizontal surface, where nothing interferes with it,
the structure of Eumenes Amedei is a symmetrical cupola, a spherical
skull-cap, with, at the top, a narrow passage just wide enough for the
insect, and surmounted by a neatly funnelled neck.It suggests the
round hut of the Eskimo or of the ancient Gael, with its central
chimney.Two centimetres and a half (.97 inch.--Translator's Note.),
more or less, represent the diameter, and two centimetres the height.(.78 inch.--Translator's Note.)When the support is a perpendicular
plane, the building still retains the domed shape, but the entrance-
and exit-funnel opens at the side, upwards.The floor of this apartment
calls for no labour: it is supplied direct by the bare stone.Having chosen the site, the builder erects a circular fence about three
millimetres thick.(.118 inch.--Translator's Note.)The materials
consist of mortar and small stones.The insect selects its stone-quarry
in some well-trodden path, on some neighbouring road, at the driest,
hardest spots.With its mandibles, it scrapes together a small quantity
of dust and saturates it with saliva until the whole becomes a regular
hydraulic mortar which soon sets and is no longer susceptible to water.The Mason-bees have shown us a similar exploitation of the beaten paths
and of the road-mender's macadam.All these open-air builders, all
these erectors of monuments exposed to wind and weather require an
exceedingly dry stone-dust; otherwise the material, already moistened
with water, would not properly absorb the liquid that is to give it
cohesion; and the edifice would soon be wrecked by the rains.They
possess the sense of discrimination of the plasterer, who rejects
plaster injured by damp.We shall see presently how the insects that
build under shelter avoid this laborious macadam-scraping and give the
preference to fresh earth already reduced to a paste by its own
dampness.When common lime answers our purpose, we do not trouble about
Roman cement.Now Eumenes Amedei requires a first-class cement, even
better than that of the Chalicodoma of the Walls, for the work, when
finished, does not receive the thick covering wherewith the Mason-bee
protects her cluster of cells.And therefore the cupola-builder, as
often as she can, uses the highway as her stone-pit.These are bits of gravel of an
almost unvarying size--that of a peppercorn--but of a shape and kind
differing greatly, according to the places worked.Some are
sharp-cornered, with facets determined by chance fractures; some are
round, polished by friction under water.Some are of limestone, others
of silicic matter.The favourite stones, when the neighbourhood of the
nest permits, are little nodules of quartz, smooth and semitransparent.The insect weighs them, so to say,
measures them with the compass of its mandibles and does not accept
them until after recognizing in them the requisite qualities of size
and hardness.A circular fence, we were saying, is begun on the bare rock.Before the
mortar sets, which does not take long, the mason sticks a few stones
into the soft mass, as the work advances.She dabs them half-way into
the cement, so as to leave them jutting out to a large extent, without
penetrating to the inside, where the wall must remain smooth for the
sake of the larva's comfort.If necessary, a little plaster is added,
to tone down the inner protuberances.The solidly embedded stonework
alternates with the pure mortarwork, of which each fresh course
receives its facing of tiny encrusted pebbles.As the edifice is
raised, the builder <DW72>s the construction a little towards the centre
and fashions the curve which will give the spherical shape.We employ
arched centrings to support the masonry of a dome while building: the
Eumenes, more daring than we, erects her cupola without any
scaffolding.A round orifice is contrived at the summit; and, on this orifice, rises
a funnelled mouthpiece built of pure cement.It might be the graceful
neck of some Etruscan vase.When the cell is victualled and the egg
laid, this mouthpiece is closed with a cement plug; and in this plug is
set a little pebble, one alone, no more: the ritual never varies.This
work of rustic architecture has naught to fear from the inclemency of
the weather; it does not yield to the pressure of the fingers; it
resists the knife that attempts to remove it without breaking it.Its
nipple shape and the bits of gravel wherewith it bristles all over the
outside remind one of certain cromlechs of olden time, of certain
tumuli whose domes are strewn with Cyclopean stones.Such is the appearance of the edifice when the cell stands alone; but
the Hymenopteron nearly always fixes other domes against her first, to
the number of five, six, or more.This shortens the labour by allowing
her to use the same partition for two adjoining rooms.The original
elegant symmetry is lost and the whole now forms a cluster which, at
first sight, appears to be merely a clod of dry mud, sprinkled with
tiny pebbles.But let us examine the shapeless mass more closely and we
shall perceive the number of chambers composing the habitation with the
funnelled mouths, each quite distinct and each furnished with its
gravel stopper set in the cement.The Chalicodoma of the Walls employs the same building methods as
Eumenes Amedei: in the courses of cement she fixes, on the outside,
small stones of minor bulk.Her work begins by being a turret of rustic
art, not without a certain prettiness; then, when the cells are placed
side by side, the whole construction degenerates into a lump governed
apparently by no architectural rule.Moreover, the Mason-bee covers her
mass of cells with a thick layer of cement, which conceals the original
rockwork edifice.The Eumenes does not resort to this general coating:
her building is too strong to need it; she leaves the pebbly facings
uncovered, as well as the entrances to the cells.The two sorts of
nests, although constructed of similar materials, are therefore easily
distinguished.The Eumenes' cupola is the work of an artist; and the artist would be
sorry to cover his masterpiece with whitewash.I crave forgiveness for
a suggestion which I advance with all the reserve befitting so delicate
a subject.Would it not be possible for the cromlech-builder to take a
pride in her work, to look upon it with some affection and to feel
gratified by this evidence of her cleverness?Might there not be an
insect science of aesthetics?I seem at least to catch a glimpse, in
the Eumenes, of a propensity to beautify her work.The nest must be,
before all, a solid habitation, an inviolable stronghold; but, should
ornament intervene without jeopardizing the power of resistance, will
the worker remain indifferent to it?The orifice at the top, if left as a mere
hole, would suit the purpose quite as well as an elaborate door: the
insect would lose nothing in regard to facilities for coming and going
and would gain by shortening the labour.Yet we find, on the contrary,
the mouth of an amphora, gracefully curved, worthy of a potter's wheel.A choice cement and careful work are necessary for the confection of
its slender, funnelled shaft.Why this nice finish, if the builder be
wholly absorbed in the solidity of her work?Here is another detail: among the bits of gravel employed for the outer
covering of the cupola, grains of quartz predominate.They are polished
and translucent; they glitter slightly and please the eye.Why are
these little pebbles preferred to chips of lime-stone, when both
materials are found in equal abundance around the nest?A yet more remarkable feature: we find pretty often, encrusted on the
dome, a few tiny, empty snail-shells, bleached by the sun.The species
usually selected by the Eumenes is one of the smaller Helices--Helix
strigata--frequent on our parched <DW72>s.I have seen nests where this
Helix took the place of pebbles almost entirely.They were like boxes
made of shells, the work of a patient hand.Certain Australian birds, notably the
Bower-birds, build themselves covered walks, or playhouses, with
interwoven twigs, and decorate the two entrances to the portico by
strewing the threshold with anything that they can find in the shape of
glittering, polished, or bright- objects.Every door-sill is a
cabinet of curiosities where the collector gathers smooth pebbles,
variegated shells, empty snail-shells, parrot's feathers, bones that
have come to look like sticks of ivory.The odds and ends mislaid by
man find a home in the bird's museum, where we see pipe-stems, metal
buttons, strips of cotton stuff and stone axe-heads.The collection at either entrance to the bower is large enough to fill
half a bushel.As these objects are of no use to the bird, its only
motive for accumulating them must be an art-lover's hobby.Our common
Magpie has similar tastes: any shiny thing that he comes upon he picks
up, hides and hoards.Well, the Eumenes, who shares this passion for bright pebbles and empty
snail-shells, is the Bower-bird of the insect world; but she is a more
practical collector, knows how to combine the useful and the ornamental
and employs her finds in the construction of her nest, which is both a
fortress and a museum.When she finds nodules of translucent quartz,
she rejects everything else: the building will be all the prettier for
them.When she comes across a little white shell, she hastens to
beautify her dome with it; should fortune smile and empty snail-shells
abound, she encrusts the whole fabric with them, until it becomes the
supreme expression of her artistic taste.The nest of Eumenes pomiformis is the size of an average cherry and
constructed of pure mortar, without the least outward pebblework.Its
shape is exactly similar to that which we have just described.When
built upon a horizontal base of sufficient extent, it is a dome with a
central neck, funnelled like the mouth of an urn.But when the
foundation is reduced to a mere point, as on the twig of a shrub, the
nest becomes a spherical capsule, always, of course, surmounted by a
neck.It is then a miniature specimen of exotic pottery, a paunchy
alcarraza.Its thickens is very slight, less than that of a sheet of
paper; it crushes under the least effort of the fingers.It displays wrinkles and seams, due to the different
courses of mortar, or else knotty protuberances distributed almost
concentrically.Both Hymenoptera accumulate caterpillars in their coffers, whether
domes or jars.Let us give an abstract of the bill of fare.These
documents, for all their dryness, possess a value; they will enable
whoso cares to interest himself in the Eumenes to perceive to what
extent instinct varies the diet, according to the place and season.The
food is plentiful, but lacks variety.It consists of tiny caterpillars,
by which I mean the grubs of small Butterflies.We learn this from the
structure, for we observe in the prey selected by either Hymenopteran
the usual caterpillar organism.The body is composed of twelve
segments, not including the head.The first three have true legs, the
next two are legless, then come two segments with prolegs, two legless
segments and, lastly, a terminal segment with prolegs.It is exactly
the same structure which we saw in the Ammophila's Grey Worm.My old notes give the following description of the caterpillars found
in the nest of Eumenes Amedei: "a pale green or, less often, a
yellowish body, covered with short white hairs; head wider than the
front segment, dead-black and also bristling with hairs.Length: 16 to
18 millimetres (.63 to.7 inch.--Translator's Note.); width: about 3
millimetres."(.12 inch.--Translator's Note.)A quarter of a century
and more has elapsed since I jotted down this descriptive sketch; and
to-day, at Serignan, I find in the Eumenes' larder the same game which
I noticed long ago at Carpentras.Time and distance have not altered
the nature of the provisions.The number of morsels served for the meal of each larva interests us
more than the quality.In the cells of Eumenes Amedei, I find sometimes
five caterpillars and sometimes ten, which means a difference of a
hundred per cent in the quantity of the food, for the morsels are of
exactly the same size in both cases.Why this unequal supply, which
gives a double portion to one larva and a single portion to another?The diners have the same appetite: what one nurseling demands a second
must demand, unless we have here a different menu, according to the
sexes.In the perfect stage the males are smaller than the females, are
hardly half as much in weight or volume.The amount of victuals,
therefore, required to bring them to their final development may be
reduced by one-half.In that case, the well-stocked cells belong to
females; the others, more meagrely supplied, belong to males.But the egg is laid when the provisions are stored; and this egg has a
determined sex, though the most minute examination is not able to
discover the differences which will decide the hatching of a female or
a male.We are therefore needs driven to this strange conclusion: the
mother knows beforehand the sex of the egg which she is about to lay;
and this knowledge allows her to fill the larder according to the
appetite of the future grub.What a strange world, so wholly different
from ours!We fall back upon a special sense to explain the Ammophila's
hunting; what can we fall back upon to account for this intuition of
the future?Can the theory of chances play a part in the hazy problem?If nothing is logically arranged with a foreseen object, how is this
clear vision of the invisible acquired?The capsules of Eumenes pomiformis are literally crammed with game.It
is true that the morsels are very small.My notes speak of fourteen
green caterpillars in one cell and sixteen in a second cell.I have no
other information about the integral diet of this Wasp, whom I have
neglected somewhat, preferring to study her cousin, the builder of
rockwork domes.As the two sexes differ in size, although to a lesser
degree than in the case of Eumenes Amedei, I am inclined to think that
those two well-filled cells belonged to females and that the males'
cells must have a less sumptuous table.Not having seen for myself, I
am content to set down this mere suspicion.What I have seen and often seen is the pebbly nest, with the larva
inside and the provisions partly consumed.To continue the rearing at
home and follow my charge's progress from day to day was a business
which I could not resist; besides, as far as I was able to see, it was
easily managed.I had had some practice in this foster-father's trade;
my association with the Bembex, the Ammophila, the Sphex (three species
of Digger-wasps.--Translator's Note.)and many others had turned me
into a passable insect-rearer.I was no novice in the art of dividing
an old pen-box into compartments in which I laid a bed of sand and, on
this bed, the larva and her provisions delicately removed from the
maternal cell.Success was almost certain at each attempt: I used to
watch the larvae at their meals, I saw my nurselings grow up and spin
their cocoons.Relying upon the experience thus gained, I reckoned upon
success in raising my Eumenes.The results, however, in no way answered to my expectations.All my
endeavours failed; and the larva allowed itself to die a piteous death
without touching its provisions.I ascribed my reverse to this, that and the other cause: perhaps I had
injured the frail grub when demolishing the fortress; a splinter of
masonry had bruised it when I forced open the hard dome with my knife;
a too sudden exposure to the sun had surprised it when I withdrew it
from the darkness of its cell; the open air might have dried up its
moisture.I did the best I could to remedy all these probable reasons
of failure.I went to work with every possible caution in breaking open
the home; I cast the shadow of my body over the nest, to save the grub
from sunstroke; I at once transferred larva and provisions into a glass
tube and placed this tube in a box which I carried in my hand, to
minimize the jolting on the journey.Nothing was of avail: the larva,
when taken from its dwelling, always allowed itself to pine away.For a long time I persisted in explaining my want of success by the
difficulties attending the removal.Eumenes Amedei's cell is a strong
casket which cannot be forced without sustaining a shock; and the
demolition of a work of this kind entails such varied accidents that we
are always liable to think that the worm has been bruised by the
wreckage.As for carrying home the nest intact on its support, with a
view to opening it with greater care than is permitted by a
rough-and-ready operation in the fields, that is out of the question:
the nest nearly always stands on an immovable rock or on some big stone
forming part of a wall.If I failed in my attempts at rearing, it was
because the larva had suffered when I was breaking up her house.The
reason seemed a good one; and I let it go at that.In the end, another idea occurred to me and made me doubt whether my
rebuffs were always due to clumsy accidents.The Eumenes' cells are
crammed with game: there are ten caterpillars in the cell of Eumenes
Amedei and fifteen in that of Eumenes pomiformis.These caterpillars,
stabbed no doubt, but in a manner unknown to me, are not entirely
motionless.The mandibles seize upon what is presented to them, the
body buckles and unbuckles, the hinder half lashes out briskly when
stirred with the point of a needle.At what spot is the egg laid amid
that swarming mass, where thirty mandibles can make a hole in it, where
a hundred and twenty pairs of legs can tear it?When the victuals
consist of a single head of game, these perils do not exist; and the
egg is laid on the victim not at hazard, but upon a judiciously chosen
spot.Thus, for instance, Ammophila hirsuta fixes hers, by one end,
cross-wise, on the Grey Worm, on the side of the first prolegged
segment.The eggs hang over the caterpillar's back, away from the legs,
whose proximity might be dangerous.The worm, moreover, stung in the
greater number of its nerve-centres, lies on one side, motionless and
incapable of bodily contortions or said an jerks of its hinder
segments.If the mandibles try to snap, if the legs give a kick or two,
they find nothing in front of them: the Ammophila's egg is at the
opposite side.The tiny grub is thus able, as soon as it hatches, to
dig into the giant's belly in full security.How different are the conditions in the Eumenes' cell.The caterpillars
are imperfectly paralysed, perhaps because they have received but a
single stab; they toss about when touched with a pin; they are bound to
wriggle when bitten by the larva.If the egg is laid on one of them,
the first morsel will, I admit, be consumed without danger, on
condition that the point of attack be wisely chosen; but there remain
others which are not deprived of every means of defence.Let a movement
take place in the mass; and the egg, shifted from the upper layer, will
tumble into a pitfall of legs and mandibles.The least thing is enough
to jeopardize its existence; and this least thing has every chance of
being brought about in the disordered heap of caterpillars.The egg, a
tiny cylinder, transparent as crystal, is extremely delicate: a touch
withers it, the least pressure crushes it.No, its place is not in the mass of provisions, for the caterpillars, I
repeat, are not sufficiently harmless.Their paralysis is incomplete,
as is proved by their contortions when I irritate them and shown, on
the other hand, by a very important fact.I have sometimes taken from
Eumenes Amedei's cell a few heads of game half transformed into
chrysalids.It is evident that the transformation was effected in the
cell itself and, therefore, after the operation which the Wasp had
performed upon them.I cannot say
precisely, never having seen the huntress at work.The sting most
certainly has played its part; but where?What we are able to declare is that the torpor is not
very deep, inasmuch as the patient sometimes retains enough vitality to
shed its skin and become a chrysalid.Everything thus tends to make us
ask by what stratagem the egg is shielded from danger.This stratagem I longed to discover; I would not be put off by the
scarcity of nests, by the irksomeness of the searches, by the risk of
sunstroke, by the time taken up, by the vain breaking open of
unsuitable cells; I meant to see and I saw.Here is my method: with the
point of a knife and a pair of nippers, I make a side opening, a
window, beneath the dome of Eumenes Amedei and Eumenes pomiformis.I
work with the greatest care, so as not to injure the recluse.Formerly
I attacked the cupola from the top, now I attack it from the side.I
stop when the breach is large enough to allow me to see the state of
things within.I pause to give the reader time to
reflect and to think out for himself a means of safety that will
protect the egg and afterwards the grub in the perilous conditions
which I have set forth.Seek, think and contrive, such of you as have
inventive minds.The egg is not laid upon the provisions; it is hung from the top of the
cupola by a thread which vies with that of a Spider's web for
slenderness.The dainty cylinder quivers and swings to and fro at the
least breath; it reminds me of the famous pendulum suspended from the
dome of the Pantheon to prove the rotation of the earth.The victuals
are heaped up underneath.In order to witness it, we must
open a window in cell upon cell until fortune deigns to smile upon us.The larva is hatched and already fairly large.Like the egg, it hangs
perpendicularly, by the rear, from the ceiling; but the suspensory cord
has gained considerably in length and consists of the original thread
eked out by a sort of ribbon.The grub is at dinner: head downwards, it
is digging into the limp belly of one of the caterpillars.I touch up
the game that is still intact with a straw.The grub forthwith retires from the fray.Marvel is
added to marvels: what I took for a flat cord, for a ribbon, at the
lower end of the suspensory thread, is a sheath, a scabbard, a sort of
ascending gallery wherein the larva crawls backwards and makes its way
up.The cast shell of the egg, retaining its cylindrical form and
perhaps lengthened by a special operation on the part of the new-born
grub, forms this safety-channel.At the least sign of danger in the
heap of caterpillars, the larva retreats into its sheath and climbs
back to the ceiling, where the swarming rabble cannot reach it.When
peace is restored, it slides down its case and returns to table, with
its head over the viands and its rear upturned and ready to withdraw in
case of need.Strength has come; the larva is brawny enough not
to dread the movements of the caterpillars' bodies.Besides, the
caterpillars, mortified by fasting and weakened by a prolonged torpor,
become more and more incapable of defence.The perils of the tender
babe are succeeded by the security of the lusty stripling; and the
grub, henceforth scorning its sheathed lift, lets itself drop upon the
game that remains.That is what I saw in the nests of both species of the Eumenes and that
is what I showed to friends who were even more surprised than I by
these ingenious tactics.The egg hanging from the ceiling, at a
distance from the provisions, has naught to fear from the caterpillars,
which flounder about below.The new-hatched larva, whose suspensory
cord is lengthened by the sheath of the egg, reaches the game and takes
a first cautious bite at it.If there be danger, it climbs back to the
ceiling by retreating inside the scabbard.This explains the failure of
my earlier attempts.Not knowing of the safety-thread, so slender and
so easily broken, I gathered at one time the egg, at another the young
larva, after my inroads at the top had caused them to fall into the
middle of the live victuals.Neither of them was able to thrive when
brought into direct contact with the dangerous game.If any one of my readers, to whom I appealed just now, has thought out
something better than the Eumenes' invention, I beg that he will let me
know: there is a curious parallel to be drawn between the inspirations
of reason and the inspirations of instinct.February has its sunny days, heralding spring, to which rude winter
will reluctantly yield place.In snug corners, among the rocks, the
great spurge of our district, the characias of the Greeks, the jusclo
of the Provencals, begins to lift its drooping inflorescence and
discreetly opens a few sombre flowers.Here the first midges of the
year will come to slake their thirst.By the time that the tip of the
stalks reaches the perpendicular, the worst of the cold weather will be
over.Another eager one, the almond-tree, risking the loss of its fruit,
hastens to echo these preludes to the festival of the sun, preludes
which are too often treacherous.A few days of soft skies and it
becomes a glorious dome of white flowers, each twinkling with a roseate
eye.The country, which still lacks green, seems dotted everywhere with
white-satin pavilions.'Twould be a callous heart indeed that could
resist the magic of this awakening.The insect nation is represented at these rites by a few of its more
zealous members.There is first of all the Honey-bee, the sworn enemy
of strikes, who profits by the least lull of winter to find out if some
rosemary or other is not beginning to open somewhere near the hive.The
droning of the busy swarms fills the flowery vault, while a snow of
petals falls softly to the foot of the tree.Together with the population of harvesters there mingles another, less
numerous, of mere drinkers, whose nesting-time has not yet begun.This
is the colony of the Osmiae, those exceedingly pretty solitary bees,
with their copper-<DW52> skin and bright-red fleece.Two species have
come hurrying up to take part in the joys of the almond-tree: first,
the Horned Osmia, clad in black velvet on the head and breast, with red
velvet on the abdomen; and, a little later, the Three-horned Osmia,
whose livery must be red and red only.These are the first delegates
despatched by the pollen-gleaners to ascertain the state of the season
and attend the festival of the early blooms.'Tis but a moment since they burst their cocoon, the winter abode: they
have left their retreats in the crevices of the old walls; should the
north wind blow and set the almond-tree shivering, they will hasten to
return to them.Hail to you, O my dear Osmiae, who yearly, from the far
end of the harmas, opposite snow-capped Ventoux (A mountain in the
Provencal Alps, near Carpentras and Serignan 6,271 feet.--Translator's
Note.), bring me the first tidings of the awakening of the insect
world!I am one of your friends; let us talk about you a little.Most of the Osmiae of my region do not themselves prepare the dwelling
destined for the laying.They want ready-made lodgings, such as the old
cells and old galleries of Anthophorae and Chalicodomae.If these
favourite haunts are lacking, then a hiding-place in the wall, a round
hole in some bit of wood, the tube of a reed, the spiral of a dead
Snail under a heap of stones are adopted, according to the tastes of
the several species.The retreat selected is divided into chambers by
partition-walls, after which the entrance to the dwelling receives a
massive seal.That is the sum-total of the building done.For this plasterer's rather than mason's work, the Horned and the
Three-horned Osmia employ soft earth.This material is a sort of dried
mud, which turns to pap on the addition of a drop of water.The two
Osmiae limit themselves to gathering natural soaked earth, mud in
short, which they allow to dry without any special preparation on their
part; and so they need deep and well-sheltered retreats, into which the
rain cannot penetrate, or the work would fall to pieces.Latreille's Osmia uses different materials for her partitions and her
doors.She chews the leaves of some mucilaginous plant, some mallow
perhaps, and then prepares a sort of green putty with which she builds
her partitions and finally closes the entrance to the dwelling.When
she settles in the spacious cells of the Masked Anthophora (Anthophora
personata, Illig.), the entrance to the gallery, which is wide enough
to admit a man's finger, is closed with a voluminous plug of this
vegetable paste.On the earthy banks, hardened by the sun, the home is
then betrayed by the gaudy colour of the lid.It is as though the
authorities had closed the door and affixed to it their great seals of
green wax.So far then as their building-materials are concerned, the Osmiae whom
I have been able to observe are divided into two classes: one building
compartments with mud, the other with a green-tinted vegetable putty.To the latter belongs Latreille's Osmia.The first section includes the
Horned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia, both so remarkable for the
horny tubercles on their faces.The great reed of the south, Arundo donax, is often used, in the
country, for making rough garden-shelters against the mistral or just
for fences.These reeds, the ends of which are chopped off to make them
all the same length, are planted perpendicularly in the earth.I have
often explored them in the hope of finding Osmia-nests.The partitions
and the closing-plug of the Horned and of the Three-horned Osmia are
made, as we have seen, of a sort of mud which water instantly reduces
to pap.With the upright position of the reeds, the stopper of the
opening would receive the rain and would become diluted; the ceilings
of the storeys would fall in and the family would perish by drowning.Therefore the Osmia, who knew of these drawbacks before I did, refuses
the reeds when they are placed perpendicularly.The same reed is used for a second purpose.We make canisses of it,
that is to say, hurdles, which, in spring, serve for the rearing of
Silkworms and, in autumn, for the drying of fig
