In cases where it
is more convenient a stay at the Arkansas Hot Springs is to be
suggested, and for obstinate cases of intestinal catarrh with sluggish
circulation, obesity, and gouty tendencies these springs are to be
preferred.A season at some of the mineral baths of Europe, as
Aix-la-Chapelle, followed by the strict regimen of the grape cure (as
at Bingen, Durkheim, Vevay, Montreux, or Meran), is a rational mode of
treatment which offers an almost certain prospect of cure.If the case is one of atony of the colon due to impaction of the rectum
and dilatation of the rectum and colon, without gastric or intestinal
indigestion, a quite different regimen is required.The constitution
and mode of life are the guides to the general plan to be followed.Sedentary pursuits are to be given up as far as possible.Long
vacations and travel must be insisted on, with active exercise by
walking and riding; also cold bathing or sponging, with brisk friction
of the whole body.Sea-bathing is useful both as an exercise and for
the effect upon the sluggish peripheral circulation, but the slothful
life at the seashore, with over-indulgence in eating and drinking, is a
source of more harm than good.Warm baths, and cold douches to the
abdomen, compresses of cold water or of alcohol, the cold douche to the
spine while in the hot bath, are all beneficial.Massage for women,
children, and feeble persons takes the place of exercise.The kneading
of the muscles over the abdomen can be combined advantageously with an
effort to accelerate the passage of the contents of the colon by
manipulation in the direction of movement.The interrupted electrical current, used for the purpose of developing
the feeble abdominal muscles, is a source of much advantage.[45] But to
be of service it should be persevered in for months, the patient
himself making the application under the direction of the physician.In
addition, the introduction of one insulated electrode into the rectum,
while the other is in contact with the abdominal muscles or along the
line of the large intestine, has been advised.The Swedish movement
cure may be a useful aid in some cases.The movements exercise the
muscles of expulsion.These are deep inspiration, flexion and extension
of thighs or trunk, twisting the trunk, pressure on the abdomen and
colon, stroking in the direction of fecal movement.[Footnote 45: S. T. Stern, "Die faradische Behandlung der Obstipation
und der nervosen Enteropathie," _Centralblatt fur Newenheil_, 5 Jahrg.,
Mai, 1882, p.201; also, I. Althaus, "Treatment of Obstinate
Constipation by Faradization of the Bowel," _Lancet_, London, 1867, ii.In the relaxed condition of the abdomen in women who have borne {654}
children or in old persons the wearing of an abdominal support
sometimes gives help and comfort.The best diet for cases of atony of the colon and rectum is one which
is easily digested and has a moderate amount of waste, as a full colon
will stimulate muscular action.Various articles are suggested with a
view to excite peristalsis by irritation of the mucous surface, but as
such substances are in themselves insoluble and innutritious, it is
unwise to resort to them.The following list includes the foods
suitable to such cases: Fresh vegetables, as spinach, raw or stewed
tomatoes, lettuce, kale, salsify, peas, asparagus, kohlrabi, and other
summer vegetables; in winter canned vegetables, if well prepared, take
their place.Among fruits, fresh fruit in general, especially grapes,
peaches, and oranges; dried fruit, as figs, raisins in small quantity,
stewed prunes, and baked or stewed apples, can be tried.Too much vegetable matter is harmful, as the bowel is filled with an
excess of waste, much of which is undigested food; the quantity must be
regulated by the appearance of the stools and by the success of the
regimen.If the blockade continues obstinately, the vegetable diet
should be reduced.The microscope in many cases can alone decide the
amount of undigested vegetable matter.Meats are all advisable in
moderation.The least digestible, as ham and veal, are to be avoided.Graham-flour bread, brown bread, or bran bread are better than bread
made of the best bolted flour.The first is more digestible, and bran
bread[46] is thought to increase peristalsis, but this is a doubtful
effect.Oatmeal well boiled, fine hominy, corn meal, or cracked wheat
with milk are pleasant and digestible.A cup of cafe au lait at
breakfast or before breakfast is the best morning drink;[47] it has a
laxative influence.Milk at
breakfast answers well for those who take it with relish.Daniel went to the bedroom.An orange on
rising in the morning is a pleasant remedy.[Footnote 46: "The Efficacy of Bran Bread in relieving Despondency...
dependent on an Irregular and Constipated State of the Bowels," _Journ.Sci._, London, 1858-59, v.[Footnote 47: "Treatment by Cafe au Lait," _Gaz.des Medecins prat._,
1840, No.Certain drugs are called for to aid these measures in giving tone
directly or indirectly to the weakened bowel muscles.Strychnia stands
first, but it woefully disappoints one who trusts much in the
theoretical arguments for its use.In fact, it may be said of all drugs
given for constipation that they stand in a very subordinate rank to
the measures already discussed.They should be thought of last, not
first, and but little confidence should be put in the vaunted value of
new drugs.Strychnia can be combined in anaemia and debility with the
dried sulphate or carbonate of iron, and with quinia or arsenic,[48] or
in feeble digestion with dilute hydrochloric acid and pepsin.Belladonna was advised by Trousseau as a stimulant to unstriped
muscular fibre, and it can well be given with strychnia; ipecacuanha
and atropia are approved of in conjunction.[49] A pill of ergot,
belladonna, and strychnia would answer the indication of a feeble
peristalsis.DaCosta has suggested giving one drop {655} of the fluid
extract of belladonna with compound tincture of gentian or cinchona
three times daily after meals.The sulphate or valerianate of zinc,
oxide of zinc, extract of valerian or gentian, capsicum, or black
pepper can be tried in pill form with belladonna and strychnia.[Footnote 48: Bartholow thinks arsenic overcomes constipation when due
to deficient secretion and dryness of the feces (_Mat.Med._, New York,
1879, p.[Footnote 49: Legros and Onimus, _Journal de l'Anat.et de la Phys._,
t. vi.Ringer says one grain of ipecacuanha taken while
fasting each morning will relieve constipation from torpor
(_Therapeutics_, New York, 1882, p.These remedies are slow-acting, and in the mean while the bowels must
be moved artificially, methodically, and taught to act at stated hours.For this purpose a small enema of cool or cold water at the same hour
every day after breakfast does well.It is irrational to distend the
bowel, already weakened by distension, with large enemata of warm
water.Recourse should not be had to this until all hopes of effecting
a cure are gone, or only as an occasional remedy in impacted
accumulations where the mass must be softened before it can be removed.If the enema does not in time empty the colon sufficiently, laxatives
will have to be taken with some regularity until the habit is created.A tumblerful of water with or without a teaspoonful of salt, or a
tumblerful of any alkaline water charged with carbonic acid, taken on
rising in the morning, may prove effective.A tablespoonful of sweet
oil at night acts well as a lubricator and softens the feces.If these
more simple means fail, it becomes unfortunately necessary to give a
purgative drug: any one of this class can be combined with strychnia,
belladonna, vegetable tonics, and iron.Those to be preferred are
aloes, colocynth,[50] and podophyllin.The compound podophyllin pill or
a pill of one-sixth of a grain of belladonna and podophyllin at night
or three times daily, the pill of aloes and myrrh, or the Lady Webster
pill, are well-approved forms of administration.A compound rhubarb
pill acts well if taken after dinner.[Footnote 50: A few drops of the Prussian tincture of colocynth several
times daily is advised by Ringer (_Therapeutics_, New York, 1882, p.If one desires to select a purgative which will probably increase the
outflow of bile, selection can be made from the following drugs:
podophyllin, aloes, rhubarb, colchicum, euonymin, colocynth, calomel,
jalap, sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate, cream of tartar; and among
the rarer alkaloids iridin, sanguinarin, physostigma, and juglandin.These, according to Rutherford, Vignal, and Dodds, increase the
secretion of bile in fasting animals.Ox-gall and pig-gall are
laxatives only; they have no effect on the liver, but can be added to
other purgatives in pill forms.Salines largely diluted may be given to strong adults: Epsom or
Rochelle salts quite early in the morning, a solution of sulphate of
magnesia with dilute sulphuric acid, to which dried sulphate of iron
may be added, are quite popular; and of the bitter waters, Hunyadi
Janos, Friedrichshall, or Pullna water serves the purpose.One grain of
sulphate of quinia added to a saline will increase its effect.The
milder laxative waters are to be preferred to the bitter waters.The
Saratoga waters, Congress, Geyser, Hathorn, answer the purpose taken
early in the morning, or among the European springs those of Kissengen,
Plombieres, Marienbad, Homburg, Seltzer, or Leamington in England, are
not too active in their effects.In atonic constipation, the form now
under consideration, the laxative chalybeate waters are indicated where
there is anaemia or debility.These are represented by the Columbian,
Pavilion, Eureka, and Excelsior Rock among the Saratoga waters, and by
the Bedford Springs water.{656} It is well to administer a number of drugs in rotation in
habitual constipation, as the susceptibility to a particular drug is
lost after continued use.Increase of the dose is the usual method to
offset this result, but it is irrational to meet exhaustion by
over-stimulation.Rest of the part stimulated by using a remedy which
brings about the result in a different way is the wiser course.The
dose should be gradually reduced, tempting the bowel to act more and
more without aid.Among the laxatives which can be borne in mind in
alternating treatment the following list includes some which can be
used with advantage: the fluid extracts of rhamnus (buckthorn) and
cascara sagrada; alum, which is called for in certain forms of atony;
sulphur in the form of confection or sulphur with guaiacum[51] (half a
drachm of each in powder at night); the wine of colchicum (five drops
or more three times daily), advantageously used in gouty or rheumatic
persons; the infusion or tincture of euonymus; the tincture of benzoin;
senna in fluid extract and in the compound powder of liquorice.[Footnote 51: Fuller, _Lancet_, London, April 23, 1864, p.Infants and children should be cured of constipation without purgatives
if possible.Attention to the diet of the infant, and close inspection
of the stools to see the effect of the food given, will guide to a
proper system of feeding.Breast-milk is the best remedy; next, a food
which most nearly resembles mother's milk--cow's milk properly diluted
with barley-water, oatmeal-water, or rice-water--stands first.Condensed milk, given in barley- or oatmeal-water, is a second and
excellent substitute in cities.Antacids prevent a too rapid
coagulation of the casein and the formation of curdy lumps.Lime-water
with milk or bicarbonate of potassium or of sodium may be administered
with the food or before it.The quantity of food must be lessened until
the child can digest all it takes.The infant should be taught to empty the bowel at the same hour daily
by always placing it at this hour in a position favorable to and
suggestive of defecation.Dilating the sphincter at the same time with
the soap suppository or the small end of a Davidson's syringe, or just
touching the margins of the anus, will excite the necessary reflex
movement.If defecation is painful, examine the inner edge of the anus
for small cracks or for eczema ani.[52] Over-stretching the sphincter
with the finger in cases of rigid or spasmodic contractions will
sometimes produce permanent relief.[Footnote 52: Betz, "Eczematous Proctitis," _Memorabilien_, iv., Dec.In children the question of diet is equally important.Most cases of
constipation in them originate in intestinal catarrh from improper diet
and over-feeding.Strict rules of diet should be rigidly enforced, and
each case receive special study in order to determine upon the best
dietary.The minutest details of the child's life, its habits and
surroundings, are to be controlled so as to secure the best possible
influences for health.Feeble development and muscular inertia must be
remedied by change of climate and tonics--iron, strychnia, and
cod-liver oil.When other methods fail to give early relief, a
purgative may be needed.Rhubarb, magnesia, calomel, Friedrichshall or
Hunyadi water, given in milk, the compound liquorice powder, the
compound anise {657} powder, are better than the more active
cathartics.[53] Habitual administration of laxatives to children ought
to be regarded as a confession that the case is incurable; it is a last
resort, for which necessity is the only argument.[Footnote 53: The compound anise powder, a non-officinal preparation in
use in Washington, is a convenient form of administration: heavy
calcined magnesia, 360 grs.; rhubarb powdered, 180 grs.; oil of anise,
40 minims; stronger alcohol, one fluidrachm.The bicarbonate or fluid
magnesia is also a good preparation.Ringer knows nothing so effectual
in bringing back the proper consistence and yellow color to the motions
of children as podophyllin.Dissolve one grain of the resin in one
drachm of alcohol, and of this give one or two drops on a lump of sugar
twice or three times a day (_op.Bouchut suggests the
same solution, with simple syrup as a menstruum.]In old persons tonics should be combined with the laxatives, as
strychnia, iron, quinia, gentian with aloes, colocynth, rhubarb, or
podophyllin.The rectum should always be examined, as impacted fecal
masses will often be found there.{658}

ENTERALGIA (INTESTINAL COLIC).BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Enterodynia, Tormina, Colicodynia, Colalgia, Dolor colicus,
Passio colica, Spasmus intestinorum, Ileus spasmodicus, Spasmus
ventriculi, Neuralgia mesenterica; Spasm of the bowels, Cholick or
Cholick Colic, and Pain in the Belly; _Ger._, Das Banchgrimmem, Die
Kolik; _Fr._, La colique.HISTORY.--Colic is described by Hippocrates.[1] He recommended the use
of emetics and gave other sound advice regarding the treatment of the
affection.Galen[2] administered sedatives, as opium and henbane, and
he advised them to be combined with carminatives.Aretaeus[3] speaks of
the pain of colic extending to the back, limbs, and testicles, and also
states that when affecting the sides of the body it may be confounded
with pleurisy, hepatitis, or splenitis.Alexander[4] points out the
differential diagnosis of the disease and directs a proper course of
treatment.Cupping, friction of the extremities, and dry fomentations
were recommended by Celsus;[5] and internally he advocated a mixture of
poppy, anise, pepper, etc.Aetius[6] describes the affection.Serapion[7] and Avicenna[8] treated of colic more clearly than any
previous writers had done, and advised narcotics administered by the
mouth and rectum.Atony of the bowels is given as a cause of the
disease by Haly Abbas,[9] and Alsaharavius adds[10] to the etiology a
hot intemperament, indurated feces, and poisonous medicines.Rhazes[11]
directs the administration of emetics when the colic is due to
indigestion.[Footnote 1: _De Affect._, xv.][Footnote 5: _Medicina_, Libri octo, iv.[Footnote 9: _Pract._, vii.Daniel travelled to the garden.[Footnote 10: _Ibid._, xvii.NATURE AND DEFINITION.--Enteralgia is the name given to intestinal pain
which is independent of indigestion and of inflammation or other
organic change in the wall of the bowel, and corresponds to gastralgia
and other visceral neuralgias.It involves the nerves which pass to the
intestine along the line of attachment of the mesentery, and which are
derived from the superior mesenteric plexus, with a prolongation from
the junction of the right pneumogastric nerve with the coeliac
plexus.[12]

[Footnote 12: The very extensive distribution of terminal
nerve-filaments in the intestine is an explanation of the frequency and
severity of attacks of intestinal pain.But weaker still were he whom fate has plac'd

Hyphenation is inconsistent.In view of the Roman context, the word "virtus" was left in place in
a speech by Manlius in Act III, although it may be a misprint for
"virtue".You were
getting on so well at school."It was a thought that had often come to Dan, but he wouldn't own it, for
he did not wish to add to his mother's sadness."Oh, well, mother," he said, "something may turn up for us, so we won't
look down in the mouth.""I have got my bundled work ready, Dan, if you can carry it round to Mr."Yes, mother, I'll carry it.I hope he'll
pay you to-night, for our rent comes due to-morrow."Shall
we have enough to pay it?"Even if old Gripp pays for the vests?"Dan whistled--a whistle of dismay and anxiety, for he well knew that the
landlord was a hard man.GRIPP'S CLOTHING STORE.Nathan Gripp's clothing store was located about a quarter of a mile from
the City Hall, on Chatham street.Not many customers from Fifth avenue
owned him as their tailor, and he had no reputation up town.His prices
were undeniably low, though his clothes were dear enough in the end.His patrons were in general from the rural districts, or city residents
of easy tastes and limited means.The interior of the store was ill-lighted, and looked like a dark
cavern.But nearly half the stock was displayed at the door, or on the
sidewalk, Mr.Gripp himself, or his leading salesman, standing in the
door-way with keen, black eyes, trying to select from the moving crowds
possible customers.He sold his clothes cheap, but they
cost him little.He paid the lowest prices for work, and whenever told
that his wages would not keep body and soul together, he simply
remarked:

"That's nothing to me, my good woman.If you don't like the pay, leave
the work for somebody else."Gripp could not afford to
leave the work for somebody else.Half wages were better than none, and
they patiently kept on wearing out their strength that Nathan might wax
rich, and live in good style up town.Gripp himself was standing in the door-way when Dan, with the bundle
of vests under his arm, stopped in front of the store.Gripp was a
little doubtful whether our hero wished to become a customer, but a
glance at the bundle dispelled his uncertainty, and revealed the nature
of his errand."I've brought home half a dozen vests," said Dan.asked Gripp, abruptly, for he never lavished any of the
suavity, which was a valuable part of his stock in trade, on his work
people.Here, Samuel, take the boy's bundle, and see
if the work is well done."It was on the tip of Dan's tongue to resent the doubt which these words
implied, but he prudently remained silent.The clerk, a callow youth, with long tow- locks, made sleek with
bear's grease, stopped picking his teeth, and motioned to Dan to come
forward."Here, young feller," he said, "hand over your bundle."The clerk surveyed the boy with a look of disapproval in his fishy
eyes."Didn't you call me a young feller?""You've called me one twice, but I ain't at all particular.I'd just as
lief call you an old feller," said Dan, affably."Look here, young chap, I don't like your manners," said the clerk, with
an irritating consciousness that he was getting the worst of the verbal
encounter."I'm sorry for that," answered Dan, "because they're the best I've got."asked the salesman, with a feeble
attempt at humor."Yes," was Dan's unexpected rejoinder."That's the way I amuse my
leisure hours."Daniel travelled to the bathroom.muttered the tallow-faced young man, "I'll take a look at
them."He opened the bundle, and examined the vests with an evident desire to
find something wrong.He couldn't find any defect, but that didn't prevent his saying:

"They ain't over-well made.""Well, they won't be over-well paid," retorted Dan."I don't know if we ought to pay for them at all.""Honesty is the best policy, young feller," said Dan."Wait here a
minute till I speak to Mr.He kept Dan before the counter, and approached the proprietor.Gripp, stroking his jet-black
whiskers."Pretty well, sir, but the boy is impudent.""He keeps calling me 'young feller.'""He don't seem to have any respect for me--or you," he added, shrewdly.He cared very little about his clerk, but he
resented any want of respect to himself.He felt that the balance at his
bankers was large enough to insure him a high degree of consideration
from his work-people at least."And the boy wants his pay, I suppose.""He hasn't asked for it, but he will."Tell him we only pay when a full dozen are finished and brought in.We'll credit him, or his mother, with these.""That'll pay them off," thought the astute clothing merchant.Samuel received this order with inward satisfaction, and went back
smiling."Well, young feller," said he, "it's all right.The vests ain't
over-well done, but we'll keep 'em."It seems to me you've forgotten something," he said."You haven't paid me for the work."We'll pay when the next half dozen are brought in.This was entirely out of the usual
course, and he knew very well that the delay would be a great
inconvenience."We've always been paid when we brought in work," he said."We've changed our rule," said the clerk, nonchalantly."We only pay
when a full dozen are brought in."We need the money, and can't
wait.""It's my orders, young feller."Then I'll speak to him," said Dan, promptly.Sandra journeyed to the office.Gripp," said he, "I've just brought in half a dozen vests, but your
clerk here won't pay me for them.""You will get your pay, young man, when you bring in another half
dozen.""Will you pay me to-night as a favor?"pleaded Dan, humbling himself for
his mother's sake."I can't break over my rule," said Nathan Gripp."Besides, Samuel says
the work isn't very well done."ejaculated the angry Samuel, his tallowy
complexion putting on a faint flush."Didn't I tell you he was
impudent?"Nathan Gripp's small black eyes snapped viciously."Boy," said he, "leave my store directly.How dare you address me in
such a way, you young tramp?""I'm no more a tramp than yourself," retorted Dan, now thoroughly angry."Samuel, come here, and put out this boy!"exclaimed Nathan, too
dignified to attempt the task himself.Samuel advanced, nothing loth, his fishy eyes gleaming with pleasure."You're a couple of swindlers!""You won't pay for honest
work."Samuel seized Dan by the shoulder, and attempted to obey orders, but our
hero doubled him up with a blow from his fist, and the luckless clerk,
faint and gasping, staggered and nearly fell.Dan stepped out on the sidewalk, and raising his hat, said, with mock
politeness, "Good-morning, gentlemen!"and walked away, leaving Gripp
and his assistant speechless with anger.[Illustration: "You're a couple of swindlers!""You won't
pay for honest work."When Dan's excitement was over, he felt that he had won a barren
victory.He had certainly been badly treated, and was justified in
yielding to his natural indignation; but for all that he had acted
unwisely.Nathan Gripp had not refused payment, he had only postponed it, and as
he had the decided advantage, which money always has when pitted against
labor, it would have been well to have been conciliatory.Now Gripp
would undoubtedly annoy him with further delay, and refuse to give Mrs."I suppose I've acted like a fool," said Dan to himself, with
compunction."My spunk is always getting the better of me, and I am
afraid poor mother will have to suffer.Well, there's no use crying for
spilt milk; I must see what I can do to mend matters."While these thoughts were passing through Dan's mind he found himself
passing the clothing establishment of Jackson & Co., who were special
rivals of Mr."Perhaps I can get some work for mother here," thought Dan."I'll try,
at any rate."He entered, and looking about him, attracted the attention of a clerk."Do you want something in our line to-day?""Yes, I do," said Dan, "if you're giving things away; but as I've got a
note of ten thousand dollars to meet to-morrow, I can't pay anything
out.""Your credit ought to be good," said the salesman, smiling, "but we
don't trust.""All right," said Dan; "I may as well proceed to business.One of our hands is sick, and if your
mother understands how to do the work, we may be able to give her some."The young man went to the rear of the store, and returned with the
proprietor.asked the proprietor, a big man, with
sandy whiskers.He was an Englishman, as any one might see, and a decided improvement on
Nathan Gripp, whom he cordially hated."Yes, sir; she has been making vests for the last two years.""No, sir; she has discharged him."He rather enjoyed this
allusion to his rival.He paid her starvation wages and made her wait for the money."I don't admire him much myself," said the Englishman."How much now did
he pay for vest-making?"There is so much competition that we
have to sell low.""Mother would rather make for you at eighteen cents than for Gripp for
twenty," said Dan.Jackson was pleased, but he said, by way of drawing out Dan:

"How do you know but I am a mean skinflint, too?""You don't look like one," said the boy."Joseph," said he, "have we any vests ready for making?"We have some bundles of half a dozen each.""Take this boy's name and address and give him one.My boy, we will pay
your mother twenty-five cents each, but we expect good work.""You will be satisfied, sir," said Dan, confidently, and he left the
store in excellent spirits."It's turned out right, after all," thought he; "but I am afraid we
shall miss the money old Gripp owed mother.I don't know how we are
going to pay the rent to-morrow.We shall be over two dollars short
unless something turns up."Dan carried the bundle of work home, and told his mother what had
happened.She was pleased with the increase of pay, but that was in the
future.It would be a week before she could collect any pay from Jackson
& Co., and the landlord would not wait."I wish I could think of some way of raising money," said Dan, putting
his face between his hands and looking thoughtful."If you only had some
jewels, mother, that we could raise money on now, we would be all
right.""I have nothing but my wedding-ring," said Mrs.Don't part with that unless you are obliged
to.""I would rather not, Dan, but if there is no other way----"

"There must be another way.Just don't think of
it any more, mother."Then we shall have all the forenoon to forage round in.It's only two
dollars and a half we want.I ought to be able to raise two dollars and
a half.""That is a great deal of money to us now, Dan.""I wonder whether Shorty wouldn't lend it to me?""He is a little hump-backed dwarf that keeps a cigar stand down on
Broadway, not far from Trinity Church.He has a good trade, and doesn't
waste his money."I hope he will be willing to grant your request, Dan."He's a good-natured fellow, Shorty is, and he'll do it,
if he can.I'll see him the first thing to-morrow morning."Somewhat cheered by Dan's confident tone, Mrs.Mordaunt went to sleep as
early as usual, forgetting the trouble possibly in store.The next morning, before selling his papers, Dan went round to Shorty's
stand."Good-morning, Dan," said the dwarf, in a singularly melodious voice."I am going to ask a favor of you," said Dan, abruptly."Our rent's due to-day, and we are two dollars and a half short.I can
make the fifty cents before noon.Can you lend me two dollars till I am
able to pay it?"To Dan's dismay Shorty shook his head."I wish I could, Dan, but there's something in the way.""If you're afraid I won't pay you back, you needn't think of that.I
never went back on a fellow that lent me money yet.""I am not afraid of trusting you, Dan, but I haven't got the money.""I understand," said Dan, coldly, for he suspected this to be a
subterfuge."No, you don't understand," said Shorty, eagerly."You think what I say
is a sham, but you wouldn't if you knew all.""If I knew all," repeated Dan, surprised."Yes, I shall have to tell you.I didn't mean to, but I don't want you
to misunderstand me.The fact is, Dan," Shorty added, sheepishly, "I've
got more than myself to provide for now.""I was married yesterday, Dan," said the cigar dealer, almost
apologetically, "and I've been buying furniture, and the fact is, I
haven't got a cent to spare.""Of course you haven't," said Dan."No, Dan, she's rather tall.Dan looked, and saw a tall woman, of twenty-five or thereabouts,
approaching the cigar stand.She was very plain, with a large mouth and
a long, aquiline nose.John journeyed to the garden."That's my wife," said the cigar dealer, regarding his tall partner with
evident pride."Julia, my dear, this is my friend, Dan Mordaunt.""Glad to see any friend of my husband," said the lady, in a deep, hoarse
voice, which might have been mistaken for a man's."So I will, thank you," answered Dan, surveying the female grenadier
with a wondering glance.-- Varick street, Dan, and I shall be very glad to see
you any evening."said Dan to himself, "that's the queerest match I ever
heard of.She might take Shorty up in her arms and carry him off.I
don't think he'll beat her very often," and Dan smiled at the thought.The morning wore away, and at eleven o'clock Dan had earned forty cents.There didn't seem to be much prospect of
raising the rent before twelve o'clock.CHAPTER V.

EFFECTING A LOAN.As Dan stood on the sidewalk with his bundle of papers, and only forty
cents toward the two dollars and a half required for the rent, he felt
like many a business man who has a note to meet and not enough money on
hand to pay it.Indeed, he was worse off, for generally business men
have friends who can help them with a temporary loan, but Dan's friends
were quite as poor as himself.One, however, Dick Stanton, a mere boy,
had the reputation of being more saving than his companions.It was
known that he had an account in the Bowery Savings Bank, and among the
street boys he was considered wealthy."Perhaps I can borrow two dollars of him," thought Dan, as Dick passed
him on his way to Canal street."I say, Dick," said Dan, "stop a minute."I want you to lend me two dollars.Our rent is due, and I can raise it
all but that."Dick shook his head, and was about to speak, when Dan said hurriedly,
for he felt that it was his last chance:

"You needn't be afraid of me, Dick; I'll pay you sure, and give you more
interest, too, than you get in the bank.""I haven't got any money in the bank, Dan.""You had last week," said Dan, suspiciously."So I had, but I haven't now.""You don't want to lend--that's what's the matter."I'm not a bit afraid of lending to you, but I
have lent my money already."asked Dan, ungrammatically, falling into a mistake made by
plenty of greater age and better experience than himself."Of course it
isn't any of my business," he added, "if you don't want to tell.""I don't mind telling you, Dan.She's got two
children, and a hard time to get along.Perhaps I shall never see it
again, but I couldn't refuse her.""Of course you couldn't," said Dan, heartily."You've done right, and
you won't be sorry for it.I wish I knew some way of making two dollars
before twelve o'clock.""Are you in urgent need of two dollars, my boy?"Dan turned, and met the face of the stranger introduced in the first
chapter."Have you been extravagant and run up bills, Dan?""No, sir; the only bill we have is the rent, and that comes due this
noon.""I thought you said you wanted to borrow _two_ dollars.""I've got four dollars toward it, sir.""Do you often fall behind when rent day comes, Dan?""No, sir; this is the first time in two years."Has business been duller than usual during
the last month?""Yes, sir, I think it has.There hasn't been as much news in the papers,
and my sales have fallen off."Mother has a dollar and twenty cents due her, and she can't collect
it."Gripp won't pay till she has made a full dozen.""I've a great mind to buy the debt of you.""I wish you would, sir," said Dan, eagerly."That would leave only sixty
cents short, for I shall make ten cents more before twelve o'clock, it's
likely."To put you quite at ease, I mean to lend
you five dollars, and help you collect your mother's bill.""You are very kind, sir," said Dan, surprised and grateful; "but I don't
need so much.""You may get short again when I am not here to assist you.""Are you not afraid I shall never pay you, sir?""That thought won't keep me awake nights," said the gentleman, laughing."You sha'n't lose anything by me, sir; I promise you that," said Dan,
earnestly."Then come into the hotel with me, and we will arrange the matter in a
business-like way."Dan followed his new friend into the Astor House, and up stairs into a
pleasant bedroom, which in its comfortable apartments reminded Dan of
the days before his father's failure."I wish I could live so again," he thought."I don't like a
tenement-house."Grant--for this was his name--took writing materials from his
valise, and seated himself at a table."I am going to draw up a note for you to sign," he said."I probably
understand better than you the necessary form."His pen ran rapidly over the paper, and in a minute or two he handed Dan
the following form of acknowledgment:


     "NEW YORK, Sept."For value received I promise to pay to Alexander Grant five
     dollars on demand with interest."Grant, "put your name at the bottom.""I added 'with interest,' but only as a form; I shall require none."interest make it
amount to in a year?""Five dollars and thirty cents," answered Dan, promptly.I see you have not forgotten what you learned in school.""I have ciphered through cube root," said Dan, with some pride."I am
not sure whether I remember that now, but I could do any sum in square
root.""It is a pity you could not have remained in school.""I should like to; but it's no use crying for spilt milk.""As long as you didn't spill it yourself," added Mr."No, sir; it was not my fault that I had to leave school."Daniel went to the office.Grant folded up the note and carefully deposited it in his wallet."The next thing is to hand you the money," he said."Shall I give you a
five-dollar bill, or small bills?""Small bills, sir, if it is just as convenient."Grant placed in Dan's hands two two-dollar bills and a one.Gripp for the money
due your mother.It is as well to have it in your own handwriting.I
won't tell you how to write it."On the whole," said he, "I believe I will take you with me when I call
upon Mr.Can you call here at three o'clock this afternoon?"Gripp will be any more
polite to me than he was to you.""He will be surprised to see me in your company," said Dan, laughing."It is a good thing to surprise the enemy, Dan.said Dan to himself, as he emerged into the street."Who would have thought that a stranger would lend me so large a sum?Now, if I could only sell the four papers
I have left before twelve o'clock.I don't want to get stuck on them."In ten minutes he had sold his
papers, and turned his steps toward the humble home where his mother was
awaiting, not without anxiety, the visit of an unamiable landlord.Mordaunt looked up anxiously as Dan entered the room.She had
little expectation that he had been able in one morning to make up the
large deficiency in the sum reserved for the rent, but there was a
possibility, and she clung to that.Dan thought of postponing the
relation of his good news, but when he saw his mother's anxious face, he
felt that it would be cruel.So when she said, "Well, Dan?""I've got it, mother," he said."You see He hasn't forgotten us," said Dan, gleefully."No, my boy, it is a rebuke to my momentary want of faith.How could you
raise so large a sum?Surely you did not earn it in one forenoon?"I'm not smart enough to earn two dollars
before twelve o'clock.""But you've got the money, Dan?""Look at this, mother," and Dan displayed the bills."I didn't know we had a friend left, able or willing to lend us that
sum.""I borrowed them of Alexander Grant, of St.Louis, and gave my note for
them," answered Dan, in a tone of some importance."He's a new friend of mine, mother.I haven't known him over twenty-four
hours.As the old friends have treated us so badly, I'm goin' in for new
ones.""He's very kind to a stranger, Dan.Heaven will reward him, I am sure."I should enjoy helping
those who needed it.If I ever get rich--though it doesn't look much
like it now--I will do all the good I can.I wonder rich men don't do it
oftener.""It springs from thoughtlessness sometimes, Dan.""And from selfishness pretty often," added Dan, whose views of human
nature were considerably less favorable than they had been in his more
prosperous days."A good many men are like Tom Carver, as he is now and
will be when he is grown up.""Perhaps there are more good and generous men than we suppose, Dan,"
urged his mother, who liked to think well of her fellow-beings.Just you step into
the bedroom, mother."Mordaunt had no desire to meet Mr.Grab, but she was a little
afraid of Dan's impetuous temper."You will treat him respectfully, won't you, Dan?"she urged, as she
turned to go into the adjoining room."I'll treat him with all the respect he deserves, mother," he answered.Mordaunt looked a little doubtful, for she understood Dan, but did
not say more, for Mr."Don't come out, whatever you hear, mother," said Dan, in a low voice."I'll come out all right, though I shall tantalize him a little at
first."Dan called out, in a loud, clear tone.The door opened, and a thin, undersized man, with bushy red hair and the
look of a cross mastiff, entered the room.Before his entrance Dan had seated himself in the plain wooden
rocking-chair with his feet on a cricket.He looked quite easy and
unconcerned."You might call me _Mr._ Grab," returned the landlord, angrily."I've no objection, I'm sure, Mr."I am perfectly well, and I am not yellow at all."I wouldn't do that for a cent, Mr.I am glad you feel well,
though you ain't looking so.It's very friendly of you to come round to
see me and mother.""She is engaged just now, and won't have the pleasure of seeing you.""I've seen more of you than I want to already," said Grab."That isn't talking like a friend, Mr.Grab," said Dan, "when I'm so
glad to see you."Of course I have come on business, and you know very well what that
business is, you young monkey."It isn't about the
rent, is it?""Oh, dear, how could I have forgotten that it was rent-day," said Dan,
with well-feigned confusion.He concluded that he wasn't going to collect
the rent, and that always chafed him."It's your business to know when rent-day comes," he said, bringing down
his fist with such emphasis on the table that he hurt his knuckles, to
Dan's secret delight."Please don't break the table, Grab," said Dan.said Grab, surveying his red knuckles."We haven't got any blasting powder, and I don't think it would be a
very interesting experiment.It might blow you up, for you are nearest
to it.""Have done with this trifling, boy," said the landlord."I am afraid you got out of the wrong end of the bed this morning, Mr."Look here, boy," said the landlord, savagely, "do you know what I am
tempted to do?""I am strongly tempted to chastise you for your impudence."Dan looked critically at the small, thin form, and secretly decided that
Mr.Grab would find it difficult to carry out his threat."I don't believe I shall sleep any
to-night."Grab made a motion to pound on the table again, but he looked at his
red knuckles and wisely forbore."I can't waste any more time," he said."You must pay your rent, or turn
out.The rent must be paid to-day, or out you go.""Really, he
ought not to tease the poor man so.He has such a bad temper, he might
hurt Dan."As soon as he pays her, I will call
round at your office and pay you.""I won't let you stay here another night, and
I mean to have security for my money, too."So saying, the landlord seized the bundle of vests which lay on the
table beside him.He sprang to his feet, his eyes flashing with anger."Then pay me my rent," said the landlord, recoiling a little."Put down that bundle before you say another word about rent.It isn't
my mother's or mine."What do you mean, boy, by your impudence?"demanded the landlord, a
little uneasily."I mean that if you take that bundle from the room, I shall put you in
charge of the nearest policeman on a charge of stealing.""That is nonsense," said Grab; but he looked nervous, and laid down the
bundle."Now, as I don't want any more of your
company, I'll pay the rent, if you'll give me a receipt.""It isn't my business what you think.There, that is settled, and now,
Mr.Grab, I have the honor of wishing you good-evening.I hope you won't
hurt your knuckles again."Grab left the room, inwardly wishing that he could wring Dan's neck.asked his mother, reproachfully, as she
re-entered the room."Didn't he turn out the poor Donovans on
a cold day last winter?"Not as long as we pay the rent."Punctually at three o'clock Dan knocked at the door of Mr.Grant's room
in the Astor House.That gentleman looked at his watch as he admitted our hero."You are punctual to the minute," he said."I'll tell you why," answered Dan, smiling."I always keep it at
Tiffany's.I don't dare to carry it for fear it will get out of order.""You ought to have a watch," said Mr."Then I could be sure to keep my business
appointments.Now I have to depend on the City Hall clock.I'd rather
look at it than carry it round.""Well, Dan, do you think Mr.He'll think you are going to buy some
clothes.I don't think he'll be very happy to see me.""He must see us both, or neither."Yes, sir--good enough for me.I don't think you would like to patronize
his establishment.""By the way, Dan, you have given me an order for money, and I have not
handed you the equivalent.""You may not get the money, sir.""I will make the effort at any rate.By the way, Dan, that coat of yours
is getting shabby.""It is the best I have, sir.Boys in my business don't have to dress
much."Please hand me my hat, and we will start."One or two of Dan's associates
whom they encountered on the way, were surprised to see him walking on
terms of apparent friendly companionship with a well-to-do stranger, but
decided that Dan was probably acting as his guide.Gripp standing as usual in the door-way of his shop
watching for customers.He did not at first observe Dan, but his
attention was drawn to Mr."Walk in, sir," he said, obsequiously."You will find what you want
here.Styles fashionable, and as for prices--we defy competition."Alexander Grant paused, and looked critically about him.He understood
very well the sort of establishment he was about to enter, and would not
have thought of doing so but in Dan's interests.He stepped over the threshold, and Dan was about to follow, when the
eagle eye of Mr."Don't you come round here
any more."Dan did not answer, for he knew Mr.Grant turned back, and said, quietly:

"To whom are you speaking, sir?""I beg your pardon, sir--it's that boy.""Then, sir, you will oblige me by stopping at once.That boy is in my
company and under my protection."Nathan Gripp stared as if transfixed.He was here
yesterday, and acted outrageously.He is in my company, and if I enter the
store he will.""Oh, of course, if he's with you he can come in.Samuel, show the
gentleman what he wants."Dan smiled, and nothing but a sense of his own interest prevented Mr.asked the callow young man named Samuel,
glaring at Dan in vivid remembrance of the blow which had doubled him
up."Have you any coats and vests that will fit this young gentleman?"repeated Samuel, mechanically, glancing at Dan in
silent hatred."That means me, Samuel," said Dan, mischievously."Samuel is an old
friend of mine, Mr."I think we can fit him," said Samuel, by no means relishing the task of
waiting upon his young opponent."Take off your coat, young feller.""I'll be ---- if I do," muttered the young man.Dan took off his coat, and tried on the one submitted to his inspection.He afterward tried on the vest, and they proved to be a good fit."Yes, sir, they fit as well as if they had been made for me.""What is the price of these articles, young man?""He'll take eight," suggested Dan, in a low voice.Grant knew well enough the ways of Chatham street merchants to
appreciate the suggestion."That is too high," he said, quietly.Samuel, who was trained to read customers, after a glance at Mr.Grant's
face, prepared to reduce the price."We might say eleven," he said, meditatively."You don't want us to give 'em away?"said Samuel, in the tone of one
whose reasonable demands had been objected to."There is no fear of that, I apprehend," returned Mr."I've no objection, I'm sure," remarked Dan, on his own account."I'd make a few remarks to you, young feller, if you were alone," he
read in the eyes of the indignant salesman, and Dan enjoyed the
restraint which he knew Samuel was putting upon himself."You are still asking too much," said the customer."The work didn't cost you much, I presume.""We pay the highest prices for work in this establishment, sir," said
Samuel, hastily."They pay twenty cents apiece for
making vests.""We pay more than that to our best hands," said Samuel."You told me you never paid more," retorted Dan."Young man," said he, "I will give you eight dollars for the clothes."As the regular price was eight dollars--when they couldn't get any
more--Samuel felt authorized to conclude the bargain without consulting
Mr."No," said Dan, "I'll wear 'em.Samuel felt it derogatory to his dignity to obey the orders of our hero,
but there was no alternative."Now write me a receipt for the price," said Mr."I have an order upon you for the balance," he said."I don't understand," ejaculated Samuel."Your principal owes my young friend, or his mother, one dollar and
twenty cents for work.This you will receive as part of the price.""We can't take the order, sir," he said."The boy's money is not yet
due.""Yes, sir; but it is our rule not to pay till a whole dozen is
delivered.""Then it is a rule which you must break," said Mr.Nathan Gripp did not like to lose the sale on the one hand, or abdicate
his position on the other."Tell your mother," he said to Dan, "that when she has finished another
half-dozen vests I will pay her the whole."He reflected that the stranger would be gone, and Dan would be in his
power."Thank you," said Dan, "but mother's agreed to work for Jackson."Then you'll have to wait for your pay," said Mr."Don't you care to sell this suit?""Yes, sir, but under the circumstances we must ask all cash.""Then I don't think we care to sell," said Gripp, allowing his anger to
overcome his interest.I think, Dan, we can find quite as good a bargain at
Jackson's.Gripp, do I understand that you decline to pay this
bill?""I will pay when the other half-dozen vests are made," said Gripp,
stubbornly.The bill is mine, and it is with me you
have to deal.Settle the bill now, or I shall
immediately put it in a lawyer's hands, who will know how to compel you
to pay it.""Take this gentleman's money, Samuel," said Gripp, in a tone of
annoyance.Dan walked out of the store better
dressed than he had been since the days of his prosperity."By continuing to care for your mother, my lad.You are lucky to have a
mother living.Now, my lad, what do you
think of my success in collecting bills?""You were too many for old Gripp, sir."He doesn't deserve to, for he grows rich by defrauding the poor who
work for him."Opposite the City Hall Park Dan and his friend separated."I shall not see you again, my boy," said Mr.Grant, "for I take the
evening train."That's a good man," said Dan, as he wended his way homeward."If there
were more such, it would be good for poor people like mother and me.If
I ever get rich, I mean to help along those that need it."MIKE RAFFERTY'S TRICK.Grant had lent him, and the
result was that for two months he was comparatively easy in his
circumstances.His mother earned five cents more daily, on account of
the higher price she received for work, and though this was a trifle, it
was by no means to be despised where the family income was so small as
in the case of the Mordaunts."Mother," said he, "I suppose I ought to be contented with earning
enough to pay our expenses, but I should like to be saving something.""Yes, Dan, it would be pleasant.But we ought to be thankful for what we
are now receiving.""But, mother, suppose I should fall sick?"Don't mention such a thing, Dan," she said."But it might happen, for all that.""Don't be frightened, mother," answered Dan, laughing."I'm as strong as
a horse, and can eat almost as much.Still, you know, we would feel
safer to have a little money in the savings-bank.""There isn't much chance of that, Dan, unless we earn more than we do
now."Well, I suppose there is no use thinking of it.By
the way, mother, you've got enough money on hand to pay the rent
to-morrow, haven't you?""Yes, Dan, and a dollar over."The door of the room was partly open, and the last part of the
conversation was heard by Mike Rafferty, the son of the tenant who
occupied the room just over the Mordaunts.He was a ne'er-do-well, who
had passed more than one term of imprisonment at Blackwell's Island.His
mother was an honest, hard-working washerwoman, who toiled early and
late to support herself and her three children.Mike might have given
her such assistance that she could have lived quite comfortably, for her
own earnings were by no means inconsiderable.Her wash-tub paid her much
more than Mrs.Mordaunts needle could possibly win, and she averaged a
dollar a day where her more refined neighbor made but twenty-five
cents.But Mike, instead of helping, was an additional burden.He got
his meals regularly at home, but contributed scarcely a dollar a month
to the common expenses.He was a selfish rowdy, who was likely to belong
permanently to the shiftless and dangerous classes of society.Mike had from time to time made approaches to intimacy with Dan, who was
nearly two years younger, but Dan despised him for his selfishly
burdening his mother with his support, and didn't encourage him.Naturally, Mike hated Dan, and pronounced him "stuck up" and proud,
though our hero associated familiarly with more than one boy ranking no
higher in the social scale than Mike Rafferty.Only the day before, Mike, finding himself out of funds, encountering
Dan on the stairs, asked for the loan of a quarter."I have no money to spare," answered Dan."You've got money, Dan; I saw you take out some a minute ago.""Yes, I've got the money, but I won't lend it.""You're a mane skinflint," said Mike, provoked."Because you've got the money, and you won't lend it.""What do you want to do with it?""I want to go to the Old Bowery to-night, if you must know.""If you wanted it for your mother I might have lent it to you, though I
need all I can earn for my own mother.""It's for my mother I want it, thin," said Mike."I guess I won't go to
the theater to-night."Your mother would never see the color of it.""Won't you lend me, thin?"If you want money, why don't you earn it, as I do?"If you go to work and sell papers or black boots, you
will be able to help your mother and pay your way to the theater
yourself.""Kape your advice to yourself," said Mike, sullenly."You'd rather have my money," said Dan, good-humoredly.I'll be _mane_, then.""I'd like to put a head on you," muttered Mike."Oh, you think you're mighty smart wid your jokes," said Mike.Dan smiled and walked off, leaving Mike more his enemy than ever.Mordaunt say that she had more than
the rent already saved up.He knew that it
must amount to several dollars, and this he felt would keep him in
cigarettes and pay for evenings at the theater for several days."I wish I had it," he said to himself."I wonder where the ould woman
kapes it."The more Mike thought of it the more he coveted this money, and he set
to work contriving means to get possession of it.About three o'clock in the afternoon he knocked at Mrs.It's bad news I bring you about Dan."she exclaimed, her heart
giving a great bound."He's been run over, ma'am, by a hoss, in front of the Astor House, and
they took him into the drug store at the corner."I guess he's broke his leg," said Mike.John went to the office.Mordaunt, trembling with apprehension, her faltering
limbs almost refusing to bear her weight, was on her way to the Astor
House.As Mike had calculated, she did not stop to lock the door.The young scape-grace entered the deserted room, rummaged about till he
found the scanty hoard reserved for the landlord, and then went off
whistling."Now I'll have a bully time," he said to himself."Didn't I fool the
ould woman good?"MIKE'S THEFT IS DISCOVERED.Dan was standing in front of the Astor House, talking to a boy
acquaintance, when his mother tottered up to him in a state of great
nervous agitation."Why, mother, what's the matter?"It occurred to him that his mother must
have lost her mind."Yes; they told me you were run over, and had your leg broken.""Then I wish I had him here," said Dan, indignantly; "I'd let him know
whether my leg is broken or not."Haven't you been run over, then?""Not that I know of, and I guess it couldn't be done without my knowing
it.""I don't know how I
got here, I was so agitated.""When did Mike Rafferty tell you this cock-and-bull story, mother?"He said you had been taken into a drug store,
and wanted me to come right over.""It's a mean trick he played on you, mother," said Dan, indignantly."I
don't see what made him do it.""He must have meant it as a joke.""I don't mind it now, Dan, since I have you safe.He didn't know how much he was distressing me."You may forgive him if you want to; I
sha'n't."I feel a good deal happier than I did when I
was hurrying over here."Sandra went back to the hallway.I have sold my papers, and sha'n't work any
more this afternoon.I hope I can come across
him soon.""I left him at the door of our room.""Did you lock the door when you came away, mother?""There isn't much to take, Dan," said Mrs."We shall be in a pretty pickle if that is lost.""You don't think Mike would take it do you, Dan?""I think he would if he knew where to find it.""I wish I had brought it with me," said Mrs.Mordaunt, in a tone of
anxiety."Don't fret, mother; I guess it's all right.""Perhaps you had better go home at once without waiting for me, Dan."In my pocket-book, in the drawer of the work-table."Well, I'll be off, and will meet
you at the room."Dan was not long in reaching his humble home.The more he thought of it,
the more he distrusted Mike, and feared that he might have had a
sinister design in the deception he had practiced upon his mother.To
lose the rent money would be a serious matter.Grab hated him, he
knew full well, and would show no mercy, while in the short time
remaining it would be quite impossible to make up the necessary sum.Dan sprang up the stairs, several at a bound, and made his way at once
to the little work-table.He pulled the drawer open without ceremony,
and in feverish haste rummaged about until, to his great joy, he found
the pocket-book."It's all right, after all," he said."Mike isn't so bad as I thought
him."He opened the pocket-book, and his countenance fell.There was a
twenty-five cent scrip in one of the compartments, and that was all."He's stolen the money, after all," he said, his heart sinking."What
are we going to do now?""That is all that is left," answered Dan, holding up the scrip."Mike could not be wicked enough to take it."You don't know him as I do, mother.He's a mean
thief, and he sent you off to have a clear field."I couldn't think of that, or anything else, Dan, when I thought you
were hurt."Grab will be angry when he finds we can't pay
him.""I will try to find Mike; and if I do, I will get the money if I can.Dan went up stairs at once, and knocked at Mrs.She came to the door, her arms dripping with suds, for she had been
washing."And how is your mother to-day?"asked Dan, abruptly, too impatient to answer the question."No; he went out quarter of an hour ago.""Did he tell you where he was going, Mrs.He said he was going over to Brooklyn to see if he could
get a job, shure.I'm sorry to tell you that Mike has played a
bad trick on my mother.""Oh, whirra, whirra, what a bye he is!"Mary journeyed to the kitchen."He's
always up to something bad.Sorra bit of worruk he does, and I at the
wash-tub all day long.""He's a bad son to you, Mrs.And what kind of trick has
he played on your good mother?""He told her that I had been run over and broken my leg.Of course she
went out to find me, thinking it was all true, and while she was away he
took the money from her pocket-book
