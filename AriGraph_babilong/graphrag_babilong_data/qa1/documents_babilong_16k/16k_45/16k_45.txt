"I will go back to the house," he said, "and have mamma put up a nice
lunch, and you and the other children can eat your dinner here by the fire.So can you, Webb and Amy, and then you can look after the youngsters.Suppose you have a little picnic, which, in March, will
be a thing to remember.Alf, you can come with me, and while mamma is
preparing the lunch you can run to the market and get some oysters and
clams, and these, with potatoes, you can roast in the ashes of a smaller
fire, which Ned and Johnnie can look after under Webb's superintendence.Wouldn't you like my little plan, Amy?""Yes, indeed," she replied, putting her hands caressingly within his arm."It's hard to think you are old when you know so well what we young
people like.I didn't believe that this day could be brighter or jollier,
and yet your plan has made the children half-wild."Indeed, Alf had already given his approval by tearing off toward the
house for the materials of this unprecedented March feast in the woods,
and the old gentleman, as if made buoyant by the good promise of his
little project in the children's behalf, followed with a step wonderfully
elastic for a man of fourscore."Well, Heaven grant I may attain an age like that!"said Webb, looking
wistfully after him."There is more of spring than autumn in father yet,
and I don't believe there will be any winter in his life.Well, Amy, like
the birds and squirrels around us, we shall dine out-of-doors today.You
must be mistress of the banquet; Ned, Johnnie, and I place ourselves
under your orders; don't we, Johnnie?""To be sure, uncle Webb; only I'm so crazy over all this fun that I'm
sure I can never do anything straight.""Well, then, 'bustle!"I believe with Maggie that
housekeeping and dining well are high arts, and not humdrum necessities.Webb, I need a broad, flat rock.Please provide one at once, while
Johnnie gathers clean dry leaves for plates.You, Ned, can put lots of
dry sticks between the stones there, and uncle Webb will kindle the right
kind of a fire to leave plenty of hot coals and ashes.Now is the time
for him to make his science useful."Was it the exquisitely pure air
and the exhilarating spring sunshine that sent the blood tingling through
his veins?Or was it the presence, tones, and gestures of a girl with
brow and neck like the snow that glistened on the mountain <DW72>s above
them, and large true eyes that sometimes seemed gray and again blue?Amy's developing beauty was far removed from a fixed type of prettiness,
and he felt this in a vague way.The majority of the girls of his
acquaintance had a manner rather than an individuality, and looked and
acted much the same whenever he saw them.They were conventionalized
after some received country type, and although farmers' daughters, they
seemed unnatural to this lover of nature.Allowing for the difference in
years, Amy was as devoid of self-consciousness as Alf or Johnnie.Not the
slightest trace of mannerism perverted her girlish ways.She moved,
talked, and acted with no more effort or thought of effort than had the
bluebirds that were passing to and fro with their simple notes and
graceful flight, She was nature in its phase of girlhood.To one of his
temperament and training the perfect day itself would have been full of
unalloyed enjoyment, although occupied with his ordinary labors; but for
some reason this unpremeditated holiday, with Amy's companionship, gave
him a pleasure before unknown--a pleasure deep and satisfying, unmarred
by jarring discords or uneasy protests of conscience or reason.Truly, on
this spring day a "first time" came to him, a new element was entering
into his life.He did not think of defining it; he did not even recognize
it, except in the old and general way that Amy's presence had enriched them
all, and in his own case had arrested a tendency to become materialistic
and narrow.On a like day the year before he would have been absorbed in
the occupations of the farm, and merely conscious to a certain extent of
the sky above him and the bird song and beauty around him.His zest in living
and working was enhanced a thousand-fold, because life and work were
illumined by happiness, as the scene was brightened by sunshine.He felt
that he had only half seen the world before; now he had the joy of one
gradually gaining vision after partial blindness.Amy saw that he was enjoying the day immensely in his quiet way; she also
saw that she had not a little to do with the result, and the reflection
that she could please and interest the grave and thoughtful man, who was
six years her senior, conveyed a delicious sense of power.And yet she
was pleased much as a child would be."He knows so much more than I do,"
she thought, "and is usually so wrapped up in some deep subject, or so
busy, that it's awfully jolly to find that one can beguile him into
having such a good time.Burt is so exuberant in everything that I am
afraid of being carried away, as by a swift stream, I know not where.I
feel like checking and restraining him all the time.For me to add my
small stock of mirth to his immense spirits would be like lighting a
candle on a day like this; but when I smile on Webb the effect is
wonderful, and I can never get over my pleased surprise at the fact."Thus, like the awakening forces in the soil around them, a vital force
was developing in two human hearts equally unconscious.Alf and his grandfather at last returned, each well laden, and preparations
went on apace.Clifford made as if he would return and dine at home,
but they all clamored for his company.With a twinkle in his eye, he said:

"Well, I told mother that I might lunch with you, and I was only waiting
to be pressed a little.I've lived a good many years, but never was on a
picnic in March before.""Grandpa, you shall be squeezed as well as pressed," cried Johnnie,
putting her arms about his neck.Sandra travelled to the hallway."You shall stay and see what a lovely
time you have given us.and she gave
one little sigh, the first of the day."Possibly Cinderella may appear in time for lunch;" and with a significant
look he directed Amy to the basket he had brought, from the bottom of which
was drawn a doll with absurdly diminutive feet, and for once in her life
Johnnie's heart craved nothing more."Maggie knew that this little mother could not be content long without
her doll, and so she put it in.You children have a thoughtful mother,
and you must be thoughtful of her," added the old man, who felt that the
incident admitted of a little homily.If some of the potatoes were slightly burned
and others a little raw, the occasion added a flavor better than Attic
salt.A flock of chickadees approached near enough to gather the crumbs
that were thrown to them."It's strange," said Webb, "how tame the birds are when they return in
the spring.In the fall the robins are among the wildest of the birds,
and now they are all around us.I believe that if I place some crumbs on
yonder rock, they'll come and dine with us, in a sense;" and the event
proved that he was right."Hey, Johnnie," said her grandfather, "you never took dinner with the
birds before, did you?This is almost as wonderful as if Cinderella sat
up and asked for an oyster."But Johnnie was only pleased with the fact, not surprised.Wonderland was
her land, and she said, "I don't see why the birds can't understand that
I'd like to have dinner with them every day.""By the way, Webb," continued his father, "I brought out the field-glass
with me, for I thought that with your good eyes you might see Burt;" and
he drew it from his pocket.The idea of seeing Burt shooting ducks nearly broke up the feast, and
Webb swept the distant river, full of floating ice that in the sunlight
looked like snow."I can see several out in boats," he said, "and Burt,
no doubt, is among them."Then Amy, Alf, and Johnnie must have a look, but Ned devoted himself
strictly to business, and Amy remarked that he was becoming like a little
sausage."Can the glass make us hear the noise of the gun better?"Johnnie asked,
at which they all laughed, Ned louder than any, because of the laughter
of the others.It required but a little thing to make these banqueters
hilarious.But there was one who heard them and did not laugh.Mary moved to the office.From the brow of the
hill a dark, sad face looked down upon them.Lured by the beauty of the
day, Mr.Alvord had wandered aimlessly into the woods, and, attracted by
merry voices, had drawn sufficiently near to witness a scene that
awakened within him indescribable pain and longing.It was not a fear that he would be unwelcomed that kept him
away; he knew the family too well to imagine that.Something in the past darkened even that bright day, and
built in the crystal air a barrier that he could not pass.They would
give him a place at their rustic board, but he could not take it.He knew
that he would be a discord in their harmony, and their innocent merriment
smote his morbid nature with almost intolerable pain.With a gesture
indicating immeasurable regret, he turned and hastened away to his lonely
home.As he mounted the little piazza his steps were arrested.The
exposed end of a post that supported the inner side of its roof formed a
little sheltered nook in which a pair of bluebirds had begun to build
their nest.They looked at him with curious and distrustful eyes as they
flitted to and fro in a neighboring tree, and he sat down and looked at
them.The birds were evidently in doubt and in perturbed consultation.They would fly to the post, then away and all around the house, but
scarcely a moment passed that Mr.Alvord did not see that he was observed
and discussed.With singular interest and deep suspense he awaited their
decision.The female bird came flying
to the post with a beakful of fine dry grass, and her mate, on a spray
near, broke out into his soft, rapturous song.The master of the house
gave a great sigh of relief.A glimmer of a smile passed over his wan
face as he muttered, "I expected to be alone this summer, but I am to
have a family with me, after all."Soon after the lunch had been discussed leisurely and hilariously the
maple-sugar camp was left in the care of Alf and Johnnie, with Abram to
assist them.Amy longed for a stroll, but even with the protection of
rubber boots she found that the departing frost had left the sodded
meadow too wet and spongy for safety.Under Webb's direction she picked
her way to the margin of the swollen stream, and gathered some pussy
willows that were bursting their sheaths.CHAPTER XXIII

REGRETS AND DUCK-SHOOTING


Saturday afternoon, as is usual in the country, brought an increased number
of duties to the inhabitants of the farmhouse, but at the supper hour they
all, except Burt, looked back upon the day with unwonted satisfaction.He
had returned weary, hungry, and discontented, notwithstanding the fact that
several brace of ducks hung on the piazza as trophies of his skill.He was
in that uncomfortable frame of mind which results from charging one's self
with a blunder.In the morning he had entered on the sport with his usual
zest, but it had soon declined, and he wished he had remained at home.He
remembered the children's intention of spending the day among the maples,
and as the sun grew warm, and the air balmy, the thought occurred with
increasing frequency that he might have induced Amy to join them, and so
have enjoyed long hours of companionship under circumstances most favorable
to his suit.He now admitted that were the river alive with ducks, the
imagined opportunities of the maple grove were tenfold more attractive.At
one time he half decided to return, but pride prevented until he should
have secured a fair amount of game.He would not go home to be laughed at.Moreover, Amy had not been so approachable of late as he could wish, and he
proposed to punish her a little, hoping that she would miss his presence
and attentions.The many reminiscences at the supper-table were not
consoling.It was evident that he had not been missed in the way that he
desired to be, and that the day had been one of rich enjoyment to her.Neither was Webb's quiet satisfaction agreeable, and Burt mildly
anathematized himself at the thought that he might have had his share in
giving Amy so much pleasure.He took counsel of experience, however, and
having learned that even duck-shooting under the most favorable auspices
palled when contrasted with Amy's smiles and society, he resolved to be
present in the future when she, like Nature, was in a propitious mood.Impetuous as he was, he had not yet reached the point of love's blindness
which would lead him to press his suit in season and out of season.He soon
found a chance to inform Amy of his regret, but she laughed merrily back at
him as she went up to her room, saying that the air of a martyr sat upon
him with very poor grace in view of his success and persistence in the
sport, and that he had better put a white mark against the day, as she had
done.Marks, one of the most
noted duck-shooters and fishermen on the river, and they brought in three
superb specimens of a rare bird in this region, the American swan, that
queen of water-fowls and embodiment of grace."Shot 'em an hour or two ago, near Polopel's Island," said Mr.Marks,
"and we don't often have the luck to get within range of such game.Marvin was down visiting one of my children, and he said how he would
like to prepare the skin of one, and he thought some of you folks here
might like to have another mounted, and he'd do it if you wished."Exclamations of pleasure followed this proposition.Alf examined them
with deep interest, while Burt whispered to Amy that he would rather have
brought her home a swan like one of those than all the ducks that ever
quacked.In accordance with their hospitable ways, the Cliffords soon had the
doctor and Mr.Marks seated by their fireside, and the veteran sportsman
was readily induced to enlarge upon some of his experiences.He had killed two of the swans, he told them, as they were swimming, and
the other as it rose.He did not propose to let any such uncommon
visitors get away.He had never seen more than ten since he had lived in
this region.With the proverbial experience of meeting game when without
a gun, he had seen five fly over, one Sunday, while taking a ramble on
Plum Point."Have you ever obtained any snow-geese in our waters?"That's the scarcest water-fowl we have.Once in a wild snowstorm I
saw a flock of about two hundred far out upon the river, and would have
had a shot into them, but some fellows from the other side started out
and began firing at long range, and that has been my only chance.I
occasionally get some brant-geese, and they are rare enough.I once saw a
flock of eight, and got them all-took five out of the flock in the first
two shots--but I've never killed more than twenty-five in all.""I don't think I have ever seen one," remarked Mrs.Clifford, who, in her
feebleness and in her home-nook, loved to hear about these bold,
adventurous travellers.They brought to her vivid fancy remote wild
scenes, desolate waters, and storm-beaten rocks.The tremendous endurance
and power of wing in these shy children of nature never ceased to be
marvels to her."Burt has occasionally shot wild-geese--we have one
mounted there--but I do not know what a brant is, nor much about its
habits," she added."Its markings are like the ordinary Canada wild-goose," Dr.Marvin
explained, "and it is about midway in size between a goose and a duck.""I've shot a good many of the common wild-geese in my time," Mr.Marks
resumed; "killed nineteen four years ago.I once knocked down ten out of
a flock of thirteen by giving them both barrels.I have a flock of eight
now in a pond not far away--broke their wings, you know, and so they
can't fly.They soon become tame, and might be domesticated easily, only
you must always keep one wing cut, or they will leave in the spring or
fall.""Well, they never lose their instinct to migrate, and if they heard other
wild-geese flying over, they'd rise quick enough if they could and go
with them.""Do you think there would be any profit in domesticating them?"I know a man up the river who used to cross them with
our common geese, and so produced a hybrid, a sort of a mule-goose, that
grew very large.I've known 'em to weigh eighteen pounds or more, and
they were fine eating, I can tell you.I don't suppose there is much in
it, though, or some cute Yankee would have made a business of it before
this.""How many ducks do you suppose you have shot all together?""Oh, I don't know--a great many."What's the greatest number you ever got out of a flock, Marks?""Well, there is the old squaw, or long-tailed duck.They go in big
flocks, you now--have seen four or five hundred together.In the spring,
just after they have come from feeding on mussels in the southern
oyster-beds, they are fishy, but in the fall they are much better, and
the young ducks are scarcely fishy at all.I've taken twenty-three out of
a flock by firing at them in the water and again when they rose; and in
the same way I once knocked over eighteen black or dusky ducks; and they
are always fine, you know.""Are the fancy kinds, like the mallards and canvas-backs that are in such
demand by the epicures, still plentiful in their season?"I get a few now and then, but don't calculate on them any longer.It
was my luck with canvas-backs that got me into my duck-shooting ways.I
was cuffed and patted on the back the same day on their account."In response to their laughing expressions of curiosity he resumed: "I was
but a little chap at the time; still I believed I could shoot ducks, but
my father wouldn't trust me with either a gun or boat, and my only chance
was to circumvent the old man.So one night I hid the gun outside the
house, climbed out of a window as soon as it was light, and paddled round
a point where I would not be seen, and I tell you I had a grand time.I
did not come in till the middle of the afternoon, but I reached a point
when I must have my dinner, no matter what came before it.The old man
was waiting for me, and he cuffed me well.I didn't say a word, but went
to my mother, and she, mother-like, comforted me with a big dinner which
she had kept for me.I was content to throw the cuffing in, and still
feel that I had the best of the bargain.An elder brother began to chaff
me and ask, 'Where are your ducks?''Better go and look under the seat in
the stern-sheets before you make any more faces,' I answered, huffily.I
suppose he thought at first I wanted to get rid of him, but he had just
enough curiosity to go and see, and he pulled out sixteen canvas-backs.The old man was reconciled at once, for I had made better wages than he
that day; and from that time on I've had all the duck-shooting I've
wanted.""That's a form of argument to which the world always yields," said
Leonard, laughing."How many kinds of wild-ducks do we have here in the bay, that you can
shoot so many?""I've prepared the skins of twenty-four different kinds that were shot in
this vicinity," replied Dr.Clifford, "I think you once had a rather severe
experience while out upon the river.My favorite sport came nigh being the death of me, and it always
makes me shiver to think of it.I started out one spring morning at five
o'clock, and did not get home till two o'clock the next morning, and not
a mouthful did I have to eat.I had fair success during the day, but was
bothered by the quantities of ice running, and a high wind.About four
o'clock in the afternoon I concluded to return home, for I was tired and
hungry.I was then out in the river off Plum Point.I saw an opening
leading south, and paddled into it, but had not gone far before the wind
drove the ice in upon me, and blocked the passage.There I was, helpless,
and it began to blow a gale.The wind held the ice immovable on the west
shore, even though the tide was running out.For a time I thought the
boat would be crushed by the grinding cakes in spite of all I could do.If it had, I'd 'a been drowned at once, but I worked like a Trojan,
shouting, meanwhile, loud enough to raise the dead.No one seemed to hear
or notice me.At last I made my way to a cake that was heavy enough to
bear my weight, and on this I pulled up the boat, and lay down exhausted.It was now almost night, and I was too tired to shout any more.There on
that mass of ice I stayed till two o'clock the next morning.I thought
I'd freeze to death, if I did not drown.I shouted from time to time,
till I found it was of no use, and then gave my thoughts to keeping awake
and warm enough to live.I knew that my chance would be with the next
turn of the tide, when the ice would move with it, and also the wind, up
the river.I was at last able to break my way through
the loosened ice to Plain Point, and then had a two-mile walk home; and I
can tell you that it never seemed so like home before.""Oh, Burt, please don't go out again when the ice is running," was his
mother's comment on the story."Thoreau speaks of seeing black ducks asleep on a pond whereon thin ice
had formed, inclosing them, daring the March night," said Webb."Have you
ever caught them napping in this way?"Marks; "though it might easily happen on a still pond.The tides and wind usually break up the very thin ice on the river, and
if there is any open water near, the ducks will stay in it."Marvin, have you caught any glimpses of spring to-day that we have
not?"The doctor laughed--having heard of Webb's exploit in the night near the
hennery--and said: "I might mention that I have seen 'Sir Mephitis'
cabbage, as I suppose I should all it, growing vigorously.It is about
the first green thing we have.Around certain springs, however, the grass
keeps green all winter, and I passed one to-day surrounded by an emerald
hue that was distinct in the distance.It has been very cold and backward
thus far.""Possess your souls in patience," said Mr."Springtime and
harvest are sure.After over half a century's observation I have noted
that, no matter what the weather may have been, Nature always catches up
with the season about the middle or last of June."CHAPTER XXIV

APRIL


The remainder of March passed quickly away, with more alternations of
mood than there were days; but in spite of snow, sleet, wind, and rain,
the most forbidding frowns and tempestuous tears, all knew that Nature
had yielded, and more often she half-smilingly acknowledged the truth
herself.All sights and sounds about the farmhouse betokened increasing activity.During the morning hours the cackling in the barn and out-buildings
developed into a perfect clamor, for the more commonplace the event of a
new-born egg became, the greater attention the hens inclined to call to
it.Possibly they also felt the spring-time impulse of all the feathered
tribes to use their voice to the extent of its compass.The clatter was
music to Alf and Johnnie, however, for gathering the eggs was one of
their chief sources of revenue, and the hunting of nests--stolen so
cunningly and cackled over so sillily--with their accumulated treasures
was like prospecting for mines.The great basketful they brought in daily
after their return from school proved that if the egg manufactory ran
noisily, it did not run in vain.Occasionally their father gave them a
peep into the dusky brooding-room.Under his thrifty management the
majority of the nests were simply loose boxes, each inscribed with a
number.When a biddy wished to sit, she was removed at night upon the
nest, and the box was placed on a low shelf in the brooding-room.If she
remained quiet and contented in the new location, eggs were placed under
her, a note of the number of the box was taken, with the date, and the
character of the eggs, if they represented any special breed.By these
simple precautions little was left to what Squire Bartley termed "luck."Some of the hens had been on the nest nearly three weeks, and eagerly did
the children listen for the first faint peep that should announce the
senior chick of the year.Webb and Burt had already opened the campaign in the garden.On the black
soil in the hot-bed, which had been made in a sheltered nook, were even
now lines of cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.These nursling
vegetables were cared for as Maggie had watched her babies.On mild sunny
days the sash was shoved down and air given.High winds and frosty nights
prompted to careful covering and tucking away.The Cliffords were not of
those who believe that pork, cabbage, and potatoes are a farmer's
birthright, when by a small outlay of time and skill every delicacy can
be enjoyed, even in advance of the season.On a warm <DW72> from which the
frost ever took its earliest departure, peas, potatoes, and other hardy
products of the garden were planted, and as the ground grew firm enough,
the fertilizers of the barn-yard were carted to the designated places,
whereon, by Nature's alchemy, they would be transmuted into forms of use
and beauty.It so happened that the 1st of April was an ideal spring day.During the
morning the brow of Storm King, still clothed with snow, was shrouded in
mist, through which the light broke uncertainly in gleams of watery
sunshine.A succession of showers took place, but so slight and mild that
they were scarcely heeded by the busy workers; there was almost a profusion
of half-formed rainbows; and atmosphere and cloud so blended that it was
hard to say where one began and the other ceased.On every twig, dead weed,
and spire of withered grass hung innumerable drops that now were water and
again diamonds when touched by the inconstant sun.Sweet-fern grass
abounded in the lawn, and from it exuded an indescribably delicious odor.The birds were so ecstatic in their songs, so constant in their calls, that
one might think that they, like the children, were making the most of
All-fools' Day, and playing endless pranks on each other.The robins acted
as if nothing were left to be desired.They were all this time in all
stages of relationship.Some had already paired, and were at work upon
their domiciles, but more were in the blissful and excited state of
courtship, and their conversational notes, wooings, and pleadings, as they
warbled the _pros_ and _cons_, were quite different from their
matin and vesper songs.Not unfrequently there were two aspirants for the
same claw or bill, and the rivals usually fought it out like their human
neighbors in the olden time, the red-breasted object of their affections
standing demurely aloof on the sward, quietly watching the contest with a
sidelong look, undoubtedly conscious, however, of a little feminine
exultation that she should be sought thus fiercely by more than one.After
all, the chief joy of the robin world that day resulted from the fact that
the mild, humid air lured the earth-worms from their burrowing, and Amy
laughed more than once as, from her window, she saw a little gourmand
pulling at a worm, which clung so desperately to its hole that the bird at
last almost fell over backward with its prize.Courtship, nest-building,
family cares--nothing disturbs a robin's appetite, and it was, indeed, a
sorry fools'-day for myriads of angle-worms that ventured out.Managing a country place is like sailing a ship: one's labors are, or
should be, much modified by the weather.This still day, when the leaves
were heavy with moisture, afforded Webb the chance he had desired to rake
the lawn and other grass-plots about the house, and store the material
for future use.He was not one to attempt this task when the wind would
half undo his labor.In the afternoon the showery phase passed, and the sun shone with a misty
brightness.Although so early in a backward spring, the day was full of
the suggestion of wild flowers, and Amy and the children started on their
first search into Nature's calendar of the seasons.All knew where to
look for the earliest blossoms, and in the twilight the explorers
returned with handfuls of hepatica and arbutus buds, which, from
experience, they knew would bloom in a vase of water.Who has ever
forgotten his childish exultation over the first wild flowers of the
year!Pale, delicate little blossoms though they be, and most of them
odorless, their memory grows sweet with our age.Burt, who had been away to purchase a horse--he gave considerable of his
time to the buying and selling of these animals--drove up as Amy
approached the house, and pleaded for a spray of arbutus."But the buds are not open yet," she said."No matter; I should value the spray just as much, since you gathered
it.""Why, Burt," she cried, laughing, "on that principle I might as well give
you a chip.""Amy," Webb asked at the supper-table, "didn't you hear the peepers this
afternoon while out walking?""Yes; and I asked Alf what they were.He said they were peepers, and that
they always made a noise in the spring.""Why, Alf," Webb resumed, in mock gravity, "you should have told Amy that
the sounds came from the _Hylodes pickeringii_.""If that is all that you can tell me," said Amy, laughing, "I prefer
Alf's explanation.I have known people to cover up their ignorance by
big words before.Indeed, I think it is a way you scientists have.""I must admit it; and yet that close observer, John Burroughs, gives a
charming account of these little frogs that we call 'hylas' for short.Shy as they are, and quick to disappear when approached, he has seen
them, as they climb out of the mud upon a sedge or stick in the marshes,
inflate their throats until they'suggest a little drummer-boy with his
drum hung high.'In this bubble-like swelling at its throat the noise is
made; and to me it is a welcome note of spring, although I have heard
people speak of it as one of the most lonesome and melancholy of sounds.It is a common saying among old farmers that the peepers must be shut up
three times by frost before we can expect steady spring weather.I
believe that naturalists think these little mites of frogs leave the mud
and marshes later on, and become tree-toads.Try to find out what you can at once about the things you see or hear:
that's the way to get an education.""Please don't think me a born pedagogue," he answered, smiling; "but you
have no idea how fast we obtain knowledge of certain kinds if we follow
up the object-lessons presented every day."CHAPTER XXV

EASTER


Easter-Sunday came early in the month, and there had been great
preparations for it, for with the Cliffords it was one of the chief
festivals of the year.To the children was given a week's vacation, and
they scoured the woods for all the arbutus that gave any promise of
opening in time.Clumps of bloodroot, hepaticas, dicentras, dog-tooth
violets, and lilies-of-the-valley had been taken up at the first
relaxation of frost, and forced in the flower-room.Hyacinth and tulip
bulbs, kept back the earlier part of the winter, were timed to bloom
artificially at this season so sacred to flowers, and, under Mrs.Clifford's fostering care, all the exotics of the little conservatory had
been stimulated to do their best to grace the day.Barkdale's pulpit was embowered with plants and vines growing in
pots, tubs, and rustic boxes, and the good man beamed upon the work,
gaining meanwhile an inspiration that would put a soul into his words on
the morrow.No such brilliant morning dawned on the worship of the Saxon goddess
Eostre, in cloudy, forest-clad England in the centuries long past, as
broke over the eastern mountains on that sacred day.At half-past five
the sun appeared above the shaggy summit of the Beacon, and the steel
hues of the placid Hudson were changed into sparkling silver.A white
mist rested on the water between Storm King, Break Neck, and Mount
Taurus.In the distance it appeared as if snow had drifted in and half
filled the gorge of the Highlands.The orange and rose-tinted sky
gradually deepened into an intense blue, and although the land was as
bare and the forests were as gaunt as in December, a soft glamour over
all proclaimed spring.Spring was also in Amy's eyes, in the oval delicacy of her girlish face
with its exquisite flush, in her quick, deft hands and elastic step as she
arranged baskets and vases of flowers.Webb watched her with his deep eyes,
and his Easter worship began early in the day.True homage it was, because
so involuntary, so unquestioning and devoid of analysis, so utterly free
from the self-conscious spirit that expects a large and definite return for
adoration.His sense of beauty, the poetic capabilities of his nature, were
kindled.Like the flowers that seemed to know their place in a harmony of
color when she touched them, Amy herself was emblematic of Easter, of its
brightness and hopefulness, of the new, richer spiritual life that was
coming to him.He loved his homely work and calling as never before,
because he saw how on every side it touched and blended with the beautiful
and sacred.Its highest outcome was like the blossoms before him which had
developed from a rank soil, dark roots, and prosaic woody stems.The grain
he raised fed and matured the delicate human perfection shown in every
graceful and unconscious pose of the young girl.She was Nature's priestess
interpreting to him a higher, gentler world which before he had seen but
dimly--interpreting it all the more clearly because she made no effort to
reveal it.She led the way, he followed, and the earth ceased to be an
aggregate of forms and material forces.With his larger capabilities he
might yet become her master, but now, with an utter absence of vanity, he
recognized how much she was doing for him, how she was widening his horizon
and uplifting his thoughts and motives, and he reverenced her as such men
ever do a woman that leads them to a higher plane of life.No such deep thoughts and vague homage perplexed Burt as he assisted Amy
with attentions that were assiduous and almost garrulous.The brightness
of the morning was in his handsome face, and the gladness of his buoyant
temperament in his heart.Amy was just to his taste--pretty, piquant,
rose-hued, and a trifle thorny too, at times, he thought.He believed
that he loved her with a boundless devotion--at least it seemed so that
morning.It was delightful to be near her, to touch her fingers
occasionally as he handed her flowers, and to win smiles, arch looks, and
even words that contained a minute prick like spines on the rose stems.He
felt sure that his suit would prosper in time, and she was all the more
fascinating because showing no sentimental tendencies to respond with a
promptness that in other objects of his attention in the past had even
proved embarrassing.She was a little conscious of Webb's silent
observation, and, looking up suddenly, caught an expression that deepened
her color slightly."That for your thoughts," she said, tossing him a flower with sisterly
freedom."Webb is pondering deeply," explained the observant Burt, "on the
reflection of light as shown not only by the color in these flowers, but
also in your cheeks under his fixed stare."There was an access of rose-hued reflection at these words, but Webb rose
quietly and said: "If you will let me keep the flower I will tell you my
thoughts another time.That
basket is now ready, and I will take it to the church."Burt was soon despatched with another, while she and Johnnie, who had
been flitting about, eager and interested, followed with light and
delicate vases.Alvord intercepted them near the
church vestibule.He had never been seen at any place of worship, and the
reserve and dignity of his manner had prevented the most zealous from
interfering with his habits.From the porch of his cottage he had seen
Amy and the little girl approaching with their floral offerings.Nature's
smile that morning had softened his bitter mood, and, obeying an impulse
to look nearer upon two beings that belonged to another world than his,
he joined them, and asked:

"Won't you let me see your flowers before you take them into the church?""Certainly," said Amy, cordially; "but there are lovelier ones on the
pulpit; won't you come in and see them?"John went back to the kitchen.cried Johnnie, "not going to church to-day?"She had lost much of
her fear of him, for in his rambles he frequently met her and Alf, and
usually spoke to them.Moreover, she had repeatedly seen him at their
fireside, and he ever had a smile for her.The morbid are often fearless
with children, believing that, like the lower orders of life, they have
little power to observe that anything is amiss, and therefore are neither
apt to be repelled nor curious and suspicious.This in a sense is true,
and yet their instincts are keen.Alvord was not selfish or
coarse; above all he was not harsh.To Johnnie he only seemed strange,
quiet, and unhappy, and she had often heard her mother say, "Poor Mr.Therefore, when he said, "I don't go to church; if I had a
little girl like you to sit by me, I might feel differently," her heart
was touched, and she replied, impulsively: "I'll sit by you, Mr.I'll sit with you all by ourselves, if you will only go to church to-day.Alvord," said Amy, gently, "that's an unusual offer for shy Johnnie
to make.You don't know what a compliment you have received, and I think
you will make the child very happy if you comply.""Could I make you happier by sitting with you in church to-day?"he
asked, in a low voice, offering the child his hand.You lead the way, for you know best where to go."She gave
her vase to Amy, and led him into a side seat near her father's pew--one
that she had noted as unoccupied of late."It's early yet Do you mind
sitting here until service begins?"I like to sit here and look at the flowers;" and the first
comers glanced wonderingly at the little girl and her companion, who was
a stranger to them and to the sanctuary.Amy explained matters to Leonard
and Maggie at the door when they arrived, and Easter-Sunday had new and
sweeter meanings to them.The spring had surely found its way into Mr.Barkdale's sermon also, and
its leaves, as he turned them, were not autumn leaves, which, even though
brilliant, suggest death and sad changes.One of his thoughts was much
commented upon by the Cliffords, when, in good old country style, the
sermon was spoken of at dinner."The God we worship," he said, "is the
God of life, of nature.In his own time and way he puts forth his power.We can employ this power and make it ours.Many of you will do this
practically during the coming weeks.You sow seed, plant trees, and seek
to shape others into symmetrical form by pruning-knife and saw.Why, that the great power that is revivifying nature
will take up the work here you leave off, and carry it forward.All the
skill and science in the world could not create a field of waving grain,
nor all the art of one of these flowers.How immensely the power of God
supplements the labor of man in those things which minister chiefly to
his lower nature!Can you believe that he will put forth so much energy
that the grain may mature and the flower bloom, and yet not exert far
greater power than man himself may develop according to the capabilities
of his being?The forces now exist in the earth and in the air to make
the year fruitful, but you must intelligently avail yourselves of them.The power ever exists that can redeem
us from evil, heal the wounds that sin has made, and develop the manhood
and womanhood that Heaven receives and rewards.With the same resolute
intelligence you must lay hold upon this ever-present spiritual force if
you would be lifted up."John went to the office.After the service there were those who would ostentatiously recognize and
encourage Mr.Alvord; but the Cliffords, with better breeding, quietly
and cordially greeted him, and that was all.At the door he placed
Johnnie's hand in her mother's, and gently said, "Good-by;" but the
pleased smile of the child and Mrs.As he entered
his porch, other maternal eyes rested upon him, and the brooding bluebird
on her nest seemed to say, with Johnnie, "I am not afraid of you."Possibly to the lonely man this may prove Easter-Sunday in very truth,
and hope, that he had thought buried forever, come from its grave.In the afternoon all the young people started for the hills, gleaning the
earliest flowers, and feasting their eyes on the sunlit landscapes veiled
with soft haze from the abundant moisture with which the air was charged.As the sun sank low in the many-hued west, and the eastern mountains
clothed themselves in royal purple, Webb chanced to be alone, near Amy,
and she said:

"You have had that flower all day, and I have not had your thoughts.""Oh, yes, you have--a great many of them.""You know that isn't what I mean.You promised to tell me what you were
thinking about so deeply this morning."He looked at her smilingly a moment, and then his face grew gentle and
grave as he replied: "I can scarcely explain, Amy.I am learning that
thoughts which are not clear-cut and definite may make upon us the
strongest impressions.They cause us to feel that there is much that we
only half know and half understand as yet.You and your flowers seemed to
interpret to me the meaning of this day as I never understood it before.Surely its deepest significance is life, happy, hopeful life, with escape
from its grosser elements, and as you stood there you embodied that
idea.""Oh, Webb," she cried, in comic perplexity, "you are getting too deep for
me.I was only arranging flowers, and not thinking about embodying
anything."If you had been, you would have spoiled everything," he resumed,
laughing."I can't explain; I can only suggest the rest in a sentence or
two.Look at the shadow creeping up yonder mountain--very dark blue on
the lower side of the moving line and deep purple above.Well, every day I see and hear and appreciate these
things better, and I thought that you were to blame.""Yes, very much," was his laughing answer."It seems to me that a few
months since I was like the old man with the muck-rake in 'Pilgrim's
Progress,' seeking to gather only money, facts, and knowledge--things of
use.I now am finding so much that is useful which I scarcely looked at
before that I am revising my philosophy, and like it much better.The
simple truth is, I needed just such a sister as you are to keep me from
plodding."Burt now appeared with a handful of rue-anemones, obtained by a rapid
climb to a very sunny nook.They were the first of the season, and he
justly believed that Amy would be delighted with them.But the words of
Webb were more treasured, for they filled her with a pleased wonder.She
had seen the changes herself to which he referred; but how could a simple
girl wield such an influence over the grave, studious man?It was an enigma that she would be long in solving,
and yet the explanation was her own simplicity, her truthfulness to all
the conditions of unaffected girlhood.On the way to the house Webb delighted Johnnie and Alf by gathering
sprays of the cherry, peach, pear, and plum, saying, "Put them in water
by a sunny window, and see which will bloom first, these sprays or the
trees out-of-doors."The supper-table was graced by many woodland
trophies--the "tawny pendants" of the alder that Thoreau said dusted his
coat with sulphur-like pollen as he pressed through them to "look for
mud-turtles," pussy willows now well developed, the hardy ferns, arbutus,
and other harbingers of spring, while the flowers that had been brought
back from the church filled the room with fragrance.Clifford, dwelling as she ever must among the shadows of pain and
disease, this was the happiest day of the year, for it pointed forward to
immortal youth and strength, and she loved to see it decked and garlanded
like a bride.And so Easter passed, and became a happy memory.CHAPTER XXVI

VERY MOODY


The next morning Amy, on looking from her window, could scarcely believe
she was awake.She had retired with her mind full of spring and
spring-time beauty, but the world without had now the aspect of January.The air was one swirl of snow, and trees, buildings--everything was
white.In dismay she hastened to join the family, but was speedily
reassured."There is nothing monotonous in American weather, and you must get used
to our sharp alternations," said Mr."This snow will do good
rather than harm, and the lawn will actually look green after it has
melted, as it will speedily.The thing we dread is a severe frost at a
far later date than this.The buds are still too dormant to be injured,
but I have known the apples to be frozen on the trees when as large as
walnuts.""Such snows are called the poor man's manure," Webb remarked, "and
fertilizing gases, to a certain amount, do become entangled in the large
wet flakes, and so are carried into the soil.But the poor man will
assuredly remain poor if he has no other means of enriching his land.The house on the northeast side looks as if built
of snow, so evenly is it plastered over.They have
scarcely sung this morning, and they look as if thoroughly disgusted."Amy and Johnnie shared in the birds' disapproval, but Alf had a boy's
affinity for snow, and resolved to construct an immense fort as soon as
the storm permitted.Before the day had far declined the heavy flakes
ceased, and the gusty wind died away.Johnnie forgot the budding flowers
in their winding-sheet, and joyously aided in the construction of the
fort.Down the sloping lawn they rolled the snowballs, that so increased
with every revolution that they soon rose above the children's heads, and
Webb and Burt's good-natured help was required to pile them into
ramparts.At the entrance of the stronghold an immense snow sentinel was
fashioned, with a cord-wood stick for a musket.The children fairly
sighed for another month of winter.All night long Nature, in a heavy fall of rain, appeared to weep that she
had been so capricious, and the morning found her in as uncomfortable a
mood as could be imagined.The slush was ankle-deep, with indefinite
degrees of mud beneath, the air chilly and raw, and the sky filled with
great ragged masses of cloud, so opaque and low that they appeared as if
disrupted by some dynamic force, and threatened to fall upon the shadowed
land.But between them the sun darted many a smile at his tear-stained
mistress.At last they took themselves off like ill-affected meddlers in
a love match, and the day grew bright and warm.By evening, spring,
literally and figuratively, had more than regained lost ground, for, as
Mr.Clifford had predicted, the lawn had a distinct emerald hue.Thenceforth the season moved forward as if there were to be no more regrets
and nonsense.An efficient ally in the form of a southwest wind came to the
aid of the sun, and every day Nature responded with increasing favor.Amy
no more complained that an American April was like early March in England;
and as the surface of the land grew warm and dry it was hard for her to
remain in-doors, there was so much of life, bustle, and movement without.Those of the lilac were nearly an inch
long, and emitted a perfume of the rarest delicacy, far superior to that of
the blossoms to come.The nests of the earlier birds were in all stages of
construction, and could be seen readily in the leafless trees.Snakes were
crawling from their holes, and lay sunning themselves in the roads, to her
and Johnnie's dismay.Alf captured turtles that, deep in the mud, had
learned the advent of spring as readily as the creatures of the air."Each rill," as Thoreau wrote, "is
peopled with new life rushing up it."Abram and Alf were planning a
momentous expedition to a tumbling dam on the Moodna, the favorite resort
of the sluggish suckers.New chicks were daily breaking their shells, and
their soft, downy, ball-like little bodies were more to Amy's taste than
the peepers of the marsh.One Saturday morning Alf rushed in, announcing with breathless haste that
"Kitten had a calf."Kitten was a fawn- Alderney, the favorite of
the barnyard, and so gentle that even Johnnie did not fear to rub her
rough nose, scratch her between her horns, or bring her wisps of grass
when she was tied near the house.There was no rest until Amy had seen it, and she admitted that she had
never looked upon a more innocent and droll little visage.At the
children's pleading the infant cow was given to them, but they were
warned to leave it for the present to Abram and Kitten's care, for the
latter was inclined to act like a veritable old cat when any one made too
free with her bovine baby.This bright Saturday occurring about the middle of the month completely
enthroned spring in the children's hearts.The air was sweet with
fragrance from the springing grass and swelling buds, and so still and
humid that sounds from other farms and gardens, and songs from distant
fields and groves, blended softly yet distinctly with those of the
immediate vicinage.The sunshine was warm, but veiled by fleecy clouds;
and as the day advanced every member of the family was out-of-doors, even
to Mrs.Clifford, for whom had been constructed, under her husband's
direction, a low garden-chair which was so light that even Alf or Amy
could draw it easily along the walks.From it she stepped down on her
first visit of the year to her beloved flower-beds, which Alf and Burt
were patting in order for her, the latter blending with, his filial
attentions the hope of seeing more of Amy.Nor was he unrewarded, for his
manner toward his mother, whom he alternately petted and chaffed, while
at the same time doing her bidding with manly tenderness, won the young
girl's hearty good-will.The only drawback was his inclination to pet her
furtively even more.She wished that Webb was preparing the flower-beds,
for then there would be nothing to perplex or worry her.But he, with his
father and Leonard, was more prosaically employed, for they were at work
in the main or vegetable garden.It was with a sense of immense relief
that she heard Mrs.Clifford, after she had given her final directions,
and gloated over the blooming crocuses and daffodils, and the budding
hyacinths and tulips, express a wish to join her husband."I'm your mother's pony to-day," she replied, and hastened away.A wide
path bordered on either side by old-fashioned perennials and shrubbery
led down through the garden.Amy breathed more freely as soon as she
gained it, and at once gave herself up to the enjoyment of the pleasing
sights and sounds on every side.Clifford was the picture of placid
content as he sat on a box in the sun, cutting potatoes into the proper
size for planting.Johnnie was perched on another box near, chattering
incessantly as she handed him the tubers, and asking no other response
than the old gentleman's amused smile.Leonard with a pair of stout
horses was turning up the rich black mould, sinking his plow to the beam,
and going twice in a furrow.It would require a very severe drought to
affect land pulverized thus deeply, for under Leonard's thorough work the
root pasturage was extended downward eighteen inches.On the side of the
plot nearest to the house Webb was breaking the lumps and levelling the
ground with a heavy iron-toothed rake, and also forking deeply the ends
of the furrows that had been trampled by the turning horses.Clifford chatting and laughing with her husband and Johnnie, Amy stood in
the walk opposite to him, and he said presently:

"Come, Amy, you can help me.You said you wanted a finger in our
horticultural pies, and no doubt had in your mind nothing less plebeian
than flower seeds and roses.Will your nose become _retrousse_ if I ask
you to aid me in planting parsnips, oyster-plant, carrots, and--think of
it!--onions?""The idea of my helping you, when the best I can do is to amuse you with
my ignorance!I do not look forward to an
exclusive diet of roses, and am quite curious to know what part I can
have in earning my daily vegetables.""A useful and typical part--that of keeping straight men and things in
general.Wait a little;" and taking up a coiled garden line, he attached
one end of it to a stout stake pressed firmly into the ground.He then
walked rapidly over the levelled soil to the further side of the plot,
drew the line "taut," as the sailors say, and tied it to another stake.He next returned toward Amy, making a shallow drill by drawing a
sharp-pointed hoe along under the line.From a basket near, containing
labelled packages of seeds, he made a selection, and poured into a bowl
something that looked like gunpowder grains, and sowed it rapidly in the
little furrow."Now, Amy," he cried, from the further side of the plot,
"do you see that measuring-stick at your feet?Place one end of it
against the stake to which the line is fastened, and move the stake with
the line forward to the other end of the measuring-stick, just as I am
doing here.You now see how many steps you save me, and how
much faster I can get on.""Are those black-looking grains you are sowing seed?""Indeed they are, as a few weeks may prove to you by more senses than
one.These are the seeds of a vegetable inseparable in its associations
from classic Italy and renowned in sacred story.You may not share in the
longings of the ancient Hebrews, but with its aid I could easily bring
tears of deep feeling to your eyes.""The vegetable is more pungent than your wit, Webb," she laughed; but she
stood near the path at the end of the line, which she moved forward from
time to time as requested, meanwhile enjoying an April day that lacked
few elements of perfection.The garden is one of the favorite haunts of the song-sparrow.In the
flower-border near, Amy would hear such a vigorous scratching among the
leaves that she might well believe that a motherly hen was at work, but
presently one of these little sober-coated creatures that Thoreau well
calls a "ground-bird" would fly to the top of a plum-tree and trill out a
song as sweet as the perfume that came from the blossoming willows not
far away.The busy plows made it a high festival for the robins, for with
a confidence not misplaced they followed near in the furrows that Leonard
was making in the garden, and that Abram was turning on an adjacent
hillside, and not only the comparatively harmless earth-worms suffered,
but also the pestiferous larvae of the May-beetle, the arch-enemy of the
strawberry plant.Even on that day of such varied and etherealized
fragrance, the fresh, wholesome odor of the upturned earth was grateful.Suddenly Webb straightened himself from the sowing of the scale-like
parsnip-seed in which he was then engaged, and said, "Listen."Remote yet
distinct, like a dream of a bird-song, came a simple melody from a
distant field."That's our meadow-lark, Amy; not
equal to your skylark, I admit.Indeed, it is not a lark at all, for Dr.Marvin says it belongs to the oriole family.Brief and simple as is its
song, I think you will agree with me that spring brings few more lovely
sounds.That is the first one that I have heard this year."She scarcely more than caught the ethereal song before Burt and Alf came
down the path, trundling immense wheelbarrow-loads of the prunings of the
shrubbery around the house.These were added to a great pile of brush and
refuse that had accumulated on the other side of the walk, and to Alf was
given the wild excitement of igniting the inflammable mass, and soon
there was a fierce crackling as the flames devoured their way into the
loose dry centre of the rejected debris of the previous year.Then to Alf
and Johnnie's unmeasured delight they were permitted to improvise a
miniature prairie fire.A part of the garden had been left to grow very
weedy in the preceding summer, and they were shown how that by lighting
the dry, dead material on the windward side, the flames, driven by a
gentle western breeze, would sweep across the entire plot, leaving it
bare and blackened, ready for the fertilizers and the plow.With merry
cries they followed the sweeping line of fire, aiding it forward by
catching up on iron rakes burning wisps and transferring them to spots in
the weedy plot that did not kindle readily.Little Ned, clinging to the
hand of Maggie, who had joined the family in the garden, looked on with
awe-struck eyes.From the bonfire and the consuming weeds great volumes
of smoke poured up and floated away, the air was full of pungent odors,
and the robins called vociferously back and forth through the garden,
their alarmed and excited cries vying with the children's shouts.In half
an hour only a faint haze of smoke to the eastward indicated the brief
conflagration; the family had gone to the house for their one-o'clock
dinner, and the birds were content with the normal aspect of the old
garden in April.The promise of the bright spring day was not fulfilled.Cold rains
followed by frosty mornings and high cool winds prevailed with depressing
persistency.It required almost as much vigor, courage, and activity as
had been essential in March to enjoy out-door life.In many of her
aspects Nature appeared almost to stand still and wait for more genial
skies, and yet for those who watched to greet and to welcome, the mighty
impulse of spring manifested itself in many ways.The currant and
gooseberry bushes, as if remembering their original haunts in dim, cold,
boggy forests, put forth their foliage without hesitation.From the
elm-trees swung the little pendent blossoms that precede the leaves.The
lilacs and some other hardy shrubs grew green and fragrant daily.Nothing
daunted, the crocuses, hyacinths, and tulips pushed upward their
succulent leaves with steady resolution.In the woods the flowers had all
kinds of experiences.On the north side of Storm King it was still
winter, with great areas of December's ice unmelted.On the south side of
the mountain, spring almost kept pace with the calendar.The only result
was that the hardy little children of April, on which had hung more
snow-flakes than dew, obtained a longer lease of blooming life, and could
have their share in garlanding the May Queen.They bravely faced the
frosty nights and drenching rains, becoming types of those lives whose
beauty is only enhanced by adversity--of those who make better use of a
little sunny prosperity to bless the world than others on whom good-fortune
ever seems to wait.The last Saturday of the month was looked forward to with hopeful
expectations, as a genial earnest of May, and a chance for out-door
pleasures; but with it came a dismal rain-storm, which left the ground as
cold, wet, and sodden as it had been a month before.The backward season,
of which the whole country was now complaining, culminated on the
following morning, which ushered in a day of remarkable vicissitude.By
rapid transition the rain passed into sleet, then snow, which flurried
down so rapidly that the land grew white and wintry, making it almost
impossible to imagine that two months of spring had passed.the whirling flakes ceased, but a more sullen, leaden, March-like sky
never lowered over a cold, dripping earth.On the north side of the house
a white hyacinth was seen hanging its pendent blossoms half in and half
out of the snow, and Alf, who in response to Dr.Marvin's suggestion was
following some of the family fortunes among the homes in the trees, came
in and said that he had found nests well hidden by a covering all too
cold, with the resolute mother bird protecting her eggs, although
chilled, wet, and shivering herself.the clouds grew thin,
rolled away, and disappeared.The sun broke out with a determined warmth
and power, and the snow vanished like a spectre of the long-past winter.The birds took heart, and their songs of exultation resounded from far
and near.A warm south breeze sprang up and fanned Amy's cheek, as she,
with the children and Burt, went out for their usual Sunday-afternoon
walk.They found the flowers looking up hopefully, but with melted snow
hanging like tears on their pale little faces.The sun at last sank into
the unclouded west, illumining the sky with a warm, golden promise for
the future.Amy gazed at its departing glory, but Burt looked at
her--looked so earnestly, so wistfully, that she was full of compunction
even while she welcomed the return of the children, which delayed the
words that were trembling on his lips.He was ready, she was not; and he
walked homeward at her side silent and depressed, feeling that the
receptive, responsive spring was later in her heart than in Nature.CHAPTER XXVII

SHAD-FISHING BY PROXY


According to the almanac, May was on time to a second, but Nature seemed
unaware of the fact.Great bodies of snow covered the Adirondack region,
and not a little still remained all the way southward through the
Catskills and the Highlands, about the headwaters of the Delaware, and
its cold breath benumbed the land.Johnnie's chosen intimates had given
her their suffrages as May Queen; but prudent Maggie had decided that the
crowning ceremonies should not take place until May truly appeared, with
its warmth and floral wealth.Therefore, on the first Saturday of the
month, Leonard planned a half-holiday, which should not only compensate
the disappointed children, but also give his busy wife a little outing.He had learned that the tide was right for crossing the shallows of the
Moodna Creek, and they would all go fishing.Marvin were invited, and great were the preparations.Reed and
all kinds of poles were taken down from their hooks, or cut in a
neighboring thicket, the country store was depleted of its stock of rusty
hooks, and stray corks were fastened on the brown linen lines for floats.Burt disdained to take his scientific tackle, and indeed there was little
use for it in Moodna Creek, but he joined readily in the frolic.He would
be willing to fish indefinitely for even minnows, if at the same time
there was a chance to angle for Amy.Some preferred to walk to the river,
and with the aid of the family rockaway the entire party were at the
boat-house before the sun had passed much beyond the meridian.Burt, from
his intimate knowledge of the channel, acted as pilot, and was jubilant
over the fact that Amy consented to take an oar with him and receive a
lesson in rowing.Marvin held the tiller-ropes, and the doctor was
to use a pair of oars when requested to do so.Webb and Leonard took
charge of the larger boat, of which Johnnie, as hostess, was captain, and
a jolly group of little boys and girls made the echoes ring, while Ned,
with his thumb in his mouth, clung close to his mother, and regarded the
nautical expedition rather dubiously.They swept across the flats to the
deeper water near Plum Point, and so up the Moodna, whose shores were
becoming green with the rank growth of the bordering marsh.Passing under
an old covered bridge they were soon skirting an island from which rose a
noble grove of trees, whose swollen buds were only waiting for a warmer
caress of the sun to unfold.Returning, they beached their boats below
the bridge, under whose shadow the fish were fond of lying.The little
people were disembarked, and placed at safe distances; for, if near, they
would surely hook each other, if never a fin.Silence was enjoined, and
there was a breathless hush for the space of two minutes; then began
whispers more resonant than those of the stage, followed by acclamations
as Johnnie pulled up a wriggling eel, of which she was in mortal terror.They all had good sport, however, for the smaller fry of the finny tribes
that haunted the vicinity of the old bridge
