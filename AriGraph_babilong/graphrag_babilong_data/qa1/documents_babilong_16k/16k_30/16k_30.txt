_Lic._ Rome is no more if Regulus departs._Reg._ Let Rome remember Regulus must die!Nor would the moment of my death be distant,
 If nature's work had been reserv'd for nature:
 What Carthage means to do, _she_ would have done
 As speedily, perhaps, at least as surely.My wearied life has almost reach'd its goal;
 The once-warm current stagnates in these veins,
 Or through its icy channels slowly creeps----
 View the weak arm; mark the pale furrow'd cheek,
 The slacken'd sinew, and the dim sunk eye,
 And tell me then I must not think of dying!My feeble limbs
 Would totter now beneath the armour's weight,
 The burden of that body it once shielded.You see, my friends, you see, my countrymen,
 I can no longer show myself a Roman,
 Except by dying like one.----Gracious Heaven
 Points out a way to crown my days with glory;
 Oh, do not frustrate, then, the will of Jove,
 And close a life of virtue with disgrace!Come, come, I know my noble Romans better;
 I see your souls, I read repentance in them;
 You all applaud me--nay, you wish my chains:
 'Twas nothing but excess of love misled you,
 And as you're Romans you will conquer that.Yes!--I perceive your weakness is subdu'd--
 Seize, seize the moment of returning virtue;
 Throw to the ground, my sons, those hostile arms;
 <DW44> no longer Regulus's triumph;
 I do request it of you, as a friend,
 I call you to your duty, as a patriot,
 And--were I still your gen'ral, I'd command you._Lic._ Lay down your arms--let Regulus depart.[_To the People, who clear the way, and quit their arms._

 _Reg._ Gods!_Ham._ Why, I begin to envy this old man![_Aside._

 _Man._ Not the proud victor on the day of triumph,
 Warm from the slaughter of dispeopled realms,
 Though conquer'd princes grace his chariot wheels,
 Though tributary monarchs wait his nod,
 And vanquish'd nations bend the knee before him,
 E'er shone with half the lustre that surrounds
 This voluntary sacrifice for Rome!Who loves his country will obey her laws;
 Who most obeys them is the truest patriot._Reg._ Be our last parting worthy of ourselves.my friends.--I bless the gods who rule us,
 Since I must leave you, that I leave you Romans.Preserve the glorious name untainted still,
 And you shall be the rulers of the globe,
 The arbiters of earth.The farthest east,
 Beyond where Ganges rolls his rapid flood,
 Shall proudly emulate the Roman name.(_Kneels._) Ye gods, the guardians of this glorious people,
 Who watch with jealous eye AEneas' race,
 This land of heroes I commit to you!This ground, these walls, this people be your care!bless them, bless them with a liberal hand!Let fortitude and valour, truth and justice,
 For ever flourish and increase among them!And if some baneful planet threat the Capitol
 With its malignant influence, oh, avert it!--
 Be Regulus the victim of your wrath.--
 On this white head be all your vengeance pour'd,
 But spare, oh, spare, and bless immortal Rome!ATTILIA _struggles to get to_ REGULUS--_is prevented--she
 faints--he fixes his eye steadily on her for some time,
 and then departs to the ships_._Man._ (_looking after him._)
 Farewell!Protector, father, saviour of thy country!Through Regulus the Roman name shall live,
 Shall triumph over time, and mock oblivion.'Tis Rome alone a Regulus can boast.WRITTEN BY DAVID GARRICK, ESQ.What son of physic, but his art extends,
 As well as hand, when call'd on by his friends?What landlord is so weak to make you fast,
 When guests like you bespeak a good repast?But weaker still were he whom fate has plac'd
 To soothe your cares, and gratify your taste,
 Should he neglect to bring before your eyes

 Whether your luxury be to smile or weep,

 "A woman write?Learn, Madam, of your betters,
 And read a noble Lord's Post-hu-mous Letters.There you will learn the sex may merit praise

Hyphenation is inconsistent.In view of the Roman context, the word "virtus" was left in place in
a speech by Manlius in Act III, although it may be a misprint for
"virtue".The glory, earned in deadly fray,
      Shall fade, decay and perish.Honour waits, o’er all the Earth
      Through endless generations,
    The art that calls her harvests forth
      And feeds the expectant nations.”

                                THE END

VINTON & COMPANY, LTD., 8, BREAM’S BUILDINGS, CHANCERY LANE, LONDON, E.C.Tenney remained unmoved
under both, and at last coolly quitted the topic altogether.“You ought to do well here,” he said, ignoring a point-blank question
about how General Boyce’s remaining interest could be protected.“Thessaly’s going to have a regular boom before long.You’ll see this
place a city in another year or two.We’ve got population enough now,
for that matter, only it’s spread out so.How did you come to go in with
Tracy?”

“Why shouldn’t I?He’s the best man here, and starting alone is the
slowest kind of slow work.”

Mr.Tenney smiled a little, and put the tips of his fingers together
gently.“Tracy and I don’t hitch very well, you know,” he said.“I took a
downright fancy to him when I first came in from Sidon Hill, but he’s
such a curious, touchy sort of fellow.I asked him one day what church
he’d recommend me to join; of course I was a stranger, and explained to
him that what I wanted was not to make any mistake, but to get into the
church where there were the most respectable people who would be of use
to me; and what do you think he said?He was huffed about it--actually
mad!He said he’d rather have given me a hundred dollars than had me ask
him that question; and after that he was cool, and so was I, and we’ve
never had much to say to each other since then.Of course, there’s no
quarrel, you know.Only it strikes me he’ll be a queer sort of man to
get along with.A lawyer with cranks like that--why, you never know what
he’ll do next.”

“He’s one of the best fellows alive,” said Horace, with sharp emphasis.“Why, of course he is,” replied Mr.“But that isn’t business.Take the General, for instance; he’s a good fellow, too--in a different
kind of way, of course--and see where it’s landed him.Look out for him and you are all right.Tracy might be making
five or six times as much as he is, if he went the right way to work.He
does more business and gets less for it than any other lawyer in town.There’s no sense in that.”

“Upon my word, Mr.Sandra went to the office.Tenney,” said Horace, after a moment’s pause, in
which he deliberately framed what he was going to say, “I find it
difficult to understand why you thought it worth while to come here at
all to-day: it surely wasn’t to talk about Tracy; and the things I want
to know about my father you won’t discuss.What I see is this: that you were a
private in the regiment my father was colonel of; that he made you a
sort of adjutant, or something in the nature of a clerk, and so lifted
you out of the ranks; that during the war, when your health failed, he
gave you a place in his business here at home, which lifted you out of
the farm; that a while later he made you a partner; and that gradually
the tables have been completely turned, until you are the colonel and
he is the private, you are rich and he is nearly insolvent.That is what
the thing sums up to in my mind.Have you come to tell me that now you are going to be good to
him?”

“Good God!Haven’t I been good to him?” said Tenney, with real
indignation.“Couldn’t I have frozen him out eighteen months ago instead
of taking up his overdrafts at only ten per cent, charge so as to keep
him along?There isn’t one man in a hundred who would have done for him
what I have.”

“I am glad to hear it,” replied the young man.“If the proportion was much larger, I am afraid this would be a very
unhappy world to live in.”

Mr.He had not clearly grasped the
meaning of this remark, but instinct told him that it was hostile.You may take it that way, if you like.” He rose as he spoke
and began buttoning his overcoat.“Only let me say this: when the smash
comes, you can’t say I didn’t warn you.If you won’t listen to me,
that’s _your_ lookout.”

“But I haven’t done anything but listen to you for the last two hours,”
 said Horace, who longed to tell his visitor to go to the devil, and yet
was betrayed into signs of anxiety at the prospect of his departure.“If
you’ll remember, you haven’t told me anything that I asked for.Heaven
knows, I should be only too glad to listen, if you’ve got anything to
say.”

Mr.Tenney made a smiling movement with his thin lips and sat down
again.“I thought you would change your tune,” he said, calmly.Horace offered
a gesture of dissent, to which the hardware merchant paid no attention.He had measured his man, and decided upon a system of treatment.“What
I really wanted,” he continued, “was to look you over and hear you talk,
and kind of walk around you and size you up, so to speak.You see I’ve
only known you as a youngster--better at spending money than at making
it.Now that you’ve started as a lawyer, I thought I’d take stock of you
again, don’t you see; and the best way to sound you all around was to
talk about your father’s affairs.”

Horace was conscious of a temptation to be angry at this cool statement,
but he did not yield to it.“Then it isn’t true--what you have told me?”
 he asked.“Well, yes, it is, mostly,” answered Mr.Tenney, again contemplating his
joined finger-tips.“But it isn’t of so much importance compared with
some other things.There’s bigger game afoot than partnerships in
hardware stores.”

Horace gave a little laugh of mingled irritation and curiosity.“What
the devil _are_ you driving at, Tenney?” he said, and swung his chair
once more to face his visitor.This time the two men eyed each other more sympathetically, and the
tones of the two voices lost something of their previous reserve.Tenney himself resumed the conversation with an air of direct candor:

“I heard somebody say you rather counted on getting some of the Minster
iron-works business.”

“Well, the fact is, I may have said I hoped to, but nothing definite has
been settled.The ladies are friends of mine: we came up from New York
together last month; but nothing was decided.”

“I see,” said Mr.Tenney, and Horace felt uneasily, as he looked into
those sharp gray eyes, that no doubt they did see very clearly.There’s no harm in that, only
it’s no good to gas with me, for there’s some solid business to be
done--something mighty promising for both of us.”

“Of course I’ve no notion what you mean,” said Horace.“But it’s just
as well to clear up the ground as we go along.The first experiment of
yoking up Boyces and Tenneys together hasn’t turned out so admirably as
to warrant me--What shall I say?”

“As to warrant you going in with your eyes shut.” Mr.Tenney supplied
the lacking phrase with evident enjoyment.On the contrary, what I want of you is to have your eyes peeled
particularly wide open.But, first of all, Tracy mustn’t hear a breath
of this whole thing.”

“Then go no further, I beg of you.I sha’n’t touch it.”

“Oh, yes, you will,” said Mr.“He
has his own private business.The railroad work, for
example: you don’t share in that.That is his own, and quite right, too.But that very fact leaves you free, doesn’t it, to go into speculations
on your own account?”

“Speculations--yes, perhaps.”

“No ‘perhaps’ about it; of course it does.At least, you can hear what
I have to say without telling him, whether you go into the thing or not;
do you promise me that?”

“I don’t think I wish to promise anything,” said Horace, doubtingly.If you won’t deal, you won’t; and I must protect myself my
own way.” Mr.Tenney did not rise and again begin buttoning his coat,
nor was it, indeed, necessary.There had been menace enough in his tone
to effect his purpose.“Very well, then,” answered Horace, in a low voice; “if you insist, I
promise.”

“I shall know within half an hour if you do tell him,” said Mr.Tenney,
in his most affable manner; “but of course you won’t.”

“Of course I won’t!” snapped Horace, testily.The first thing, then, is to put the
affairs of the Minster women into your hands.”

Horace took his feet off the table, and looked in fixed surprise at
his father’s partner.“How--what do you mean?” he stammered at last,
realizing, even as he spoke, that there were certain strange depths in
Mr.Tenney’s eyes which had been dimly apparent at the outset, and then
had been for a long time veiled, and were now once more discernible.“How do you mean?”

“It can be fixed, as easy as rolling off a log.Old Clarke has gone to
Florida for his health, and there’s going to be a change made.A word
from me can turn the whole thing over to you.”

“A word from you!” Horace spoke with incredulity, but he did not really
doubt.There was a revelation of reserve power in the man’s glance that
fascinated him.Daniel went to the bedroom.“That’s what I said.The question is whether I shall speak it or not.”

“To be frank with you”--Horace smiled a little--“I hope very much that
you will.”

“I daresay.But have you got the nerve for it?--that’s the point.Can
you keep your mouth shut, and your head clear, and will you follow me
without kicking or blabbing?That’s what I want to know.”

“And that’s just what I can’t tell you.I’m not going to bind myself
to do unknown things.” Horace said this bravely enough, but the shrewd,
listening ear understood very well the lurking accent of assent.“You needn’t bind yourself to anything, except to tell Tracy nothing
till I give you the word, and then only what we shall agree upon.Of
course, later on he will have to know something about it.And mind, mum’s the word.” Mr.Tenney rose now, not tentatively,
but as one who is really going.Horace sprang to his feet as well, and
despite the other’s declaration that he was pressed for time, and had
already stayed too long, insisted on detaining him.“What I don’t understand in all this,” he said, hurriedly--“for that
matter the whole thing is a mystery--but what I particularly fail to see
is your object in benefiting me.You tell me
that you have got my father in a hole, and then you offer me a great and
substantial prize.You are not the man to
do things for nothing.What you haven’t told me is what there is in this
affair for you.”

Mr.Tenney seemed complimented by this tribute to his commercial sense
and single-mindedness.“No, I haven’t told you,” he said, buttoning his
coat.“That’ll come in due time.All you’ve got to do meanwhile is to
keep still, and to take the thing when it comes to you.Let me know
at once, and say nothing to any living soul--least of all Tracy--until
you’ve talked with me.That oughtn’t to be hard.”

“And suppose I don’t like the conditions?”

“Then you may lump them,” said Schuyler Ten, ney, disclosing his small
teeth again in a half-smile, as he made his way out.MINSTER’S NEW LEGAL ADVISER.Horace Boyce, on returning home one evening,
found on his table a note which had been delivered during the day by
a servant.Minster--“Desideria Minster” she signed
herself--asking him to call upon her the following afternoon.The young
man read the missive over and over again by the lamplight, and if it
had been a love-letter from the daughter instead of the polite business
appointment by the mother, his eyes couldn’t have flashed more eagerly
as he took in the meaning of its words.He thought long upon that, ruminating in his
easy-chair before the fire until far past midnight, until the dainty
little Japanese saucer at his side was heaped up with cigar ashes, and
the air was heavy with smoke.Evidently this summons was directly connected with the remarks made by
Tenney a fortnight before.He had said the Minster business should come
to him, and here it was.Minster wrote to him at his
residence, rather than at his office, was proof that she too wished to
have him alone, and not the firm of Tracy & Boyce, as her adviser.That
there should be this prejudice against Reuben, momentarily disturbed the
young man; but, upon examination, he found it easy to account for it.Reuben was very nice--his partner even paused for a moment to reflect
how decent a fellow Reuben really was--but then, he scarcely belonged to
the class of society in which people like the Boyces and Minsters moved.Naturally the millionnaire widow, belonging as she did to an ancient
family in the Hudson River valley, and bearing the queer name of a
grandmother who had been a colonial beauty, would prefer to have as her
family lawyer somebody who also had ancestors.The invitation had its notable social side, too.There was no good
in blinking the fact that his father the General--who had effected a
somewhat noisy entrance to the house a half-hour ago, and the sound
of whose burdened breathing now intermittently came to his ears in the
silence of the night--had allowed the family status to lapse.The Boyces
were not what they had been.In the course of such few calls as he had
made since his return, it had been impossible for him not to detect
the existence of a certain surprise that he should have called at all.Everybody, too, had taken pains to avoid reference to his father, even
when the course of talk made such allusion natural.This had for the
moment angered the young man, and later had not a little discouraged
him.As a boy he had felt it a great thing to be the son of a general,
and to find it now to be a distinct detriment was disheartening indeed.But this black-bordered, perfumed note from Mrs.Minster put all, as
by the sweep of a hand, into the background.Once he visited that
proud household as a friend, once he looked Thessaly in the face as
the confidential adviser of the Minster family, the Boyces were
rehabilitated.To dwell upon the thought was very pleasant, for it led the way by
sweetly vagrant paths to dreams of the dark-eyed, beautiful Kate.During the past month these visions had lost color and form under the
disconcerting influences just spoken of, but now they became, as if by
magic, all rosy-hued and definite again.He had planned to himself on
that first November day a career which should be crowned by marriage
with the lovely daughter of the millions, and had made a mental march
around the walls encompassing her to spy out their least defended point.Now, all at once, marvellous as it seemed, he found himself transported
within the battlements.He was to be her mother’s lawyer--nay, _her_
lawyer as well, and to his sanguine fancy this meant everything.It meant one of the most beautiful
women he had ever seen as his wife--a lady well-born, delicately
nurtured, clever, and good; it meant vast wealth, untold wealth, with
which to be not only the principal personage of these provincial parts,
but a great figure in New York or Washington or Europe.He might be
senator in Congress, minister to Paris, or even aspire to the towering,
solitary eminence of the Presidency itself with the backing of these
millions.It meant a yacht, the very dream of sea-going luxury and
speed, in which to bask under Hawaiian skies, to loiter lazily along the
topaz shores of far Cathay, to flit to and fro between spice lands and
cold northern seas, the whole watery globe subject to her keel.Why,
there could be a castle on the Moselle, a country house in Devonshire,
a flat in Paris, a villa at Mentone, a summer island home on the St.Lawrence, a mansion in New York--all together, if he liked, or as many
as pleased his whim.It might be worth the while to lease a shooting in
Scotland, only the mischief was that badly bred Americans, the odious
_nouveaux riches_, had rather discredited the national name in the
Highlands.So the young man’s fancies floated on the wreaths of scented smoke till
at last he yawned in spite of himself, sated with the contemplation of
the gifts the gods had brought him.Minster’s note once
again before he went to bed, and sleep overtook his brain while it was
still pleasantly musing on the choicest methods of expending the income
of her millions.Curiously enough, during all these hours of happy castle-building, the
question of why Schuyler Tenney had interested himself in the young
man’s fortunes never once crossed that young man’s mind.To be frank,
the pictures he painted were all of “gentlemen” and “ladies,” and his
father’s partner, though his help might be of great assistance at
the outset, could scarcely expect to mingle in such company, even in
Horace’s tobacco reveries.Neither to his father at the breakfast-table, nor to Reuben Tracy at
the office, did young Mr.Boyce next day mention the fact that he was to
call on Mrs.This enforced silence was not much to his liking,
primarily because his temperament was the reverse of secretive.When
he had done anything or thought of doing something, the impulse to tell
about it was always strong upon him.The fact that the desire to talk
was not rigorously balanced by regard for the exact and prosaic truth
may not have been an essential part of the trait when we come to
analysis, but garrulity and exaggeration ran together in Horace’s
nature.To repress them now, just at the time when the most important
event of his life impended, required a good deal of effort.He had some qualms of conscience, too, so far as Reuben was concerned.Two or three things had happened within the past week which had laid
him under special obligation to the courtesy and good feeling of his
partner.They were not important, perhaps, but still the memory of them
weighed upon _his_ mind when, at three o’clock, he put on his coat and
explained that he might not be back again that afternoon.Reuben nodded,
and said, “All right: I shall be here.If so-and-so comes, I’ll go over
the matter and make notes for you.” Then Horace longed very much to tell
all about the Minster summons and the rest, and this longing arose as
much from a wish to be frank and fair as from a craving to confide his
secret to somebody; but he only hesitated for a second, and then went
out.Minster received him in the chamber which had been her husband’s
working room, and which still contained his desk, although it had since
been furnished with book-shelves and was called the library.Horace
noted, as the widow rose to greet him, that, though the desk was open,
its pigeon-holes did not seem to contain many papers.After his hostess had bidden him to be seated, and had spoken in mildly
deprecating tones about the weather, she closed her resolutely lined
lips, folded her hands in her lap, and looked at him in amiable
suspense.Minster’s dark face, with its
high frame of white hair and its bright black eyes, habitually produced
an impression of great cleverness and alert insight, and Horace was
conscious of embarrassment in finding the task of conversation devolved
upon himself.He took up the burden, however, and carried it along from
subject to subject until at last it seemed fitting to broach the great
topic.“I didn’t get your note until evening,” he said, with a polite inquiring
smile.“No, I didn’t send it until after dinner,” she replied, and a pause
ensued.It fortunately occurred to Horace to say he was very glad to have her
call upon him always, if in any way she saw how he could serve her.As
he spoke these words, he felt that they were discreet and noncommittal,
and yet must force her to come to the point.“It is very kind of you, I’m sure,” she said, graciously, and came to a
full stop.“If there is anything I can do now,” Horace remarked tentatively.What I wanted to ask you was, do you know the Wendovers?”

“I don’t think I do.” murmured the young man, with a great sinking of
the heart.“They’re New York people,” the lady explained.“I know almost nobody in New York,” answered Horace gloomily.No, I am quite sure the name is new to me.”

“That is curious,” said Mrs.She took a letter up from the
desk.“This is from Judge Wendover, and it mentions you.I gathered from
it that he knew you quite well.”

Oh, shades of the lies that might have been told, if one had only known!Horace swiftly ransacked his brain for a way out of this dilemma.Evidently this letter bore upon his selection as her lawyer.He guessed
rightly that it had been written at Tenney’s suggestion and by some one
who had Mrs.John travelled to the garden.Obviously this some one was of the
legal profession.“The name does sound familiar, on second thought,” he said.“I daresay
it is, if I could only place it.You see, I had a number of offers to
enter legal firms in New York, and in that way I saw a good many people
for a few minutes, you know, and quite probably I’ve forgotten some of
their names.They would remember me, of course, but I might confuse them
one with another, don’t you see?Strange, I don’t fix the man you mean.Was he a middle-aged man, grayish hair, well dressed?”

“Yes, that describes him.” She did not add that it would equally
describe seven out of every ten other men called “judge” throughout the
United States.“Now I place him,” said Horace triumphantly.“There was some talk of
my going into his office as a junior partner.Mutual friends of ours
proposed it, I remember.Curious that I should
have forgotten his name.One’s memory plays such whimsical tricks,
though.”

“I didn’t know Judge Wendover was practising law,” said Mrs.“He never was much of a lawyer.He was county judge once down in
Peekskill, about the time I was married, but he didn’t get reelected;
and I thought he gave it all up when he went to New York.”

“If it’s the man I mean,” put in Horace, groping his way despairingly,
“there wasn’t much business in his office.That is why I didn’t go in, I
daresay: it wouldn’t be worth my while unless he himself was devoted to
the law, and carried on a big practice.”

“I daresay it’s the same man,” remarked Mrs.“He probably
_would_ have a kind of law office.They generally do.”

“Well, may I ask,” Horace ventured after another pause, “in what
connection he mentions my name?”

“He recommends me to consult you about affairs--to--well, how shall I
say it?--to make you my lawyer?”

Eureka!The words were out, and the difficult passage about Judge
What’s-his-name was left safely behind.Horace felt his brain swimming
on a sea of exaltation, but he kept his face immobile, and bowed his
head with gravity.“I am very young for so serious a responsibility, I’m afraid,” he said
modestly.“There isn’t really much to do,”
 she answered.“And somebody would have to learn what there is; and
you can do that as well as any one else, better than a stranger.The
difficulty is,” she spoke more slowly, and Horace listened with all his
ears: “you have a partner, I’m told.”

The young man did not hesitate for an instant.“Only in a limited way,”
 he replied.Tracy and I have combined on certain lines of work
where two heads are better than one, but we each keep distinct our own
private practice.It is much better.”

“I certainly prefer it,” said Mrs.“I am glad to hear you keep
separate.Tracy, and, indeed, he is very highly spoken
of as a _lawyer_; but certain things I have heard--social matters, I
mean--”

The lady broke off discreetly.She could not tell this young man what
she had heard about that visit to the Lawton house.Horace listened to
her without the remotest notion of her meaning, and so could only smile
faintly and give the least suggestion of a sigh.“We can’t have everything in this world just to our minds,” he said
judicially, and it seemed to him to cover the case with prudent
vagueness.“I suppose you thought the partnership would be a good thing?” she
asked.“At the time--_yes_,” answered Horace.“And, to be fair, it really has
some advantages.Tracy is a prodigious worker, for one thing, and
he is very even-tempered and willing; so that the burden of details
is taken off my shoulders to a great extent, and that disposes one to
overlook a good many things, you know.”

Mrs.She also knew what it was to delight
in relief from the burden of details, and she said to herself that
fortunately Mr.Boyce would thus have the more leisure to devote the
affairs of the Minsters.Into their further talk it is not needful to pursue the lady and her
lawyer.She spoke only in general terms, outlining her interests and
investments which required attention, and vaguely defining what she
expected him to do.Horace listened very closely, but beyond a nebulous
comprehension of the existence of a big company and a little company,
which together controlled the iron-works and its appurtenances, he
learned next to nothing.One of the first things which she desired of
Horace was, however, that he should go to Florida and talk the whole
subject over with Mr.Clarke, and to this he gladly assented.“I will write to him that you are coming,” she said, as she rose.“I may
tell you that he personally preferred Mr.Tracy as his successor; but,
as I have told you--well, there were reasons why--”

Horace made haste to bow and say “quite so,” and thus spare Mrs.“Perhaps it will be better to say nothing
to any one until I have returned from Florida,” he added, as a parting
suggestion, and it had her assent.The young man walked buoyantly down the gravel path and along the
streets, his veins fairly tingling with excitement and joy.The great
prize had come to him--wealth, honor, fame, were all within his grasp.He thought proudly, as he strode along, of what he would do after his
marriage.Even the idea of hyphenating the two names in the English
fashion, Minster-Boyce, came into his mind, and was made welcome.Perhaps, though, it couldn’t well be done until his father was dead; and
that reminded him--he really must speak to the General about his loose
behavior.Thus Horace exultantly communed with his happy self, and formed
resolutions, dreamed dreams, discussed radiant probabilities as he
walked, until his abstracted eye was suddenly, insensibly arrested by
the sight of a familiar sign across the street--“S.Tenney & Co.” Then
for the first time he remembered his promise, and the air grew colder
about him as he recalled it.He crossed the road after a moment’s
hesitation, and entered the hardware store.Tenney was alone in the little office partitioned off by wood and
glass from the open store.He received the account given by Horace of
his visit to the Minster mansion with no indication of surprise, and
with no outward sign of satisfaction.“So far, so good,” he said, briefly.Then, after a moment’s meditation,
he looked up sharply in the face of the young man, who was still
standing: “Did you say anything about your terms?”

“Of course not.You don’t show price-lists like a
storekeeper, in the _law!_”

Mr.Tenney smiled just a little at Horace’s haughty tone--a smile of
furtive amusement.“It’s just as well,” he said.“I’ll talk with you
about that later.The old lady’s rather close-fisted.We may make a
point there--by sending in bills much smaller than old Clarke’s used to
be.Luckily it wasn’t needed.”

The matter-of-fact way in which Mr.Tenney used this “we” grated
disagreeably on the young man’s ear, suggesting as it did a new
partnership uncomfortably vague in form; but he deemed it wise not to
touch upon the subject.His next question, as to the identity of Judge
Wendover, brought upon the stage, however, still a third partner in the
shadowy firm to which he had committed himself.“Oh, Wendover’s in with us.He’s all right,” replied Schuyler Tenney,
lightly.He’s the president of the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company.You’ll hear a good deal about _that_ later on.”
 The speaker showed his teeth again by a smiling movement of the lips at
this assurance, and Horace somehow felt his uneasiness growing.“She wants me to go to Florida to see Clarke, and talk things over,” he
said.We must consider all that very carefully
before you go.I’ll think
out what you are to tell him.”

Horace was momentarily shrinking in importance before his own mental
vision; and, though he resented it, he could not but submit.“I suppose
I’d better make some other excuse to Tracy about the Florida trip,” he
said, almost deferentially; “what do you think?”

“Oh, you think so, do you?” Mr.Tenney was interested, and made a
renewed scrutiny of the young man’s face.I’ll think about
it, and let you know to-morrow.Look in about this time, and don’t say
anything till then.So long!”

Thus dismissed, Horace took his leave, and it was not until he had
nearly reached his home that the thoughts chasing each other in his mind
began to take on once more roseate hues and hopeful outlines.Tenney watched his partner’s son through the partition until he was
out of sight, and then smiled at the papers on his desk in confidence.“He’s ready to lie at a minute’s notice,” he mused; “offered on his own
hook to lie to Tracy.That’s all right--only he mustn’t try it on with
me!”




CHAPTER XII.--THE THESSALY CITIZENS’ CLUB.The village of Thessaly took no pains to conceal the fact that it was
very proud of itself.What is perhaps more unique is that the farming
people round about, and even the smaller and rival hamlets scattered
through the section, cordially recognized Thessaly’s right to be proud,
and had a certain satisfaction in themselves sharing that pride.Lest this should breed misconception and paint a more halcyon picture of
these minor communities than is deserved, let it be explained that they
were not without their vehement jealousies and bickerings among one
another.Often there arose between them sore contentions over questions
of tax equalization and over political neglects and intrigues; and
here, too, there existed, in generous measure, those queer parochial
prejudices--based upon no question whatever, and defying alike inquiry
and explanation--which are so curious a heritage from the childhood days
of the race.No long-toed brachycephalous cave-dweller of the stone
age could have disliked the stranger who hibernated in the holes on
the other side of the river more heartily than the people of Octavius
disliked those of Sidon.In the hop-picking season the young men of
these two townships always fell to fighting when they met, and their
pitched conflicts in and around the Half-way House near Tyre, when
dances were given there in the winter, were things to talk about
straight through until hoeing had begun in the spring.There were many
other of these odd and inexplicable aversions--as, for instance, that
which had for many years impelled every farmer along the whole length of
the Nedahma Creek road to vote against any and all candidates nominated
from Juno Mills, a place which they scarcely knew and had no earthly
reason for disliking.But in such cases no one asked for reasons.Matters simply stood that way, and there was nothing more to be said.Neighbors took almost as much
pleasure in boasting of its wealth and activity, and prophesying its
future greatness, as did its own sons.The farmers when they came in
gazed with gratified amazement at the new warehouses, the new chimneys,
the new factory walls that were rising everywhere about them, and
returned more satisfied than ever that “Thessaly was just a-humming
along.” Dearborn County had always heretofore been a strictly
agricultural district, full of rich farm-lands and well-to-do
farm-owners, and celebrated in the markets of New York for the
excellence of its dairy products.Now it seemed certain that Thessaly
would soon be a city, and it was already a subject for congratulation
that the industries which were rooting, sprouting, or bearing fruit
there had given Dearborn County a place among the dozen foremost
manufacturing shires in the State.The farmers were as pleased over this as any one else.It was true that
they were growing poorer year by year; that their lands were gradually
becoming covered with a parchment film of mortgages, more deadly than
sorrel or the dreaded black-moss; that the prices of produce had gone
down on the one hand as much as the cost of living and of labor had
risen on the other; that a rich farmer had become a rarity in a district
which once was controlled by the princes of herds and waving fields:
but all the same the agriculturists of Dearborn County were proud of
Thessaly, of its crowds of foreign-born operatives, its smoke-capped
chimneys, and its noisy bustle.They marched almost solidly to the polls
to vote for the laws which were supposed to protect its industries, and
they consoled themselves for falling incomes and increased expenditure
by roseate pictures of the great “home market” which Thessaly was to
create for them when it became a city.For many years it had been
scarcely known to the outside world save as the seat of a seminary of
something more than local repute.This institution still nestled under
the brow of the hill whence the boy Reuben Tracy had looked with fondly
wistful vision down upon it, but it was no longer of much importance.It
was yet possible to discern in the quiet streets immediately adjoining
the seminary enclosure, with their tall arched canopies of elm-boughs,
and old-fashioned white houses with verandas and antique gardens, some
remains of the academic character that this institution had formerly
imparted to the whole village.John went back to the bedroom.But the centre of activity and of
population had long since moved southward, and around this had grown up
a new Thessaly, which needed neither elms nor gardens, which had use for
its children at the loom or the lathe when the rudiments of the common
school were finished, and which alike in its hours of toil and of
leisure was anything rather than academie.I suppose that in this modern Thessaly, with its factories and mills,
its semi-foreign saloons, and its long streets of uniformly ugly cottage
dwellings, there were many hundreds of adults who had no idea whether
the once-famous Thessaly seminary was still open or not.If Thessaly had had the time and inclination for a serious study of
itself, this decadence of the object of its former pride might have
awakened some regret.The seminary, which had been one of the first in
the land to open its doors to both sexes, had borne an honorable part in
the great agitation against slavery that preceded the war.Some of its
professors had been distinguished abolitionists--of the kind who strove,
suffered, and made sacrifices when the cause was still unpopular,
yet somehow fell or were edged out of public view once the cause had
triumphed and there were rewards to be distributed, and they had taken
the sentiment of the village with them in those old days.Then there
was a steady demand upon the seminary library, which was open to
householders of the village, for good books.Then there was maintained
each winter a lecture course, which was able, not so much by money as by
the weight and character of its habitual patrons, to enrich its annual
lists with such names as Emerson, Burritt, Phillips, Curtis, and
Beecher.At this time had occurred the most sensational episode in the
history of the village--when the rumor spread that a runaway <DW64> was
secreted somewhere about the seminary buildings, and a pro-slavery crowd
came over from Tyre to have him out and to vindicate upon the persons of
his protectors the outraged majesty of the Fugitive Slave law, and the
citizens of Thessaly rose and chased back the invaders with celerity and
emphasis.But all this had happened so long ago that it was only vaguely
remembered now.There were those who still liked to recall those
days and to tell stories about them, but they had only themselves for
listeners.The new Thessaly was not precisely intolerant of the history
of this ante-bellum period, but it had fresher and more important
matters to think of; and its customary comment upon these legends of the
slow, one-horse past was, “Things have changed a good deal since then,”
 offered with a smile of distinct satisfaction.Stephen Minster’s enterprise in opening up the
iron fields out at Juno, and in building the big smelting-works on the
outskirts of Thessaly, had altered everything.The branch road to the
coal district which he called into existence lifted the village at once
into prominence as a manufacturing site.Other factories were erected
for the making of buttons, shoes, Scotch-caps, pasteboard boxes,
matches, and a number of varieties of cotton cloths.When this last
industry appeared in the midst of them, the people of Thessaly found
their heads fairly turned.This period of industrial progress, of which I speak with, I hope,
becoming respect and pride, had now lasted some dozen years, and, so far
from showing signs of interruption, there were under discussion four or
five new projects for additional trades to be started in the village,
which would be decided upon by the time the snow was off the ground.During these years, Thessaly had more than quadrupled its population,
which was now supposed to approximate thirteen thousand, and might be
even more.There had been considerable talk for the past year or two
about getting a charter as a city from the legislature, and undoubtedly
this would soon be done.About this step there were, however, certain
difficulties, more clearly felt than expressed.Not even those who were
most exultant over Thessaly’s splendid advance in wealth and activity
were blind to sundry facts written on the other side of the ledger.Thessaly had now some two thousand voters, of whom perhaps two-fifths
had been born in Europe.It had a saloon for every three hundred and
fifty inhabitants, and there was an uneasy sense of connection between
these two facts which gave rise to awkward thoughts.The village was
fairly well managed by its trustees; the electorate insisted upon
nothing save that they should grant licenses liberally, and, this apart,
their government did not leave much to be desired.But how would it be
when the municipal honors were taken on, when mayor, aider-men and all
the other officers of the new city, with enlarged powers of expenditure
and legislation, should be voted for?Whenever the responsible business
men of Thessaly allowed their minds to dwell upon a forecast of what
this board of aldermen would probably be like, they frankly owned to
themselves that the prospect was not inviting.But as a rule they did
not say so, and the village was drifting citywards on a flowing tide.*****

It was just before Christmas that Reuben Tracy took the first step
toward realizing his dream of making this Thessaly a better place than
it was.Fourteen citizens, all more or less intimate friends of his,
assembled at his office one evening, and devoted some hours to listening
to and discussing his plans.An embarrassment arose almost at the outset through the discovery that
five or six of the men present thought Thessaly was getting on very well
as it was, and had assumed that the meeting was called for the purpose
of arranging a citizens’ movement to run the coming spring elections
for trustees in the interest of good government--by which they of course
understood that they were to be asked to take office.The exposure of
this mistake threatened for a little time to wreck the purpose of the
gathering.Jones, a gentleman who made matches, or rather had just
taken a handsome sum from the great Ruby Loco-foco Trust as his reward
for ceasing to manufacture them, was especially disposed to resent
what Reuben said about the moral and material state of the village.He
insisted that it was the busiest and most progressive town in that whole
section of the State; it had six streets well paved, was lighted with
gas, had no disorderly houses to speak of,
