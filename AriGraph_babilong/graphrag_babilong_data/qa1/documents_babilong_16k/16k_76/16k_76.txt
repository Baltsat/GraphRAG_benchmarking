He then, because of
a superstitious faith in the auspices of the Supreme Being, threw the
reins upon the neck of the revolution he afterwards vainly tried to
curb.Others, who did not wish to restrain it, seized the reins and when
the precipice was reached took care that Robespierre should be hurled
over it.Many allegations against Robespierre have been disproved He tried to
save Danton and Camille Desmoulins, and did save seventy-three deputies
whose death the potentates of the Committee of Public Safety had
planned.But against him still lies that terrible sentence found in his
Note Book, and reported by a Committee to the Convention: "Demand that
Thomas Payne be decreed of accusation for the interests of America as
much as of France."*

     * "Demander que Thomas Payne soit decrete d'accusation pour
     les interets de l'Amerique autant que de la France."The Committee on Robespierre's papers, and especially Courtois its
Chairman, suppressed some things favorable to him (published long
after), and it can never be known whether they found anything further
about Paine.They made a strong point of the sentence found, and added:
"Why Thomas Payne more than another?Because he helped to establish the
liberty of both worlds."An essay by Paine on Robespierre has been lost, and his opinion of the
man can be gathered only from occasional remarks.After the Courtois
report he had to accept the theory of Robespierre's malevolence and
hypocrisy.He then, for the first time, suspected the same hand in a
previous act of hostility towards him.In August, 1793, an address had
been sent to the Convention from Arras, a town in his constituency,
saying that they had lost confidence in Paine.This failed of success
because a counter-address came from St.Robespierre being a native
of Arras, it now seemed clear that he had instigated the address.It
was, however, almost certainly the work of Joseph Le-bon, who, as Paine
once wrote, "made the streets of Arras run with blood" Lebon was his
_suppleant_, and could not sit in the Convention until Paine left it.But although Paine would appear to have ascribed his misfortunes to
Robespierre at the time, he was evidently mystified by the whole thing.No word against him had ever fallen from Robespierre's lips, and if that
leader had been hostile to him why should he have excepted him from the
accusations of his associates, have consulted him through the summer,
and even after imprisonment, kept him unharmed for months?There is a
notable sentence in Paine's letter (from prison) to Monroe, elsewhere
considered, showing that while there he had connected his trouble rather
with the Committee of Public Safety than with Robespierre."However discordant the late American Minister Gouvernoeur Morris, and
the late French Committee of Public Safety, were, it suited the purposes
of both that I should be continued in arrestation.The former wished to
prevent my return to America, that I should not expose his misconduct;
and the latter lest I should publish to the world the history of its
wickedness.Whilst that Minister and that Committee continued, I had
no expectation of liberty.I speak here of the Committee of which
Robespierre was a member."Paine wrote this letter on September 10, 1794.Robespierre, three
months before that, had ceased to attend the Committee, disavowing
responsibility for its actions: Paine was not released.Robespierre,
when the letter to Monroe was written, had been dead more than six
months: Paine was not released The prisoner had therefore good reason to
look behind Robespierre for his enemies; and although the fatal sentence
found in the Note Book, and a private assurance of Barrere, caused him
to ascribe his wrongs to Robespierre, farther reflection convinced him
that hands more hidden had also been at work.He knew that Robespierre
was a man of measured words, and pondered the sentence that he should
"be decreed of accusation for the interests of America as much as of
France."In a letter written in 1802, Paine said: "There must have been
a coalition in sentiment, if not in fact, between the terrorists of
America and the terrorists of France, and Robespierre must have known
it, or he could not have had the idea of putting America into the bill
of accusation against me."Robespierre, he remarks, assigned no reason
for his imprisonment.The secret for which Paine groped has remained hidden for a hundred
years.It is painful to reveal it now, but historic justice, not only to
the memory of Paine, but to that of some eminent contemporaries of his,
demands that the facts be brought to light.The appointment of Gouverneur Morris to be Minister to France, in 1792,
passed the Senate by 16 to 11 votes.The President did not fail to
advise him of this reluctance, and admonish him to be more cautious in
his conduct.In the same year Paine took his seat in the Convention.Thus the royalist and republican tendencies, whose struggles made
chronic war in Washington's Cabinet, had their counterpart in Paris,
where our Minister Morris wrote royalist, and Paine republican,
manifestoes.It will have been seen, by quotations from his diary
already given, that Gouverneur Morris harbored a secret hostility
towards Paine; and it is here assumed that those entries and incidents
are borne in mind.The Diary shows an appearance of friendly terms
between the two; Morris dines Paine and receives information from him.The royalism of Morris and humanity of Paine brought them into a common
desire to save the life of Louis.But about the same time the American Minister's own position became a
subject of anxiety to him.He informs Washington (December 28, 1792)
that Genet's appointment as Minister to the United States had not been
announced to him (Morris)."Perhaps the Ministry think it is a trait of
republicanism to omit those forms which were anciently used to express
good will."His disposition towards Paine was not improved by finding
that it was to him Genet had reported."I have not yet seen M. Genet,"
writes Morris again, "but Mr.Soon
after this Morris became aware that the French Ministry had asked
his recall, and had Paine also known this the event might have been
different The Minister's suspicion that Paine had instigated the recall
gave deadliness to his resentment when the inevitable break came between
them.The occasion of this arose early in the spring.When war had broken out
between England and France, Morris, whose sympathies were with England,
was eager to rid America of its treaty obligations to France.He so
wrote repeatedly to Jefferson, Secretary of State.An opportunity
presently occurred for acting on this idea.In reprisal for the seizure
by British cruisers of American ships conveying provisions to France,
French cruisers were ordered to do the like, and there were presently
ninety-two captured American vessels at Bordeaux.They were not allowed
to reload and go to sea lest their cargoes should be captured by
England.Morris pointed out to the French Government this violation of
the treaty with America, but wrote to Jefferson that he would leave
it to them in Philadelphia to insist on the treaty's observance, or to
accept the "unfettered" condition in which its violation by France left
them.Consultation with Philadelphia was a slow business, however,
and the troubles of the American vessels were urgent The captains, not
suspecting that the American Minister was satisfied with the treaty's
violation, were angry at his indifference about their relief, and
applied to Paine.Unable to move Morris, Paine asked him "if he did not
feel ashamed to take the money of the country and do nothing for it" It
was, of course, a part of Morris' scheme for ending the treaty to point
out its violation and the hardships resulting, and this he did; but
it would defeat his scheme to obtain the practical relief from those
hardships which the un-theoretical captains demanded.On August 20th,
the captains were angrily repulsed by the American Minister, who,
however, after they had gone, must have reflected that he had gone too
far, and was in an untenable position; for on the same day he wrote to
the French Minister a statement of the complaint."I do not [he adds] pretend to interfere in the internal concerns of the
French Republic, and I am persuaded that the Convention has had weighty
reasons for laying upon Americans the restriction of which the American
captains complain.The result will nevertheless be that this prohibition
will severely aggrieve the parties interested, and put an end to the
commerce between France and the United States."The note is half-hearted, but had the captains known it was written
they might have been more patient Morris owed his subsequent humiliation
partly to his bad manners.The captains went off to Paine, and proposed
to draw up a public protest against the American Minister.Paine advised
against this, and recommended a petition to the Convention.This was
offered on August 22d.In this the captains said: "We, who know your
political situation, do not come to you to demand the rigorous execution
of the treaties of alliance which unite us to you.We confine ourselves
to asking for the present, to carry provisions to your colonies."To
this the Convention promptly and favorably responded.It was a double humiliation to Morris that the first important benefit
gained by Americans since his appointment should be secured without his
help, and that it should come through Paine.And it was a damaging blow
to his scheme of transferring to England our alliance with France.A
"violation" of the treaty excused by the only sufferers could not be
cited as "releasing" the United States.A cruel circumstance for
Morris was that the French Minister wrote (October 14th): "You must be
satisfied, sir, with the manner in which the request presented by the
American captains from Bordeaux, has been received"--and so forth.Four
days before, Morris had written to Jefferson, speaking of the thing
as mere "mischief," and belittling the success, which "only served
an ambition so contemptible that I shall draw over it the veil of
oblivion."The "contemptible ambition" thus veiled from Paine's friend, Jefferson,
was revealed by Morris to others.Some time before (June 25th), he had
written to Robert Morris:

"I suspected that Paine was intriguing against me, although he put on a
face of attachment.Since that period I am confirmed in the idea, for
he came to my house with Col.Oswald, and being a little more drunk than
usual, behaved extremely ill, and through his insolence I discovered
clearly his vain ambition."This was probably written after Paine's rebuke already quoted.It is not
likely that Colonel Oswald would have taken a tipsy man eight leagues
out to Morris' retreat, Sainport, on business, or that the tipsy man
would remember the words of his rebuke two years after, when Paine
records them in his letter to Washington.At any rate, if Morris saw
no deeper into Paine's physical than into his mental condition, the
"insolent" words were those of soberness.For Paine's private letters
prove him ignorant of any intrigue against Morris, and under an
impression that the Minister had himself asked for recall; also that,
instead of being ambitious to succeed Morris, he was eager to get out
of France and back to America.The first expression of French
dissatisfaction with Morris had been made through De Ternant, (February
20th, 1793,) whom he had himself been the means of sending as Minister
to the United States.*

     * On September I, 1792, Morris answered a request of the
     executive of the   republic that he could not comply until
     he had received "orders from his   Court," (les ordres de ma
     cour).The representatives of the new-born republic were
     scandalized by such an expression from an American Minister,
     and   also by his intimacy with Lord and Lady Gower.They
     may have suspected what Morris' "Diary" now suggests, that
     he (Morris) owed his appointment to this English Ambassador
     and his wife.On August 17, 1792, Lord Gower was
     recalled, in hostility to the republic, but during the
     further weeks of his stay in Paris the American Minister
     frequented their house.From the recall   Morris was
     saved for a year by the intervention of Edmund Randolph.(See my "Omitted Chapters of History," etc, p.Morris ("Diary,"
     ii., p.98) records an accusation of Randolph, to which he
     listened in the office of Lord Grenville, Secretary of!State, which plainly meant his (Randolph's) ruin, which
     followed.He   I knew it to be untrue, but no defence is
     mentioned.It would appear that Morris must have had sore need of a scapegoat to
fix on poor Paine, when his intrigues with the King's agents, his
trust of the King's money, his plot for a second attempt of the King to
escape, his concealment of royalist leaders in his house, had been his
main ministerial performances for some time after his appointment.Had
the French known half as much as is now revealed in Morris' Diary, not
even his office could have shielded him from arrest.That the executive
there knew much of it, appears in the revolutionary archives.There is
reason to believe that Paine, instead of intriguing against Morris,
had, in ignorance of his intrigues, brought suspicion on himself by
continuing his intercourse with the Minister.The following letter of
Paine to Barrere, chief Committeeman of Public Safety, dated September
5th, shows him protecting Morris while he is trying to do something for
the American captains."I send you the papers you asked me for."The idea you have to send Commissioners to Congress, and of which you
spoke to me yesterday, is excellent, and very necessary at this moment.Jefferson, formerly Minister of the United States in France, and
actually Minister for Foreign Affairs at Congress, is an ardent defender
of the interests of France.Gouverneur Morris, who is here now, is
badly disposed towards you.I believe he has expressed the wish to be
recalled.The reports which he will make on his arrival will not be to
the advantage of France.This event necessitates the sending direct of
Commissioners from the Convention.He
has set the Americans who are here against him, as also the Captains of
that Nation who have come from Bordeaux, by his negligence with regard
to the affair they had to treat about with the Convention._Between us_
[sic] he told them: 'That they had thrown themselves into the lion's
mouth, and it was for them to get out of it as best they could.'I shall
return to America on one of the vessels which will start from Bordeaux
in the month of October.This was the project I had formed, should
the rupture not take place between America and England; but now it is
necessary for me to be there as soon as possible.The Congress will
require a great deal of information, independently of this.It will soon
be seven years that I have been absent from America, and my affairs in
that country have suffered considerably through my absence.My house and
farm buildings have been entirely destroyed through an accidental fire."Morris has many relations in America, who are excellent patriots.I
enclose you a letter which I received from his brother, General Louis
Morris, who was a member of the Congress at the time of the Declaration
of Independence.You will see by it that he writes like a good patriot.I only mention this so that you may know the true state of things.It
will be fit to have respect for Gouverneur Morris, on account of his
relations, who, as I said above, are excellent patriots."There are about 45 American vessels at Bordeaux, at the present moment.If the English Government wished to take revenge on the Americans, these
vessels would be very much exposed during their passage.I advised them, on leaving, to demand a
convoy of the Convention, in case they heard it said that the English
had begun reprisals against the Americans, if only to conduct as far as
the Bay of Biscay, at the expense of the American Government.But if the
Convention determines to send Commissioners to Congress, they will be
sent in a ship of the line.But it would be better for the Commissioners
to go in one of the best American sailing vessels, and for the ship of
the line to serve as a convoy; it could also serve to convoy the ships
that will return to France charged with flour.I am sorry that we cannot
converse together, but if you could give me a rendezvous, where I could
see Mr.Otto, I shall be happy and ready to be there.If events force
the American captains to demand a convoy, it will be to me that they
will write on the subject, and not to Morris, against whom they have
grave reasons of complaint Your friend, etc."*

     * State Archives, Paris.Translation of a letter from Thomas
     Payne to Citizen Barrere."It may be noted that Paine and
     Barrere, though they could read each other's language, could
     converse only in their own tongue.This is the only letter written by Paine to any one in France about
Gouverneur Morris, so far as I can discover, and not knowing French he
could only communicate in writing.The American Archives are equally
without anything to justify the Minister's suspicion that Paine was
intriguing against him, even after his outrageous conduct about the
captains.Morris had laid aside the functions of a Minister to exercise
those of a treaty-making government.During this excursion into
presidential and senatorial power, for the injury of the country to
which he was commissioned, his own countrymen in France were without an
official Minister, and in their distress imposed ministerial duties on
Paine.But so far from wishing to supersede Morris, Paine, in the above
letter to Barrere, gives an argument for his retention, namely, that
if he goes home he will make reports disadvantageous to France.He
also asks respect for Morris on account of his relations, "excellent
patriots."Barrere, to whom Paine's letter is written, was chief of the
Committee of Public Safety, and had held that powerful position since
its establishment, April 6, 1793.To this all-powerful Committee of Nine
Robespierre was added July 27th.On the day that Paine wrote the letter,
September 5th, Barrere opened the Terror by presenting a report in which
it is said, "Let us make terror the order of the day!"This Barrere was
a sensualist, a crafty orator, a sort of eel which in danger turned into
a snake.His "supple genius," as Louis Blanc expresses it, was probably
appreciated by Morris, who was kept well informed as to the secrets
of the Committee of Public Safety.This omnipotent Committee had
supervision of foreign affairs and appointments.At this time the
Minister of Foreign Affairs was Deforgues, whose secretary was the
M. Otto alluded to in Paine's letter to Barrere.Otto spoke English
fluently; he had been in the American Legation.Deforgues became
Minister June 5th, on the arrest of his predecessor (Lebrun), and was
anxious lest he should follow Lebrun to prison also,--as he ultimately
did.Deforgues and his secretary, Otto, confided to Morris their strong
desire to be appointed to America, Genet having been recalled.*

Despite the fact that Morris' hostility to France was well known, he had
become an object of awe.So long as his removal was daily expected in
reply to a request twice sent for his recall, Morris was weak, and even
insulted.But when ship after ship came in without such recall, and at
length even with the news that the President had refused the Senate's
demand for Morris' entire correspondence, everything was changed.**

     * Morris'  letter to Washington, Oct.The
     passage is omitted from the letter as quoted in his "Diary
     and Letters" ii., p.** See my "Life of Edmund Randolph," p."So long," writes Morris to Washington, "as they believed in the success
of their demand, they treated my representations with indifference
and contempt; but at last, hearing nothing from their minister on that
subject, or, indeed, on any other, they took it into their heads that I
was immovable, and made overtures for conciliation."It must be borne in
mind that at this time America was the only ally of France; that already
there were fears that Washington was feeling his way towards a treaty
with England.Soon after the overthrow of the monarchy Morris had hinted
that the treaty between the United States and France, having been made
with the King, might be represented by the English Ministry in America
as void under the revolution; and that "it would be well to evince a
degree of good will to America."When Robespierre first became a leader
he had particular charge of diplomatic affairs.It is stated by Frederic
Masson that Robespierre was very anxious to recover for the republic the
initiative of the alliance with the United States, which was credited
to the King; and "although their Minister Gouverneur Morris was justly
suspected, and the American republic was at that time aiming only to
utilize the condition of its ally, the French republic cleared it at a
cheap rate of its debts contracted with the King."*

     * "Le Departement des Affaires Etrangeres pendant la
     Revolution," P-295.Such were the circumstances which, when Washington seemed determined
to force Morris on France, made this Minister a power.Lebrun, the
ministerial predecessor of Deforgues, may indeed have been immolated to
placate Morris, who having been, under his administration, subjected to
a domiciliary visit, had gone to reside in the country.That was when
Morris' removal was supposed near; but now his turn came for a little
reign of terror on his own account In addition to Deforgues' fear of
Lebrun's fate, should he anger Washington's immovable representative, he
knew that his hope of succeeding Genet in America must depend on Morris.The terrors and schemes of Deforgues and Otto brought them to the feet
of Morris.About the time when the chief of the Committee of Public
Safety, Barrere, was consulting Paine about sending Commissioners
to America, Deforgues was consulting Morris on the same point.The
interview was held shortly after the humiliation which Morris had
suffered, in the matter of the captains, and the defeat of his scheme
for utilizing their grievance to release the United States from their
alliance.The American captains had appointed Paine their Minister, and
he had been successful.Paine and his clients had not stood in awe of
Morris; but he now had the strength of a giant, and proceeded to use it
like a giant.The interview with Deforgues was not reported by Morris to the Secretary
of State (Paine's friend, Jefferson), but in a confidential letter to
Washington,--so far as was prudent."I have insinuated [he writes] the advantages which might result from
an early declaration on the part of the new minister that, as France has
announced the determination not to meddle with the interior affairs of
other nations, he can know only the _government_ of America.In union
with this idea, I told the minister that I had observed an overruling
influence in their affairs which seemed to come from the other side of
the channel, and at the same time had traced the intention to excite a
seditious spirit in America; that it was impossible to be on a friendly
footing with such persons, but that at present a different spirit seemed
to prevail, etc."*

     * Letter to Washington, Oct.In thus requiring that the new minister to America shall recognize only
the "government" (and not negotiate with Kentucky, as Genet had done),
notice is also served on Deforgues that the Convention must in future
deal only with the American Minister, and not with Paine or sea-captains
in matters affecting his countrymen.The reference to an influence from
the other side of the channel could only refer to Paine, as there were
then no Englishmen in Paris outside his garden in the Faubourg St.By this ingenious phrase Morris already disclaims jurisdiction
over Paine, and suggests that he is an Englishman worrying Washington
through Genet This was a clever hint in another way.Genet, now
recalled, evidently for the guillotine, had been introduced to Morris
by Paine, who no doubt had given him letters to eminent Americans.Paine
had sympathized warmly with the project of the Kentuckians to expel the
Spanish from the Mississippi, and this was patriotic American doctrine
even after Kentucky was admitted into the Union (June 1, 1792).O'Fallon, a leading Kentuckian on the subject But
things had changed, and when Genet went out with his blank commissions
he found himself confronted with a proclamation of neutrality which
turned his use of them to sedition.Paine's acquaintance with Genet, and
his introductions, could now be plausibly used by Morris to involve him.The French Minister is shown an easy way of relieving his country from
responsibility for Genet, by placing it on the deputy from "the other
side of the channel.""This declaration produced the effect I intended," wrote Morris.The
effect was indeed swift On October 3d, Amar, after the doors of the
Convention were locked, read the memorable accusation against the
Girondins, four weeks before their execution.In that paper he denounced
Brissot for his effort to save the King, for his intimacy with the
English, for injuring the colonies by his labors for <DW64> emancipation!In this denunciation Paine had the honor to be included."At that same time the Englishman Thomas Paine, called by the faction
[Girondin] to the honor of representing the French nation, dishonored
himself by supporting the opinion of Brissot, and by promising us in his
fable the dissatisfaction of the United States of America, our natural
allies, which he did not blush to depict for us as full of veneration
and gratitude for the tyrant of France."On October 19th the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deforgues, writes to
Morris:

"I shall give the Council an account of the punishable conduct of their
agent in the United States [Genet], and I can assure you beforehand that
they will regard the strange abuse of their confidence by this agent, as
I do, with the liveliest indignation.The President of the United States
has done justice to our sentiments in attributing the deviations of the
citizen Genet to causes entirely foreign to his instructions, and we
hope that the measures to be taken will more and more convince the head
and members of your Government that so far from having authorized the
proceedings and manoeuvres of Citizen Genet our only aim has been to
maintain between the two nations the most perfect harmony."One of "the measures to be taken" was the imprisonment of Paine, for
which Amar's denunciation had prepared the way.For Robespierre had successfully attacked Amar's report for
extending its accusations beyond the Girondins.How then could an
accusation be made against Paine, against whom no charge could be
brought, except that he had introduced a French minister to his friends
in America!A deputy must be formally accused by the Convention before
he could be tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal.An indirect route must
be taken to reach the deputy secretly accused by the American Minister,
and the latter had pointed it out by alluding to Paine as an influence
"from across the channel."There was a law passed in June for the
imprisonment of foreigners belonging to countries at war with France.Paine had not been liable to
this law, being a deputy, and never suspected of citizenship in the
country which had outlawed him, until Morris suggested it.Could he
be got out of the Convention the law might be applied to him without
necessitating any public accusation and trial, or anything more than an
announcement to the Deputies.Christmas day was celebrated by the
terrorist Bourdon de l'Oise with a denunciation of Paine: "They have
boasted the patriotism of Thomas Paine._Eh bien!_ Since the Brissotins
disappeared from the bosom of this Convention he has not set foot in it.And I know that he has intrigued with a former agent of the bureau of
Foreign Affairs."This accusation could only have come from the American
Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs--from Gouverneur Morris and
Deforgues.Genet was the only agent of Deforgues' office with whom Paine
could possibly have been connected; and what that connection was the
reader knows.That accusation is associated with the terrorist's charge
that Paine had declined to unite with the murderous decrees of the
Convention.After the speech of Bourdon de l'Oise, Bentabole moved the "exclusion
of foreigners from every public function during the war."Bentabole was
a leading member of the Committee of General Surety."The Assembly,"
adds _The Moniteur_, "decreed that no foreigner should be admitted to
represent the French people."The Committee of General Surety assumed
the right to regard Paine as an Englishman; and as such out of the
Convention, and consequently under the law of June against aliens
of hostile nations.He was arrested next day, and on December 28th
committed to the Luxembourg prison.A TESTIMONY UNDER THE GUILLOTINE

While Paine was in prison the English gentry were gladdened by a rumor
that he had been guillotined, and a libellous leaflet of "The Last Dying
Words of Thomas Paine" appeared in London.Paine was no less confident
than his enemies that his execution was certain--after the denunciation
in Amar's report, October 3d--and did indeed utter what may be regarded
as his dying words--"The Age of Reason."This was the task which he
had from year to year adjourned to his maturest powers, and to it he
dedicates what brief remnant of life may await him.That completed, it
will be time to die with his comrades, awakened by his pen to a dawn now
red with their blood.The last letter I find written from the old Pompadour mansion is to
Jefferson, under date of October 20th:

"Dear Sir,--I wrote you by Captain Dominick who was to sail from Havre
about the 20th of this month.Since my letter by Dominick I am every day
more convinced and impressed with the propriety of Congress sending
Commissioners to Europe to confer with the Ministers of the Jesuitical
Powers on the means of terminating the war.The enclosed printed paper
will shew there are a variety of subjects to be taken into consideration
which did not appear at first, all of which have some tendency to put
an end to the war.I see not how this war is to terminate if some
intermediate power does not step forward.There is now no prospect that
France can carry revolutions thro' Europe on the one hand, or that the
combined powers can conquer France on the other hand.It is a sort
of defensive War on both sides.This being the case how is the War
to close?Neither side will ask for peace though each may wish it.I
believe that England and Holland are tired of the war.Their Commerce
and Manufactures have suffered most exceedingly--and besides this it is
to them a war without an object.I cannot help repeating my wish that Congress would send Commissioners,
and I wish also that yourself would venture once more across the Ocean
as one of them.If the Commissioners rendezvous at Holland they would
then know what steps to take.Pinckney to their
Councils, and it would be of use, on many accounts, that one of them
should come over from Holland to France.Perhaps a long truce, were it
proposed by the neutral Powers, would have all the effects of a Peace,
without the difficulties attending the adjustment of all the forms of
Peace.--Yours affectionately Thomas Paine."* I am indebted for this letter to Dr.John S. H. Fogg, of
     Boston.The letter is endorsed by Jefferson, "Rec'd Mar.Thus has finally faded the dream of Paine's life--an international
republic.It is notable that in this letter Paine makes no mention of his own
danger.He may have done so in the previous letter, unfound, to which
he alludes.Why he made no attempt to escape after Amar's report seems a
mystery, especially as he was assisting others to leave the country.Two
of his friends, Johnson and Choppin--the last to part from him in the
old garden,--escaped to Switzerland.Johnson will be remembered as the
young man who attempted suicide on hearing of Marat's menaces against
Paine.Writing to Lady Smith of these two friends, he says:

"He [Johnson] recovered, and being anxious to get out of France, a
passport was obtained for him and Mr.Choppin; they received it late in
the evening, and set off the next morning for Basle, before four, from
which place I had a letter from them, highly pleased with their escape
from France, into which they had entered with an enthusiasm of patriotic
devotion.thou hast ruined the character of a revolution
virtuously begun, and destroyed those who produced it.I might also say
like Job's servant, 'and I only am escaped.'"Two days after they were gone I heard a rapping at the gate, and
looking out of the window of the bedroom I saw the landlord going with
the candle to the gate, which he opened; and a guard with muskets and
fixed bayonets entered.I went to bed again and made up my mind for
prison, for I was the only lodger.It was a guard to take up Johnson and
Choppin, but, I thank God, they were out of their reach."The guard came about a month after, in the night, and took away
the landlord, George.And the scene in the house finished with the
arrestation of myself.This was soon after you called on me, and sorry
I was that it was not in my power to render to Sir [Robert Smith] the
service that you asked."In the
wintry garden this lone man--in whose brain and heart the republic and
the religion of humanity have their abode--moves companionless.In
the great mansion, where once Madame de Pompadour glittered amid
her courtiers, where in the past summer gathered the Round Table of
great-hearted gentlemen and ladies.Thomas Paine sits through the
watches of the night at his devout task.*

"My friends were falling as fast as the guillotine could cut their heads
off, and as I expected, every day, the same fate, I resolved to begin my
work.I appeared to myself to be on my death bed, for death was on every
side of me, and I had no time to lose.This accounts for my writing at
the time I did, and so nicely did the time and intention meet, that I
had not finished the first part of the work more than six hours before
I was arrested and taken to prison.The people of France were running
headlong into atheism, and I had the work translated in their own
language, to stop them in that career, and fix them to the first article
of every man's creed, who has any creed at all--_I believe in God_."**

     * It was a resumed task.Early in the year Paine had brought
     to his colleague Lanthenas a manuscript on religion,
     probably entitled "The Age of Reason."Lanthenas translated
     it, and had it printed in French, though no trace of its
     circulation appears.At that time Lanthenas may have
     apprehended blood about to be shed, the tribute to one that
     was pierced in trying to benefit mankind.The execution of the
     Girondins took place on October 31st.The second Christmas of the new republican era dawns.Where is the
vision that has led this wayworn pilgrim?Where the star he has followed
so long, to find it hovering over the new birth of humanity?It may have
been on that day that, amid the shades of his slain friends, he wrote,
as with the proscription which fell on him, with the other Girondins, in
May, and took the precaution to show Paine's essay to Couthon, who,
with Robespierre, had religious matters particularly in charge.Couthon frowned on the work and on Paine, and reproached Lanthenas for
translating it.There was no frown more formidable than that of Couthon,
and the essay (printed only in French) seems to have been suppressed.At the close of the year Paine wrote the whole work _de novo_.The first
edition in English, now before me, was printed in Paris, by Barrois,
1794.In his preface to Part II., Paine implies a previous draft in
saying: "I had not finished it more than six hours, _in the state it has
since appeared_, before a guard came," etc (The italics are mine.)The
fact of the early translation appears in a letter of Lanthenas to Merlin
de Thionville."Nothing that is here said can apply, even with the most distant
disrespect, to the real character of Jesus Christ.He was a virtuous and
amiable man.The morality that he preached and practised was of the
most benevolent kind; and though similar systems of morality had been
preached by Confucius, and by some of the Greek philosophers, many years
before, by the Quakers since, and by good men in all ages, it has not
been exceeded by any.... He preached most excellent morality, and the
equality of man; but he preached also against the corruption and
avarice of the Jewish priests, and this brought upon him the hatred and
vengeance of the whole order of priesthood.The accusation which those
priests brought against him was that of sedition and conspiracy against
the Roman government, to which the Jews were then subject and tributary;
and it is not improbable that the Roman government might have some
secret apprehension of the effect of his doctrine, as well as the Jewish
priests; neither is it improbable that Jesus Christ had in contemplation
the delivery of the Jewish nation from the bondage of the Romans.Between the two, however, this virtuous reformer and religionist lost
his life.... He was the son of God in like manner that every other
person is--for the Creator is the Father of All.... Jesus Christ founded
no new system.He called men to the practice of moral virtues, and the
belief of one God.The great trait in his character is philanthropy."Many Christmas sermons were preached in 1793, but probably all of them
together do not contain so much recognition of the humanity of Jesus as
these paragraphs of Paine.The Christmas bells ring in the false, but
shall also ring in the true.While he is writing, on that Christmas
night, word comes that he has been denounced by Bourdon de l'Oise,
and expelled from the Convention."Conceiving, after this, that I had but a few days of liberty I sat
down, and brought the work to a close as speedily as possible."In the "Age of Reason" there is a page of personal recollections.I have
a feeling that this little episode marks the hour when Paine was told of
his doom.From this overshadowed Christmas, likely to be his last,
the lonely heart--as loving a heart as ever beat--here wanders across
tempestuous years to his early home in Norfolk.There is a grateful
remembrance of the Quaker meeting, the parental care, the Grammar
School; of his pious aunt who read him a printed sermon, and the garden
steps where he pondered what he had just heard,--a Father demanding
his Son's death for the sake of making mankind happier and better.He
"perfectly recollects the spot" in the garden where, even then, but
seven or eight years of age, he felt sure a man would be executed for
doing such a thing, and that God was too good to act in that way.So
clearly come out the scenes of childhood under the shadow of death.He probably had an intimation on December 27th that he would be
arrested that night.The place of his abode, though well known to
the authorities, was not in the Convention's Almanack.Officially,
therefore, his residence was still in the Passage des Petits Peres.There the officers would seek him, and there he should be found."For
that night only he sought a lodging there," reported the officers
afterwards.He may have feared, too, that his manuscript would be
destroyed if he were taken in his residence.On the evening of December 27th, in the
old mansion, Paine reaches the last page of the "Age of Reason."They
who have supposed him an atheist, may search as far as Job, who said
"Though He slay me I will trust in Him," before finding an author who,
caught in the cruel machinery of destructive nature, could write that
last page."The creation we behold is the real and ever existing word of God, in
which we cannot be deceived.It proclaim-eth his power, it demonstrates
his wisdom, it manifests his goodness and beneficence.The moral duty
of man consists in imitating the moral goodness and beneficence of God
manifested in the creation towards all his creatures.That seeing, as we
daily do, the goodness of God to all men, it is an example calling upon
all men to practise the same towards each other, and consequently
that everything of persecution and revenge between man and man, and
everything of cruelty to animals, is a violation of moral duty."In what "Israel" is greater faith found?Having written these words,
the pen drops from our world-wanderer's hand.It is nine o'clock of
the night.He will now go and bend his neck under the decree of the
Convention--provided by "the goodness of God to all men."Through the
Faubourg, past Porte St.Martin, to the Rue Richelieu, to the Passage
des Petits Peres, he walks in the wintry night.In the house where
he wrote his appeal that the Convention would slay not the man in
destroying the monarch, he asks a lodging "for that night only."As he lays his head on the pillow, it is no doubt with a grateful
feeling that the good God has prolonged his freedom long enough to
finish a defence of true religion from its degradation by superstition
or destruction by atheism,--these, as he declares, being the two
purposes of his work.It was providently if not providentially timed."I had not finished it more than six hours, in the state it has since
appeared, before a guard came, about three in the morning, with an
order, signed by the two Committees of Public Safety and Surety General,
for putting me in arrestation as a foreigner, and conveying me to the
prison of the Luxembourg."The following documents are translated for this work from the originals
in the National Archives of France."Committee of General Surety and Surveillance of the National
Convention."On the 7th Nivose [December 27th] of the ad year of the French

"The Committee resolves, that the persons named Thomas Paine and
Anacharsis Clootz, formerly Deputies to the National Convention,
be arrested and imprisoned, as a measure of General Surety; that an
examination be made of their papers, and those found suspicious put
under seal and brought to the Committee of General Surety."Citizens Jean Baptiste Martin and Lamy, bearers of the present decree
are empowered to execute it,--for which they ask the help of the Civil
authorities and, if need be, of the army."The representatives of the nation, members of the Committee of General

Guffroy, Louis (du bas Rhin) La Vicomterie, Panis.""This day, the 8th Nivose of the 2d year of the French Republic, one and
indivisible, to execute and fulfil the order given us, we have gone to
the residence of Citizen Thomas Paine, Passage des Petits Peres,
number seven, Philadelphia House.Having requested the Commander of the
[Police] post, William Tell Section, to have us escorted, according to
the order we showed him, he obeyed by assigning us four privates and
a corporal, to search the above-said lodging; where we requested the
porter to open the door, and asked him whether he knew all who lodged
there; and as he did not affirm it, we desired him to take us to the
principal agent, which he did; having come to the said agent, we asked
him if he knew by name all the persons to whom he rented lodgings; after
having repeated to him the name mentioned in our order, he replied to
us, that he had come to ask him a lodging for that night only; which
being ascertained, we asked him to conduct us to the bedroom of Citizen
Thomas Paine, where we arrived; then seeing we could not be understood
by him, an American, we begged the manager of the house, who knows his
language, to kindly interpret for him, giving him notice of the order of
which we were bearers; whereupon the said Citizen Thomas Paine submitted
to be taken to Rue Jacob, Great Britain Hotel, which he declared
through his interpreter to be the place where he had his papers; having
recognized that his lodging contained none of them, we accompanied the
said Thomas Paine and his interpreter to Great Britain Hotel, Rue Jacob,
Unity Section; the present minutes closed, after being read before the
undersigned.* It will be remembered that Audibert had carried to London
     Paine's invitation to the Convention."And as it was about seven or eight o'clock in the morning of this day
8th Nivose, being worn out with fatigue, and forced to take some food,
we postponed the end of our proceeding till eleven o'clock of the same
day, when, desiring to finish it, we went with Citizen Thomas Paine to
Britain House, where we found Citizen Barlow, whom Citizen Thomas Paine
informed that we, the Commissaries, were come to look into the papers,
which he said were at his house, as announced in our preceding paragraph
through Citizen Dellanay, his interpreter; We, Commissary of the Section
of the Unity, undersigned, with the Citizens order-bearers, requested
Citizen Barlow to declare whether there were in his house, any papers
or correspondence belonging to Citizen Thomas Paine; on which, complying
with our request, he declared there did not exist any; but wishing to
leave no doubt on our way of conducting the matter, we did not think it
right to rely on what he said; resolving, on the contrary, to ascertain
by all legal ways that there did not exist any, we requested Citizen
Barlow to open for us all his cupboards; which he did, and after having
visited them, we, the abovesaid Commissary, always in the presence of
Citizen Thomas Paine, recognized that there existed no papers belonging
to him; we also perceived that it was a subterfuge on the part of
Citizen Thomas Paine who wished only to transfer himself to the house of
Citizen Barlow, his native friend (_son ami natal_) whom we invited to
ask of Citizen Thomas Paine his usual place of abode; and the latter
seemed to wish that his friend might accompany him and be present at the
examination of his papers.Which we, the said Commissary granted him,
as Citizen Barlow could be of help to us, together with Citizen Etienne
Thomas Dessous, interpreter for the English language, and Deputy
Secretary to the Committee of General Surety of the National Convention,
whom we called, in passing by the said Committee, to accompany us to
the true lodging of the said Paine, Faubourg du Nord, Nro.At which
place we entered his rooms, and gathered in the Sitting-room all
the papers found in the other rooms of the said apartment.The said
Sitting-room receives light from three windows, looking, one on
the Garden and the two others on the Courtyard; and after the most
scrupulous examination of all the papers, that we had there gathered,
none of them has been found suspicious, neither in French nor in
English, according to what was affirmed to us by Citizen Dessous our
interpreter who signed with us, and Citizen Thomas Paine; and we, the
undersigned Commissary, resolved that no seal should be placed, after
the examination mentioned, and closed the said minutes, which we declare
to contain the truth.Drawn up at the residence, and closed at 4 p.m.in the day and year abovenamed; and we have all signed after having read
the minutes."And after having signed we have requested, according to the order of
the Committee of General Surety of the National Convention, Citizen
Thomas Paine to follow us, to be led to jail; to which he complied
without any difficulty, and he has signed with us:

"Foreign Office--Received the 12th Ventose [March 2d].Sent to the
Committees of General Surety and Public Safety the 8th Pluviose [January
27th] this 2d year of the French Republic, One and indivisible."Citizens Legislators!--The French nation has, by a universal decree,
invited to France one of our countrymen, most worthy of honor, namely,
Thomas Paine, one of the political founders of the independence and of
the Republic of America."Our experience of twenty years has taught America to know and esteem
his public virtues and the invaluable services he rendered her."Persuaded that his character of foreigner and ex-Deputy is the only
cause of his provisional imprisonment, we come in the name of our
country (and we feel sure she will be grateful to us for it), we come
to you, Legislators, to reclaim our friend, our countryman, that he may
sail with us for America, where he will be received with open arms."If it were necessary to say more in support of the Petition which,
as friends and allies of the French Republic, we submit to her
representatives, to obtain the liberation of one of the most earnest and
faithful apostles of liberty, we would beseech the National Convention,
for the sake of all that is dear to the glory and to the heart of
freemen, not to give a cause of joy and triumph to the allied tyrants of
Europe, and above all to the despotism of Great Britain, which did not
blush to outlaw this courageous and virtuous defender of Liberty."But their insolent joy will be of short duration; for we have the
intimate persuasion that you will not keep longer in the bonds of
painful captivity the man whose courageous and energetic pen did so much
to free the Americans, and whose intentions we have no doubt whatever
were to render the same services to the French Republic.Yes, we feel
convinced that his principles and views were pure, and in that regard
he is entitled to the indulgence due to human fallibility, and to the
respect due to rectitude of heart; and we hold all the more firmly
our opinion of his innocence, inasmuch as we are informed that after a
scrupulous examination of his papers, made by order of the Committee of
General Surety, instead of anything to his charge, enough has been
found rather to corroborate the purity of his principles in politics and
morals."As a countryman of ours, as a man above all so dear to the Americans,
who like yourselves are earnest friends of Liberty, we ask you, in the
name of that goddess cherished of the only two Republics of the World,
to give back Thomas Paine to his brethren and permit us to take him to
his country which is also ours."If you require it, Citizens Representatives, we shall make ourselves
warrant and security for his conduct in France during the short stay he
may make in this land."Signed: W. Jackson, of Philadelphia.John Willert Billopp, of New
York.Samuel P. Broome, of New York.Joel
Barlow, of Connecticut.John McPherson, of Alexandria [Va.].The following answer to the petitioning Americans was given by Vadier,
then president of the Convention."Citizens: The brave Americans are our brothers in liberty; like us
they have broken the chains of despotism; like us they have sworn the
destruction of kings and vowed an eternal hatred to tyrants and their
instruments.From this identity of principles should result a union
of the two nations forever unalterable.If the tree of liberty already
flourishes in the two hemispheres, that of commerce should, by this
happy alliance, cover the poles with its fruitful branches.It is for
France, it is for the United States, to combat and lay low, in concert,
these proud islanders, these insolent dominators of the sea and the
commerce of nations.When the sceptre of despotism is falling from the
criminal hand of the tyrants of the earth, it is necessary also to break
the trident which emboldens the insolence of these corsairs of Albion,
these modern Carthaginians.It is time to repress the audacity and
mercantile avarice of these pirate tyrants of the sea, and of the
commerce of nations."You demand of us, citizens, the liberty of Thomas Paine; you wish to
restore to your hearths this defender of the rights of man.One can only
applaud this generous movement.Thomas Paine is a native of England;
this is undoubtedly enough to apply to him the measures of security
prescribed by the revolutionary laws.It may be added, citizens, that
if Thomas Paine has been the apostle of liberty, if he has powerfully
co-operated with the American Revolution, his genius has not understood
that which has regenerated France; he has regarded the system only
in accordance with the illusions with which the false friends of our
revolution have invested it.You must with us deplore an error little
reconcilable with the principles admired in the justly esteemed works of
this republican author.* The preceding documents connected with the arrest are in
     the Archives Nationales."The National Convention will take into consideration the object of your
petition, and invites you to its sessions."A memorandum adds: "Reference of this petition is decreed to the
Committees of Public Safety and General Surety, united."It is said that Paine sent an appeal for intervention to the Cordeliers
Club, and that their only reply was to return to him a copy of his
speech in favor of preserving the life of Louis XVI.This I have not
been able to verify.On leaving his house for prison, Paine entrusted to Joel Barlow the
manuscript of the "Age of Reason," to be conveyed to the printer.This
was with the knowledge of the guard, whose kindness is mentioned by
Paine.A MINISTER AND HIS PRISONER

Before resuming the history of the conspiracy against Paine it is
necessary to return a little on our steps.For a year after the fall of
monarchy in France (August 10, 1792), the real American Minister there
was Paine, whether for Americans or for the French Executive.The
Ministry would not confer with a hostile and presumably decapitated
agent, like Morris.Those communications of
Paine were utilized in Robespierre's report to the Convention, November
17, 1793, on the foreign relations of France.It was inspired by the
humiliating tidings that Genet in America had reinforced the European
intrigues to detach Washington from France.The President had demanded
Genet's recall, had issued a proclamation of "impartiality" between
France and her foes, and had not yet decided whether the treaty formed
with Louis XVI.In his report Robespierre makes a solemn appeal to the "brave
Americans."Was it "that crowned automaton called Louis XVI."who helped
to rescue them from the oppressor's yoke, or our arm and armies?Was it
his money sent over or the taxes of French labor?He declares that the
Republic has been treacherously compromised in America."By a strange fatality the Republic finds itself still represented
among their allies by agents of the traitors she has punished: Brissot's
brother-in-law is Consul-General there; another man, named Genet, sent
by Lebrun and Brissot to Philadelphia as plenipotentiary agent, has
faithfully fulfilled the views and instructions of the faction that
appointed him."The result is that "parallel intrigues" are observable--one aiming
to bring France under the league, the other to break up the American
republic into parts.*

     * "Hist.In this idea of "parallel intrigues" the irremovable Morris is
discoverable.It is the reappearance of what he had said to Deforgues
about the simultaneous sedition in America (Genet's) and "influence in
their affairs from the other side of the channel" (Paine's).There was
not, however, in Robespierre's report any word that might be construed
into a suspicion of Paine; on the contrary, he declares the Convention
now pure.The Convention instructed the Committee of Public Safety
to provide for strictest fulfilment of its treaties with America, and
caution to its agents to respect the government and territory of
its allies.The first necessary step was to respect the President's
Minister, Gouverneur Morris, however odious he might be, since it would
be on his representations that the continuance of France's one important
alliance might depend.Morris played cleverly on that string; he hinted
dangers that did not exist, and dangled promises never to be fulfilled.The unofficial Minister he had
practically superseded him for a year was now easily locked up in the
Luxembourg.The historic paradox must be ventured
that he owed his reprieve--his life--to Robespierre.Robespierre had
Morris' intercepted letters and other evidences of his treachery, yet
as Washington insisted on him, and the alliance was at stake, he must be
obeyed.On the other hand were evidences of Washington's friendship
for Paine, and of Jefferson's intimacy with him.Time must therefore be
allowed for the prisoner to communicate with the President and Secretary
of State.It was only after
ample time had passed, and no word about Paine came from Washington
or Jefferson, while Morris still held his position, that Robespierre
entered his memorandum that Paine should be tried before the
revolutionary tribunal.Meanwhile a great deal happened, some of which, as Paine's experiences
in the Luxembourg, must be deferred to a further chapter.The Americans in Paris, including the
remaining sea-captains, who had been looking to Paine as their Minister,
were now to discover where the power was lodged.Knowing Morris' hatred
for Paine, they repaired to the Convention with their petition.Major
Jackson, a well known officer of the American Revolution, who headed the
deputation (which included every unofficial American in Paris), utilized
a letter of introduction he had brought from Secretary Jefferson to
Morris by giving it to the Committee of General Surety, as an evidence
of his right to act in the emergency.Action was delayed by excitement over the celebration of the first
anniversary of the King's execution.On that occasion (January 21st)
the Convention joined the Jacobin Club in marching to the "Place de la
Revolution," with music and banners; there the portraits of kings were
burned, an act of accusation against all the kings of the earth adopted,
and a fearfully realistic drama enacted.By a prearrangement unknown
to the Convention four condemned men were guillotined before them.The Convention recoiled, and instituted an inquisition as to the
responsibility for this scene.It was credited to the Committee of
General Surety, justly no doubt, but its chief, Vadier, managed
to relieve it of the odium.This Vadier was then president of the
Convention.He was appropriately selected to give the first anniversary
oration on the King's execution.A few days later it fell to Vadier to
address the eighteen Americans at the bar of the Convention on their
petition for Paine's release.The petition and petitioners being
referred to the Committees of Public Safety and General Surety in joint
session, the Americans were there answered, by Billaud-Varennes it was
said, "that their reclamation was only the act of individuals, without
any authority from the American government."Bill 'ad just lit 'is pipe, and as he threw
the match down he ses: "I don't like these 'ere safety matches," he ses.ses Bill, turning on 'im like lightning; "well,
take that for contradictin'," he ses, an' he gave Ginger a smack that
nearly knocked his 'ead off.It was so sudden that old Sam and Peter put their beer down and stared at
each other as if they couldn't believe their eyes.Then they stooped
down and helped pore Ginger on to 'is legs agin and began to brush 'im
down."Never mind about 'im, mates," ses Bill, looking at Ginger very wicked."P'r'aps he won't be so ready to give me 'is lip next time.Let's come
to another pub and enjoy ourselves."Sam and Peter followed 'im out like lambs, 'ardly daring to look over
their shoulder at Ginger, who was staggering arter them some distance
behind a 'olding a handerchief to 'is face."It's your turn to pay, Sam," ses Bill, when they'd got inside the next
place."Three 'arf pints o' four ale, miss," ses Sam, not because 'e was mean,
but because it wasn't 'is turn."Three pots o' six ale, miss," ses Sam, in a hurry."That wasn't wot you said afore," ses Bill."Take that," he ses, giving
pore old Sam a wipe in the mouth and knocking 'im over a stool; "take
that for your sauce."Peter Russet stood staring at Sam and wondering wot Bill ud be like when
he'd 'ad a little more.Sam picked hisself up arter a time and went
outside to talk to Ginger about it, and then Bill put 'is arm round
Peter's neck and began to cry a bit and say 'e was the only pal he'd got
left in the world.It was very awkward for Peter, and more awkward still
when the barman came up and told 'im to take Bill outside."Go on," he ses, "out with 'im.""He's all right," ses Peter, trembling; "we's the truest-'arted gentleman
in London.Bill said he was, and 'e asked the barman to go and hide 'is face because
it reminded 'im of a little dog 'e had 'ad once wot 'ad died."You get outside afore you're hurt," ses the bar-man.Bill punched at 'im over the bar, and not being able to reach 'im threw
Peter's pot o' beer at 'im.There was a fearful to-do then, and the
landlord jumped over the bar and stood in the doorway, whistling for the
police.Bill struck out right and left, and the men in the bar went down
like skittles, Peter among them.Then they got outside, and Bill, arter
giving the landlord a thump in the back wot nearly made him swallow the
whistle, jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter 'im.[Illustration: "Bill jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter
'im."]"I'll talk to you by-and-by," he ses, as the cab drove off at a gallop;
"there ain't room in this cab.You wait, my lad, that's all.You just
wait till we get out, and I'll knock you silly.""Don't you talk to me," roars Bill."If I choose to knock you about
that's my business, ain't it?He wouldn't let Peter say another word, but coming to a quiet place near
the docks he stopped the cab and pulling 'im out gave 'im such a dressing
down that Peter thought 'is last hour 'ad arrived.He let 'im go at
last, and after first making him pay the cab-man took 'im along till they
came to a public-'ouse and made 'im pay for drinks.They stayed there till nearly eleven o'clock, and then Bill set off home
'olding the unfortunit Peter by the scruff o' the neck, and wondering out
loud whether 'e ought to pay 'im a bit more or not.Daniel travelled to the garden.Afore 'e could make
up 'is mind, however, he turned sleepy, and, throwing 'imself down on the
bed which was meant for the two of 'em, fell into a peaceful sleep.Sam and Ginger Dick came in a little while arterward, both badly marked
where Bill 'ad hit them, and sat talking to Peter in whispers as to wot
was to be done.Ginger, who 'ad plenty of pluck, was for them all to set
on to 'im, but Sam wouldn't 'ear of it, and as for Peter he was so sore
he could 'ardly move.They all turned in to the other bed at last, 'arf afraid to move for fear
of disturbing Bill, and when they woke up in the morning and see 'im
sitting up in 'is bed they lay as still as mice."Why, Ginger, old chap," ses Bill, with a 'earty smile, "wot are you all
three in one bed for?""We was a bit cold," ses Ginger.We 'ad a bit of a spree last
night, old man, didn't we?My throat's as dry as a cinder.""It ain't my idea of a spree," ses Ginger, sitting up and looking at 'im.ses Bill, starting back, "wotever 'ave you been
a-doing to your face?Have you been tumbling off of a 'bus?"Ginger couldn't answer; and Sam Small and Peter sat up in bed alongside
of 'im, and Bill, getting as far back on 'is bed as he could, sat staring
at their pore faces as if 'e was having a 'orrible dream."And there's Sam," he ses."Where ever did you get that mouth, Sam?""Same place as Ginger got 'is eye and pore Peter got 'is face," ses Sam,
grinding his teeth."You don't mean to tell me," ses Bill, in a sad voice--"you don't mean to
tell me that I did it?""You know well enough," ses Ginger.Daniel went to the bathroom.Bill looked at 'em, and 'is face got as long as a yard measure."I'd 'oped I'd growed out of it, mates," he ses, at last, "but drink
always takes me like that."You surprise me," ses Ginger, sarcastic-like."Don't talk like that,
Ginger," ses Bill, 'arf crying."It ain't my fault; it's my weakness."I don't know," ses Ginger, "but you won't get the chance of doing it
agin, I'll tell you that much.""I daresay I shall be better to-night, Ginger," ses Bill, very humble;
"it don't always take me that way."Well, we don't want you with us any more," ses old Sam, 'olding his 'ead
very high."You'll 'ave to go and get your beer by yourself, Bill," ses Peter
Russet, feeling 'is bruises with the tips of 'is fingers."But then I should be worse," ses Bill."I want cheerful company when
I'm like that.I should very likely come 'ome and 'arf kill you all in
your beds.You don't 'arf know what I'm like.Last night was nothing,
else I should 'ave remembered it."'Ow do you think company's going to be
cheerful when you're carrying on like that, Bill?Why don't you go away
and leave us alone?""
