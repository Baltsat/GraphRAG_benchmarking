Then, without a word, he tiptoed back to the car again, and, crawling
into the tonneau, covered himself with rugs.In his untutored mind were
certain great qualities, and loyalty to his employer was one.The five
dollars in his pocket had nothing whatever to do with it.At eighteen he had developed a philosophy of four words.It took the
place of the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, and the Catechism.It
was: "Mind your own business."The discovery of Tillie's hiding-place interested but did not thrill
him.If she wanted to do the sort of thing she
was doing, that was her affair.Tillie and her middle-aged lover, Palmer
Howe and Grace--the alley was not unfamiliar with such relationships.It
viewed them with tolerance until they were found out, when it raised its
hands.True to his promise, Palmer wakened the sleeping boy before nine
o'clock.Grace had eaten little and drunk nothing; but Howe was slightly
stimulated."Give her the 'once over,'" he told Johnny, "and then go back and crawl
into the rugs again.Their progress was slow and rough over the
country roads, but when they reached the State road Howe threw open the
throttle.He took chances
and got away with them, laughing at the girl's gasps of dismay."Wait until I get beyond Simkinsville," he said, "and I'll let her out.The girl sat beside him with her eyes fixed ahead.He had been drinking,
and the warmth of the liquor was in his voice.She was going to make him live up to the letter of his promise to
go away at the house door; and more and more she realized that it would
be difficult.Instead of laughing when
she drew back from a proffered caress, he turned surly.Obstinate lines
that she remembered appeared from his nostrils to the corners of his
mouth.Finally she hit on a plan to make him stop somewhere in her neighborhood
and let her get out of the car.Now it passed them, and as
often they passed it.Palmer's car lost on
the hills, but gained on the long level stretches, which gleamed with a
coating of thin ice."I wish you'd let them get ahead, Palmer."I told you we'd travel to-night."What the deuce was the matter with
women, anyhow?Here was Grace as
sober as Christine.His light car skidded and struck the big car heavily.On a smooth road
perhaps nothing more serious than broken mudguards would have been the
result.But on the ice the small car slewed around and slid over the
edge of the bank.At the bottom of the declivity it turned over.Howe freed himself and stood
erect, with one arm hanging at his side.There was no sound at all from
the boy under the tonneau.Down the bank plunged a heavy, gorilla-like
figure, long arms pushing aside the frozen branches of trees.When he
reached the car, O'Hara found Grace sitting unhurt on the ground.In the
wreck of the car the lamps had not been extinguished, and by their light
he made out Howe, swaying dizzily.The other members of O'Hara's party had crawled down the bank by that
time.With the aid of a jack, they got the car up.Johnny Rosenfeld lay
doubled on his face underneath.When he came to and opened his eyes,
Grace almost shrieked with relief."I'm all right," said Johnny Rosenfeld.And, when they offered him
whiskey: "Away with the fire-water.I--I--" A spasm of
pain twisted his face.With his arms he lifted
himself to a sitting position, and fell back again.CHAPTER XVII


By Christmas Day Sidney was back in the hospital, a little wan, but
valiantly determined to keep her life to its mark of service.She had a
talk with K. the night before she left.Katie was out, and Sidney had put the dining-room in order.K. sat by
the table and watched her as she moved about the room.The past few weeks had been very wonderful to him: to help her up and
down the stairs, to read to her in the evenings as she lay on the couch
in the sewing-room; later, as she improved, to bring small dainties home
for her tray, and, having stood over Katie while she cooked them, to
bear them in triumph to that upper room--he had not been so happy in
years."I hope you don't feel as if you must stay on," she said anxiously."Not
that we don't want you--you know better than that.""There is no place else in the whole world that I want to go to," he
said simply."I seem to be always relying on somebody's kindness to--to keep things
together.First, for years and years, it was Aunt Harriet; now it is
you.""Don't you realize that, instead of your being grateful to me, it is
I who am undeniably grateful to you?I have lived
around--in different places and in different ways.I would rather be
here than anywhere else in the world."There was so much that was hopeless in his
eyes that he did not want her to see.She would be quite capable, he
told himself savagely, of marrying him out of sheer pity if she ever
guessed.And he was afraid--afraid, since he wanted her so much--that he
would be fool and weakling enough to take her even on those terms.Everything was ready for her return to the hospital.She had been out
that day to put flowers on the quiet grave where Anna lay with folded
hands; she had made her round of little visits on the Street; and now
her suit-case, packed, was in the hall."In one way, it will be a little better for you than if Christine and
Palmer were not in the house."She likes you, K. She depends on you, too, especially since that night
when you took care of Palmer's arm before we got Dr.I often think,
K., what a good doctor you would have been.You knew so well what to do
for mother."She still could not trust her voice about her mother."Palmer's arm is going to be quite straight.Ed is so proud of Max
over it.Once at least, whenever they were
together, she brought Max into the conversation.He is
interesting, don't you think?""Very," said K.

To save his life, he could not put any warmth into his voice.It was not in human nature to expect more of him."Those long talks you have, shut in your room--what in the world do you
talk about?She was a little jealous of those evenings, when she sat alone, or
when Harriet, sitting with her, made sketches under the lamp to the
accompaniment of a steady hum of masculine voices from across the hall.Max came in always, before he went,
and, leaning over the back of a chair, would inform her of the absolute
blankness of life in the hospital without her."I go every day because I must," he would assure her gayly; "but, I tell
you, the snap is gone out of it.When there was a chance that every cap
was YOUR cap, the mere progress along a corridor became thrilling."He
had a foreign trick of throwing out his hands, with a little shrug of
the shoulders.he said--which, being translated, means:
"What the devil's the use!"And K. would stand in the doorway, quietly smoking, or go back to his
room and lock away in his trunk the great German books on surgery with
which he and Max had been working out a case.So K. sat by the dining-room table and listened to her talk of Max that
last evening together.Rosenfeld to-day not to be too much discouraged about
Johnny.Now that you are
such friends,"--she eyed him wistfully,--"perhaps some day you will come
to one of his operations.Even if you didn't understand exactly, I know
it would thrill you.And--I'd like you to see me in my uniform, K. You
never have."She grew a little sad as the evening went on.She was going to miss K.
very much.While she was ill she had watched the clock for the time to
listen for him.She knew the way he slammed the front door.Palmer never
slammed the door.She knew too that, just after a bang that threatened
the very glass in the transom, K. would come to the foot of the stairs
and call:--

"Ahoy, there!""Aye, aye," she would answer--which was, he assured her, the proper
response.Whether he came up the stairs at once or took his way back to Katie had
depended on whether his tribute for the day was fruit or sweetbreads.He would miss her,
too; but he would have Harriet and Christine and--Max.Back in a circle
to Max, of course.She insisted, that last evening, on sitting up with him until midnight
ushered in Christmas Day.Christine and Palmer were out; Harriet, having
presented Sidney with a blouse that had been left over in the shop from
the autumn's business, had yawned herself to bed.When the bells announced midnight, Sidney roused with a start.She
realized that neither of them had spoken, and that K.The little clock on the shelf took up the burden of the
churches, and struck the hour in quick staccato notes.Sidney rose and went over to K., her black dress in soft folds about
her.Sidney left the little house at
six, with the street light still burning through a mist of falling snow.The hospital wards and corridors were still lighted when she went on
duty at seven o'clock.She had been assigned to the men's surgical ward,
and went there at once.She had not seen Carlotta Harrison since her
mother's death; but she found her on duty in the surgical ward.For the
second time in four months, the two girls were working side by side.Sidney's recollection of her previous service under Carlotta made her
nervous."We were all sorry to hear of your trouble," she said."I hope we shall
get on nicely."Sidney surveyed the ward, full to overflowing.At the far end two cots
had been placed."The ward is heavy, isn't it?"There are three of
us--you, myself, and a probationer."The first light of the Christmas morning was coming through the windows.Carlotta put out the lights and turned in a business-like way to her
records."The probationer's name is Wardwell," she said."Perhaps you'd better
help her with the breakfasts.If there's any way to make a mistake, she
makes it."It was after eight when Sidney found Johnny Rosenfeld.Suffering had refined the boy's features.His dark, heavily fringed eyes
looked at her from a pale face."I was in a private room; but it cost thirty plunks a week, so I moved.Sidney had not seen him since his accident.She had wished to go, but K.
had urged against it.She was not strong, and she had already suffered
much.And now the work of the ward pressed hard.She stood beside him and stroked his hand.He pretended to think that her sympathy was for his fall from the estate
of a private patient to the free ward."Oh, I'm all right, Miss Sidney," he said.Howe is paying six
dollars a week for me.The difference between me and the other fellows
around here is that I get a napkin on my tray and they don't.""Six dollars a week for a napkin is going some.I'm no bloated
aristocrat; I don't have to have a napkin.""Have they told you what the trouble is?"Max Wilson is going to
operate on me.What a thing it was
to be able to take this life-in-death of Johnny Rosenfeld's and make it
life again!All sorts of men made up Sidney's world: the derelicts who wandered
through the ward in flapping slippers, listlessly carrying trays; the
unshaven men in the beds, looking forward to another day of boredom, if
not of pain; Palmer Howe with his broken arm; K., tender and strong, but
filling no especial place in the world.Towering over them all was the
younger Wilson.He meant for her, that Christmas morning, all that the
other men were not--to their weakness strength, courage, daring, power.Johnny Rosenfeld lay back on the pillows and watched her face."When I was a kid," he said, "and ran along the Street, calling Dr.Max
a dude, I never thought I'd lie here watching that door to see him come
in.Ain't it the hell of a world, anyhow?It
ain't much of a Christmas to you, either."Sidney fed him his morning beef tea, and, because her eyes filled up
with tears now and then at his helplessness, she was not so skillful as
she might have been.When one spoonful had gone down his neck, he smiled
up at her whimsically.As much as was possible, the hospital rested on that Christmas Day.The
internes went about in fresh white ducks with sprays of mistletoe in
their buttonholes, doing few dressings.Over the upper floors, where the
kitchens were located, spread toward noon the insidious odor of roasting
turkeys.Every ward had its vase of holly.In the afternoon, services
were held in the chapel downstairs.Wheel-chairs made their slow progress along corridors and down
elevators.Convalescents who were able to walk flapped along in carpet
slippers.Outside the wide doors of the corridor
the wheel-chairs were arranged in a semicircle.Behind them, dressed for
the occasion, were the elevator-men, the orderlies, and Big John, who
drove the ambulance.On one side of the aisle, near the front, sat the nurses in rows, in
crisp caps and fresh uniforms.On the other side had been reserved a
place for the staff.The internes stood back against the wall, ready to
run out between rejoicings, as it were--for a cigarette or an ambulance
call, as the case might be.Over everything brooded the after-dinner peace of Christmas afternoon.The nurses sang, and Sidney sang with them, her fresh young voice rising
above the rest.Yellow winter sunlight came through the stained-glass
windows and shone on her lovely flushed face, her smooth kerchief, her
cap, always just a little awry.Max, lounging against the wall, across the chapel, found his eyes
straying toward her constantly.What
a zest for living and for happiness she had!The Episcopal clergyman read the Epistle:

"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."She was good, and she had been anointed with the oil of
gladness.And he--

His brother was singing.His deep bass voice, not always true, boomed
out above the sound of the small organ.Ed had been a good brother to
him; he had been a good son.Max's vagrant mind wandered away from the service to the picture of his
mother over his brother's littered desk, to the Street, to K., to the
girl who had refused to marry him because she did not trust him, to
Carlotta last of all.He turned a little and ran his eyes along the line
of nurses.As if she were conscious of his scrutiny, she lifted
her head and glanced toward him.The nurses sang:--

     "O holy Child of Bethlehem!Descend to us, we pray;
      Cast out our sin, and enter in,
      Be born in us to-day."The wheel-chairs and convalescents quavered the familiar words.Ed's
heavy throat shook with earnestness.The Head, sitting a little apart with her hands folded in her lap and
weary with the suffering of the world, closed her eyes and listened.The Christmas morning had brought Sidney half a dozen gifts.K. sent her
a silver thermometer case with her monogram, Christine a toilet mirror.But the gift of gifts, over which Sidney's eyes had glowed, was a
great box of roses marked in Dr.Max's copper-plate writing, "From a
neighbor."Tucked in the soft folds of her kerchief was one of the roses that
afternoon.Max was waiting for Sidney in the
corridor.--she glanced down to the rose
she wore."The others make the most splendid bit of color in the ward.""They are not any the less mine because I am letting other people have a
chance to enjoy them."Under all his gayety he was curiously diffident with her.All the pretty
speeches he would have made to Carlotta under the circumstances died
before her frank glance.There were many things he wanted to say to her.He wanted to tell her
that he was sorry her mother had died; that the Street was empty without
her; that he looked forward to these daily meetings with her as a holy
man to his hour before his saint.What he really said was to inquire
politely whether she had had her Christmas dinner.Sidney eyed him, half amused, half hurt.Is it bad for discipline for us to be good
friends?"Something in her eyes roused
the devil of mischief that always slumbered in him."My car's been stalled in a snowdrift downtown since early this morning,
and I have Ed's Peggy in a sleigh.Put on your things and come for a
ride."He hoped Carlotta could hear what he said; to be certain of it, he
maliciously raised his voice a trifle.She was to be free that afternoon until six o'clock;
but she had promised to go home.Ten to one, he's with her now."The
heavy odor of the hospital, mingled with the scent of pine and evergreen
in the chapel; made her dizzy.And,
besides, if K. were with Christine--

"It's forbidden, isn't it?""And yet, you continue to tempt me and expect me to yield!""One of the most delightful things about temptation is yielding now and
then."Here was her old friend and
neighbor asking to take her out for a daylight ride.The swift rebellion
of youth against authority surged up in Sidney.Carlotta had gone by that time--gone with hate in her heart and black
despair.She knew very well what the issue would be.Sidney would drive
with him, and he would tell her how lovely she looked with the air on
her face and the snow about her.The jerky motion of the little sleigh
would throw them close together.He would
touch Sidney's hand daringly and smile in her eyes.That was his method:
to play at love-making like an audacious boy, until quite suddenly the
cloak dropped and the danger was there.The Christmas excitement had not died out in the ward when Carlotta went
back to it.On each bedside table was an orange, and beside it a pair
of woolen gloves and a folded white handkerchief.There were sprays of
holly scattered about, too, and the after-dinner content of roast turkey
and ice-cream.The lame girl who played the violin limped down the corridor into the
ward.She was greeted with silence, that truest tribute, and with the
instant composing of the restless ward to peace.She was pretty in a young, pathetic way, and because to her Christmas
was a festival and meant hope and the promise of the young Lord, she
played cheerful things.The ward sat up, remembered that it was not the Sabbath, smiled across
from bed to bed.The probationer, whose name was Wardwell, was a tall, lean girl with a
long, pointed nose.She kept up a running accompaniment of small talk to
the music."Last Christmas," she said plaintively, "we went out into the country
in a hay-wagon and had a real time.I don't know what I am here for,
anyhow."Turkey and goose, mince pie and pumpkin pie, four kinds of cake; that's
the sort of spread we have up in our part of the world.When I think of
what I sat down to to-day--!"She had a profound respect for Carlotta, and her motto in the hospital
differed from Sidney's in that it was to placate her superiors, while
Sidney's had been to care for her patients.Seeing Carlotta bored, she ventured a little gossip.She had idly
glued the label of a medicine bottle on the back of her hand, and was
scratching a skull and cross-bones on it."I wonder if you have noticed something," she said, eyes on the label."I have noticed that the three-o'clock medicines are not given," said
Carlotta sharply; and Miss Wardwell, still labeled and adorned, made the
rounds of the ward."I'm no gossip," she said, putting the tray on the table."If you won't
see, you won't.As it was not required that tears be recorded on the record, Carlotta
paid no attention to this.Miss Wardwell swelled with importance
and let her superior ask her twice.A hand seemed to catch Carlotta's heart and hold it.Being an old friend doesn't make you look at a girl as if you
wanted to take a bite out of her.Mark my word, Miss Harrison, she'll
never finish her training; she'll marry him.I wish," concluded the
probationer plaintively, "that some good-looking fellow like that would
take a fancy to me.I am as ugly as a mud fence, but
I've got style."She was long and sinuous, but she wore her
lanky, ill-fitting clothes with a certain distinction.Harriet Kennedy
would have dressed her in jade green to match her eyes, and with long
jade earrings, and made her a fashion.The violinist had seen the tears on Johnny
Rosenfeld's white cheeks, and had rushed into rollicking, joyous music."I'm twenty-one and she's eighteen," hummed the
ward under its breath."Lord, how I'd like to dance!If I ever get out of this charnel-house!"The medicine-tray lay at Carlotta's elbow; beside it the box of labels.Carlotta knew it down to the depths of
her tortured brain.As inevitably as the night followed the day, she was
losing her game.She had lost already, unless--

If she could get Sidney out of the hospital, it would simplify things.She surmised shrewdly that on the Street their interests were wide
apart.It was here that they met on common ground.The lame violin-player limped out of the ward; the shadows of the
early winter twilight settled down.At five o'clock Carlotta sent Miss
Wardwell to first supper, to the surprise of that seldom surprised
person.The ward lay still or shuffled abut quietly.Christmas was over,
and there were no evening papers to look forward to.Carlotta gave the five-o'clock medicines.Then she sat down at the table
near the door, with the tray in front of her.There are certain thoughts
that are at first functions of the brain; after a long time the spinal
cord takes them up and converts them into acts almost automatically.Perhaps because for the last month she had done the thing so often in
her mind, its actual performance was almost without conscious thought.Carlotta took a bottle from her medicine cupboard, and, writing a new
label for it, pasted it over the old one.Then she exchanged it for one
of the same size on the medicine tray.In the dining-room, at the probationers' table, Miss Wardwell was
talking."Believe me," she said, "me for the country and the simple life after
this.They think I'm only a probationer and don't see anything, but I've
got eyes in my head.Wilson, and she
thinks I don't see it.But never mind; I paid, her up to-day for a few
of the jolts she has given me."Throughout the dining-room busy and competent young women came and ate,
hastily or leisurely as their opportunity was, and went on their way
again.In their hands they held the keys, not always of life and death
perhaps, but of ease from pain, of tenderness, of smooth pillows, and
cups of water to thirsty lips.In their eyes, as in Sidney's, burned the
light of service.But here and there one found women, like Carlotta and Miss Wardwell,
who had mistaken their vocation, who railed against the monotony of the
life, its limitations, its endless sacrifices.Fifty or so against two--fifty who looked out on the world with the
fearless glance of those who have seen life to its depths, and, with the
broad understanding of actual contact, still found it good.Fifty who
were learning or had learned not to draw aside their clean starched
skirts from the drab of the streets.And the fifty, who found the very
scum of the gutters not too filthy for tenderness and care, let Carlotta
and, in lesser measure, the new probationer alone.They could not have
voiced their reasons.The supper-room was filled with their soft voices, the rustle of their
skirts, the gleam of their stiff white caps.When Carlotta came in, she greeted none of them.They did not like her,
and she knew it.Before her, instead of the tidy supper-table, she was seeing the
medicine-tray as she had left it."I guess I've fixed her," she said to herself.Her very soul was sick with fear of what she had done.CHAPTER XVIII


K. saw Sidney for only a moment on Christmas Day.This was when the gay
little sleigh had stopped in front of the house.Sidney had hurried radiantly in for a moment.Christine's parlor was
gay with firelight and noisy with chatter and with the clatter of her
tea-cups.K., lounging indolently in front of the fire, had turned to see Sidney
in the doorway, and leaped to his feet."I can't come in," she cried.I am out
sleigh-riding with Dr."Ask him in for a cup of tea," Christine called out."Here's Aunt
Harriet and mother and even Palmer!"Christine had aged during the last weeks, but she was putting up a brave
front.Sidney ran to the front door and called: "Will you come in for a cup of
tea?"As Sidney turned back into the house, she met Palmer.He had come out
in the hall, and had closed the door into the parlor behind him.His arm
was still in splints, and swung suspended in a gay silk sling.The sound of laughter came through the door faintly.The boy's face was
always with him."Better in some ways, but of course--"

"When are they going to operate?""He doesn't seem to blame you; he says it's all in the game.""Sidney, does Christine know that I was not alone that night?""If she guesses, it is not because of anything the boy has said.Out of the firelight, away from the chatter and the laughter, Palmer's
face showed worn and haggard.He put his free hand on Sidney's shoulder."I was thinking that perhaps if I went away--"

"That would be cowardly, wouldn't it?""If Christine would only say something and get it over with!She doesn't
sulk; I think she's really trying to be kind.She turns pale every time I touch her hand."All the light had died out of Sidney's face.Life was terrible, after
all--overwhelming.One did wrong things, and other people suffered; or
one was good, as her mother had been, and was left lonely, a widow, or
like Aunt Harriet.Things were so different from
what they seemed to be: Christine beyond the door, pouring tea and
laughing with her heart in ashes; Palmer beside her, faultlessly dressed
and wretched.The only one she thought really contented was K. He seemed
to move so calmly in his little orbit.He was always so steady, so
balanced.If life held no heights for him, at least it held no depths."There's only one thing, Palmer," she said gravely."Johnny Rosenfeld
is going to have his chance.If anybody in the world can save him, Max
Wilson can."The light of that speech was in her eyes when she went out to the sleigh
again.K. followed her out and tucked the robes in carefully about her.Is there any chance of having you home for supper?"I am to go on duty at six again."He waved them
off smilingly from the pavement, and went rather heavily back into the
house."Just how many men are in love with you, Sidney?"asked Max, as Peggy
started up the Street."No one that I know of, unless--"

"Exactly.Unless--"

"What I meant," she said with dignity, "is that unless one counts very
young men, and that isn't really love.""We'll leave out Joe Drummond and myself--for, of course, I am very
young.Who is in love with you besides Le Moyne?Any of the internes at
the hospital?"Le Moyne is not in love with me."There was such sincerity in her voice that Wilson was relieved.K., older than himself and more grave, had always had an odd attraction
for women.He had been frankly bored by them, but the fact had remained.And Max more than suspected that now, at last, he had been caught."Don't you really mean that you are in love with Le Moyne?"I am not in love with anybody; I haven't time
to be in love.So warm did the argument become that
they passed without seeing a middle-aged gentleman, short and rather
heavy set, struggling through a snowdrift on foot, and carrying in his
hand a dilapidated leather bag.But the cutter slipped by and left him knee-deep,
looking ruefully after them.Ed's mind, only a vague and
inarticulate regret.These things that came so easily to Max, the
affection of women, gay little irresponsibilities like the stealing
of Peggy and the sleigh, had never been his.If there was any faint
resentment, it was at himself.He had raised the boy wrong--he had
taught him to be selfish.Holding the bag high out of the drifts, he
made his slow progress up the Street.At something after two o'clock that night, K. put down his pipe
and listened.He had not been able to sleep since midnight.In his
dressing-gown he had sat by the small fire, thinking.The content of his
first few months on the Street was rapidly giving way to unrest.He
who had meant to cut himself off from life found himself again in close
touch with it; his eddy was deep with it.For the first time, he had begun to question the wisdom of what he had
done.It had taken courage, God knew,
to give up everything and come away.In a way, it would have taken more
courage to have stayed.He had thought, at first, that he could
fight down this love for Sidney.The
innocent touch of her hand on his arm, the moment when he had held her
in his arms after her mother's death, the thousand small contacts of her
returns to the little house--all these set his blood on fire.Under his quiet exterior K. fought many conflicts those winter
days--over his desk and ledger at the office, in his room alone,
with Harriet planning fresh triumphs beyond the partition, even by
Christine's fire, with Christine just across, sitting in silence and
watching his grave profile and steady eyes.He had a little picture of Sidney--a snap-shot that he had taken
himself.It showed Sidney minus a hand, which had been out of range when
the camera had been snapped, and standing on a steep declivity
which would have been quite a level had he held the camera straight.Nevertheless it was Sidney, her hair blowing about her, eyes looking
out, tender lips smiling.When she was not at home, it sat on K.'s
dresser, propped against his collar-box.When she was in the house, it
lay under the pin-cushion.Two o'clock in the morning, then, and K. in his dressing-gown, with the
picture propped, not against the collar-box, but against his lamp, where
he could see it.He sat forward in his chair, his hands folded around his knee, and
looked at it.He was trying to picture the Sidney of the photograph
in his old life--trying to find a place for her.There had been few women in his old life.There had been women who had cared for him, but he put them
impatiently out of his mind.Almost
before he had heaved his long legs out of the chair, she was tapping at
his door outside.Rosenfeld was standing in the lower hall,
a shawl about her shoulders."I've had word to go to the hospital," she said."I thought maybe you'd
go with me.It seems as if I can't stand it alone."Are you afraid to stay in the house alone?"He ran up the staircase to his room and flung on some clothing.Rosenfeld's sobs had become low moans; Christine stood
helplessly over her."I am terribly sorry," she said--"terribly sorry!When I think whose
fault all this is!"Rosenfeld put out a work-hardened hand and caught Christine's
fingers.I guess you and I
understand each other.K. never forgot the scene in the small emergency ward to which Johnny
had been taken.Under the white lights his boyish figure looked
strangely long.There was a group around the bed--Max Wilson, two or
three internes, the night nurse on duty, and the Head.Sitting just inside the door on a straight chair was Sidney--such a
Sidney as he never had seen before, her face colorless, her eyes wide
and unseeing, her hands clenched in her lap.When he stood beside her,
she did not move or look up.The group around the bed had parted to
admit Mrs.Only Sidney and K. remained by
the door, isolated, alone."You must not take it like that, dear.But, after
all, in that condition--"

It was her first knowledge that he was there.Her voice was dreary, inflectionless."They say I gave him the wrong medicine; that he's dying; that I
murdered him."I came on duty at six o'clock and gave the
medicines.When the night nurse came on at seven, everything was all
right.The medicine-tray was just as it should be.I
went to say good-night to him and he--he was asleep.I didn't give him
anything but what was on the tray," she finished piteously."I looked at
the label; I always look."By a shifting of the group around the bed, K.'s eyes looked for a moment
directly into Carlotta's.Just for a moment; then the crowd closed up
again.It was well for Carlotta that it did.She looked as if she had
seen a ghost--closed her eyes, even reeled."Get some one to
take her place."After all, the presence of this man in this room
at such a time meant nothing.He was Sidney's friend, that was all.It was the boy's weakened condition that was turning her
revenge into tragedy."I am all right," she pleaded across the bed to the Head.He had done everything he knew without
result.The boy, rousing for an instant, would lapse again into stupor.With a healthy man they could have tried more vigorous measures--could
have forced him to his feet and walked him about, could have beaten him
with knotted towels dipped in ice-water.But the wrecked body on the bed
could stand no such heroic treatment.It was Le Moyne, after all, who saved Johnny Rosenfeld's life.For, when
staff and nurses had exhausted all their resources, he stepped forward
with a quiet word that brought the internes to their feet astonished.There was a new treatment for such cases--it had been tried abroad."Try it, for Heaven's sake," he said.The apparatus was not in the house--must be extemporized, indeed, at
last, of odds and ends from the operating-room.K. did the work, his
long fingers deft and skillful--while Mrs.Rosenfeld knelt by the bed
with her face buried; while Sidney sat, dazed and bewildered, on her
little chair inside the door; while night nurses tiptoed along the
corridor, and the night watchman stared incredulous from outside the
door.When the two great rectangles that were the emergency ward windows
had turned from mirrors reflecting the room to gray rectangles in the
morning light; Johnny Rosenfeld opened his eyes and spoke the first
words that marked his return from the dark valley.When it was clear that the boy would live, K. rose stiffly from the
bedside and went over to Sidney's chair."He's all right now," he said--"as all right as he can be, poor lad!"How strange that you should know such a thing.The internes, talking among themselves, had wandered down to their
dining-room for early coffee.Wilson was giving a few last instructions
as to the boy's care.'s hand and
held it to her lips.The iron repression of the night, of months indeed,
fell away before her simple caress."My dear, my dear," he said huskily."Anything that I can do--for
you--at any time--"

It was after Sidney had crept like a broken thing to her room that
Carlotta Harrison and K. came face to face.Johnny was quite conscious
by that time, a little blue around the lips, but valiantly cheerful."More things can happen to a fellow than I ever knew there was!"he
said to his mother, and submitted rather sheepishly to her tears and
caresses."You were always a good boy, Johnny," she said."Just you get well
enough to come home.I'll take care of you the rest of my life.We will
get you a wheel-chair when you can be about, and I can take you out in
the park when I come from work.""I'll be passenger and you'll be chauffeur, ma."Le Moyne is going to get your father sent up again.With sixty-five
cents a day and what I make, we'll get along.""Oh, Johnny, if I could see you coming in the door again and yelling
'mother' and'supper' in one breath!"The meeting between Carlotta and Le Moyne was very quiet.She had been
making a sort of subconscious impression on the retina of his mind
during all the night.It would be difficult to tell when he actually
knew her.When the preparations for moving Johnny back to the big ward had been
made, the other nurses left the room, and Carlotta and the boy were
together.K. stopped her on her way to the door.Edwardes here; my name is Le Moyne.""I have not seen you since you left St."No; I--I rested for a few months.""I suppose they do not know that you were--that you have had any
previous hospital experience.""I shall not tell them, of course."And thus, by simple mutual consent, it was arranged that each should
respect the other's confidence.There had been a time, just before dawn,
when she had had one of those swift revelations that sometimes come at
the end of a long night.The boy was
very low, hardly breathing.Her past stretched behind her, a series of
small revenges and passionate outbursts, swift yieldings, slow remorse.She would have given every hope she had in the
world, just then, for Sidney's stainless past.She hated herself with that deadliest loathing that comes of complete
self-revelation.And she carried to her room the knowledge that the night's struggle had
been in vain--that, although Johnny Rosenfeld would live, she had gained
nothing by what he had suffered.The whole night had shown her the
hopelessness of any stratagem to win Wilson from his new allegiance.She
had surprised him in the hallway, watching Sidney's slender figure
as she made her way up the stairs to her room.Never, in all his past
overtures to her, had she seen that look in his eyes.CHAPTER XIX


To Harriet Kennedy, Sidney's sentence of thirty days' suspension came
as a blow.K. broke the news to her that evening before the time for
Sidney's arrival.The little household was sharing in Harriet's prosperity.Katie had
a helper now, a little Austrian girl named Mimi.And Harriet had
established on the Street the innovation of after-dinner coffee.It was
over the after-dinner coffee that K. made his announcement."What do you mean by saying she is coming home for thirty days?"Not ill, although she is not quite well.The fact is, Harriet,"--for
it was "Harriet" and "K."by this time,--"there has been a sort of
semi-accident up at the hospital.It hasn't resulted seriously, but--"

Harriet put down the apostle-spoon in her hand and stared across at him."There was a mistake about the medicine, and she was blamed; that's
all.""She'd better come home and stay home," said Harriet shortly."I hope it
doesn't get in the papers.This dressmaking business is a funny sort of
thing.One word against you or any of your family, and the crowd's off
somewhere else.""There's nothing against Sidney," K. reminded her.It seems it's a
mere matter of discipline.Somebody made a mistake, and they cannot let
such a thing go by.But he believes, as I do, that it was not Sidney."However Harriet had hardened herself against the girl's arrival, all she
had meant to say fled when she saw Sidney's circled eyes and pathetic
mouth.And took her corseted
bosom.For the time at least, Sidney's world had gone to pieces about her.All
her brave vaunt of service faded before her disgrace.When Christine would have seen her, she kept her door locked and asked
for just that one evening alone.But after Harriet had retired, and
Mimi, the Austrian, had crept out to the corner to mail a letter back to
Gratz, Sidney unbolted her door and listened in the little upper hall.Harriet, her head in a towel, her face carefully cold-creamed, had gone
to bed; but K.'s light, as usual, was shining over the transom.Sidney
tiptoed to the door."May I come in and talk to you?"He turned and took a quick survey of the room.The picture was against
the collar-box.But he took the risk and held the door wide.Sidney came in and sat down by the fire.By being adroit he managed to
slip the little picture over and under the box before she saw it.It is
doubtful if she would have realized its significance, had she seen it."I've been thinking things over," she said."It seems to me I'd better
not go back.""That would be foolish, wouldn't it, when you have done so well?And,
besides, since you are not guilty, Sidney--"

"I didn't do it!"I can't keep on; that's all there is to it.All
last night, in the emergency ward, I felt it going.I
kept saying to myself: 'You didn't do it, you didn't do it'; and all the
time something inside of me was saying, 'Not now, perhaps; but sometime
you may.'"Poor K., who had reasoned all this out for himself and had come to the
same impasse!"To go on like this, feeling that one has life and death in one's hand,
and then perhaps some day to make a mistake like that!"She looked up at
him forlornly."I am just not brave enough, K.""Wouldn't it be braver to keep on?Her world was in pieces about her, and she felt alone in a wide and
empty place.And, because her nerves were drawn taut until they were
ready to snap, Sidney turned on him shrewishly."I think you are all afraid I will come back to stay.Nobody really
wants me anywhere--in all the world!Not at the hospital, not here, not
anyplace."When you say that nobody wants you," said K., not very steadily, "I--I
think you are making a mistake."The only person
who ever really wanted me was my mother, and I went away and left her!"She scanned his face closely, and, reading there something she did not
understand, she  suddenly."No; I do not mean Joe Drummond."If he had found any encouragement in her face, he would have gone on
recklessly; but her blank eyes warned him."If you mean Max Wilson," said Sidney, "you are entirely wrong.He's not
in love with me--not, that is, any more than he is in love with a
dozen girls.He likes to be with me--oh, I know that; but that doesn't
mean--anything else.Anyhow, after this disgrace--"

"There is no disgrace, child.""He'll think me careless, at the least."You say he likes to be with you.Sidney had been sitting in a low chair by the fire.She rose with a
sudden passionate movement.In the informality of the household, she,
had visited K. in her dressing-gown and slippers; and now she stood
before him, a tragic young figure, clutching the folds of her gown
across her breast."I worship him, K.," she said tragically."When I see him coming, I want
to get down and let him walk on me.I
know the very way he rings for the elevator.When I see him in the
operating-room, cool and calm while every one else is flustered and
excited, he--he looks like a god."Then, half ashamed of her outburst, she turned her back to him and stood
gazing at the small coal fire.It was as well for K. that she did not
see his face.For that one moment the despair that was in him shone in
his eyes.He glanced around the shabby little room, at the sagging bed,
the collar-box, the pincushion, the old marble-topped bureau under which
Reginald had formerly made his nest, at his untidy table, littered with
pipes and books, at the image in the mirror of his own tall figure,
stooped and weary."You're sure it's not
just--glamour, Sidney?"Her voice was muffled, and he knew then that
she was crying.Tears, of course, except in the privacy
of one's closet, were not ethical on the Street."Give me a handkerchief," said Sidney in a muffled tone, and the little
scene was broken into while K. searched through a bureau drawer.Then:

"It's all over, anyhow, since this.If he'd really cared he'd have come
over to-night.Back in a circle she came inevitably to her suspension.She would never
go back, she said passionately.She was innocent, had been falsely
accused.If they could think such a thing about her, she didn't want to
be in their old hospital.K. questioned her, alternately soothing and probing.I have given him his medicines dozens of times.""Who else had access to the medicine closet?""Carlotta Harrison carried the keys, of course.I was off duty from four
to six.When Carlotta left the ward, the probationer would have them.""Have you reason to think that either one of these girls would wish you
harm?""None whatever," began Sidney vehemently; and then, checking
herself,--"unless--but that's rather ridiculous.""I've sometimes thought that Carlotta--but I am sure she is perfectly
fair with me.Even if she--if she--"

"Yes?"Wilson, I don't believe--Why, K., she wouldn't!"Murder, of course," said K., "in intention, anyhow.I'm only trying to find out whose mistake it was."Soon after that she said good-night and went out.She turned in the
doorway and smiled tremulously back at him."You have done me a lot of good.With a quick movement that was one of her charms, Sidney suddenly closed
the door and slipped back into the room.K., hearing the door close,
thought she had gone, and dropped heavily into a chair.said Sidney suddenly from behind him,
and, bending over, she kissed him on the cheek.The next instant the door had closed behind her, and K. was left alone
to such wretchedness and bliss as the evening had brought him.On toward morning, Harriet, who slept but restlessly in her towel,
wakened to the glare of his light over the transom."I wish you wouldn't go to
sleep and let your light burn!"K., surmising the towel and cold cream, had the tact not to open his
door."I am not asleep, Harriet, and I am sorry about the light.Before he extinguished the light, he walked over to the old dresser and
surveyed himself in the glass.Two nights without sleep and much anxiety
had told on him.He looked old, haggard; infinitely tired.Mentally he
compared himself with Wilson, flushed with success, erect, triumphant,
almost insolent.Nothing had more certainly told him the hopelessness
of his love for Sidney than her good-night kiss.He drew a long breath and proceeded
to undress in the dark.Joe Drummond came to see Sidney the next day.She would have avoided
him if she could, but Mimi had ushered him up to the sewing-room boudoir
before she had time to escape.She had not seen the boy for two months,
and the change in him startled her.He was thinner, rather hectic,
scrupulously well dressed.Daniel went to the hallway.she said, and then: "Won't you sit down?"He dramatized himself, as he had that
night the June before when he had asked Sidney to marry him.He offered no conventional greeting whatever;
but, after surveying her briefly, her black gown, the lines around her
eyes:--

"You're not going back to that place, of course?""Then somebody's got to decide for you.The thing for you to do is to
stay right here, Sidney.Nobody here
would ever accuse you of trying to murder anybody."In spite of herself, Sidney smiled a little.It was a mistake about the
medicines.His love was purely selfish, for he brushed aside her protest as if she
had not spoken."You give me the word and I'll go and get your things; I've got a car of
my own now.""But, Joe, they have only done what they thought was right.Whoever made
it, there was a mistake.""You don't mean that you are going to stand for this sort of thing?Every time some fool makes a mistake, are they going to blame it on
you?"I can't talk to you
if you explode like a rocket all the time."Her matter-of-fact tone had its effect.He advanced into the room, but
he still scorned a chair."I guess you've been wondering why you haven't heard from me," he said."I've seen you more than you've seen me."The idea of espionage is always repugnant, and
to have a rejected lover always in the offing, as it were, was
disconcerting."I wish you would be just a little bit sensible, Joe.It's so silly of
you, really.It's not because you care for me; it's really because you
care for yourself.""You can't look at me and say that, Sid."He ran his finger around his collar--an old gesture; but the collar was
very loose."I'm just eating my heart out for you, and that's the truth.Everywhere I go, people say, 'There's the fellow Sidney
Page turned down when she went to the hospital.'I've got so I keep off
the Street as much as I can."Sidney was half alarmed, half irritated.This wild, excited boy was not
the doggedly faithful youth she had always known.It seemed to her
that he was hardly sane--that underneath his quiet manner and carefully
repressed voice there lurked something irrational, something she could
not cope with."But what do you want me to do?If you'd
only sit down--"

"I want you to come home.I just want
you to come back, so that things will be the way they used to be.Now
that they have turned you out--"

"They've done nothing of the sort."Because you love the hospital, or because you love somebody connected
with the hospital?"Sidney was thoroughly angry by this time, angry and reckless.She had
come through so much that every nerve was crying in passionate protest."If it will make you understand things any better," she cried, "I am
going back for both reasons!"But her words seemed, surprisingly
enough, to steady him.Mary journeyed to the bedroom."Then, as far as I am concerned, it's all over, is it?"Suddenly:--

"You think Christine has her hands full with Palmer, don't you?Well,
if you take Max Wilson, you're going to have more trouble than Christine
ever dreamed of.I can tell you some things about him now that will make
you think twice.""Every word that you say shows me how right I am in not marrying you,
Joe," she said."Real men do not say those things about each other under
any circumstances.I don't want you to
come back until you have grown up."He was very white, but he picked up his hat and went to the door."I guess I AM crazy," he said."I've been wanting to go away, but mother
raises such a fuss--I'll not annoy you any more."He reached in his pocket and, pulling out a small box, held it toward
her."Reginald," he said solemnly.Some boys caught
him in the park, and I brought him home."He left her standing there speechless with surprise, with the box in her
hand, and ran down the stairs and out into the Street.At the foot of
the steps he almost collided with Dr.I'm glad
you've made it up."CHAPTER XX


Winter relaxed its clutch slowly that year.March was bitterly cold;
even April found the roads still frozen and the hedgerows clustered with
ice.But at mid-day there was spring in the air.In the courtyard of the
hospital, convalescents sat on the benches and watched for robins.The
fountain, which had frozen out, was being repaired.Here and there on
ward window-sills tulips opened their gaudy petals to the sun.Harriet had gone abroad for a flying trip in March and came back laden
with new ideas, model gowns, and fresh enthusiasm.She carried out and
planted flowers on her sister's grave, and went back to her work with a
feeling of duty done.A combination of crocuses and snow on the ground
had given her an inspiration for a gown.She drew it in pencil on an
envelope on her way back in the street car.Grace Irving, having made good during the white sales, had been sent to
the spring cottons.The day she
sold Sidney material for a simple white gown, she was very happy.Once
a customer brought her a bunch of primroses.All day she kept them under
the counter in a glass of water, and at evening she took them to Johnny
Rosenfeld, still lying prone in the hospital.On Sidney, on K., and on Christine the winter had left its mark heavily.Christine, readjusting her life to new conditions, was graver, more
thoughtful.'s guidance, she
had given up the "Duchess" and was reading real books.She was thinking
real thoughts, too, for the first time in her life.Sidney, as tender as ever, had lost a little of the radiance from her
eyes; her voice had deepened.Where she had been a pretty girl, she
was now lovely.She was back in the hospital again, this time in the
children's ward.K., going in one day to take Johnny Rosenfeld a basket
of fruit, saw her there with a child in her arms, and a light in her
eyes that he had never seen before.It hurt him, rather--things being as
they were with him.With the opening of spring the little house at Hillfoot took on fresh
activities.Tillie was house-cleaning with great thoroughness.She
scrubbed carpets, took down the clean curtains, and put them up again
freshly starched.It was as if she found in sheer activity and fatigue a
remedy for her uneasiness.The impeccable character of the little
house had been against it.Schwitter had a little bar and
served the best liquors he could buy; but he discouraged rowdiness--had
been known to refuse to sell to boys under twenty-one and to men who had
already overindulged.The word went about that Schwitter's was no place
for a good time.Even Tillie's chicken and waffles failed against this
handicap.By the middle of April the house-cleaning was done.One or two motor
parties had come out, dined sedately and wined moderately, and had gone
back to the city again.The
roads dried up, robins filled the trees with their noisy spring songs,
and still business continued dull.By the first day of May, Tillie's uneasiness had become certainty.Schwitter, coming in from the early milking, found her
sitting in the kitchen, her face buried in her apron.He put down the
milk-pails and, going over to her, put a hand on her head."I guess there's no mistake, then?""There's no mistake," said poor Tillie into her apron.He bent down and kissed the back of her neck.Then, when she failed to
brighten, he tiptoed around the kitchen, poured the milk into pans,
and rinsed the buckets, working methodically in his heavy way.The
tea-kettle had boiled dry.Then:--

"Do you want to see a doctor?""I'd better see somebody," she said, without looking up."And--don't
think I'm blaming you.As far as
that goes, I've wanted a child right along.It isn't the trouble I am
thinking of either."He made some tea
clumsily and browned her a piece of toast.When he had put them on one
end of the kitchen table, he went over to her again."I guess I'd ought to have thought of this before, but all I thought of
was trying to get a little happiness out of life.And,"--he stroked
her arm,--"as far as I am concerned, it's been worth while, Tillie.No
matter what I've had to do, I've always looked forward to coming back
here to you in the evening.Maybe I don't say it enough, but I guess you
know I feel it all right."Without looking up, she placed her hand over his."I guess we started wrong," he went on."You can't build happiness on
what isn't right.You and I can manage well enough; but now that there's
going to be another, it looks different, somehow."After that morning Tillie took up her burden stoically.The hope of
motherhood alternated with black fits of depression.She sang at her
work, to burst out into sudden tears.Schwitter had given up his nursery
business; but the motorists who came to Hillfoot did not come back.When, at last, he took the horse and buggy and drove about the country
for orders, he was too late.Other nurserymen had been before him;
shrubberies and orchards were already being set out.The second payment
on his mortgage would be due in July.By the middle of May they were
frankly up against it.Schwitter at last dared to put the situation into
words."We're not making good, Til," he said.We are too decent; that's what's the matter with us."With all her sophistication, Tillie was vastly ignorant of life."We'll have to keep a sort of hotel," he said lamely."Sell to everybody
that comes along, and--if parties want to stay over-night--"

Tillie's white face turned crimson."If it's bad weather, and they're married--"

"How are we to know if they are married or not?"But the
situation was not less acute.There were two or three unfurnished rooms
on the second floor.He began to make tentative suggestions as to their
furnishing.Once he got a catalogue from an installment house, and tried
to hide it from her.She burned it in the kitchen
stove.Schwitter himself was ashamed; but the idea obsessed him.Other people
fattened on the frailties of human nature.Two miles away, on the other
road, was a public house that had netted the owner ten thousand dollars
profit the year before.He was not as young as he had been; there was the expense of keeping
his wife--he had never allowed her to go into the charity ward at the
asylum.Now that there was going to be a child, there would be three
people dependent upon him.One night, after Tillie was asleep, he slipped noiselessly into his
clothes and out to the barn, where he hitched up the horse with nervous
fingers.Tillie never learned of that midnight excursion to the "Climbing Rose,"
two miles away.Lights blazed in every window; a dozen automobiles were
parked before the barn.From the bar came
the jingle of glasses and loud, cheerful conversation.When Schwitter turned the horse's head back toward Hillfoot, his
mind was made up.He would furnish the upper rooms; he would bring a
barkeeper from town--these people wanted mixed drinks; he could get a
second-hand piano somewhere.Tillie's rebellion was instant and complete.When she found him
determined, she made the compromise that her condition necessitated.She
could not leave him, but she would not stay in the rehabilitated little
house.When, a week after Schwitter's visit to the "Climbing Rose," an
installment van arrived from town with the new furniture, Tillie
moved out to what had been the harness-room of the old barn and there
established herself."I am not leaving you," she told him."I don't even know that I am
blaming you.But I am not going to have anything to do with it, and
that's flat."So it happened that K., making a spring pilgrimage to see Tillie,
stopped astounded in the road.The weather was warm, and he carried
his Norfolk coat over his arm.The little house was bustling; a dozen
automobiles were parked in the barnyard.The bar was crowded, and a
barkeeper in a white coat was mixing drinks with the casual indifference
of his kind.There were tables under the trees on the lawn, and a new
sign on the gate.Even Schwitter bore a new look of prosperity.Over his schooner of beer
K. gathered something of the story."I'm not proud of it, Mr.I've come to do a good many things
the last year or so that I never thought I would do.First I took Tillie away from her good position, and after
that nothing went right.Then there were things coming on"--he looked at
K. anxiously--"that meant more expense.I would be glad if you wouldn't
say anything about it at Mrs."I'll not speak of it, of course."It was then, when K. asked for Tillie, that Mr.Schwitter's unhappiness
became more apparent."She wouldn't stand for it," he said."She moved out the day I furnished
the rooms upstairs and got the piano."I--I'll take you
out there, if you would like to see her."K. shrewdly surmised that Tillie would prefer to see him alone, under
the circumstances."I guess I can find her," he said, and rose from the little table."If you--if you can say anything to help me out, sir, I'd appreciate it.Of course, she understands how I am driven.But--especially if you would
tell her that the Street doesn't know--"

"I'll do all I can," K. promised, and followed the path to the barn.Tillie received him with a certain dignity.The little harness-room
was very comfortable.A white iron bed in a corner, a flat table with
a mirror above it, a rocking-chair, and a sewing-machine furnished the
room."I wouldn't stand for it," she said simply; "so here I am.There being but one chair, she sat on the bed.The room was littered
with small garments in the making.She made no attempt to conceal them;
rather, she pointed to them with pride.He's got a
hired girl at the house.It was hard enough to sew at first, with me
making two right sleeves almost every time."Then, seeing his kindly eye
on her: "Well, it's happened, Mr."You're going to be a very good mother, Tillie."K., who also needed cheering
that spring day, found his consolation in seeing her brighten under the
small gossip of the Street.The deaf-and-dumb book agent had taken on
life insurance as a side issue, and was doing well; the grocery store at
the corner was going to be torn down, and over the new store there
were to be apartments; Reginald had been miraculously returned, and was
building a new nest under his bureau; Harriet Kennedy had been to Paris,
and had brought home six French words and a new figure.Outside the open door the big barn loomed cool and shadowy, full of
empty spaces where later the hay would be stored; anxious mother hens
led their broods about; underneath in the horse stable the restless
horses pawed in their stalls.From where he sat, Le Moyne could see only
the round breasts of the two hills, the fresh green of the orchard the
cows in a meadow beyond."I've had more time to think since I
moved out than I ever had in my life before.When the
noise is worst down at the house, I look at the hills there and--"

There were great thoughts in her mind--that the hills meant God, and
that in His good time perhaps it would all come right."The hills help a lot," she repeated.Tillie's work-basket lay near him.He picked up one of the
little garments.In his big hands it looked small, absurd."I--I want to tell you something, Tillie.Don't count on it too much;
but Mrs.Schwitter has been failing rapidly for the last month or two."I wanted to see things work out right for you."All the color had faded from Tillie's face."You're very good to me, Mr."I don't wish the poor
soul any harm, but--oh, my God!if she's going, let it be before the
next four months are over."K. had fallen into the habit, after his long walks, of dropping into
Christine's little parlor for a chat before he went upstairs.Those
early spring days found Harriet Kennedy busy late in the evenings, and,
save for Christine and K., the house was practically deserted.The breach between Palmer and Christine was steadily widening.She was
too proud to ask him to spend more of his evenings with her.On those
occasions when he voluntarily stayed at home with her, he was so
discontented that he drove her almost to distraction.Although she was
convinced that he was seeing nothing of the girl who had been with
him the night of the accident, she did not trust him.Not that girl,
perhaps, but there were others.Into Christine's little parlor, then, K. turned, the evening after he
had seen Tillie.She was reading by the lamp, and the door into the hall
stood open."Come in," she said, as he hesitated in the doorway."There's a brush in the drawer of the hat-rack--although I don't really
mind how you look."The little room always cheered K. Its warmth and light appealed to his
aesthetic sense; after the bareness of his bedroom, it spelled luxury.And perhaps, to be entirely frank, there was more than physical comfort
and satisfaction in the evenings he spent in Christine's firelit parlor.He was entirely masculine, and her evident pleasure in his society
gratified him.He had fallen into a way of thinking of himself as a sort
of older brother to all the world because he was a sort of older brother
to Sidney.The evenings with her did something to reinstate him in his
own self-esteem.It was subtle, psychological, but also it was very
human."Here's a chair, and here are
cigarettes
