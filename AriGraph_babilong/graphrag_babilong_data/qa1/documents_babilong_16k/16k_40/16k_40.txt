We
are an association whose object it is to aid, in the only way in which
woman, alas!Our sympathies are with
them in the cause for which they have periled all--our hearts are with
them in the prayer, that ere long their beloved commander may be
restored to them, and that once more as of old he may lead them to
victory in the sacred name of the Union and Constitution."With united prayers that the Father of all may have you and yours ever
in His holy keeping, we remain your devoted partisans."The following in reply was addressed to the lady whose name was first
signed to the above:

                                               "New York, Feb.Madam--I take great pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of the very
kind letter of the 13th inst., from yourself and your friends.Will you
do me the favor to say to them how much I thank them for it, and that I
am at a loss to express my gratitude for the pleasant and cheering terms
in which it is couched.Such sentiments on the part of those whose
brothers have served with me in the field are more grateful to me than
anything else can be.I feel far more than rewarded by them for all I
have tried to accomplish.--I am, Madam, with the most sincere respect
and friendship, yours very truly,

                                                    Geo._May._--A number of the teachers and pupils of the Academy have enlisted
for the war.Among them E. C. Clarke, H. C. Kirk, A. T. Wilder, Norman
K. Martin, T. C. Parkhurst, Mr.They have a tent on the square
and are enlisting men in Canandaigua and vicinity for the 4th N. Y.
Heavy Artillery.Noah T. Clarke's mother in
Naples.She had already sent three sons, Bela, William and Joseph, to
the war and she is very sad because her youngest has now enlisted.She
says she feels as did Jacob of old when he said, "I am bereaved of my
children.Joseph is not and Simeon is not and now you will take Benjamin
away."I have heard that she is a beautiful singer but she says she
cannot sing any more until this cruel war is over.I wish that I could
write something to comfort her but I feel as Mrs.Browning puts it: "If
you want a song for your Italy free, let none look at me."Our society met at Fannie Pierce's this afternoon.Her mother is an
invalid and never gets out at all, but she is very much interested in
the soldiers and in all young people, and loves to have us come in and
see her and we love to go.She enters into the plans of all of us young
girls and has a personal interest in us.We had a very good time
to-night and Laura Chapin was more full of fun than usual.Once there
was silence for a minute or two and some one said, "awful pause."Laura
said, "I guess you would have awful paws if you worked as hard as I do."We were talking about how many of us girls would be entitled to flag bed
quilts, and according to the rules, they said that, up to date, Abbie
Clark and I were the only ones.The explanation is that Captain George
N. Williams and Lieutenant E. C. Clarke are enlisted in their country's
service.Susie Daggett is Secretary and Treasurer of the Society and she
reported that in one year's time we made in our society 133 pairs of
drawers, 101 shirts, 4 pairs socks for soldiers, and 54 garments for the
families of soldiers.Abbie Clark and I had our ambrotypes taken to-day for two young braves
who are going to the war.William H. Adams is also commissioned Captain
and is going to the front._July_ 4.--The terrible battle of Gettysburg brings to Canandaigua sad
news of our soldier boys of the 126th Regiment.Colonel Sherrill was
instantly killed, also Captains Wheeler and Herendeen, Henry Willson and
Henry P. Cook.[Illustration: "Abbie Clark and I had our ambrotypes taken to-day",

_July_ 26.--Charlie Wheeler was buried with military honors from the
Congregational church to-day.Two companies of the 54th New York State
National Guard attended the funeral, and the church was packed,
galleries and all.It was the saddest funeral and the only one of a
soldier that I ever attended.He was killed
at Gettysburg, July 3, by a sharpshooter's bullet.He was a very bright
young man, graduate of Yale college and was practising law.He was
captain of Company K, 126th N. Y. Volunteers.Morse's lecture, "You and I": "And who has forgotten that
gifted youth, who fell on the memorable field of Gettysburg?To win a
noble name, to save a beloved country, he took his place beneath the
dear old flag, and while cannon thundered and sabers clashed and the
stars of the old Union shone above his head he went down in the shock of
battle and left us desolate, a name to love and a glory to endure.And
as we solemnly know, as by the old charter of liberty we most sacredly
swear, he was truly and faithfully and religiously

    Of all our friends the noblest,
    The choicest and the purest,
    The nearest and the dearest,
      In the field at Gettysburg.Of all the heroes bravest,
    Of soul the brightest, whitest,
    Of all the warriors greatest,
      Shot dead at Gettysburg.And where the fight was thickest,
    And where the smoke was blackest,
    And where the fire was hottest,
      On the fields of Gettysburg,
    There flashed his steel the brightest,
    There blazed his eyes the fiercest,
    There flowed his blood the reddest
      On the field of Gettysburg.O music of the waters
      That flow at Gettysburg,
    Mourn tenderly the hero,
    The rare and glorious hero,
    The loved and peerless hero,
      Who died at Gettysburg.Sandra moved to the kitchen.His turf shall be the greenest,
    His roses bloom the sweetest,
    His willow droop the saddest
      Of all at Gettysburg.His memory live the freshest,
    His fame be cherished longest,
    Of all the holy warriors,
      Who fell at Gettysburg.These were patriots, these were our jewels.And of every soldier who has fallen in this war his friends may
write just as lovingly as you and I may do of those to whom I pay my
feeble tribute."_August,_ 1863.--The U. S. Sanitary Commission has been organized.W. Fitch Cheney to Gettysburg with supplies for the
sick and wounded and he took seven assistants with him.Home bounty was
brought to the tents and put into the hands of the wounded soldiers._August_ 12.--Lucilla Field was married in our church to-day to Rev.I always thought she was cut out for a minister's wife.John travelled to the kitchen.Jennie
Draper cried herself sick because Lucilla, her Sunday School teacher, is
going away._October_ 8.--News came to-day of the death of Lieutenant Hiram Brown.He died of fever at Portsmouth, only little more than a year after he
went away._November_ 1.--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery is stationed at Fort
Hamilton, N. Y. harbor.Uncle Edward has invited me down to New York to
spend a month!Grandfather says that I can go and Miss
Rosewarne is beginning a new dress for me to-day._November_ 6.--We were saddened to-day by news of the death of Augustus
Torrey Wilder in the hospital at Fort Ethan Allen.Grandfather and I
came from Canandaigua yesterday.We were
met by a military escort of "one" at Albany and consequently came
through more safely, I suppose.James met us at 42d Street Grand Central
Station.He lives at Uncle Edward's; attends to all of his legal
business and is his confidential clerk.They
are very stylish and grand but I don't mind that.Aunt Emily is reserved
and dignified but very kind.People do not pour their tea or coffee into
their saucers any more to cool it, but drink it from the cup, and you
must mind and not leave your teaspoon in your cup.Morris K. Jesup lives right across the
street and I see him every day, as he is a friend of Uncle Edward.Grandfather has gone back home and left me in charge of friends "a la
militaire" and others._November_ 15.--"We" went out to Fort Hamilton to-day and are going to
Blackwell's Island to-morrow and to many other places of interest down
the Bay.Soldiers are everywhere and I feel quite important, walking
around in company with blue coat and brass buttons--very becoming style
of dress for men and the military salute at every turn is what one reads
about._Sunday_.--Went to Broadway Tabernacle to church to-day and heard Rev.Abbie Clark is visiting her sister, Mrs.Fred
Thompson, and sat a few seats ahead of us in church.We also saw Henrietta Francis Talcott, who was a "Seminary
girl."She wants me to come to see her in her New York home._November_ 19.--We wish we were at Gettysburg to-day to hear President
Lincoln's and Edward Everett's addresses at the dedication of the
National Cemetery.We will read them in to-morrow's papers, but it will
not be like hearing them._Author's Note,_ 1911.--Forty-eight years have elapsed since Lincoln's
speech was delivered at the dedication of the Soldiers' Cemetery at
Gettysburg.So eloquent and remarkable was his utterance that I believe
I am correct in stating that every word spoken has now been translated
into all known languages and is regarded as one of the World Classics.The same may be said of Lincoln's letter to the mother of five sons lost
in battle.I make no apology for inserting in this place both the speech
and the letter.Whitelaw Reid, the American Ambassador to Great
Britain, in an address on Lincoln delivered at the University of
Birmingham in December, 1910, remarked in reference to this letter,
"What classic author in our common English tongue has surpassed that?"and next may I ask, "What English or American orator has on a similar
occasion surpassed this address on the battlefield of Gettysburg?""Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this
continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a
great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated, can long endure.We are met on a great battlefield of
that war.We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final
resting place for those who gave their lives that that nation might
live.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But in
a larger sense we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot
hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here
have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.The
world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here--but it can
never forget what they did here.It is for us, the living, rather, to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have
thus far so nobly advanced.It is rather for us to be here dedicated to
the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full
measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve, that these dead shall
not have died in vain--that this nation under God shall have a new birth
of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people and for the
people, shall not perish from the earth."It was during the dark days of the war that he wrote this simple letter
of sympathy to a bereaved mother:--

"I have been shown, in the files of the War Department, a statement that
you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of
battle.I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which
should attempt to beguile you from your grief for a loss so overwhelming,
but I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation which may be
found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.I pray that our
Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave
you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn
pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the
altar of Freedom."_November_ 21.--Abbie Clark and her cousin Cora came to call and invited
me and her soldier cousin to come to dinner to-night, at Mrs.He will be here this afternoon and I will give him the
invitation._November_ 22.--We had a delightful visit.Thompson took us up into
his den and showed us curios from all over the world and as many
pictures as we would find in an art gallery._Friday_.--Last evening Uncle Edward took a party of us, including Abbie
Clark, to Wallack's Theater to see "Rosedale," which is having a great
run.I enjoyed it and told James it was the best play I ever "heard."He
said I must not say that I "heard" a play.I told James that I heard of a young girl who went abroad and on her
return some one asked her if she saw King Lear and she said, no, he was
sick all the time she was there!I just loved the play last night and
laughed and cried in turn, it seemed so real.I don't know what
Grandmother will say, but I wrote her about it and said, "When you are
with the Romans, you must do as the Romans do."I presume she will say
"that is not the way you were brought up."_December_ 7.--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery has orders to move to
Fort Ethan Allen, near Washington, and I have orders to return to
Canandaigua.I have enjoyed the five weeks very much and as "the
soldier" was on parole most of the time I have seen much of interest in
the city.Uncle Edward says that he has lived here forty years but has
never visited some of the places that we have seen, so he told me when I
mentioned climbing to the top of Trinity steeple.Canandaigua, _December_ 8.--Home again.I had military attendance as far
as Paterson, N. J., and came the rest of the way with strangers.Not
caring to talk I liked it just as well.When I said good bye I could not
help wondering whether it was for years, or forever.This cruel war is
terrible and precious lives are being sacrificed and hearts broken every
day._Christmas Eve,_ 1863.--Sarah Gibson Howell was married to Major Foster
this evening.It was a
beautiful wedding and we all enjoyed it.Some time ago I asked her to
write in my album and she sewed a lock of her black curling hair on the
page and in the center of it wrote, "Forget not Gippie."_December_ 31.--Our brother John was married in Boston to-day to Laura
Arnold, a lovely girl.1864

_April_ 1.--Grandfather had decided to go to New York to attend the fair
given by the Sanitary Commission, and he is taking two immense books,
which are more than one hundred years old, to present to the Commission,
for the benefit of the war fund._April_ 18.--Grandfather returned home to-day, unexpectedly to us.I
knew he was sick when I met him at the door.He had traveled all night
alone from New York, although he said that a stranger, a fellow
passenger, from Ann Arbor, Mich., on the train noticed that he was
suffering and was very kind to him.He said he fell in his room at
Gramercy Park Hotel in the night, and his knee was very painful.Cheney and he said the hurt was a serious one and needed
most careful attention.I was invited to a spelling school at Abbie
Clark's in the evening and Grandmother said that she and Anna would take
care of Grandfather till I got back, and then I could sit up by him the
rest of the night.We spelled down and had quite a merry time.Major C.
S. Aldrich had escaped from prison and was there.He came home with me,
as my soldier is down in Virginia._April_ 19.--Grandfather is much worse.Lightfoote has come to
stay with us all the time and we have sent for Aunt Glorianna._April_ 20.--Grandfather dictated a letter to-night to a friend of his
in New York.After I had finished he asked me if I had mended his
gloves.I said no, but I would have them ready when he wanted them.he looks so sick I fear he will never wear his gloves
again._May_ 16.--I have not written in my diary for a month and it has been
the saddest month of my life.He was
buried May 2, just two weeks from the day that he returned from New
York.We did everything for him that could be done, but at the end of
the first week the doctors saw that he was beyond all human aid.Uncle
Thomas told the doctors that they must tell him.He was much surprised
but received the verdict calmly.He said "he had no notes out and
perhaps it was the best time to go."He had taught us how to live and he
seemed determined to show us how a Christian should die.He said he
wanted "Grandmother and the children to come to him and have all the
rest remain outside."When we came into the room he said to Grandmother,
"Do you know what the doctors say?"Sandra journeyed to the office.She bowed her head, and then he
motioned for her to come on one side and Anna and me on the other and
kneel by his bedside.He placed a hand upon us and upon her and said to
her, "All the rest seem very much excited, but you and I must be
composed."Then he asked us to say the 23d Psalm, "The Lord is my
Shepherd," and then all of us said the Lord's Prayer together after
Grandmother had offered a little prayer for grace and strength in this
trying hour.Then he said, "Grandmother, you must take care of the
girls, and, girls, you must take care of Grandmother."We felt as though
our hearts would break and were sure we never could be happy again.During the next few days he often spoke of dying and of what we must do
when he was gone.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.Once when I was sitting by him he looked up and smiled
and said, "You will lose all your roses watching over me."A good many
business men came in to see him to receive his parting blessing.The two
McKechnie brothers, Alexander and James, came in together on their way
home from church the Sunday before he died.He lived until Saturday, the 30th, and in the morning he said, "Open the
door wide."We did so and he said, "Let the King of Glory enter in."Very soon after he said, "I am going home to Paradise," and then sank
into that sleep which on this earth knows no waking.I sat by the window
near his bed and watched the rain beat into the grass and saw the
peonies and crocuses and daffodils beginning to come up out of the
ground and I thought to myself, I shall never see the flowers come up
again without thinking of these sad, sad days.He was buried Monday
afternoon, May 2, from the Congregational church, and Dr.Daggett
preached a sermon from a favorite text of Grandfather's, "I shall die in
my nest."James and John came and as we stood with dear Grandmother and
all the others around his open grave and heard Dr.Daggett say in his
beautiful sympathetic voice, "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to
dust," we felt that we were losing our best friend; but he told us that
we must live for Grandmother and so we will.The next Sabbath, Anna and I were called out of church by a messenger,
who said that Grandmother was taken suddenly ill and was dying.When we
reached the house attendants were all about her administering
restoratives, but told us she was rapidly sinking.I asked if I might
speak to her and was reluctantly permitted, as they thought best not to
disturb her.I sat down by her and with tearful voice said,
"Grandmother, don't you know that Grandfather said we were to care for
you and you were to care for us and if you die we cannot do as
Grandfather said?"She opened her eyes and looked at me and said
quietly, "Dry your eyes, child, I shall not die to-day or to-morrow."Inscribed in my diary:

    "They are passing away, they are passing away,
    Not only the young, but the aged and gray.Their places are vacant, no longer we see
    The armchair in waiting, as it used to be.The hat and the coat are removed from the nail,
    Where for years they have hung, every day without fail.The shoes and the slippers are needed no more,
    Nor kept ready waiting, as they were of yore,
    The desk which he stood at in manhood's fresh prime,
    Which now shows the marks of the finger of time,
    The bright well worn keys, which were childhood's delight
    Unlocking the treasures kept hidden from sight.These now are mementoes of him who has passed,
    Who stands there no longer, as we saw him last.Other hands turn the keys, as he did, before,
    Other eyes will his secrets, if any, explore.The step once elastic, but feeble of late,
    No longer we watch for through doorway or gate,
    Though often we turn, half expecting to see,
    The loved one approaching, but ah!We miss him at all times, at morn when we meet,
    For the social repast, there is one vacant seat.At noon, and at night, at the hour of prayer,
    Our hearts fill with sadness, one voice is not there.Yet not without hope his departure we mourn,
    In faith and in trust, all our sorrows are borne,
    Borne upward to Him who in kindness and love
    Sends earthly afflictions to draw us above.Thus hoping and trusting, rejoicing, we'll go,
    Both upward and onward through weal and through woe
    'Till all of life's changes and conflicts are past
    Beyond the dark river, to meet him at last."In Memoriam

Thomas Beals died in Canandaigua, N. Y., on Saturday, April 30th, 1864,
in the 81st year of his age.Beals was born in Boston, Mass.,
November 13, 1783.He came to this village in October, 1803, only 14 years after the first
settlement of the place.He was married in March, 1805, to Abigail
Field, sister of the first pastor of the Congregational church here.Her
family, in several of its branches, have since been distinguished in the
ministry, the legal profession, and in commercial enterprise.Living to a good old age, and well known as one of our most wealthy and
respected citizens, Mr.Beals is another added to the many examples of
successful men who, by energy and industry, have made their own fortune.On coming to this village, he was teacher in the Academy for a time, and
afterward entered into mercantile business, in which he had his share of
vicissitude.When the Ontario Savings Bank was established, 1832, he
became the Treasurer, and managed it successfully till the institution
ceased, in 1835, with his withdrawal.In the meantime he conducted,
also, a banking business of his own, and this was continued until a week
previous to his death, when he formally withdrew, though for the last
five years devolving its more active duties upon his son.As a banker, his sagacity and fidelity won for him the confidence and
respect of all classes of persons in this community.The business
portion of our village is very much indebted to his enterprise for the
eligible structures he built that have more than made good the losses
sustained by fires.More than fifty years ago he was actively concerned
in the building of the Congregational church, and also superintended the
erection of the county jail and almshouse; for many years a trustee of
Canandaigua Academy, and trustee and treasurer of the Congregational
church.At the time of his death he and his wife, who survives him, were
the oldest members of the church, having united with it in 1807, only
eight years after its organization.Until hindered by the infirmities of
age, he was a constant attendant of its services and ever devoutly
maintained the worship of God in his family.No person has been more
generally known among all classes of our citizens.Whether at home or
abroad he could not fail to be remarked for his gravity and dignity.His
character was original, independent, and his manners remarkable for a
dignified courtesy.Our citizens were familiar with his brief, emphatic
answers with the wave of his hand.He was fond of books, a great reader,
collected a valuable number of volumes, and was happy in the use of
language both in writing and conversation.In many unusual ways he often
showed his kind consideration for the poor and afflicted, and many
persons hearing of his death gratefully recollect instances, not known
to others, of his seasonable kindness to them in trouble.In his
charities he often studied concealment as carefully as others court
display.His marked individuality of character and deportment, together
with his shrewd discernment and active habits, could not fail to leave a
distinct impression on the minds of all.For more than sixty years he transacted business in one place here, and
his long life thus teaches more than one generation the value of
sobriety, diligence, fidelity and usefulness.In his last illness he remarked to a friend that he always loved
Canandaigua; had done several things for its prosperity, and had
intended to do more.He had known his measure of affliction; only four
of eleven children survive him, but children and children's children
ministered to the comfort of his last days.Notwithstanding his years
and infirmities, he was able to visit New York, returning April 18th
quite unwell, but not immediately expecting a fatal termination.As the
final event drew near, he seemed happily prepared to meet it.He
conversed freely with his friends and neighbors in a softened and
benignant spirit, at once receiving and imparting benedictions.His end
seemed to realize his favorite citation from Job: "I shall die in my
nest."His funeral was attended on Monday in the Congregational church by a
large assembly, Dr.Daggett, the pastor, officiating on the
occasion.--Written by Dr.O. E. Daggett in 1864._May._--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery is having hard times in the
Virginia mud and rain.It is such a change from
their snug winter quarters at Fort Ethan Allen.There are 2,800 men in
the Regiment and 1,200 are sick.Charles S. Hoyt of the 126th, which
is camping close by, has come to the help of these new recruits so
kindly as to win every heart, quite in contrast to the heartlessness of
their own surgeons._June_ 22.--Captain Morris Brown, of Penn Yan, was killed to-day by a
musket shot in the head, while commanding the regiment before
Petersburg._June_ 23, 1864.--Anna graduated last Thursday, June 16, and was
valedictorian of her class.There were eleven girls in the class, Ritie
Tyler, Mary Antes, Jennie Robinson, Hattie Paddock, Lillie Masters,
Abbie Hills, Miss McNair, Miss Pardee and Miss Palmer, Miss Jasper and
Anna.The subject of her essay was "The Last Time."I will copy an
account of the exercises as they appeared in this week's village paper.A WORD FROM AN OLD MAN

"Mr.Editor:

"Less than a century ago I was traveling through this enchanted region
and accidentally heard that it was commencement week at the seminary.My venerable appearance seemed to command respect and I received
many attentions.I presented my snowy head and patriarchal beard at the
doors of the sacred institution and was admitted.I heard all the
classes, primary, secondary, tertiary, et cetera.I
rose early, dressed with much care.I affectionately pressed the hands
of my two landlords and left.When I arrived at the seminary I saw at a
glance that it was a place where true merit was appreciated.I was
invited to a seat among the dignitaries, but declined.I am a modest
man, I always was.I recognized the benign Principals of the school.You
can find no better principles in the states than in Ontario Female
Seminary.After the report of the committee a very lovely young lady
arose and saluted us in Latin.As she proceeded, I thought the grand
old Roman tongue had never sounded so musically and when she pronounced
the decree, 'Richmond delenda est,' we all hoped it might be prophetic.Then followed the essays of the other young ladies and then every one
waited anxiously for 'The Last Time.'The story was
beautifully told, the adieux were tenderly spoken.We saw the withered
flowers of early years scattered along the academic ways, and the golden
fruit of scholarly culture ripening in the gardens of the future.Enchanted by the sorrowful eloquence, bewildered by the melancholy
brilliancy, I sent a rosebud to the charming valedictorian and wandered
out into the grounds.I went to the concert in the evening and was
pleased and delighted.I shall return next year unless
the gout carries me off.I hope I shall hear just such beautiful music,
see just such beautiful faces and dine at the same excellent hotel.Anna closed her valedictory with these words:

"May we meet at one gate when all's over;
  The ways they are many and wide,
And seldom are two ways the same;
  Side by side may we stand
At the same little door when all's done.The ways they are many,
    The end it is one."_July_ 10.--We have had word of the death of Spencer F. Lincoln._August._--The New York State S. S. Convention was held in Buffalo and
among others Fanny Gaylord, Mary Field and myself attended.We had a
fine time and were entertained at the home of Mr.Her
mother is living with her, a dear old lady who was Judge Atwater's
daughter and used to go to school to Grandfather Beals.We went with
other delegates on an excursion to Niagara Falls and went into the
express office at the R. R. station to see Grant Schley, who is express
agent there.Daniel travelled to the garden.He said it seemed good to see so many home faces._September_ 1.--My war letters come from Georgetown Hospital now.John moved to the hallway.Noah T. Clarke is very anxious and sends telegrams to Andrew Chesebro
every day to go and see his brother._September_ 30.--To-day the "Benjamin" of the family reached home under
the care of Dr.J. Byron Hayes, who was sent to Washington after him.Noah T. Clarke's to see him and found him just a shadow
of his former self.However, "hope springs eternal in the human breast"
and he says he knows he will soon be well again.This is his thirtieth
birthday and it is glorious that he can spend it at home.Noah T. Clarke accompanied his brother to-day to the
old home in Naples and found two other soldier brothers, William and
Joseph, had just arrived on leave of absence from the army so the
mother's heart sang "Praise God from whom all blessings flow."The
fourth brother has also returned to his home in Illinois, disabled._November._--They are holding Union Revival Services in town now.One
evangelist from out of town said he would call personally at the homes
and ask if all were Christians.Anna told Grandmother if he came here
she should tell him about her.Grandmother said we must each give an
account for ourselves.Anna said she should tell him about her little
Grandmother anyway.We saw him coming up the walk about 11 a.m.and Anna
went to the door and asked him in.They sat down in the parlor and he
remarked about the pleasant weather and Canandaigua such a beautiful
town and the people so cultured.She said yes, she found the town every
way desirable and the people pleasant, though she had heard it remarked
that strangers found it hard to get acquainted and that you had to have
a residence above the R. R. track and give a satisfactory answer as to
who your Grandfather was, before admittance was granted to the best
society.He asked
her how long she had lived here and she told him nearly all of her brief
existence!She said if he had asked her how old she was she would have
told him she was so young that Will Adams last May was appointed her
guardian.He asked how many there were in the family and she said her
Grandmother, her sister and herself.He said, "They are Christians, I
suppose.""Yes," she said, "my sister is a S. S. teacher and my
Grandmother was born a Christian, about 80 years ago."Anna said she would have to be excused
as she seldom saw company.When he arose to go he said, "My dear young
lady, I trust that you are a Christian.""Mercy yes," she said, "years
ago."He said he was very glad and hoped she would let her light shine.She said that was what she was always doing--that the other night at a
revival meeting she sang every verse of every hymn and came home feeling
as though she had herself personally rescued by hand at least fifty
"from sin and the grave."He smiled approvingly and bade her good bye.She told Grandmother she presumed he would say "he had not found so
great faith, no not in Israel."George Wilson leads and

_March_ 5.--I have just read President Lincoln's second inaugural
address.It only takes five minutes to read it but, oh, how much it
contains._March_ 20.--Hardly a day passes that we do not hear news of Union
victories.Every one predicts that the war is nearly at an end._March_ 29.--An officer arrived here from the front yesterday and he
said that, on Saturday morning, shortly after the battle commenced which
resulted so gloriously for the Union in front of Petersburg, President
Lincoln, accompanied by General Grant and staff, started for the
battlefield, and reached there in time to witness the close of the
contest and the bringing in of the prisoners.His presence was
immediately recognized and created the most intense enthusiasm.He
afterwards rode over the battlefield, listened to the report of General
Parke to General Grant, and added his thanks for the great service
rendered in checking the onslaught of the rebels and in capturing so
many of their number.I read this morning the order of Secretary Stanton
for the flag raising on Fort Sumter.It reads thus: "War department,
Adjutant General's office, Washington, March 27th, 1865, General Orders
No.Ordered, first: That at the hour of noon, on the 14th day of
April, 1865, Brevet Major General Anderson will raise and plant upon the
ruins of Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, the same U. S. Flag which
floated over the battlements of this fort during the rebel assault, and
which was lowered and saluted by him and the small force of his command
when the works were evacuated on the 14th day of April, 1861.Second,
That the flag, when raised be saluted by 100 guns from Fort Sumter and
by a national salute from every fort and rebel battery that fired upon
Fort Sumter.Third, That suitable ceremonies be had upon the occasion,
under the direction of Major-General William T. Sherman, whose military
operations compelled the rebels to evacuate Charleston, or, in his
absence, under the charge of Major-General Q. A. Gillmore, commanding
the department.Among the ceremonies will be the delivery of a public
address by the Rev.Fourth, That the naval forces at
Charleston and their Commander on that station be invited to participate
in the ceremonies of the occasion.By order of the President of the
United States.E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War."_April,_ 1865.--What a month this has been.On the 6th of April Governor
Fenton issued this proclamation: "Richmond has fallen.The wicked men
who governed the so-called Confederate States have fled their capital,
shorn of their power and influence.The rebel armies have been defeated,
broken and scattered.Victory everywhere attends our banners and our
armies, and we are rapidly moving to the closing scenes of the war.Through the self-sacrifice and heroic devotion of our soldiers, the life
of the republic has been saved and the American Union preserved.I,
Reuben E. Fenton, Governor of the State of New York, do designate
Friday, the 14th of April, the day appointed for the ceremony of raising
the United States flag on Fort Sumter, as a day of Thanksgiving, prayer
and praise to Almighty God, for the signal blessings we have received at
His hands."_Saturday, April_ 8.--The cannon has fired a salute of thirty-six guns
to celebrate the fall of Richmond.This evening the streets were
thronged with men, women and children all acting crazy as if they had
not the remotest idea where they were or what they were doing.Atwater
block was beautifully lighted and the band was playing in front of it.On the square they fired guns, and bonfires were lighted in the streets.Clark's house was lighted from the very garret and they had a
transparency in front, with "Richmond" on it, which Fred Thompson made.We didn't even light "our other candle," for Grandmother said she
preferred to keep Saturday night and pity and pray for the poor
suffering, wounded soldiers, who are so apt to be forgotten in the hour
of victory._Sunday Evening, April_ 9.--There were great crowds at church this
morning.Daggett's text was from Prov.18: 10: "The name of the Lord
is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe."They sang hymns relating to our country and Dr.Daggett's prayers were full of thanksgiving.Noah T. Clarke had the
chapel decorated with flags and opened the Sunday School by singing,
"Marching On," "My Country, 'tis of Thee," "The Star Spangled Banner,"
"Glory, Hallelujah," etc.H. Lamport talked very pleasantly and
paid a very touching tribute to the memory of the boys, who had gone out
to defend their country, who would never come "marching home again."He
lost his only son, 18 years old (in the 126th), about two years ago.I
sat near Mary and Emma Wheeler and felt so sorry for them._Monday Morning, April_ 10.--"Whether I am in the body, or out of the
body, I know not, but one thing I know," Lee has surrendered!and all
the people seem crazy in consequence.The bells are ringing, boys and
girls, men and women are running through the streets wild with
excitement; the flags are all flying, one from the top of our church,
and such a "hurrah boys" generally, I never dreamed of.We were quietly
eating our breakfast this morning about 7 o'clock, when our church bell
commenced to ring, then the Methodist bell, and now all the bells in
town are ringing.Noah T. Clarke ran by, all excitement, and I don't
believe he knows where he is.Aldrich
passing, so I rushed to the window and he waved his hat.I raised the
window and asked him what was the matter?He came to the front door
where I met him and he almost shook my hand off and said, "The war is
over.We have Lee's surrender, with his own name signed."I am going
down town now, to see for myself, what is going on.Later--I have
returned and I never saw such performances in my life.Every man has a
bell or a horn, and every girl a flag and a little bell, and every one
is tied with red, white and blue ribbons.I am going down town again
now, with my flag in one hand and bell in the other and make all the
noise I can.Noah T. Clarke and other leading citizens are riding
around on a dray cart with great bells in their hands ringing them as
hard as they can.The latest musical
instrument invented is called the "Jerusalem fiddle."Some boys put a
dry goods box upon a cart, put some rosin on the edge of the box and
pulled a piece of timber back and forth across it, making most unearthly
sounds.They drove through all the streets, Ed Lampman riding on the
horse and driving it._Monday evening, April_ 10.--I have been out walking for the last hour
and a half, looking at the brilliant illuminations, transparencies and
everything else and I don't believe I was ever so tired in my life.The
bells have not stopped ringing more than five minutes all day and every
one is glad to see Canandaigua startled out of its propriety for once.Every yard of red, white and blue ribbon in the stores has been sold,
also every candle and every flag.One society worked hard all the
afternoon making transparencies and then there were no candles to put in
to light them, but they will be ready for the next celebration when
peace is proclaimed.The Court House, Atwater Block, and hotel have
about two dozen candles in each window throughout, besides flags and
mottoes of every description.It is certainly the best impromptu display
ever gotten up in this town."Victory is Grant-ed," is in large red,
white and blue letters in front of Atwater Block.The speeches on the
square this morning were all very good.Daggett commenced with
prayer, and such a prayer, I wish all could have heard it.Francis
Granger, E. G. Lapham, Judge Smith, Alexander Howell, Noah T. Clarke and
others made speeches and we sang "Old Hundred" in conclusion, and Rev.Hibbard dismissed us with the benediction.Noah T. Clarke, but he told me to be careful and not hurt him, for he
blistered his hands to-day ringing that bell.He says he is going to
keep the bell for his grandchildren.Between the speeches on the square
this morning a song was called for and Gus Coleman mounted the steps and
started "John Brown" and all the assembly joined in the chorus, "Glory,
Hallelujah."This has been a never to be forgotten day._April_ 15.--The news came this morning that our dear president, Abraham
Lincoln, was assassinated yesterday, on the day appointed for
thanksgiving for Union victories.I have felt sick over it all day and
so has every one that I have seen.All seem to feel as though they had
lost a personal friend, and tears flow plenteously.How soon has sorrow
followed upon the heels of joy!One week ago to-night we were
celebrating our victories with loud acclamations of mirth and good
cheer.Now every one is silent and sad and the earth and heavens seem
clothed in sack-cloth.The
flags are all at half mast, draped with mourning, and on every store and
dwelling-house some sign of the nation's loss is visible.Just after
breakfast this morning, I looked out of the window and saw a group of
men listening to the reading of a morning paper, and I feared from their
silent, motionless interest that something dreadful had happened, but I
was not prepared to hear of the cowardly murder of our President.And
William H. Seward, too, I suppose cannot survive his wounds.I went down town shortly after I heard the news, and it
was wonderful to see the effect of the intelligence upon everybody,
small or great, rich or poor.Every one was talking low, with sad and
anxious looks.But we know that God still reigns and will do what is
best for us all.Perhaps we're "putting our trust too much in princes,"
forgetting the Great Ruler, who alone can create or destroy, and
therefore He has taken from us the arm of flesh that we may lean more
confidingly and entirely upon Him.I trust that the men who committed
these foul deeds will soon be brought to justice._Sunday, Easter Day, April_ 16.--I went to church this morning.The
pulpit and choir-loft were covered with flags festooned with crape.Although a very disagreeable day, the house was well filled.The first
hymn sung was "Oh God our help in ages past, our hope for years to
come."Daggett's prayer, I can never forget, he alluded so
beautifully to the nation's loss, and prayed so fervently that the God
of our fathers might still be our God, through every calamity or
affliction, however severe or mysterious.All seemed as deeply affected
as though each one had been suddenly bereft of his best friend.The hymn
sung after the prayer, commenced with "Yes, the Redeemer rose."Daggett said that he had intended to preach a sermon upon the
resurrection.He read the psalm beginning, "Lord, Thou hast been our
dwelling-place in all generations."His text was "That our faith and
hope might be in God."He commenced by saying, "I feel as you feel this
morning: our sad hearts have all throbbed in unison since yesterday
morning when the telegram announced to us Abraham Lincoln is shot."He
said the last week would never be forgotten, for never had any of us
seen one come in with so much joy, that went out with so much sorrow.His whole sermon related to the President's life and death, and, in
conclusion, he exhorted us not to be despondent, for he was confident
that the ship of state would not go down, though the helmsman had
suddenly been taken away while the promised land was almost in view.He
prayed for our new President, that he might be filled with grace and
power from on High, to perform his high and holy trust.On Thursday we
are to have a union meeting in our church, but it will not be the day of
general rejoicing and thanksgiving we expected.In Sunday school the desk was draped with mourning, and
the flag at half-mast was also festooned with crape.Noah T. Clarke
opened the exercises with the hymn "He leadeth me," followed by "Though
the days are dark with sorrow," "We know not what's before us," "My days
are gliding swiftly by."Clarke said that we always meant to
sing "America," after every victory, and last Monday he was wondering if
we would not have to sing it twice to-day, or add another verse, but our
feelings have changed since then.Nevertheless he thought we had better
sing "America," for we certainly ought to love our country more than
ever, now that another, and such another, martyr, had given up his life
for it.Then he talked to the children and said that last
Friday was supposed to be the anniversary of the day upon which our Lord
was crucified, and though, at the time the dreadful deed was committed,
every one felt the day to be the darkest one the earth ever knew; yet
since then, the day has been called "Good Friday," for it was the death
of Christ which gave life everlasting to all the people.So he thought
that life would soon come out of darkness, which now overshadows us all,
and that the death of Abraham Lincoln might yet prove the nation's life
in God's own most mysterious way._Wednesday evening, April_ 19, 1865.--This being the day set for the
funeral of Abraham Lincoln at Washington, it was decided to hold the
service to-day, instead of Thursday, as previously announced in the
Congregational church.All places of business were closed and the bells
of the village churches tolled from half past ten till eleven o'clock.It is the fourth anniversary of the first bloodshed of the war at
Baltimore.It was said to-day, that while the services were being held
in the White House and Lincoln's body lay in state under the dome of the
capitol, that more than twenty-five millions of people all over the
civilized world were gathered in their churches weeping over the death
of the martyred President.We met at our church at half after ten
o'clock this morning.The bells tolled until eleven o'clock, when the
services commenced.The church was beautifully decorated with flags and
black and white cloth, wreaths, mottoes and flowers, the galleries and
all.There was a shield beneath the arch of
the pulpit with this text upon it: "The memory of the just is blessed."Under the choir-loft the picture of Abraham Lincoln
hung amid the flags and drapery.The motto, beneath the gallery, was
this text: "Know ye that the Lord He is God."The four pastors of the
place walked in together and took seats upon the platform, which was
constructed for the occasion.The choir chanted "Lord, Thou hast been
our dwelling-place in all generations," and then the Episcopal rector,
Rev.Leffingwell, read from the psalter, and Rev.Daniel went back to the bedroom.Daggett
followed with prayer.Judge Taylor was then called upon for a short
address, and he spoke well, as he always does.The choir sang "God is
our refuge and our strength."_Thursday, April_ 20.--The papers are full of the account of the funeral
obsequies of President Lincoln.We take Harper's Weekly and every event
is pictured so vividly it seems as though we were eye witnesses of it
all.The picture of "Lincoln at home" is beautiful.What a dear, kind
man he was.It is a comfort to know that the assassination was not the
outcome of an organized plot of Southern leaders, but rather a
conspiracy of a few fanatics, who undertook in this way to avenge the
defeat of their cause.It is rumored that one of the conspirators has
been located._April_ 24.--Fannie Gaylord and Kate Lapham have returned from their
eastern trip and told us of attending the President's funeral in Albany,
and I had a letter from Bessie Seymour, who is in New York, saying that
she walked in the procession until half past two in the morning, in
order to see his face.They say that they never saw him in life, but in
death he looked just as all the pictures represent him.Sandra went back to the office.We all wear
Lincoln badges now, with pin attached.They are pictures of Lincoln upon
a tiny flag, bordered with crape.Susie Daggett has just made herself a
flag, six feet by four.Noah T. Clarke gave
one to her husband upon his birthday, April 8.I think everybody ought
to own a flag._April_ 26.--Now we have the news that J. Wilkes Booth, who shot the
President and who has been concealing himself in Virginia, has been
caught, and refusing to surrender was shot dead.It has taken just
twelve days to bring him to retribution.I am glad that he is dead if he
could not be taken alive, but it seems as though shooting was too good
for him.However, we may as well take this as really God's way, as the
death of the President, for if he had been taken alive, the country
would have been so furious to get at him and tear him to pieces the
turmoil would have been great and desperate.It may be the best way to
dispose of him.Of course, it is best, or it would not be so.Morse
called this evening and he thinks Booth was shot by a lot of cowards.The flags have been flying all day, since the news came, but all,
excepting Albert Granger, seem sorry that he was not disabled instead of
being shot dead.Albert seems able to look into the "beyond" and also to
locate departed spirits.His "latest" is that he is so glad that Booth
got to h--l before Abraham Lincoln got to Springfield.Fred Thompson went down to New York last Saturday and while stopping
a few minutes at St.Johnsville, he heard a man crowing over the death
of the President.Thompson marched up to him, collared him and
landed him nicely in the gutter.The bystanders were delighted and
carried the champion to a platform and called for a speech, which was
given.Every one who hears the story, says:
"Three cheers for F. F.The other afternoon at our society Kate Lapham wanted to divert our
minds from gossip I think, and so started a discussion upon the
respective characters of Washington and Napoleon.It was just after
supper and Laura Chapin was about resuming her sewing and she exclaimed,
"Speaking of Washington, makes me think that I ought to wash my hands,"
so she left the room for that purpose._May_ 7.--Anna and I wore our new poke bonnets to church this morning
and thought we looked quite "scrumptious," but Grandmother said after we
got home, if she had realized how unbecoming they were to us and to the
house of the Lord, she could not have countenanced them enough to have
sat in the same pew.Daggett in his
text, "It is good for us to be here."It was the first time in a month
that he had not preached about the affairs of the Nation.In the afternoon the Sacrament was administered and Rev.A. D. Eddy, D.
D., who was pastor from 1823 to 1835, was present and officiated.Deacon
Castle and Deacon Hayes passed the communion.Eddy concluded the
services with some personal memories.Daniel travelled to the hallway.He said that forty-two years ago
last November, he presided upon a similar occasion for the first time in
his life and it was in this very church.He is now the only surviving
male member who was present that day, but there are six women living,
and Grandmother is one of the six.The Monthly Concert of Prayer for Missions was held in the chapel in the
evening.Daggett told us that the collection taken for missions
during the past year amounted to $500.He commended us and said it was
the largest sum raised in one year for this purpose in the twenty years
of his pastorate.Eddy then said that in contrast he would tell us
that the collection for missions the first year he was here, amounted to
$5, and that he was advised to touch very lightly upon the subject in
his appeals as it was not a popular theme with the majority of the
people.One member, he said, annexed three ciphers to his name when
asked to subscribe to a missionary document which was circulated, and
another man replied thus to an appeal for aid in evangelizing a portion
of Asia: "If you want to send a missionary to Jerusalem, Yates county, I
will contribute, but not a cent to go to the other side of the world."C. H. A. Buckley was present also and gave an interesting talk.By
way of illustration, he said he knew a small boy who had been earning
twenty-five cents a week for the heathen by giving up eating butter.The
other day he seemed to think that his generosity, as well as his
self-denial, had reached the utmost limit and exclaimed as he sat at the
table, "I think the heathen have had gospel enough, please pass the
butter."_May_ 10.--Jeff Davis was captured to-day at Irwinsville, Ga., when he
was attempting to escape in woman's apparel.Green drew a picture of
him, and Mr.We bought one as a
souvenir of the war.The big headlines in the papers this morning say, "The hunt is up.He
brandisheth a bowie-knife but yieldeth to six solid arguments.At
Irwinsville, Ga., about daylight on the 10th instant, Col.Prichard,
commanding the 4th Michigan Cavalry, captured Jeff Davis, family and
staff.They will be forwarded under strong guard without delay."The
flags have been flying all day, and every one is about as pleased over
the manner of his capture as over the fact itself.Lieutenant Hathaway,
one of the staff, is a friend of Mr.Manning Wells, and he was pretty
sure he would follow Davis, so we were not surprised to see his name
among the captured.Wells says he is as fine a horseman as he ever
saw._Monday evg., May_ 22.--I went to Teachers' meeting at Mrs.George Willson is the leader and she told
us at the last meeting to be prepared this evening to give our opinion
in regard to the repentance of Solomon before he died.We concluded that
he did repent although the Bible does not absolutely say so.Grandmother
thinks such questions are unprofitable, as we would better be repenting
of our sins, instead of hunting up Solomon's at this late day._May_ 23.--We arise about 5:30 nowadays and Anna does not like it very
well.I asked her why she was not as good natured as usual to-day and
she said it was because she got up "s'urly."She thinks Solomon must
have been acquainted with Grandmother when he wrote "She ariseth while
it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her
maidens."Patrick Burns, the "poet," who has also been our man of all
work the past year, has left us to go into Mr.He
seemed to feel great regret when he bade us farewell and told us he
never lived in a better regulated home than ours and he hoped his
successor would take the same interest in us that he had.He left one of his poems as a souvenir.It is entitled, "There will soon be an end to the war," written in
March, hence a prophecy.Morse had read it and pronounced it
"tip top."It was mostly written in capitals and I asked him if he
followed any rule in regard to their use.He said "Oh, yes, always begin
a line with one and then use your own discretion with the rest."_May_ 25.--I wish that I could have been in Washington this week, to
have witnessed the grand review of Meade's and Sherman's armies.The
newspaper accounts are most thrilling.The review commenced on Tuesday
morning and lasted two days.It took over six hours for Meade's army to
pass the grand stand, which was erected in front of the President's
house.It was witnessed by the President, Generals Grant, Meade, and
Sherman, Secretary Stanton, and many others in high authority.At ten
o'clock, Wednesday morning, Sherman's army commenced to pass in review.His men did not show the signs of hardship and suffering which marked
the appearance of the Army of the Potomac.Flags were flying everywhere and windows,
doorsteps and sidewalks were crowded with people, eager to get a view of
the grand armies.The city was as full of strangers, who had come to see
the sight, as on Inauguration Day.Very soon, all that are left of the
companies, who went from here, will be marching home, "with glad and
gallant tread."_June_ 3.--I was invited up to Sonnenberg yesterday and Lottie and Abbie
Clark called for me at 5:30 p.m., with their pony and democrat wagon.Jennie Rankine was the only other lady present and, for a wonder, the
party consisted of six gentlemen and five ladies, which has not often
been the case during the war.After supper we adjourned to the lawn and
played croquet, a new game which Mr.It is something like billiards, only a mallet is used instead of a
cue to hit the balls.I did not like it very well, because I couldn't
hit the balls through the wickets as I wanted to."We" sang all the
songs, patriotic and sentimental, that we could think of.Lyon came to call upon me to-day, before he returned to New York.I told him that I regretted that I could
not sing yesterday, when all the others did, and that the reason that I
made no attempts in that line was due to the fact that one day in
church, when I thought I was singing a very good alto, my grandfather
whispered to me, and said: "Daughter, you are off the key," and ever
since then, I had sung with the spirit and with the understanding, but
not with my voice.He said perhaps I could get some one to do my singing
for me, some day.I told him he was very kind to give me so much
encouragement.Anna went to a Y.M.C.A.meeting last evening at our
chapel and said, when the hymn "Rescue the perishing," was given out,
she just "raised her Ebenezer" and sang every verse as hard as she
could.The meeting was called in behalf of a young man who has been
around town for the past few days, with only one arm, who wants to be a
minister and sells sewing silk and needles and writes poetry during
vacation to help himself along.I have had a cough lately and
Grandmother decided yesterday to send for the doctor.He placed me in a
chair and thumped my lungs and back and listened to my breathing while
Grandmother sat near and watched him in silence, but finally she said,
"Caroline isn't used to being pounded!"The doctor smiled and said he
would be very careful, but the treatment was not so severe as it seemed.After he was gone, we asked Grandmother if she liked him and she said
yes, but if she had known of his "new-fangled" notions and that he wore
a full beard she might not have sent for him!Sandra travelled to the bathroom.Carr was
clean-shaven and also Grandfather and Dr.Daggett, and all of the
Grangers, she thinks that is the only proper way.What a funny little
lady she is!_June_ 8.--There have been unusual attractions down town for the past
two days.a man belonging to the
Ravel troupe walked a rope, stretched across Main street from the third
story of the Webster House to the chimney of the building opposite.He
is said to be Blondin's only rival and certainly performed some
extraordinary feats.Then
took a wheel-barrow across and returned with it backwards.He went
across blindfolded with a bag over his head.Then he attached a short
trapeze to the rope and performed all sorts of gymnastics.There were at
least 1,000 people in the street and in the windows gazing at him.Grandmother says that she thinks all such performances are wicked,
tempting Providence to win the applause of men.Nothing would induce her
to look upon such things.She is a born reformer and would abolish all
such schemes.This morning she wanted us to read the 11th chapter of
Hebrews to her, about faith, and when we had finished the forty verses,
Anna asked her what was the difference between her and Moses.Grandmother said there were many points of difference.Anna was not
found in the bulrushes and she was not adopted by a king's daughter.Anna said she was thinking how the verse read, "Moses was a proper
child," and she could not remember having ever done anything strictly
"proper" in her life.I noticed that Grandmother did not contradict her,
but only smiled._June_ 13.--Van Amburgh's circus was in town to-day and crowds attended
and many of our most highly respected citizens, but Grandmother had
other things for us to consider._June_ 16.--The census man for this town is Mr.He called
here to-day and was very inquisitive, but I think I answered all of his
questions although I could not tell him the exact amount of my property.Grandmother made us laugh to-day when we showed her a picture of the
Siamese twins, and I said, "Grandmother, if I had been their mother I
should have cut them apart when they were babies, wouldn't you?"The
dear little lady looked up so bright and said, "If I had been Mrs.Siam,
I presume I should have done just as she did."I don't believe that we
will be as amusing as she is when we are 82 years old._Saturday, July_ 8.--What excitement there must have been in Washington
yesterday over the execution of the conspirators.Surratt should have deserved hanging with the others.I saw a
picture of them all upon a scaffold and her face was screened by an
umbrella.I read in one paper that the doctor who dressed Booth's broken
leg was sentenced to the Dry Tortugas.Jefferson Davis, I suppose, is
glad to have nothing worse served upon him, thus far, than confinement
in Fortress Monroe.It is wonderful that 800,000 men are returning so
quietly from the army to civil life that it is scarcely known, save by
the welcome which they receive in their own homes.Buddington, of Brooklyn, preached to-day.His wife
was Miss Elizabeth Willson, Clara Coleman's sister.My Sunday School
book is "Mill on the Floss," but Grandmother says it is not Sabbath
reading, so I am stranded for the present._December_ 8.--Yesterday was Thanksgiving day.I do not remember that it
was ever observed in December before.President Johnson appointed it as
a day of national thanksgiving for our many blessings as a people, and
Governor Fenton and several governors of other states have issued
proclamations in accordance with the President's recommendation.The
weather was very unpleasant, but we attended the union thanksgiving
service held in our church.The choir sang America for the opening
piece.Daggett read Miriam's song of praise: "The Lord hath
triumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea."Then he offered one of his most eloquent and fervent prayers, in
which the returned soldiers, many of whom are in broken health or maimed
for life, in consequence of their devotion and loyalty to their country,
were tenderly remembered.His text was from the 126th Psalm, "The Lord
hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."It was one of his
best sermons.He mentioned three things in particular which the Lord has
done for us, whereof we are glad: First, that the war has closed;
second, that the Union is preserved; third, for the abolition of
slavery.After the sermon, a collection was taken for the poor, and Dr.A. D. Eddy, who was present, offered prayer.The choir sang an anthem
which they had especially prepared for the occasion, and then all joined
in the doxology.Uncle Thomas Beals' family of four united with our
three at Thanksgiving dinner.Uncle sent to New York for the oysters,
and a famous big turkey, with all the usual accompaniments, made us a
fine repast.Anna and Ritie Tyler are reading together Irving's Life of
Washington, two afternoons each week.I wonder how long they will keep
it up._December_ 11.--I have been down town buying material for garments for
our Home Missionary family which we are to make in our society.Anna and
I were cutting them out and basting them ready for sewing, and
grandmother told us to save all the basting threads when we were through
with them and tie them and wind them on a spool for use another time.Anna, who says she never wants to begin anything that she cannot finish
in 15 minutes, felt rather tired at the prospect of
