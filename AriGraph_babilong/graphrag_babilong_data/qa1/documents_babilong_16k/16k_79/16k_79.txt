And there thou dwellest, robed in sunset splendor,
             Up ’mid the ether clear,
         Midst the soft moonlight and the starlight tender
             Of a pure atmosphere.So, Christian soul, to thy low states declining,
             There is no peace for thee;
         Mount up!where the calm heavens are shining,
             Win peace by victory!What giant forces wrought, O mount supernal!Back in the early time,
         In building, balancing thy form eternal
             With potency sublime!O soul of mightier force, thy powers awaken!Build thou foundations which shall stand unshaken
             When heaven and earth shall flee.thy heart with earthquake shocks was rifted,
             With red fires melted through,
         And many were the mighty throes which lifted
             Thy head into the blue.Let Calv’ry tell, dear Christ!the sacrificing
             By which thy peace was won;
         And the sad garden by what agonizing
             The world was overcome.throughout thy grand endeavor
             Pray not that trials cease!’Tis these that lift thee into Heaven forever,
             The Heaven of perfect peace.The young astronomer and his Wife used
to attend the Music Hall meetings in Boston, where Sumner, Garrison,
Theodore Parker, and Wendell Phillips thundered away.On one occasion,
after Lincoln’s election, Phillips spoke advocating disunion.The crowd
was much excited, and threatened to mob him.“Hurrah for old Virginny!”
they yelled.Phillips was as calm as a Roman; but it was necessary to
form a body-guard to escort him home.Asaph Hall was a six-footer, and
believed in fair play; so he joined the little knot of men who bore
Phillips safely through the surging crowd.In after years he used to
tell of Phillips’ apparent unconcern, and of his courteous bow of thanks
when arrived at his doorstep.Angeline Hall had an adventure no less interesting.She became
acquainted with a shrewd old negress, called Moses, who had helped many
slaves escape North, stirring up mobs, when necessary, to free the
fugitives from the custody of officers.One day she went with Moses to
call upon the poet Lowell.Was glad to have
a chat with the old woman, and smilingly asked her if it did not trouble
her conscience to resist the law.Moses was ready to resist the law
again, and Lowell gave her some money.Superstitious people hailed the advent of Donati’s comet as a sign of
war—and Angeline Hall was yet to mourn the loss of friends upon the
battlefield.But hoping for peace and loving astronomy, she published
the following verses in a local newspaper:

                            DONATI’S COMET.O, not in wrath but lovingly,
                  In beauty pure and high,
                Bright shines the stranger visitant,
                  A glory in our sky.No harbinger of pestilence
                  Nor battle’s fearful din;
                Then open wide, ye gates of heaven,
                  And let the stranger in.It seems a spirit visible
                  Through some diviner air,
                With burning stars upon her brow
                  And in her shining hair.Through veil translucent, luminous
                  Shines out her starry face,
                And wrapped in robes of light she glides
                  Still through the silent space.And fill till it o’errun
                Thy silver horn thou ancient moon,
                  From fountains of the sun!But open wide the golden gates
                  Into your realm of Even,
                And let the angel presence pass
                  In glory through the heaven.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XII.––––––
                           LOVE IN A COTTAGE.Miss Sarah Waitt, a Cambridge school-teacher of beautiful character, and
firm friend of Angeline Hall, once said, after an acquaintance of thirty
years or more, that she had never known of a happier married life than
that of Mr.He opposed his wife’s writing
poetry—not from an aversion to poetry, but because poetry inferior to
the best is of little value.The wife, accustomed as an invalid to his
thoughtful attentions, missed his companionship as health returned.What
were her feelings the first night she found herself obliged to walk home
alone!But thereafter, like a more consistent apostle of woman’s rights,
she braved the night alone wherever duty led.She undertook to help her
husband in his computations, but, failing to persuade him that her time
was worth as much as his, she quit work.He could, indeed, compute much
faster than she, but she feelingly demanded a man’s wages.However, this labor trouble subsided without resort to boycott.The most
serious quarrel—and for a time it was very dreadful—arose in this way:

It is well known that Boston is the intellectual and moral centre of the
country, in fact of the world; the hub of the universe, as it were.There in ancient times witchcraft and the Quaker superstition were
gently but firmly discouraged (compare _Giles Corey_, Longfellow’s fine
drama, long since suppressed by Boston publishers).There in modern
times descendants of the Puritans practice race-suicide and Irishmen
practice politics.There a white man is looked upon as the equal of a
<DW64>, though somewhat inferior, in many ways, to the Boston woman.Now
it so happened that some Boston and Cambridge ladies of Angeline Hall’s
acquaintance had resolved beyond equivocation that woman should
thenceforth be emancipated from skirts.Hall, in college days, had worn the “bloomer” costume.So they very
generously suggested that she have the honor of inaugurating bloomers in
Boston and vicinity.Truly it showed a self-sacrificing spirit on the
part of these ladies to allow this comparatively unknown sister to reap
the honor due her who should abolish skirts.They would not for one
moment think of robbing her of this honor by donning bloomers
themselves.They could only suggest that the reform be instituted
without delay, and they were eager to see how much the Boston public
would appreciate it.He reminded his wife that they were just struggling
to their feet, and the bloomers might ruin their prospects.A pure-minded woman to be interfered with in this manner!And worse than that, to think that she had married a coward!“A
coward”—yes, that is what she called him.It so happened, shortly
afterward, that the astronomer, returning home one night, found his wife
by the doorstep watching a blazing lamp, on the point of explosion.He
stepped up and dropped his observing cap over the lamp.Whereupon she
said, “You _are_ brave!” Strange she had not noticed it before!Asaph Hall used to aver that a family quarrel is not always a bad thing.Could he have been thinking of his
own experience?It is possible that the little quarrels indicated above
led to a clearer understanding of the separate duties of husband and
wife, and thence to a division of labor in the household.The secret of
social progress lies in the division of labor.And the secret of success
and great achievement in the Hall household lay in the division of
labor.Hall confined his attention to astronomy,
and Mrs.The world gained a worthy
astronomer.Did it lose a reformer-poetess?But it was richer
by one more devoted wife and mother.From the spring of 1859 to the end of their stay in Cambridge, that is,
for three years, the Halls occupied the cozy little Bond cottage, at the
top of Observatory Hill.Back of the cottage they had a vegetable
garden, which helped out a small salary considerably.There in its
season they raised most delicious sweet corn.In the dooryard, turning
an old crank, was a rosy-cheeked little boy, who sang as he turned:

                         Julee, julee, mem, mem,
                         Julee, julee, mem, mem;

then paused to call out:

“Mama, don’t you like my sweet voice?”

Asaph Hall, Jr., was born at the Bond cottage, October 6, 1859.If we
may trust the accounts of his fond mother, he was a precocious little
fellow—played bo-peep at four months—weighed twenty-one pounds at six
months, when he used to ride out every day in his little carriage and
get very rosy—took his first step at fourteen months, when he had ten
teeth—was quite a talker at seventeen months, when he tumbled down the
cellar stairs with a pail of coal scattered over him—darned his stocking
at twenty-six months, and demanded that his aunt’s letter be read to him
three or four times a day—at two and a half years trudged about in the
snow in his rubber boots, and began to help his mother with the
housework, declaring, “I’m big enough, mama.” “Little A.” was a general
favorite.He fully enjoyed a clam bake, and was very fond of oranges.One day he got lost, and his terrified mother thought he might have
fallen into a well.But he was found at last on his way to Boston to buy
oranges.Love in a cottage is sweeter and more prosperous when the cottage stands
a hundred miles or more from the homes of relatives.How can wife cleave
unto husband when mother lives next door?And how can husband prosper
when father pays the bills?It was a fortunate piece of hard luck that
Angeline Hall saw little of her people.Sandra went to the bathroom.As it was, her sympathy and
interest constantly went out to mother and sisters.In one she threatened to rescue her mother from the irate
Mr.Woodward by carrying her off bodily to Cambridge.By others it
appears that she was always in touch with her sisters Ruth and Mary.Indeed, during little A.’s early infancy Mary visited Cambridge and
acted as nurse.In the summer of 1860, little A. and his mother visited
Rodman.Charlotte Ingalls was on from the West, also, and there was a
sort of family reunion.Charlotte, Angeline and Ruth, and their cousins
Huldah and Harriette were all mothers now, and they merrily placed their
five babies in a row.Mary went to the bedroom.In the fall of the same year Angeline visited her aunts, Lois and
Charlotte Stickney, who still lived on their father’s farm in Jaffrey,
New Hampshire.The old ladies were very poor, and labored in the field
like men, maintaining a pathetic independence.Angeline was much
concerned, but found some comfort, no doubt, in this example of Stickney
grit.She had found her father’s old home, heard his story from his
sisters’ lips, learned of the stalwart old grandfather, Moses Stickney;
and from that time forth she took a great interest in the family
genealogy.In 1863 she visited Jaffrey again, and that summer ascended
Mt.Just twenty-five years afterward,
accompanied by her other three sons, she camped two or three weeks on
her grandfather’s farm; and it was my own good fortune to ascend the
grand old mountain with her.Great white
clouds lay against the blue sky in windrows.At a distance the rows
appeared to merge into one great mass; but on the hills and fields and
ponds below the shadows alternated with the sunshine as far as eye could
reach.There beneath us lay the rugged land whose children had carried
Anglo-Saxon civilization westward to the Pacific.Moses Stickney’s farm
was a barren waste now, hardly noticeable from the mountain-top.Lois
and Charlotte had died in the fall of 1869, within a few days of each
other.House and barn had disappeared, and the site was marked by
raspberry bushes.We drew water from the old well; and gathered the dead
brush of the apple orchard, where our tent was pitched, to cook our
victuals.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                             CHAPTER XIII.––––––
                     WASHINGTON AND THE CIVIL WAR.Many an obscure man of ability was raised to prominence by the Civil
War.So it was with the astronomer, Asaph Hall.A year after the war
broke out, the staff of workers at the U.S.Some resigned to go South; others were ordered elsewhere by
the Federal Government.In the summer of 1862, while his wife was
visiting her people in Rodman, Mr.Hall went to Washington, passed an
examination, and was appointed an “Aid” in the Naval Observatory.On August 27, three weeks after he entered
the observatory, Mr.Hall wrote to his wife:

    When I see the slack, shilly-shally, expensive way the Government
    has of doing everything, it appears impossible that it should ever
    succeed in beating the Rebels.He soon became disgusted at the wire-pulling in Washington, and wrote
contemptuously of the “_American_ astronomy” then cultivated at the
Naval Observatory.But he decided to make the best of a bad bargain; and
his own work at Washington has shed a lustre on American astronomy.When he left Cambridge, thanks to his frugal wife, he had three hundred
dollars in the bank, although his salary at the Harvard Observatory was
only six hundred a year.The Bonds hated to lose him, and offered him
eight hundred in gold if he would stay.This was as good as the
Washington salary of one thousand a year in paper money which he
accepted, to say nothing of the bad climate and high prices of that
city, or of the uncertainties of the war.The next three years were teeming with great events.In less than a
month after his arrival in Washington, the second battle of Bull Run was
fought.At the observatory he heard the roar of cannon and the rattle of
musketry; and it was his heart-rending task to hunt for wounded friends.His wife, still at the North, wrote under date of September 4, 1862:

    DEAREST ASAPH:... I wish I could go right on to you, I feel so
    troubled about you.You will write to me, won’t you, as soon as you
    get this, and tell me whether to come on now or not.If there is
    danger I had rather share it with you.Little A says he does not want papa to get shot.Cried about it last
    night, and put his arms round my neck.He says he is going to take
    care of mamma.To this her husband replied, September 6:

    DEAREST ANGIE: I have just got your letter.... You must not give
    yourself any uneasiness about me.I shall keep along about my
    business.We are now observing the planet Mars in the morning, and I
    work every other night.Don’t tell little A that I am going to be shot.Don’t expect
    anything of that kind.You had better take your time and visit at
    your leisure now.Things will be more settled in a couple of weeks.Fox [his room-mate at McGrawville] seems to be doing well.The
    ball is in his chest and probably lodged near his lungs.It may kill
    him, but I think not....

Observing Mars every other night, and serving Mars the rest of the time!His wife’s step-brothers Constant and Jasper Woodward were both wounded.Jasper, the best of the Woodward brothers, was a lieutenant, and led his
company at Bull Run, the captain having scalded himself slightly with
hot coffee in order to keep out of the fight.Jasper was an exceedingly
bashful fellow, but a magnificent soldier, and he fairly gloried in the
battle.When he fell, and his company broke in retreat, Constant paused
to take a last shot in revenge, and was himself wounded.Hall found
them both, Constant fretful and complaining, though not seriously
wounded, and Jasper still glorying in the fight.The gallant fellow’s
wound did not seem fatal; but having been left in a damp stone church,
he had taken cold in it, so that he died.Next followed the battle of Antietam, and the astronomer’s wife, unable
to find out who had won, and fearful lest communication with Washington
might be cut off if she delayed, hastened thither.A. J.
Warner, a McGrawville schoolmate, whose family lived with the Halls in
Georgetown, was brought home shot through the hip.To add to the trials
of the household, little A. and the colonel’s boy Elmer came down with
diphtheria.Through the unflagging care and nursing of his mother,
little A. lived.Hall, exhausted by the hot,
unwholesome climate no less than by his constant exertions in behalf of
wounded friends, broke down, and was confined within doors six weeks
with jaundice.Indeed, it was two years before he fully recovered.Strange that historians of the Civil War have not dwelt upon the
enormous advantage to the Confederates afforded by their hot, enervating
climate, so deadly to the Northern volunteer.In January, 1863, the Halls and Warners moved to a house in Washington,
on I Street, between 20th and 21st Streets, N.W.Here a third surgical
operation on the wounded colonel proved successful.Though he nearly
bled to death, the distorted bullet was at last pulled out through the
hole it had made in the flat part of the hip bone.Deceived by the
doctors before, the poor man cried: “Mr.Is the
ball out?”

Soon after this, in March, small-pox, which was prevalent in the city,
broke out in the house, and Mr.Hall sent his wife and little boy to
Cambridge, Mass.There she stayed with her friend Miss Sarah Waitt; and
there she wrote the following letter to Captain Gillis, Superintendent
of the Naval Observatory:

                                               CAMBRIDGE, Apr.Gillis._

    DEAR SIR: I received a letter from Mr.Hall this morning saying that
    Prof.Hesse has resigned his place at the Observatory.If the question is one of ability, I should be more than willing
    that he with all other competitors should have a thorough and
    impartial examination.I know I should be proud of the result.If on
    the other hand the question is who has the greatest number of
    influential friends to push him forward whether qualified or
    unqualified, I fear, alas!He stands alone on his
    merits, but his success is only a question of time.I, more than any
    one, know of all his long, patient and faithful study.A few years,
    and he, like Johnson, will be beyond the help of some Lord
    Chesterfield.Hall writes me that he shall do nothing but wait.I could not
    bear not to have his name at least proposed.Truly,

                ANGELINE S. HALL.Hall wrote to his wife from Washington:

    DEAREST ANGIE: Yesterday afternoon Capt.Gillis told me to tell you
    that the best answer he could make to your letter is that hereafter
    you might address me as Prof.A. Hall....

    You wrote to Capt.Yours,

                A. HALL.And so it was that Asaph Hall entered permanently into the service of
the United States Government.His position in life was at last secure,
and the rest of his days were devoted completely to science.His wife,
grown stronger and more self-reliant, took charge of the family affairs
and left him free to work.That summer he wrote to her, “It took me a
long time to find out what a good wife I have got.”

Some fifteen years afterward Mrs.Hall rendered a similar service to the
famous theoretical astronomer, Mr.George W. Hill, who for several years
was an inmate of her house.Hill’s rare abilities, and his
extreme modesty, Mrs.Hall took it upon herself to urge his appointment
to the corps of Professors of Mathematics, U.S.Navy, to which her
husband belonged.There were two vacancies at the time, and Mr.Hill,
having brilliantly passed a competitive examination, was designated for
appointment.But certain influences deprived the corps of the lustre
which the name of Hill would have shed upon it.In the fall of 1863 the Halls settled down again in the house on I
Street.Here the busy little wife made home as cheerful as the times
permitted, celebrating her husband’s birthday with a feast.But the I
Street home was again invaded by small-pox.Captain Fox, having been
appointed to a government clerkship, was boarding with them, when he
came down with varioloid.Hall’s sister, on a visit to
Washington, caught the small-pox from him.However, she recovered
without spreading the disease.In May, 1864, they rented rooms in a house on the heights north of the
city.Crandle, was a Southern sympathizer; but
when General Jubal A. Early threatened the city he was greatly alarmed.On the morning of July 12 firing was heard north of the city.Crandle,
with a clergyman friend, had been out very early reconnoitering, and
they appeared with two young turkeys, stolen somewhere in anticipation
of the sacking of the city.For the Confederates were coming, and the
house, owned as it was by a United States officer, would surely be
burned.A hiding place for the family had been found in the Rock Creek
valley.Hall went to his work that morning as usual; but he did not return.Hall, who was soon to give birth to another son, took little Asaph
and went in search of her husband.He was not at the observatory, but
the following note explained his absence:

                                                          July 12, 1864.DEAR ANGIE: I am going out to Fort Lincoln.Don’t know how long I
    shall stay.Keep
    cool and take good care of little A.

            Yours truly,

                A. HALL.Hall was put in command
of workmen from the Navy Yard, who manned an intrenchment near Fort
Lincoln.Many of the men were foreigners, and some of them did not know
how to load a gun.Had the Confederates charged upon them they might
have been slaughtered like sheep.But in a day or two Union troops
arrived in sufficient force to drive Early away.Before the summer was over, the Halls moved to a house in Georgetown, on
the corner of West and Montgomery Streets.It was an old-fashioned brick
house, with a pleasant yard fenced by iron pickets.These were made of
old gun barrels, and gave the place the name of “Gunbarrel Corner.”
Here, on the 28th of September, 1864, their second child, Samuel, was
born.And here the family lived for three years, renting rooms to
various friends and relatives.Mary went back to the kitchen.Charles Kennon, whose soldier husband lost his life in the Red River
expedition, leaving her with three noble little sons.Kennon and the
Halls had been neighbors in Cambridge, where he studied at the Harvard
Divinity School.Hall had objected to having a home in Washington,
and had looked to New England as a fitter place for his family to live;
but his wife would not be separated from him.The curse of war was upon
the city.Crowded with sick and wounded soldiers, idle officers and
immoral women, it was scourged by disease.Forty cases of small-pox were
at one time reported within half a mile of the place where Mr.But people had become so reckless as to attend a ball at a
small-pox hospital.Most of the native population were Southern
sympathizers, and some of the women were very bitter.They hated all
Yankees—people who had lived upon saw-dust, and who came to Washington
to take the Government offices away from Southern gentlemen.As Union
soldiers were carried, sick and wounded, to the hospital, these women
would laugh and jeer at them.But there were people in Washington who were making history.Hall saw Grant—short, thin, and stoop-shouldered, dressed in his
uniform, a slouch hat pulled over his brow—on his way to take command of
the Army of the Potomac.That venerable patriot John Pierpont, whom she
had seen and admired at McGrawville, became attached to Mrs.Hall, and
used to dine at her house.She took her little boy to one of Lincoln’s
receptions, and one night Lincoln and Secretary Stanton made a visit to
the Naval Observatory, where Mr.Hall showed them some objects through
his telescope.At the Cambridge Observatory the Prince of Wales had once
appeared, but on that occasion the young astronomer was made to feel
less than nobody.Now the great War President, who signed his commission
in the United States Navy, talked with him face to face.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.One night soon
afterward, when alone in the observing tower, he heard a knock at the
trap door.He leisurely completed his observation, then went to lift the
door, when up through the floor the tall President raised his head.Lincoln had come unattended through the dark streets to inquire why the
moon had appeared inverted in the telescope.Surveyors’ instruments,
which he had once used, show objects in their true position.At length the war was over, and the Army of the Potomac and Sherman’s
Army passed in review through the city.Hall was one of those who
witnessed these glorious spectacles—rank after rank, regiment after
regiment of seasoned veterans, their battle-flags torn and begrimed,
their uniforms shabby enough but their arms burnished and glistening,
the finest soldiers in the world!Among the officers was General
Osborne, an old Jefferson County acquaintance.Among all the noble men of those heroic times, I, for my part, like to
think of old John Pierpont, the minister poet, who broke bread at my
mother’s table.Whether this predilection is due to prenatal causes,
some Oliver Wendell Holmes may decide.Certain it is that I was born in
September, 1868, and in the preceding April my mother wrote:

          O dear anemone, and violet fair,
            Beloved hepatica, arbutus sweet!Two years ago I twined your graces rare,
            And laid the garland at the poet’s feet.The grand old poet on whose brow the snow
            Of eighty winters lay in purest white,
          But in whose heart was held the added glow
            Of eighty summers full of warmth and light.Like some fair tree within the tropic clime
            In whose green boughs the spring and autumn meet,
          Where wreaths of bloom around the ripe fruits twine,
            And promise with fulfilment stands complete,

          So twined around the ripeness of his thought
            An ever-springing verdure and perfume,
          All his rich fullness from October caught
            And all her freshness from the heart of June.But last year when the sweet wild flowers awoke
            And opened their dear petals to the sun,
          He was not here, but every flow’ret spoke
            An odorous breath of him the missing one.Of this effusion John Greenleaf Whittier—to whom the verses were
addressed—graciously wrote:

    The first four verses of thy poem are not only very beautiful from
    an artistic point of view, but are wonderfully true of the man they
    describe.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XIV.––––––
                          THE GAY STREET HOME.In November, 1867, the Halls bought the Captain Peters’ place, No.18
Gay Street, Georgetown, and for twenty-five years, that is, for the rest
of Angeline Hall’s life, this was her home.The two-story brick house,
covered with white stucco, and having a shingled roof, stood in the
centre of a generous yard, looking southward.Wooden steps led up to a
square front porch, the roof of which was supported by large wooden
pillars.The front door opened into a hall, with parlor on the right
hand and sitting room on the left.Back of the sitting room was the
dining room, and back of that the kitchen.In the year of the
Centennial, 1876, the house was enlarged to three stories, with a flat
tin roof, and three bay-windows were added, one in the dining room and
two in front of the house, and the front porch was lengthened so as to
extend from one bay window to the other.The new house was heated
chiefly by a furnace and a large kitchen range, but in the dining room
and sitting room grates were put in for open coal fires.The two rooms
were thrown together by sliding doors, and became the centre of home
comfort; though the room over the sitting room, where, in a low
cane-seated rocking chair of oak, Mrs.Hall sat and did the family
sewing, was of almost equal importance.In the sitting room hung the
old-fashioned German looking-glass with its carved and gilded frame, the
gift of Dr.Over the fire-place was an engraving of Lincoln,
and in one corner of the room was the round mahogany table where
Professor Hall played whist with his boys.Over the dining room mantle
hung a winter scene painted by some relative of the family, and in the
bay window stood Mrs.[Illustration: THE GAY STREET HOME]


In the front yard was a large black-heart cherry tree, where house-wrens
built their nests, a crab-apple tree that blossomed prodigiously, a
damson plum, peach trees, box-trees and evergreens.The walks were
bordered with flower beds, where roses and petunias, verbenas and
geraniums, portulacas and mignonnette blossomed in profusion.In the
back yard was a large English walnut tree, from the branches of which
the little Halls used to shoot the ripe nuts with their bows and arrows.In another part of the back yard was Mrs.Hall’s hot-bed, with its seven
long sashes, under which tender garden plants were protected during the
winter, and sweet English violets bloomed.Along the sidewalk in front
of the premises was a row of rather stunted rock-maples; for the
Southern soil seemed but grudgingly to nourish the Northern trees.Such, in bare outline, was the Gay Street home.Here on September 16,
1868, the third child, Angelo, was born.Among the boys of the
neighborhood 18 Gay Street became known as the residence of “Asaph, Sam,
and Angelico.” This euphonious and rhythmical combination of names held
good for four years exactly, when, on September 16, 1872, the fourth and
last child, Percival, was born.One of my earliest recollections is the
sight of a red, new-born infant held in my father’s hands.It has been
humorously maintained that it was my parents’ design to spell out the
name “Asaph” with the initials of his children.I am inclined to
discredit the idea, though the pleasantry was current in my boyhood, and
the fifth letter,—which might, of course, be said to stand for Hall,—was
supplied by Henry S. Pritchett, who as a young man became a member of
the family, as much attached to Mrs.In fact, when
Asaph was away at college, little Percival used to say there were five
boys in the family _counting Asaph_.As a curious commentary upon this
letter game, I will add that my own little boy Llewellyn used to
pronounce his grandfather’s name “Apas.” Blood is thicker than water,
and though the letters here are slightly mixed, the proper four, and
four only, are employed.So it came to pass that Angeline Hall reared her four sons in the
unheard-of and insignificant little city of Georgetown, whose sole claim
to distinction is that it was once the home of Francis Scott Key.What a
pity the Hall boys were not brought up in Massachusetts!And yet how
glad I am that we were not!In Georgetown Angeline Hall trained her sons
with entire freedom from New England educational fads; and for her sake
Georgetown is to them profoundly sacred.Here it was that this woman of
gentle voice, iron will, and utmost purity of character instilled in her
growing boys moral principles that should outlast a lifetime.One day
when about six years old I set out to annihilate my brother Sam.I had a
chunk of wood as big as my head with which I purposed to kill him.He
happened to be too nimble for me, so that the fury of my rage was
ungratified.She told me in heartfelt words the inevitable consequences of such
actions—and from that day dated my absolute submission to her authority.In this connection it will not be amiss to quote the words of Mrs.John
R. Eastman, for thirteen years our next-door neighbor:

    During the long days of our long summers, when windows and doors
    were open, and the little ones at play out of doors often claimed a
    word from her, I lived literally within sound of her voice from day
    to day.Never once did I hear it raised in anger, and its sweetness,
    and steady, even tones, were one of her chief and abiding charms.The fact is, Angeline Hall rather over-did the inculcation of Christian
principles.Like Tolstoi she taught the absolute wickedness of fighting,
instead of the manly duty of self-defense.And yet, I think my brothers
suffered no evil consequences.Perhaps the secret of her
great influence over us was that she demanded the absolute truth.Dishonesty in word or act was out of the question.In two instances, I
remember, I lied to her; for in moral strength I was not the equal of
George Washington.Daniel journeyed to the garden.But those lies weighed heavily on my conscience, till
at last, after many years, I confessed to her.If she demanded truth and obedience from her sons, she gave to them her
absolute devotion.Miracles of healing were performed in her household.By sheer force of character, by continual watchings and utmost care in
dieting, she rescued me from a hopeless case of dysentery in the fifth
year of my age.The old Navy doctor called it a miracle, and so it was.Serious sickness was uncommon in
our family, as is illustrated by the fact that, for periods of three
years each, not one of her four boys was ever late to school, though the
distance thither was a mile or two.When Percival, coasting down one of
the steep hills of Georgetown, ran into a street car and was brought
home half stunned, with one front tooth knocked out and gone and another
badly loosened, Angeline Hall repaired to the scene of the accident
early the next morning, found the missing tooth, and had the family
dentist restore it to its place.There it has done good service for
twenty years.Is it any wonder that such a woman should have insisted
upon her husband’s discovering the satellites of Mars?Perhaps the secret of success in the moral training of her sons lay in
her generalship.In house and yard there was
work to do, and she marshaled her boys to do it.Like a good general she
was far more efficient than any of her soldiers, but under her
leadership they did wonders.Sweeping, dusting, making beds, washing
dishes, sifting ashes, going to market, running errands, weeding the
garden, chopping wood, beating carpets, mending fences, cleaning
house—there was hardly a piece of work indoors or out with which they
were unfamiliar.There was abundance
of leisure for all sorts of diversions, including swimming and skating,
two forms of exercise which struck terror to the mother heart, but in
which, through her self-sacrifice, they indulged quite freely.Their leisure was purchased by her labor; for until they were of
academic age she was their school teacher.In an hour or two a day they
mastered the three R’s and many things besides.Nor did they suffer from
too little teaching, for at the preparatory school each of them in turn
led his class, and at Harvard College all four sons graduated with
distinction.How few mothers have so
proud a record, and how impossible would such an achievement have seemed
to any observer who had seen the collapse of this frail woman at
McGrawville!But as each successive son completed his college course it
was as if she herself had done it—her moral training had supplied the
incentive, her teaching and encouragement had started the lad in his
studies, when he went to school her motherly care had provided
nourishing food and warm clothing, when he went to college her frugality
had saved up the necessary money.She used to say, “Somebody has got to
make a sacrifice,” and she sacrificed herself.It is good to know that
on Christmas Day, 1891, half a year before she died, she broke bread
with husband and all four sons at the old Georgetown home.Let it not be supposed that Angeline Hall reached the perfection of
motherhood.The Gay Street home was the embodiment
of her spirit; and as she was a Puritan, her sons suffered sometimes
from her excess of Puritanism.They neither drank nor used tobacco; but
fortunately their father taught them to play cards.Their mother brought
them up to believe in woman suffrage; but fortunately Cupid provided
them wives regardless of such creed.She taught them to eschew pride,
sending them to gather leaves in the streets, covering their garments
with patches, discouraging the use of razors on incipient beards; but
fortunately a boy’s companions take such nonsense out of him.She even
left a case of chills and fever to the misdirected mercies of a woman
doctor, a homœopathist.I myself was the victim, and for twenty-five
years I have abhorred women homœopathic physicians.But such trivial faults are not to be compared with the depths of a
mother’s love.To all that is intrinsically noble and beautiful she was
keenly sensitive.How good it was to see her exult in the glories of a
Maryland sunset—viewed from the housetop with her boys about her.And
how strange that this timid woman could allow them to risk their
precious necks on the roof of a three-story house!Perhaps her passion for the beautiful was most strikingly displayed in
the cultivation of her garden.To each son she dedicated a rose-bush.There was one for her husband and another for his mother.In a shady
part of the yard grew lilies of the valley; and gladiolas, Easter lilies
and other varieties of lilies were scattered here and there.In the
early spring there were crocuses and hyacinths and daffodils.Vines
trailed along the fences and climbed the sides of the house.She was
especially fond of her English ivy.Honeysuckles flourished, hollyhocks
ran riot even in the front yard, morning-glories blossomed west of the
house, by the front porch grew a sweet-briar rose with its fragrant
leaves, and by the bay windows bloomed blue and white wisterias.A
magnolia bush stood near the parlor window, a forsythia by the front
fence, and by the side alley a beautiful flowering bush with a dome of
white blossoms.The flower beds were literally crowded, so that humming
birds, in their gorgeous plumage, were frequent visitors.Hall had loved the wild flowers of her native woods and fields; and
in the woods back of Georgetown she sought out her old friends and
brought them home to take root in her yard, coaxing their growth with
rich wood’s earth, found in the decayed stump of some old tree.Thus the following poem, like all her poems, was but the expression of
herself:

                              ASPIRATION.The violet dreams forever of the sky,
            Until at last she wakens wondrous fair,
          With heaven’s own azure in her dewy eye,
            And heaven’s own fragrance in her earthly air.The lily folds close in her heart the beams
            That the pure stars reach to her deeps below,
          Till o’er the waves her answering brightness gleams—
            A star hath flowered within her breast of snow.The rose that watches at the gates of morn,
            While pours through heaven the splendor of the sun,
          Needs none to tell us whence her strength is born,
            Nor where her crown of glory she hath won.And every flower that blooms on hill or plain
            In the dull soil hath most divinely wrought
          To haunting perfume or to heavenly stain
            The sweetness born of her aspiring thought.With what expectancy we wait the hour
          When all the hopes to which thou dost aspire
            Shall in the holiness of beauty flower.------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER XV.––––––
                           AN AMERICAN WOMAN.The desire of knowledge is a powerful instinct of the soul, as
    inherent in woman as in man.... It was designed to be gratified, all
    the avenues of her soul are open for its gratification.Her every
    sense is as perfect as man’s: her hand is as delicate in its touch,
    her ear as acute in hearing, her eye the same in its wonderful
    mechanism, her brain sends out the same two-fold telegraphic
    network.She is endowed with the same consciousness, the same power
    of perception.From her
    very organization she is manifestly formed for the pursuit of the
    same knowledge, for the attainment of the same virtue, for the
    unfolding of the same truth.Whatever aids man in the pursuit of any
    one of these objects must aid her also.Let woman then reject the
    philosophy of a narrow prejudice or of false custom, and trust
    implicitly to God’s glorious handwriting on every folded tissue of
    her body, on every tablet of her soul.Let her seek for the highest
    culture of brain and heart.Let her apply her talent to the highest
    use.In so doing will the harmony of her being be perfect.Brain and
    heart according well will make one music.All the bright
    intellections of the mind, all the beautiful affections of the heart
    will together form one perfect crystal around the pole of Truth.From these words of hers it appears that Angeline Hall believed in a
well-rounded life for women as well as for men; and to the best of her
ability she lived up to her creed.Physically deficient herself, she
heralded the advent of the American woman—the peer of Spartan mother,
Roman matron or modern European dame.Her ideal could hardly be called
“the new woman,” for she fulfilled the duties of wife and mother with
the utmost devotion.Among college women she was a pioneer; and perhaps
the best type of college woman corresponds to her ideal.[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF 1878]


In person she was not remarkable—height about five feet three inches,
weight with clothing about one hundred and twenty-three pounds.In
middle life she was considerably bent over, more from years of toil than
from physical weakness.Nervous strength was lacking; and early in life
she lost her teeth.John went back to the bedroom.But her frame was well developed, her waist being as
large as a Greek goddess’s, for she scorned the use of corsets.Her
smooth skin was of fine stout texture.Her well-shaped head was adorned
by thin curls of wonderfully fine, dark hair, which even at the time of
death showed hardly a trace of white.Straight mouth, high forehead,
strong brow, large straight nose, and beautiful brown eyes indicated a
woman of great spiritual force.She cared little for adornment, believing that the person is attractive
if the soul is good.Timid in the face of physical danger, she was
endowed with great moral courage and invincible resolution.She used to
speak of “going along and doing something,” and of “doing a little every
day.” Friends and relatives found in her a wise counsellor and fearless
leader.She was gifted with intellect of a high order—an unquenchable
thirst for knowledge, a good memory, excellent mathematical ability, and
the capacity for mental labor.But her sense of duty controlled, and she
devoted her talents to the service of others.Unlike Lady Macbeth in other respects, she was suited to bear
men-children.And, thanks to her true womanhood, she nursed them at the
breast.There were no bottle babies in the Hall family.Tradition has it
that she endured the pains of childbirth with unusual fortitude, hardly
needing a physician.But this seeming strength was due in part to an
unwise modesty.With hardly enough strength for the duties of each day, she did work
enough for two women through sheer force of will.It is not surprising
then that she died, in the sixty-second year of her age, from a stroke
of apoplexy.She was by no means apoplectic in appearance, being rather
a pale person; but the blood-vessels of the brain were worn out and
could no longer withstand the pressure.In the fall of 1881, after the
death of her sister Mary and of Nellie Woodward, daughter of her sister
Ruth, she was the victim of a serious sickness, which continued for six
months or more.Friends thought she would die; but her sister Ruth came
and took care of her, and saved her for ten more years of usefulness.She lived to see her youngest son through college, attended his Class
Day, and died a few days after his graduation.The motive power of her life was religious faith—a faith that outgrew
all forms of superstition.Brought up to accept the narrow theology of
her mother’s church, she became a Unitarian.The eldest son was sent
regularly to the Unitarian Sunday School in Washington; but a quarrel
arising in the church, she quietly withdrew, and thereafter assumed the
whole responsibility of training her sons in Christian morals.Subsequently she took a keen interest in the Concord School of
Philosophy; and, adopting her husband’s view, she looked to science for
the regeneration of mankind.In this she was not altogether wise, for
her own experience had proven that the advancement of knowledge depends
upon a divine enthusiasm, which must be fed by a religion of some sort.Fortunately, she was possessed of a poetic soul, and she never lost
religious feeling.The following poem illustrates very well the faith of her later life:

                              TO SCIENCE.I.

         Friend of our race, O Science, strong and wise!Though thou wast scorned and wronged and sorely tried,
         Bound and imprisoned, racked and crucified,
         Thou dost in life invulnerable rise
         The glorious leader ’gainst our enemies.Thou art Truth’s champion for the domain wide
         Ye twain shall conquer fighting side by side.Thus thou art strong, and able thou to cope
         With all thy enemies that yet remain.They fly already from the open plain,
         And climb, hard-pressed, far up the rugged <DW72>.John travelled to the hallway.We hear thy bugle sound o’er land and sea
         And know that victory abides with thee.Because thou’st conquered all _one_ little world
           Thou never like the ancient king dost weep,
           But like the brave Ulysses, on the deep
           Dost launch thy bark, and, all its sails unfurled,
           Dost search for new worlds which may lie impearled
           By happy islands where the billows sleep;
           Or into sunless seas dost fearless sweep,
           Braving the tempest which is round thee hurled;
           Or, bolder still, mounting where far stars shine,
           From conquest unto conquest thou dost rise
           And hold’st dominion over realms divine,
           Where, clear defined unto thy piercing eyes,
           And fairer than Faith’s yearnful heart did ween
           Stretches the vastness of the great Unseen.E’en where thy sight doth fail thou givest not o’er,
          But still “beyond the red” thy spectraphone
          The ray invisible transforms to tone,
          Thus winning from the silence more and more;
          Wherein thou buildest new worlds from shore to shore
          With hills perpetual and with mountains lone;
          To music moving pond’rous stone on stone
          As unto Orpheus’ lyre they moved of yore.Beyond the farthest sweep of farthest sun,
          Beyond the music of the sounding spheres
          Which chant the measures of the months and years,
          Toward realms that e’en to daring Thought are new
          Still let thy flying feet unwearied run.let her not deem thee foe,
           Though thou dost drive her from the Paradise
           To which she clings with backward turning eyes,
           Thou art her angel still, and biddest her go
           To wider lands where the great rivers flow,
           And broad and green many a valley lies,
           Where high and grand th’ eternal mountains rise,
           And oceans fathomless surge to and fro.Thus thou dost teach her that God’s true and real,
           Fairer and grander than her dreams _must_ be;
           Till she shall leave the realm of the Ideal
           To follow Truth throughout the world with thee,
           Through earth and sea and up beyond the sun
           Until the mystery of God is won.Whatever the literary defects, these are noble sonnets.But I had rather
take my chances in a good Unitarian church than try to nourish the soul
with such Platonic love of God.She disliked the Unitarian habit of
clinging to church traditions and ancient forms of worship; but better
these than the materialism of a scientific age.She was absolutely loyal to truth, not
guilty of that shuffling attitude of modern theologians who have
outgrown the superstition of Old Testament only to cling more
tenaciously to the superstition of the New.In the Concord School of
Philosophy, and later in her studies as a member of the Ladies’
Historical Society of Washington, she was searching for the new faith
that should fulfil the old.It might be of interest here to introduce
selections from some of her Historical Society essays, into the
composition of which she entered with great earnestness.Written toward
the close of life, they still retain the freshness and unspoiled
enthusiasm of youth.One specimen must suffice:

    In thinking of Galileo, and the office of the telescope, which is to
    give us increase of light, and of the increasing power of the larger
    and larger lenses, which widens our horizon to infinity, this
    constantly recurring thought comes to me: how shall we grow into the
    immensity that is opening before us?The principle of light pervades
    all space—it travels from star to star and makes known to us all
    objects on earth and in heaven.The great ether throbs and thrills
    with its burden to the remotest star as with a joy.But there is
    also an all-pervading force, so subtle that we know not yet how it
    passes through the illimitable space.But before it all worlds fall
    into divine order and harmony.It imparts the
    power of one to all, and gathers from all for the one.What in the
    soul answers to these two principles is, first, also light or
    knowledge, by which all things are unveiled; the other which answers
    to gravitation, and before which all shall come into proper
    relations, and into the heavenly harmony, and by which we shall fill
    the heavens with ourselves, and ourselves with heaven, is love.But after all, Angeline Hall gave
herself to duty and not to philosophy—to the plain, monotonous work of
home and neighborhood.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she
supplied with her own hands the various family wants—cooked with great
skill, canned abundance of fruit for winter, and supplied the table from
day to day with plain, wholesome food.Would that she might have taught
Bostonians to bake beans!If they would try her method, they would
discover that a mutton bone is an excellent substitute for pork.Pork
and lard she banished from her kitchen.Beef suet is, indeed, much
cleaner.The chief article of diet was meat, for Mrs.Hall was no
vegetarian, and the Georgetown markets supplied the best of Virginia
beef and mutton.Like the virtuous woman of Scripture, she provided the
family with warm clothing, and kept it in repair.A large part of her
life was literally spent in mending clothes.She never relaxed the rigid
economy of Cambridge days.She commonly needed but one servant, for she
worked with her own hands and taught her sons to help her.The house was
always substantially clean from roof to cellar.Nowhere on the whole premises was a bad smell tolerated.While family wants were scrupulously attended to, she stretched forth a
hand to the poor.The Civil War filled Washington with <DW64>s, and for
several winters Mrs.In
1872 she was “Directress” of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth wards; and
for a long time she was a member of a benevolent society in Georgetown,
having charge of a section of the city near her residence.For the last
fourteen years of her life, she visited the Home for Destitute <DW52>
Women and Children in north Washington.Her poor <DW52> neighbors
regarded her with much esteem.She listened to their stories of
distress, comforted them, advised them.The aged she admitted to her
warm kitchen; and they went away, victuals in their baskets or coins in
their hands, with the sense of having a friend in Mrs.Uncle
Louis, said to be one hundred and fourteen years old, rewarded her with
a grape-vine, which was planted by the dining room window.And “the
Uncle Louis grape” was the best in the garden.At the close of the Civil War she even undertook to redeem two fallen
Irish women by taking them into her house to work.But their appetite
for whiskey was too strong, and they would steal butter, barter it for
liquor, and come home drunk.On one occasion one of these women took
little Asaph along to visit the saloon; and there his mother found him,
with the servant standing by joking with rough men, her dress in shreds.Hall had no time or strength for such charitable enterprises, and
soon abandoned them.She was saved from most of the follies of
philanthropy by the good sense of her husband, whom she rewarded with
the devotion of a faithful wife.His studies and researches, almost from
the first, were much too deep for her entire comprehension, but she was
always enthusiastic about his work.In the introduction to his
“_Observations and Orbits of the Satellites of Mars_,” Professor Hall
chivalrously says:

    In the spring of 1877, the approaching favorable opposition of the
    planet Mars attracted my attention, and the idea occurred to me of
    making a careful search with our large Clark refractor for a
    satellite of this planet.An examination of the literature of the
    planet showed, however, such a mass of observations of various
    kinds, made by the most experienced and skillful astronomers that
    the chance of finding a satellite appeared to be very slight, so
    that I might have abandoned the search had it not been for the
    encouragement of my wife.Each night she sent her
husband to the observatory supplied with a nourishing lunch, and each
night she awaited developments with eager interest.I can well remember
the excitement at home.There was a great secret in the house, and all
the members of the family were drawn more closely together by mutual
confidence.The moral and intellectual training of her sons has already been
referred to.Summer vacations were often spent with her sisters in
Rodman, N.Y.Her mother, who reached the age of eighty years, died in
the summer of 1878, when Mrs.Hall became the head of the Stickney
family.Her sisters Mary and Elmina were childless.Ruth had six
children, in whose welfare their Aunt Angeline took a lively interest.The three girls each spent a winter with her in Washington, and when, in
the summer of 1881, Nellie was seized with a fatal illness, Aunt
Angeline was present to care for her.Now and then Charlotte Ingalls,
who had prospered in Wisconsin, would come on from the West, and the
Stickney sisters would all be together.The last reunion occurred in the
summer of 1891, a year previous to Angeline’s death.Daniel went to the bedroom.It was a goodly
sight to see the sisters in one wagon, near the old home place; and
when, at Elmina’s house, Angeline was bustling about attending to the
needs of the united family, it was good to hear Charlotte exclaim, “Take
care, old lady!” She was thirteen years older than Angeline, and seemed
almost to belong to an earlier generation.She remembered her father
well, and had no doubt acquired from him some of the ancient New
Hampshire customs lost to her younger sisters.Certainly her
exclamations of “Fiddlesticks,” and “Witch-cats,” were quaint and
picturesque.But it was Angeline who was really best versed in the family history.She had made a study of it, in all its branches, and could trace her
descent from at least eleven worthy Englishmen, most of whom arrived in
New England before 1650.She made excursions to various points in New
England in search of relatives.At Belchertown, Mass., in 1884, she
found her grandfather Cook’s first cousin, Mr.He was then
one hundred years old, and remembered how in boyhood he used to go
skating with Elisha Cook.How brief the history of America in the presence of such a man!I
remember seeing an old New Englander, as late as 1900, who as a boy of
eleven years had seen General Lafayette.It was a treat to hear him
describe the courteous Frenchman, slight of stature, bent with age, but
active and polite enough to alight from the stage-coach to shake hands
with the people assembled to welcome him in the little village of
Charlton, Mass.At the close of life she longed to
visit Europe, but death intervened, and her days were spent in her
native country.She passed two summers in the mountains of Virginia.In
1878, with her little son Percival, she accompanied her husband to
Colorado, to observe the total eclipse of the sun.Three years before
they had taken the whole family to visit her sister Charlotte’s people
in Wisconsin.It was through her family loyalty that she acquired the Adirondack
habit.In the summer of 1882, after the severe sickness of the preceding
winter, she was staying with a cousin’s son, a country doctor, in
Washington County, N.Y.He proposed an outing in the invigorating air of
the Adirondacks.And so, with her three youngest sons and the doctor’s
family, she drove to Indian Lake, and camped there about a week.Her
improvement was so marked that the next summer, accompanied by three
sons and her sister Ruth, she drove into the wilderness from the West,
camping a few days in a log cabin by the side of Piseco Lake.In 1885,
setting out from Rodman again, she drove four hundred miles, passing
north of the mountains to Paul Smith’s, and thence to Saranac Lake
village, John Brown’s farm, Keene Valley, and Lake George, and returning
by way of the Mohawk Valley.In 1888 she camped with the three youngest
sons on Lower Saranac, and in 1890 she spent July and August at the
summer school of Thomas Davidson, on the side of Mt.One day
I escorted her and her friend Miss Sarah Waitt to the top of the
mountain, four or five miles distant, and we spent the night on the
summit before a blazing camp-fire.Two years later she was planning
another Adirondack trip when death overtook her—at the house of her
friend Mrs.Berrien, at North Andover, Mass., July 3, 1892.Her poem “Heracles,” written towards the close of her career, fittingly
describes her own herculean labors:

                               HERACLES.I.

           Genius of labor, mighty Heracles!Though bound by fate to do another’s will,
           Not basely, as a slave, dost thou fulfil
           The appointed task.The eye of God to please
           Thou seekest, and man to bless, and not thy ease.So to thy wearying toil thou addest still
           New labors, to redeem some soul from ill,
           Performing all thy generous mind conceives.From the sea-monster’s jaws thy arm did free,
           And from her chains, the fair Hesione.And when Alcestis, who her lord to save,
