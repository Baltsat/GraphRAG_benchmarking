He had
the figures at his tongue’s end, and when he finished with a spirited
sentence about being proud of his native town, and about birds fouling
their own nests, it looked as if he had the sense of the little
assemblage with him.Reuben Tracy found it somewhat difficult to reply to an unexpected
attack of this nature.He was forced to admit the truth of everything
his critic had said, and then to attempt once more to show why
these things were not enough.Father Chance, the Catholic priest, a
broad-shouldered, athletic young man, who preached very commonplace
sermons but did an enormous amount of pastoral work, took up the
speaking, and showed that his mind ran mainly upon the importance of
promoting total abstinence.John Fairchild, the editor and owner of
Thessaly’s solitary daily paper, a candid and warmhearted man, whose
heterodoxy on the tariff question gave concern to the business men of
the place, but whose journal was honest and popular, next explained what
his views were, and succeeded in precipitating, by some chance remark,
a long, rambling, and irrelevant debate on the merits of protection
and the proper relations between capital and labor.To illustrate his
position on these subjects, and on the general question of Thessaly’s
condition, Mr.Burdick, the cashier of the Dearborn County Bank, next
related how he was originally opposed to the Bland Silver bill, and
detailed the mental processes by which his opinion had finally become
reversed.Matthew’s, a mildly
paternal gentleman, who seemed chiefly occupied by the thought that he
was in the same room with a Catholic priest, tentatively suggested a
bazaar, with ladies and the wives of workingmen mingled together on the
committee, and smiled and coughed confusedly when this idea was received
in absolute silence.Lester, a young physician who had moved into the village only
a few years before, but was already its leading medical authority, who
broke this silence by saying, with a glance which, slowly circling the
room, finally rested on Reuben Tracy: “All this does not help us.Our
views on all sorts of matters are interesting, no doubt, but they
are not vital just now.The question is not so much why you propose
something, but what do you propose?”

The answer came before the person addressed had arranged his words,
and it came from Horace Boyce.This young gentleman had, with a
self-restraint which he himself was most surprised at, taken no part in
the previous conversation.“I think this is the idea,” he said now, pulling his chair forward
into the edge of the open space under the light, and speaking with easy
distinctness and fluency.“It will be time enough to determine just what
we will do when we have put ourselves in the position to act together
upon what we may decide to do.We are all proud and fond of our village;
we are at one in our desire to serve and advance its interests.That is
a platform broad enough, and yet specific enough, for us to start
upon.Let us accept it as a beginning, and form an association, club,
society--whatever it may be called--with this primary purpose in view:
to get together in one body the gentlemen who represent what is most
enlightened, most public-spirited, and at once most progressive and most
conservative in Thessaly.All that we need at first is the skeleton
of an organization, the most important feature of which would be the
committee on membership.Much depends upon getting the right kind of men
interested in the matter.Let the objects and work of this organization
unfold and develop naturally and by degrees.It may take the form of
a mechanics’ institute, a library, a gymnasium, a system of
coffee-taverns, a lecture course With elevating popular exhibitions;
and so I might go on, enumerating all the admirable things which similar
bodies have inaugurated in other villages, both here and in Europe.I have made these matters, both at home and abroad, a subject of
considerable observation; I am enthusiastic over the idea of setting
some such machinery in motion here, and I am perfectly confident, once
it is started, that the leading men of Thessaly will know how to make
it produce results second to none in the whole worldwide field of
philanthropic endeavor.”

When young Mr.Boyce had finished, there was a moment’s hush.Then
Reuben Tracy began to say that this expressed what he had in mind; but,
before he had the words out, the match manufacturer exclaimed:

“Whatever kind of organization we have, it will need a president, and I
move that Mr.Horace Boyce be elected to that place.”

Two or three people in the shadows behind clapped their hands.Horace
protested that it was premature, irregular, that he was too young,
etc.; but the match-maker was persistent, and on a vote there was no
opposition.Turner ceased smiling for a moment or two while
this was going on, and twirled his thumbs nervously; but nobody paid
any attention to him, and soon his face lightened again as his name was
placed just before that of Father Chance on the general committee.Once started, the work of organization went forward briskly.It was
decided at first to call the organization the “Thessaly Reform Club,”
 but two manufacturers suggested that this was only one remove from
styling it a Cobden Club outright, and so the name was altered to
“Thessaly Citizens’ Club,” and all professed themselves pleased.When
the question of a treasurer came up, Reuben Tracy’s name was mentioned,
but some one asked if it would look just the thing to have the two
principal officers in one firm, and so the match-maker consented to take
the office instead.Even the committee on by-laws would have been made
up without Reuben had not Horace interfered; then, upon John Fairchild’s
motion, he was made the chairman of that committee, while Fairchild
himself was appointed secretary.When the meeting had broken up, and the men were putting on their
overcoats and lighting fresh cigars, Dr.Lester took the opportunity of
saying in an undertone to Reuben; “Well, what do you think of it?”

“It seems to have taken shape very nicely.Don’t you think so?”

“Hm-m!There’s a good deal of Boyce in it so far, and damned little
Tracy!”

Reuben laughed.“Oh, don’t be disturbed about that.He’s the best man
for the place.He’s studied all these things in Europe--the cooperative
institutes in the English industrial towns, and so on; and he’ll put his
whole soul into making this a success.”

The doctor sniffed audibly at this, but offered no further remark.Later
on, however, when he was walking along in the crisp moonlight with John
Fairchild, he unburdened his mind.“It was positively sickening,” he growled, biting his cigar angrily, “to
see the way that young cub of a Boyce foisted himself upon the concern.I’d bet any money he put up the whole thing with Jones.They nominated
each other for president and treasurer--didn’t you notice that?”

“Yes, I noticed it,” replied Fairchild, with something between a sigh
and a groan.After a moment he added: “Do you know, I’m afraid Rube will
find himself in a hole with that young man, before he gets through with
him.It may sound funny to you, but I’m deucedly nervous about it.I’d
rather see a hundred Boyces broiled alive than have harm come to so much
as Tracy’s little finger.”

“What could have ailed him to go in blindfold like that into the
partnership?He knew absolutely nothing of the fellow.”

“I’ve told him a hundred times, he’s got no more notion of reading
characters than a mulley cow.Anybody can go up to him and wheedle his
coat off his back, if he knows the first rudiments of the confidence
game.It seems, in this special instance, that he took a fancy to Boyce
because he saw him give two turkeys to old Ben Lawton, who’d lost his
money at a turkey-shoot and got no birds.He thought it was generous and
noble and all that.So far as I can make out, that was his only reason.”

Dr.Lester stopped short and looked at his companion.Daniel moved to the office.Then he burst out
in a loud, shrill laugh, which renewed itself in intermittent gurgles
of merriment so many times that Fairchild finally found them monotonous,
and interposed a question:

“There’s something besides fun in all this, Lester.What is it?”

“It isn’t professional to tell, my dear fellow, but there _is_
something--you’re right--and we are Reuben’s friends against all the
world; and this is what I laughed at.”

Then in a low tone, as if even the white flaring moon and the jewelled
stars in the cold sky had ears, he told his secret to his friend--a
secret involving one small human being of whose very existence Mr.“The girl has come back here to Thessaly, you know,” concluded the
doctor.Then after a moment’s thought he said:

“It’s too bad we changed the name of the organization.That cuss _ought_
to be the president of a Reform Club!”




CHAPTER XIII.-- THE DAUGHTER OF THE MILLIONS.A YOUNG woman who is in her twenty-third year, who is possessed of
bright wits, perfect health, great personal beauty, and a fortune
of nearly a million of dollars in her own right, and who moreover is
untroubled by a disquieting preference for any single individual in the
whole army of males, ought not, by all the rules, to be unhappy.Kate Minster defied the rules, and moped.Not infrequently she found
herself in the mood to think, “Now I realize how rich girls must feel
when they commit themselves to entering a convent.” Oftener still,
perhaps, she caught her tongue framing impatient or even petulant
answers to her mother, to her mother’s friends, to everybody, in truth,
save her sister Ethel.The conviction that she was bad-tempered had
begun to enter her mind as it were without rapping, and with the air of
a familiar.By dint of repeated searchings in the mirror, she had almost
discovered a shadow between her brows which would presently develop into
a wrinkle, and notify to the whole world her innate vixenish tendencies.And indeed, with all this brooding which grew upon her, it was something
of a triumph for youth that the wrinkle had still failed to come.It is said that even queens yawn sometimes, when nobody is looking.But
at least they have work to do, such as it is, and grow tired.Miss
Kate had no work of any sort, and was utterly wearied.The vacuity of
existence oppressed her with formless fatigue, like a nightmare.The mischief was that all of his own tremendous energy which Stephen
Minster had transmitted to the generation following him was concentrated
in this eldest child of his.The son had been a lightheaded weakling.The other daughter, Ethel, was as fragile and tenderly delicate as a
Christmas rose.But Kate had always been the strong one of the family,
physically vigorous, restive under unintelligent discipline, rebellious
to teachers she disliked, and proudly confident of her position, her
ability, and the value of her plans and actions.She had loved her
father passionately, and never ceased to mourn that, favorite of his
though she was, business cares had robbed her of so much of his company
for years before his death.As a girl she had dreamed her dreams--bold,
sweepingly ambitious visions they were; but this father of whom she was
so proud, this powerful father who had so manfully subdued things under
his feet, was always the one who was to encompass their fulfilment.When he died, her aêrial castles at a stroke tumbled into chaos.All her
plans and aspirations had turned upon him as their pivot.Without him
all was disorganized, shapeless, incomprehensible.Nearly three years had gone by, and still matters about her and
possibilities before her alike refused to take on definite outlines.She still did not do today the things she wanted to do, yet felt as
powerless as ever to tell what her purposes for to-morrow clearly were.All the conditions for achievement were hers to command, and there was
nothing to achieve.There was something alike grotesque and pathetic in the record of her
attempts to find work.She had gathered at considerable expense all
the books and data she could learn about relating to the life and
surroundings of Lady Arabella Stuart, and had started to write what
should be the authoritative work on the subject, only to discover that
she did not know how to make a book, and would not want to make that
kind of a book if she had known how.She had begun collections of
orchids, of coins, of engraved portraits, of cameos, and, at varying
times, of kindred other trifles, and then on some gray and rainy morning
had found herself impelled to turn upon each of these in its order with
disgust and wrath.For music she unluckily had no talent, and a very
exhaustive and costly outfit of materials for a painter’s studio amused
her for less than one short month.She had a considerable feeling for
color, but was too impatient to work laboriously at the effort to learn
to draw; and so she hated her pictures while they were being painted,
and laughed scornfully at them afterward.She wrote three or four short
stories, full of the passions she had read about, and was chagrined
to get them back from a whole group of polite but implacable editors.Embroidery she detested, and gardening makes one’s back ache.Miss Minster was perfectly aware that other young ladies, similarly
situated, got on very well indeed, without ever fluttering so much as
a feather for a flight toward the ether beyond their own personal
atmosphere; but she did not clearly comprehend what it was that they did
like.She had seen something of their daily life--perhaps more of their
amusements than of their occupations--and it was not wholly intelligible
to her.They seemed able to extract entertainment from a host of things
which were to her almost uninteresting.During her few visits to New
York, Newport, and Saratoga, for the most part made during her father’s
lifetime, people had been extremely kind to her, and had done their best
to make her feel that there existed for her, ready made, a very notable
social position.She had been invited to more dinners than there were
days at her disposal in which to eat them; she had been called with
something like public acclamation the belle of sundry theatre parties;
her appearance and her clothes had been canvassed with distinctly
overfree flattery in one or two newspapers; she had danced a little,
made a number of calls, suffered more than was usual from headaches, and
yawned a great deal.The women whom she met all seemed to take it for
granted that she was in the seventh heaven of enjoyment; and the young
men with huge expanses of shirt front, who sprang up everywhere
in indefinite profusion about her, like the clumps of white
double-hollyhocks in her garden at home, were evidently altogether
sincere in their desire to please her.But the women all received the
next comer with precisely the smile they gave her; and the young men,
aside from their eagerness to devise and provide diversions for her, and
the obvious honesty of their liking for her, were deadly commonplace.She was always glad when it was time to return to Thessaly.Yet in this same village she was practically secluded from the society
of her own generation.There were not a few excellent families in
Thessaly who were on calling and even dining terms with the Minsters,
but there had never been many children in these purely native
households, and now most of the grown-up sons had gone to seek fortune
in the great cities, and most of the girls had married either men who
lived elsewhere or men who did not quite come within the Minsters’
social pale.It was a wearisome and vexatious thing, she said to herself very often,
this barrier of the millions beyond which she must not even let her
fancy float, and which encompassed her solitude like a prison wall.Often, too, she approached the point of meditating revolt, but only to
realize with a fresh sigh that the thought was hopeless.If the people of her own class, even with the advantages of amiable
manners, cleanliness, sophisticated speech, and refined surroundings,
failed to interest her, it was certain enough that the others would be
even less tolerable.And she for whose own protection these impalpable
defences against unpleasant people, adventurers, fortune-hunters, and
the like, had all been reared, surely she ought to be the last in the
world to wish them levelled.And then she would see, of course, that she
did not wish this; yet, all the same, it was very, very dull!There must be whole troops of good folk somewhere whom she could know
with pleasure and gain--nice women who would like her for herself, and
clever men who would think it worth their while to be genuine with her,
and would compliment her intelligence by revealing to it those high
thoughts, phrased in glowing language, of which the master sex at its
best is reputed to be capable--if only they would come in her way.But
there were no signs betokening their advent, and she did not know where
to look for them, and could not have sallied forth in the quest if she
had known; and oh, but this was a weary world, and riches were mere
useless rubbish, and life was a mistake!Patient, soft-eyed Ethel was the one to whom such of these repinings
against existence as found their way into speech were customarily
addressed.She was sympathetic enough, but hers was a temperament placid
as it was tender, and Kate could do everything else save strike out
sparks from it when her mood was for a conflagration.As for the mother,
she knew in a general way that Kate had a complaining and unsatisfied
disposition, and had always had it, and accepted the fact much as she
did that of Ethel’s poor health--as something which could not be helped,
and therefore need not be worried about.Hence, she was but rarely made
the confidante of her elder daughter’s feelings, but Kate occasionally
railed at destiny in the hearing of Miss Tabitha Wilcox, whom she liked
sometimes much more than at others, but always enough to have a certain
satisfaction in mildly bullying her.“You know as well as I do, Tabitha,” said Miss Kate one afternoon in
January, rising from the couch where she had been lounging in sheer
idleness, and walking over to the window with slow indolence of gait,
“that our whole life here is simply ridiculous.We girls have lived here
in Thessaly ever since we were little children, and if we left the place
for good to-morrow, positively there would not be a single personal tie
to be broken.So far as making friends go, we might as well have lived
in the moon, where I believe it is settled that there are no people at
all.And pray what is there in life worth having but friends--I mean
real friends?”

“I had supposed,” began the little lady with the iron-gray curls, who
sat primly beside the window at one corner of the great drawing-room--“I
had supposed that _I_ would be reckoned among--”

“Oh, don’t take me up in that way, Tabitha!Of course, I reckoned
you--you know that well enough--that is, you count and you don’t count,
for you are like one of us.Besides, I was thinking of people of my own
age.There are some few nice girls here, but they are never frank with
me as they are among themselves; I suppose because they are always
thinking that I am rich.Say ten, and
I always think I can see dollar-marks shining in their eyes whenever I
look at them.Certainly they have nothing else inside their heads that
would shine.”

“I am sure you exaggerate their--”

“Oh, no, Tabitha!Don’t be sure of any such thing.They couldn’t be
exaggerated; they wouldn’t bear it.Candidly now, can you think of
a single man in the place whom you would like to hear mentioned as
entertaining the shadow of a hope that some time he might be--what
shall I say?--allowed to cherish the possibility of becoming the--the
son-in-law of my mother?”

“I didn’t think your mind ran on such--”

“And it doesn’t,” broke in the girl, “not in the least, I assure you.I
put it in that way merely to show you what I mean.You can’t associate
on terms of equality with people who would almost be put out of the
house if they ventured to dream of asking you to marry them.Don’t you see what I mean?That is why I say we have no friends here; money brings us
nothing that is of value; this isn’t like a home at all.”

“Why, and everybody is talking of how much Thessaly has improved of late
years.They say the Bidwells,
who already talk of building a second factory for their button
business--they say they moved in very good society indeed at Troy.Bid-well twice at church sociables--the stout lady, you know,
with the false front.They seem quite a knowable family.”

Kate did not reply, but drummed on the window-pane and watched the
fierce quarrels of some English sparrows flitting about on the frozen
snow outside.Miss Tabitha went on with more animation than sequence:

“Of course you’ve heard of the club they’re going to start, or have
started; they call it the Thessaly Citizens’ Club.”

“Who?the Bidwells?”

“Oh, dear, no!The young men of the village--or I suppose it will soon
be a city now.They tell all sorts of stories about what this club
is going to do; reform the whole town, if you believe them.I always
understood a club was for men to drink and play cards and sit up to all
hours in, but it seems this is to be different.At any rate, several
clergymen, Dr.Turner among them, have joined it, and Horace Boyce was
elected president.”

The sparrows had disappeared, but Kate made no answer, and musingly kept
her eyes fastened on the snow where the disagreeable birds had been.“Now, _there’s_ a young man,” said Miss Tabitha, after a pause.Still no
comment came from the window, and so the elder maiden drifted forward:

“It’s all Horace Boyce now.Everybody
is saying he will soon be our leading man.They tell me that he speaks
beautifully--in public, I mean--and he is so good-looking and so bright;
they all expect he’ll make quite a mark when court sits next month.I
suppose hell throw his partner altogether into the shade; everybody at
least seems to think so.And Reuben Tracy had _such_ a chance--once.”

The tall, dark girl at the window still did not turn, but she took up
the conversation with an accent of interest.“_Had_ a chance--what do you mean?I’ve never heard a word against him,
except that idle story you told here once.”

“Idle or not, Kate, you can’t deny that the girl is here.”

Kate laughed, in scornful amusement.“No; and so winter is here, and you
are here, and the snowbirds are here, and all the rest of it.But what
does that go to show?”

“And that reminds me,” exclaimed Tabitha, leaning forward in her chair
with added eagerness--“now, what _do_ you think?”

“The processes by which you are reminded of things, Tabitha, are not fit
subjects for light and frivolous brains like mine.”

“You laugh; but you really never _could_ guess it in all your born days.That Lawton girl--she’s actually a tenant of mine; or, that is, she
rented from another party, but she’s in _my house!_ You can just fancy
what a state I was in when I heard of it.”

“How do you mean?What house?”

“You know those places of mine on Bridge Street--rickety old houses
they’re getting to be now, though I must say they’ve stood much better
than some built years and years after my father put them up, for he was
the most thorough man about such things you ever saw, and as old Major
Schoonmaker once said of him, he--”

“Yes, but what about that--that girl?”

Tabitha returned to her subject without impatience.All her life she had
been accustomed to being pulled up and warned from rambling, and if her
hearers neglected to do this the responsibility for the omission was
their own.“Well, you know the one-story-and-attic place, painted brown, and
flat-roofed, just beyond where the Truemans live.It seems as if I had
had more than forty tenants for that place.Everybody that can’t keep
a store anywhere, and make a living, seems to hit upon that identical
building to fail in.Old Ikey Peters was the last; he started a sort of
fish store, along with peanuts and toys and root beer, and he came to me
a month or two back and said it was no go; he couldn’t pay the rent
any more, and he’d got a job as night watchman: so if he found another
tenant, might he turn it over to him until the first of May, when his
year would be up?and I said, ‘Yes, if it isn’t for a saloon.’ And next
I heard he had rented the place to a woman who had come from Tecumseh to
start a milliner’s shop.I went past there a few days afterward, and
I saw Ben Lawton fooling around inside with a jack-plane, fixing up a
table; but even then I hadn’t a suspicion in the world.It must have
been a week later that I went by again, and there I saw the sign over
the door, ‘J.Lawton--Millinery;’ and would you believe it, even _then_
I didn’t dream of what was up!So in walks I, to say ‘how do you do,’
and lo and behold!there was Ben Lawton’s eldest girl running the place,
and quite as much at home as I was.You could have knocked me over with
a feather!”

“Quite appropriately, in a milliner’s shop, too,” said Kate, who had
taken a chair opposite to Tabitha’s and seemed really interested in her
narrative.“Well, there she was, anyway.”

“And what happened next?Did you faint or run away, or what?”

“Oh, she was quite civil, I must say.She recognized me--she used to see
me at my sister’s when she worked there--and asked me to sit down, and
explained that she hadn’t got entirely settled yet.Yes, I must admit
that she was polite enough.”

“How tiresome of her!Now, if she had thrown boiling water on you, or
even made faces at you, it would have been something like.And _did_ you sit down, Tabitha?”

“I don’t see how I could have done otherwise.And she really has a great
deal of taste in her work.She saw in a minute what’s been the trouble
with my bonnets--you know I always told you there was something--they
were not high enough in front.Don’t you think yourself, now, that this
is an improvement?”

Miss Wilcox lifted her chin, and turned her head slowly around for
inspection; but, instead of the praise which was expected, there came a
merry outburst of laughter.“And you really bought a bonnet of her!” Kate laughed again at the
thought, and then, with a sudden impulse, rose from her chair, glided
swiftly to where Tabitha sat, and kissed her.“You softhearted,
ridiculous, sweet old thing!” she said, beaming at her, and smoothing
the old maid’s cheek in affectionate patronage.Tabitha smiled with pleasure at this rare caress, and preened her head
and thin shoulders with a bird-like motion.But then the serious side
of her experience loomed once more before her, and the smile vanished as
swiftly as it had come.“She’s not living with her father, you know.She and one of her
half-sisters have had the back rooms rigged up to live in, and there
they are by themselves.I guess she saw by my face that I didn’t think
much of _that_ part of the business.Still, thank goodness, it’s only
till the first of May!”

“Shall you turn them out then, Tabitha?” Kate spoke seriously now.“The place has always been respectable, Kate, even if it is tumble-down.To be sure, I did hear certain stories about the family of the man who
sold non-explosive oil there two years ago, and his wife frizzed her
hair in a way that went against my grain, I must admit; but it would
never do to have a scandal about one of my houses, not even _that_ one!”

“I know nothing about these people, of course,” said Kate, slowly and
thoughtfully; “but it seems to me, to speak candidly, Tabitha, that you
are the only one who is making what you call a scandal.No--wait; let me
finish.In some curious way the thought of this girl has kept itself
in my head--perhaps it was because she came back here on the same train
with me, or something else equally trivial.Perhaps she is as bad a
character as you seem to think, but it may also be that she only wants a
little help to be a good girl and to make an honest living for herself.To me, her starting a shop like that here in her native village seems to
show that she wants to work.”

“Why, Kate, everybody knows her character.There’s no secret in the
world about _that_.”

“But suppose I am right about her present wish.Suppose that she does
truly want to rehabilitate herself.Would you like to have it on your
conscience that you put so much as a straw in her way, let alone turned
her out of the little home she has made for herself?I know you better
than that, Tabitha: you couldn’t bring yourself to do it.You may do her a great deal of injury by talking about
her, as, for example, you have been talking to me here to-day.I am
going to ask you a favor, a real personal favor.I want you to promise
me not to mention that girl’s name again to a living soul until--when
shall I say?--until the first of May; and if anybody else mentions it,
to say nothing at all.Now, will you promise that?”

“Of course, if you wish it, but I assure you there wasn’t the slightest
doubt in the world.”

“That I don’t care about.Why should we women be so brutal to each
other?You and I had good homes, good fathers, and never knew what it
was to want for anything, or to fight single-handed against the world.How can we tell what might have crushed and overwhelmed us if we had
been really down in the thick of the battle, instead of watching it from
a private box up here?No: give the girl a chance, and remember your
promise.”

“Come to think of it, she has been to church twice now, two Sundays
running.Turner spoke to her in the vestibule, seeing that she
was a stranger and neatly dressed, and didn’t dream who she was; and
she told me she was never so mortified in her life as when she found out
afterward.A clergyman’s wife has to be so particular, you know.”

“Yes,” Kate answered, absently.Her heart was full of bitter and
sardonic things to say about Mrs.Turner and her conceptions of the
duties of a pastor’s helpmeet, but she withheld them because they might
grieve Tabitha, and then was amazed at herself for being so considerate,
and then fell to wondering whether she, too, was bitten by this
Pharisaical spirit, and so started as out of a dream when Tabitha rose
and said she must go and see Mrs.“Remember your promise,” Kate said, with a little smile and another
caress.She had not been so affectionate before in a long, long time,
and the old maid mused flightily on this unwonted softness as she found
her way up-stairs.The girl returned to the window and looked out once more upon the smooth
white crust which, broken only by half-buried dwarf firs, stretched
across the wide lawn.When at last she wearied of the prospect and her
thoughts, and turned to join the family on the floor above, she confided
these words aloud to the solitude of the big room:

“I almost wish I could start a milliner’s shop myself.”

The depreciatory reflection that she had never discovered in all these
years what was wrong with Tabitha’s bonnets rose with comical suddenness
in her mind, and she laughed as she opened the door.CHAPTER XIV.--HORACE EMBARKS UPON THE ADVENTURE.Boyce was spared the trouble of going to Florida, and
relieved from the embarrassment of inventing lies to his partner
about the trip, which was even more welcome.Only a few days after the
interview with Mrs.Minster, news came of the unexpected death of Lawyer
Clarke, caused by one of those sudden changes of temperature at sunset
which have filled so many churchyards in that sunny clime.His executors
were both resident in Thessaly, and at a word from Mrs.Minster they
turned over to Horace the box containing the documents relating to her
affairs.Only one of these executors, old ’Squire Gedney, expressed
any comment upon Mrs.Minster’s selection, at least in Horace’s hearing.This Gedney was a slovenly and mumbling old man, the leading
characteristics of whose appearance were an unshaven jaw, a general
shininess and disorder of apparel, and a great deal of tobacco-juice.It was still remembered that in his youth he had promised to be an
important figure at the bar and in politics.His failure had been
exceptionally obvious and complete, but for some occult reason Thessaly
had a soft corner in its heart for him, even when his estate bordered
upon the disreputable, and for many years had been in the habit of
electing him to be one of its justices of the peace.The functions of
this office he avowedly employed in the manner best calculated to insure
the livelihood which his fellow-citizens expected him to get out of it.His principal judicial maxim was never to find a verdict against the
party to a suit who was least liable to pay him his costs.If justice
could be made to fit with this rule, so much the better for justice.But, in any event, the ’squire must look out primarily for his costs.He made no concealment of this theory and practice; and while some
citizens who took matters seriously were indignant about it, the great
majority merely laughed and said the old man had got to live somehow,
and voted good-naturedly for him next time.If Calvin Gedney owed much to the amiability and friendly feeling of his
fellow-townsmen, he repaid the debt but poorly in kind.No bitterer or
more caustic tongue than his wagged in all Dearborn County.When he was
in a companiable mood, and stood around in the cigar store and talked
for the delectation of the boys of an evening, the range and scope of
his personal sneers and sarcasms would expand under the influence of
applauding laughter, until no name, be it never so honored, was sacred
from his attack, save always one--that of Minster.There was a popular
understanding that Stephen Minster had once befriended Gedney, and that
that accounted for the exception; but this was rendered difficult of
credence by the fact that so many other men had befriended Gedney, and
yet now served as targets for his most rancorous jeers.Whatever the
reason may have been, however, the ’squire’s affection for the memory
of Stephen Minster, and his almost defiant reverence for the family he
had left behind, were known to all men, and regarded as creditable to
him.Perhaps this was in some way accountable for the fact that the ’squire
remained year after year in old Mr.Clarke’s will as an executor,
long after he had ceased to be regarded as a responsible person by the
village at large, for Mr.Clarke also was devoted to the Minsters.At
all events, he was so named in the will, in conjunction with a non-legal
brother of the deceased, and it was in this capacity that he addressed
some remarks to Mr.Horace Boyce when he handed over to him the Minster
papers.The scene was a small and extremely dirty chamber off the
justice’s court-room, furnished mainly by a squalid sofa-bed, a number
of empty bottles on the bare floor, and a thick overhanging canopy of
cobwebs.“Here they are,” said the ’squire, expectorating indefinitely among
the bottles, “and God help ’em!What it all means beats me.”

“I guess you needn’t worry, Cal,” answered Horace lightly, in the easily
familiar tone which Thessaly always adopted toward its unrespected
magistrate.“You’d better come out and have a drink; then you’ll see
things brighter.”

“Damn your impudence, you young cub!” shouted the ’squire, flaming up
into sudden and inexplicable wrath.“Who are you calling ‘Cal’?By the
Eternal, when I was your age, I’d have as soon bitten off my tongue as
dared call a man of my years by his Christian name!Daniel went to the garden.I can remember your
great-grandfather, the judge, sir.I was admitted before he died; and I
tell you, sir, that if it had been possible for me to venture upon such
a piece of cheek with him, he’d have taken me over his knee, by Gawd!and walloped me before the whole assembled bar of Dearborn County!”

The old man had worked himself up into a feverish reminiscence of his
early stump-speaking days, and he trembled and spluttered over his
concluding words with unwonted excitement.People always did laugh at “Cal” Gedney,
and laugh most when he grew strenuous.“You’d better get the drink first,” he said, putting the box under his
arm, “and _then_ free your mind.”

“I’ll see you food for worms, first!” shouted the ’squire, still
furiously.“You’ve got your papers, and I’ve got my opinion, and that’s
all there is ’twixt you and me.There’s the door that the carpenters
made, and I guess they were thinking of you when they made it.”

“Upon my word, you’re amusing this morning, ’squire,” said Horace,
looking with aroused interest at the vehement justice.“What’s the
matter with you?Come around to the house
and I’ll rig you up in some new ones.”

The ’squire began with a torrent of explosive profanity, framed in
gestures which almost threatened personal violence.All at once he
stopped short, looked vacantly at the floor, and then sat down on his
bed, burying his face in his hands.From the convulsive clinching of his
fingers among the grizzled, unkempt locks of hair, and the heaving of
his chest, Horace feared he was going to have a fit, and, advancing, put
a hand on his shoulder.The ’squire shook it off roughly, and raised his haggard,
deeply-furrowed face.It was a strong-featured countenance still, and
had once been handsome as well, but what it chiefly said to Horace now
was that the old man couldn’t stand many more such nights of it as this
last had evidently been.“Come, ’squire, I didn’t want to annoy you.I’m sorry if I did.”

“You insulted me,” said the old man, with a dignity which quavered into
pathos as he added: “I’ve got so low now, by Gawd, that even you can
insult me!”

Horace smiled at the impracticability of all this.“What the deuce is it
all about, anyway?” he asked.I’ve always
been civil to you, haven’t I?”

“You’re no good,” was the justice’s concise explanation.“I daresay you’re right,” he said,
pleasantly, as one humors a child.“_Now_ will you come out and have a
drink?”

“I’ve not been forty-four years at the bar for nothing--”

“I should think not!Whole generations of barkeepers can testify to
that.”

“I can tell,” went on the old man, ignoring the jest, and rising from
the bed as he spoke; “I can tell when a man’s got an honest face.I
can tell when he means to play fair.And I wouldn’t trust you one inch
farther, Mr.Horace Boyce, than I could throw a bull by the tail.I tell
you that, sir, straight to your teeth.”

Horace, still with the box snugly under his arm, had sauntered out into
the dark and silent courtroom.He turned now, half smiling, and said:

“Third and last call--_do_ you want a drink?”

The old man’s answer was to slam the door in his face with a noise
which rang in reverberating echoes through the desolate hall of justice.*****

The morning had lapsed into afternoon, and succeeding hours had brought
the first ashen tints of dusk into the winter sky, before the young man
completed his examination of the Minster papers.He had taken them to
his own room in his father’s house, sending word to the office that he
had a cold and would not come down that day; and it was behind a locked
door that he had studied the documents which stood for millions.On a
sheet of paper he made certain memoranda from time to time, and now that
the search was ended, he lighted a fresh cigar, and neatly reduced these
to a little tabular statement:

[Illustration: 0196]

When Horace had finished this he felt justified in helping himself
to some brandy and soda.It was the most interesting and important
computation upon which he had ever engaged, and its noble proportions
grew upon him momentarily as he pondered them and sipped his drink.More
than two and a quarter millions lay before his eyes, within reach of his
hand.Was it not almost as if they were his?And of course this did not
represent everything.There was sundry village property that he knew
about; there would be bank accounts, minor investments and so on, quite
probably raising the total to nearly or quite two millions and a half.And he had only put things down at par values.The telegraph stock was
quoted at a trifle less, just now, but if there had been any Minster
Iron-works stock for sale, it would command a heavy premium.The
scattering investments, too, which yielded an average of five per cent.,
must be worth a good deal more than their face.What he didn’t like
about the thing was that big block of Thessaly Manufacturing Company
stock.That seemed to be earning nothing at all; he could find no record
of dividends, or, in truth, any information whatever about it.Where had
he heard about that company before?The name was curiously familiar to
his mind; he had been told something about it--by whom?That was the company of which the
mysterious Judge Wendover was president.Tenney had talked about it;
Tenney had told him that he would hear a good deal about it before long.As these reflections rose in the young man’s mind, the figures which
he had written down on the paper seemed to diminish in size and
significance.It was a queer notion, but he couldn’t help feeling that
the millions had somehow moved themselves farther back, out of his
reach.The thought of these two men--of the gray-eyed, thin-lipped,
abnormally smart Tenney, and of that shadowy New York financier who
shared his secrets--made him nervous.They had a purpose, and he was
more or less linked to it and to them, and Heaven only knew where he
might be dragged in the dark.He finished his glass and resolved that
he would no longer remain in the dark.To-morrow he would see Tenney and
Mrs.Minster and Reuben, and have a clear understanding all around.There came sharp and loud upon his door a peremptory knocking, and
Horace with a swift movement slipped the paper on which he had made the
figures into the box, and noiselessly closed the cover.Then he opened
the door, and discovered before him a man whom for the instant, in the
dim light of the hall, he did not recognize.The man advanced a
step, and then Horace saw that it was--strangely changed and unlike
himself--his father!“I didn’t hear you come in,” said the young man, vaguely confused by the
altered appearance of the General, and trying in some agitation of mind
to define the change and to guess what it portended.“They told me you were here,” said the father, moving lumpishly forward
into the room, and sinking into a chair.“I’m glad of it.I want to talk
to you.”

His voice had suddenly grown muffled, as if with age or utter weariness.His hands lay palm upward and inert on his fat knees, and he buried his
chin in his collar helplessly.The gaze which he fastened opaquely upon
the waste-paper basket, and the posture of his relaxed body, suggested
to Horace a simple explanation.Evidently this was the way his
delightful progenitor looked when he was drunk.“Wouldn’t it be better to go to bed now, and talk afterward?” said the
young man, with asperity.He clearly understood the purport of
the question, and gathered his brows at first in a half-scowl.Then the
humor of the position appealed to him, and he smiled instead--a grim
and terrifying smile which seemed to darken rather than illumine his
purplish face.“Did you think I was drunk, that you should say that?” he asked, with
the ominous smile still on his lips.He added, more slowly, and with
something of his old dignity: “No--I’m merely ruined!”

“It has come, has it?” The young man heard himself saying these words,
but they sounded as if they had issued from other lips than his.He had
schooled himself for a fortnight to realize that his father was actually
insolvent, yet the shock seemed to find him all unprepared.You knew about it?”

“Tenney told me last month that it must come, sooner or later.”

The General offered an invocation as to Mr.Tenney’s present existence
and future state which, solemnly impressive though it was, may not be
set down here.“So I say, too, if you like,” answered Horace, beginning to pace the
room.“But that will hardly help us just now.Tell me just what has
happened.”

“Sit down, then: you make me nervous, tramping about like that.The
villain simply asked me to step into the office for a minute, and then
took out his note-book, cool as a cucumber.‘I thought I’d call your
attention to how things stand between us.’ he said, as if I’d been a
country customer who was behindhand with his paper.Then the scoundrel
calmly went on to say that my interest in the partnership was worth less
than nothing; that I already owed him more than the interest would come
to, if the business were sold out, and that he would like to know what I
proposed to do about it.that’s what he said to me, and I sat
there and listened to him.”

“What did you say?”

“I told him what I thought of him.He hasn’t heard so much straight,
solid truth about himself before since he was weaned, I’ll bet!”

“But what good was that?He isn’t the sort who minds that kind of thing.What did you tell him you would do?”

“Break his infernal skull for him if he ever spoke to me again!”

Horace almost smiled, as he felt how much older he was than this
red-faced, white-haired boy, who could fight and drink and tell funny
stories, world without end, but was powerless to understand business
even to the extent of protecting his interest in a hardware store.But
the tendency to smile was painfully short-lived; the subject was too
serious.“Well, tell _me_, then, what you are going to do!”

“Good God!” broke forth the General, raising his head again.“What _can_
I do!Crawl into a hole and die somewhere, I should think.I don’t see
anything else.But before I do, mark me, I’ll have a few minutes alone
with that scoundrel, in his office, in the street, wherever I can find
him; and if I don’t fix him up so that his own mother won’t know him,
then my name isn’t ‘Vane’ Boyce!”

“Tut-tut,” said the prudent lawyer of the family.“Men don’t die because
they fail in the hardware business, and this isn’t Kentucky.We don’t
thrash our enemies up here in the North.Do you want me to see Tenney?”

“I suppose so--if you can stomach a talk with the whelp.He said
something, too, about talking it over with you, but I was too raving mad
to listen.Have you had any dealings with him?”

“Nothing definite.We’ve discussed one or two little things--in the
air--that is all.”

The General rose and helped himself to some neat brandy from his son’s
_liqueur_-stand.“Well, if you do--you hear me--he’ll singe you clean as
a whistle.By God, he won’t leave so much as a pin-feather on you!”

Horace smiled incredulously.“I rather think I can take care of Mr.Schuyler Tenney,” said he, with a confident front.“I’ll go down and see
him now, if you like, and don’t you worry yourself about it.I daresay
I can straighten it out all right.The best thing you can do is to
say nothing at all about your affairs to anybody.It might complicate
matters if he heard that you had been publicly proclaiming your
intention of beating him into a jelly.I don’t know, but I can fancy
that he might not altogether like that.And, above all things, don’t get
down on your luck.I guess we can keep our heads above water, Tenney or
no Tenney.”

The young man felt that it was distinctly decent of him to thus assume
responsibility for the family, and did not look to see the General take
it so much as a matter of course.But that distinguished soldier had
quite regained his spirits, and smacked his lips over a second glass of
brandy with smiling satisfaction, as if Tenney had already been turned
out of the hardware store, neck and crop.You go ahead, and let him have it from the shoulder.Give
him one for me, while you’re about it,” he said, with his old robust
voice and hearty manner all come back again.The elasticity of this
stout man’s temperament was a source of perpetual wonderment to his
slender son.Yet Horace, too, had much the same singular capacity for shaking off
trouble, and he saw matters in quite a hopeful light as he strode along
down toward Main Street.Clearly Tenney had only meant to frighten the
General.He found his father’s partner in the little office boxed off the store,
and had a long talk with him--a talk prolonged, in fact, until after
business hours.When he reflected upon this conversation during his
homeward journey, he could recall most distinctly that he had told
Tenney everything about the Minsters which the search of the papers
revealed.Somehow, the rest of the talk had not seemed to be very
important.Tenney had laughed lightly when the question of the General
came up, and said: “Oh, you needn’t bother about that.I only wanted him
to know how things stood.He can go on as long as he likes; that is,
of course, if you and I continue to work together.” And Horace had said
that he was much obliged, and would be glad to work with Mr.Tenney--and
really that had been the sum of the whole conversation.Or yes, there had been one other thing.Tenney had said that it would
be best now to tell Reuben Tracy that Mrs.Minster had turned over her
affairs to him--temporarily, at least--but not to discuss them with him
at all, and not to act as if he thought they were of special importance.Horace felt that this could easily be done.Reuben was the least
suspicious man in the world, and the matter might be so stated to him
that he would never give it a second thought.The General received over the supper-table the tidings that no evil
was intended to him, much as his son had expected him to; that is, with
perfectly restored equanimity.He even admitted that Tenney was within
his rights to speak as he did, and that there should be no friction
provoked by any word or act of his.“I don’t like the man, you know,” he said, between mouthfuls, “but it’s
just as well that I should stick by him.He’s skinned me dry, and my
only chance is now to keep friendly with him, in the hope that when he
begins skinning other people he’ll let me make myself good out of the
proceeds.”

This worldly wisdom, emanating from such an unlikely source, surprised
the young man, and he looked up with interest to his father’s face,
red-shining under the lamplight.“I mean what I say,” continued the General, who ate with unfailing gusto
as he talked.“Tenney as much as said that to me himself, awhile ago.”

Horace nodded with comprehension.He had thought the aphorism too
concise and strong for his father’s invention.“And I could guess with my eyes shut how he’s going to do it,” the
elder Boyce went on.“He’s got a lot of the stock of the Thessaly
Manufacturing Company, the one that’s built the rolling mills in
connection with the Minster iron-works, and the rest of the stock is
held in New York; and some fine day the New Yorkers will wake up and
find themselves cleaned out.Tenney’s little ways!”

The General wagged his round head upon its thick neck with complacency
at his superior insight, but Horace finished his supper in silence.He
did not see very far into the millstone yet, but already he guessed that
the stockholders who were to be despoiled lived in Thessaly and not New
York.A strange, amorphous vision of the looting of the millions arose
like a mirage between him and the shaded lamplight, and he looked into
its convolving vortex half in terror, half in trembling fascination.Suddenly he felt himself impelled to say--why he could not tell--“I
might as well speak to you about it.It is my ambition to marry Miss
Kate Minster.I think I shall succeed.”

The General almost upset his chair in his eagerness to rise, lean over
the table, and shake hands with his son.CHAPTER XV.--THE LAWTON GIRL’S WORK.FORTUNATELY Jessica Lawton’s humble little business enterprise began to
bring in returns before her slender store of money was quite exhausted.Even more fortunate, at least in her estimation, was the fact that the
lion’s share of this welcome patronage came from the poor working-girls
of the village.When the venture was a month old, there was nearly
enough work to occupy all her time, and, taking into account the season,
this warranted her in believing that she had succeeded.The result had not come without many anxious days, made bitter alike by
despairing tremors for the future and burning indignation at the insults
and injuries of the present.Now that these had in a measure abated, she
felt, in looking back upon them, that the fear of failure was always
the least of her troubles.At the worst, the stock which, through
Mrs.Fairchild’s practical kindness, she had been able to bring from
Tecumseh, could be sold for something like its cost.Her father’s help
had sufficed for nearly all the changes needed in the small tenement,
and she had money enough to pay the rent until May.The taking over of Lucinda was a more serious matter, for the girl had
been a wage-earner, and would be entitled to complain if it turned out
that she had been decoyed away from the factory on an empty promise.But
Lucinda, so far from complaining, seemed exceptionally contented.It was
true that she gave no promise of ever acquiring skill as a milliner, and
she was not infrequently restless under the discipline which Jessica,
with perhaps exaggerated caution, strove to impose, but she worked with
great diligence in their tiny kitchen, and served customers in the store
with enthusiasm if not _finesse_.The task of drilling her into that
habit of mind which considers finger-nails and is mindful of soap was
distinctly onerous, and even now had reached only a stage in which
progress might be reported; but much could be forgiven a girl who was so
cheerful and who really tried so hard to do her share.As for the disagreeable experiences, which had once or twice been
literally terrifying, the girl still grew sick at heart with rage and
shame and fear that they might jeopardize her plans, when she thought
of them.In their ruder aspects they were divisible into two classes.A number of young men, sometimes in groups of twos or threes, but more
often furtively and alone, had offensively sought to make themselves at
home in the store, and had even pounded on the door in the evening after
it was shut and bolted; a somewhat larger number of rough factory-girls,
or idlers of the factory-girl class, had come from time to time with
the obvious intention of insulting her.These latter always appeared
in gangs, and supported one another in cruel giggling and in coarse
inquiries and remarks.After a few painfully futile attempts to meet and rebuff these hostile
waves, Jessica gave up the effort, and arranged matters so that she
could work in the living-room beyond, within call if she were needed,
but out of the visual range of her persecutors.Lucinda encountered them
instead, and gave homely but vigorous Rolands for their Olivers.It
was in the interchange of these remarks that the chief danger, to the
struggling little business lay, for if genuine customers heard them,
why, there was an end to everything.It is not easy to portray the
girl’s relief as week after week went by, and time brought not only no
open scandal, but a marked diminution of annoyance.When Jessica was
no longer visible, interest in the sport lagged.To come merely for
the sake of baiting Lucinda was not worth the while.And when these
unfriendly visits slackened, and then fell off almost altogether,
Jessica hugged to her breast the notion that it was because these rough
young people had softened toward and begun to understand and sympathize
with her.It was the easier to credit this kindly hypothesis in that she had
already won the suffrages of a considerable circle of working-girls.To explain how this came about would be to analyze many curious and
apparently contradictory phases of untutored human nature, and to
recount many harmless little stratagems and well-meant devices, and many
other frankly generous words and actions which came from hearts not the
less warm because they beat amid the busy whir of the looms, or throbbed
to the time of the seamstress’s needle.Jessica’s own heart was uplifted with exultation, sometimes, when she
thought upon the friendliness of these girls.So far as she knew and
believed, every one of them was informed as to her past, and there was
no reason beyond their own inclination why they should take stock in
her intentions for the future.To a slender few, originally suggested
by Lucinda, and then confirmed by her own careful scrutiny, she had
confided the crude outlines of her scheme--that is, to build up a
following among the toilers of her own sex, to ask from this following
no more than a decent living for work done, and to make this work
include not merely the details of millinery and hints about dress, but a
general mental and material helpfulness, to take practical form step by
step as the means came to hand and the girls themselves were ready for
the development.Whenever she had tried to put this into words, its
melancholy vagueness had been freshly apparent to her, but the girls had
believed in her!And they had brought others, and spread the favorable report about,
until even now, in the dead season, lying half way between Christmas and
the beginning of Lent, she was kept quite busy.To be sure, her patrons
were not governed much by these holiday dates at any time, and she was
undoubtedly doing their work better and more cheaply than it could ever
have been done for them before, but their good spirit in bringing it was
none the less evident for that.And out of the contact with this good spirit, Jessica began to be dimly
conscious of getting great stores of strength for herself.If it could
be all like this, she felt that her life would be ideally happy.She had
not the skill of mind to separate her feelings, and contrast and weigh
them one against the other, but she knew clearly enough that she was
doing what afforded her keen enjoyment, and it began to be apparent that
merely by doing it she would come to see more clearly, day by day, how
to expand and ennoble her work.The mission which Annie Fairchild had
urged upon her and labored to fit her for, and which she had embraced
and embarked upon with only the vaguest ideas as to means or details or
specific aims, was unfolding itself inspiringly before her.During this period she wrote daily to the good woman who had sent her
upon this work--short letters setting forth tersely the events and
outcome of the day--and the answers which came twice a week helped
greatly to strengthen her.And do not doubt that often she stood in grave need of strength!The
mere matter of regular employment itself was still more or less of a
novelty to her; regular hours still found her physically rebellious.The restraints of a shop, of studied demeanor, of frugal meals, of no
intimate society save that of one dull girl,--these still wore gratingly
upon her nerves, and produced periodical spasms of depression and gloom,
in which she was much tortured by doubts about herself and the utility
of what she was doing.Sometimes, too, these doubts took the positive form of temptation--of a
wild kind of longing to get back again into the atmosphere where bright
lights shone on beautiful dresses, and the hours went swiftly, gayly by
with jest, and song, and the sparkle of the amber air-beads rising in
the tall wine-glasses.There came always afterward the memory of those
other hours which dragged most gruesomely, when the daylight made all
tawdry and hateful once more, and heartaches ruled where smiles had
been.Yet still these unbidden yearnings would come, and then the girl
would set her teeth tight together, and thrust her needle through the
mutinous tears till they were exorcised.It had been in her unshaped original plan to do a good deal for her
father, but this proved to be more easily contemplated than done.Once
the little rooms had been made habitable for her and Lucinda, there
remained next to nothing for him to do.He came around every morning,
when some extraordinary event, such as a job of work or a fire, did not
interfere, and offered his services, but he knew as well as they did
that this was a mere amiable formality.He developed a great fondness
for sitting by the stove in Jessica’s small working room, and either
watching her industrious fingers or sleeping calmly in his chair.Perhaps the filial instinct was not strong in Lucinda’s composition;
perhaps it had been satiated by over-close contact during those five
years of Jessica’s absence.At any rate, the younger girl did not
enjoy Ben’s presence as much as her sister seemed to, and almost daily
detracted from his comfort by suggestions that the apartments were very
small, and that a man hanging around all day took up a deplorable amount
of room.It had been Jessica’s notion, too, that she and her sister would walk
out in the evenings under the escort of their father, and thus secure
themselves from misapprehension.But
