"That's all right," he said, "but what's the use of all this
secrecy?Why can't you come out and tell what's the matter with you?What's the use of this whispering behind doors?He paused, checked by his own harshness, and Jennie, who was
intensely wrought up by the information she had received, as well as
the unwonted verbal castigation she was now enduring, rose to an
emotional state never reached by her before."I will, Lester, I will," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I come back.She hurried to the adjoining chamber to get her wraps, and Lester,
who had even yet no clear conception of what it all meant, followed
her stubbornly to the door."See here," he exclaimed in his vigorous, brutal way, "you're not
acting right.He stood in the doorway, his whole frame exhibiting the pugnacity
and settled determination of a man who is bound to be obeyed.Jennie,
troubled and driven to bay, turned at last."It's my child, Lester," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I
come back.""What the hell are you talking
about?""I couldn't help it," she returned."I was afraid--I should
have told you long ago.I meant to only--only--Oh, let me go
now, and I'll tell you all when I come back!"He stared at her in amazement; then he stepped aside, unwilling to
force her any further for the present."Well, go ahead," he said
quietly."Don't you want some one to go along with you?"She hurried forth, white-faced, and he stood there, pondering.Could this be the woman he had thought he knew?Why, she had been
deceiving him for years.He choked a little as he muttered:

"Well, I'll be damned!"CHAPTER XXIX


The reason why Jennie had been called was nothing more than one of
those infantile seizures the coming and result of which no man can
predict two hours beforehand.Vesta had been seriously taken with
membranous croup only a few hours before, and the development since
had been so rapid that the poor old Swedish mother was half frightened
to death herself, and hastily despatched a neighbor to say that Vesta
was very ill and Mrs.This message,
delivered as it was in a very nervous manner by one whose only object
was to bring her, had induced the soul-racking fear of death in Jennie
and caused her to brave the discovery of Lester in the manner
described.Jennie hurried on anxiously, her one thought being to reach
her child before the arm of death could interfere and snatch it from
her, her mind weighed upon by a legion of fears.What if it should
already be too late when she got there; what if Vesta already should
be no more.Instinctively she quickened her pace and as the street
lamps came and receded in the gloom she forgot all the sting of
Lester's words, all fear that he might turn her out and leave her
alone in a great city with a little child to care for, and remembered
only the fact that her Vesta was very ill, possibly dying, and that
she was the direct cause of the child's absence from her; that perhaps
but for the want of her care and attention Vesta might be well
to-night."If I can only get there," she kept saying to herself; and then,
with that frantic unreason which is the chief characteristic of the
instinct-driven mother: "I might have known that God would punish me
for my unnatural conduct.I might have known--I might have
known."When she reached the gate she fairly sped up the little walk and
into the house, where Vesta was lying pale, quiet, and weak, but
considerably better.Several Swedish neighbors and a middle-aged
physician were in attendance, all of whom looked at her curiously as
she dropped beside the child's bed and spoke to her.She had sinned, and sinned
grievously, against her daughter, but now she would make amends so far
as possible.Lester was very dear to her, but she would no longer
attempt to deceive him in anything, even if he left her--she felt
an agonized stab, a pain at the thought--she must still do the
one right thing.Vesta must not be an outcast any longer.Where Jennie was, there must Vesta be.Sitting by the bedside in this humble Swedish cottage, Jennie
realized the fruitlessness of her deception, the trouble and pain it
had created in her home, the months of suffering it had given her with
Lester, the agony it had heaped upon her this night--and to what
end?She sat there and
meditated, not knowing what next was to happen, while Vesta quieted
down, and then went soundly to sleep.Lester, after recovering from the first heavy import of this
discovery, asked himself some perfectly natural questions."Who was
the father of the child?How did it chance to be in
Chicago, and who was taking care of it?"He could ask, but he could
not answer; he knew absolutely nothing.Curiously, now, as he thought, his first meeting with Jennie at
Mrs.What was it about her then that
had attracted him?What made him think, after a few hours'
observation, that he could seduce her to do his will?What was
it--moral looseness, or weakness, or what?There must have been
art in the sorry affair, the practised art of the cheat, and, in
deceiving such a confiding nature as his, she had done even more than
practise deception--she had been ungrateful.Now the quality of ingratitude was a very objectionable thing to
Lester--the last and most offensive trait of a debased nature,
and to be able to discover a trace of it in Jennie was very
disturbing.It is true that she had not exhibited it in any other way
before--quite to the contrary--but nevertheless he saw
strong evidences of it now, and it made him very bitter in his feeling
toward her.How could she be guilty of any such conduct toward him?Had he not picked her up out of nothing, so to speak, and befriended
her?He moved from his chair in this silent room and began to pace
slowly to and fro, the weightiness of this subject exercising to the
full his power of decision.She was guilty of a misdeed which he felt
able to condemn.The original concealment was evil; the continued
deception more.Lastly, there was the thought that her love after all
had been divided, part for him, part for the child, a discovery which
no man in his position could contemplate with serenity.He moved
irritably as he thought of it, shoved his hands in his pockets and
walked to and fro across the floor.That a man of Lester's temperament should consider himself wronged
by Jennie merely because she had concealed a child whose existence was
due to conduct no more irregular than was involved later in the
yielding of herself to him was an example of those inexplicable
perversions of judgment to which the human mind, in its capacity of
keeper of the honor of others, seems permanently committed.Lester,
aside from his own personal conduct (for men seldom judge with that in
the balance), had faith in the ideal that a woman should reveal
herself completely to the one man with whom she is in love; and the
fact that she had not done so was a grief to him.He had asked her
once tentatively about her past.That
was the time she should have spoken of any child.His first impulse, after he had thought the thing over, was to walk
out and leave her.At the same time he was curious to hear the end of
this business.He did put on his hat and coat, however, and went out,
stopping at the first convenient saloon to get a drink.He took a car
and went down to the club, strolling about the different rooms and
chatting with several people whom he encountered.He was restless and
irritated; and finally, after three hours of meditation, he took a cab
and returned to his apartment.The distraught Jennie, sitting by her sleeping child, was at last
made to realize, by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over.There was nothing more that she could do for Vesta, and now the claims
of the home that she had deserted began to reassert themselves, the
promise to Lester and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the
very end.It was just
probable that he wished to hear the remainder of her story before
breaking with her entirely.Although anguished and frightened by the
certainty, as she deemed it, of his forsaking her, she nevertheless
felt that it was no more than she deserved--a just punishment for
all her misdoings.When Jennie arrived at the flat it was after eleven, and the hall
light was already out.She first tried the door, and then inserted her
key.No one stirred, however, and, opening the door, she entered in
the expectation of seeing Lester sternly confronting her.The burning gas had merely been an oversight on his
part.She glanced quickly about, but seeing only the empty room, she
came instantly to the other conclusion, that he had forsaken
her--and so stood there, a meditative, helpless figure.At this moment his footsteps sounded on the stairs.He came in with
his derby hat pulled low over his broad forehead, close to his sandy
eyebrows, and with his overcoat buttoned up closely about his neck.He
took off the coat without looking at Jennie and hung it on the rack.Then he deliberately took off his hat and hung that up also.When he
was through he turned to where she was watching him with wide
eyes."I want to know about this thing now from beginning to end," he
began.Jennie wavered a moment, as one who might be going to take a leap
in the dark, then opened her lips mechanically and confessed:

"It's Senator Brander's."echoed Lester, the familiar name of the dead but
still famous statesman ringing with shocking and unexpected force in
his ears."We used to do his washing for him," she rejoined simply--"my
mother and I."Lester paused, the baldness of the statements issuing from her
sobering even his rancorous mood."Senator Brander's child," he
thought to himself.So that great representative of the interests of
the common people was the undoer of her--a self-confessed
washerwoman's daughter.A fine tragedy of low life all this was.he demanded, his face the picture of a
darkling mood."It's been nearly six years now," she returned.He calculated the time that had elapsed since he had known her, and
then continued:

"How old is the child?"The need for serious thought made his tone
more peremptory but less bitter."Where have you been keeping her all this time?""She was at home until you went to Cincinnati last spring."Was she there the times I came to Cleveland?""Yes," said Jennie; "but I didn't let her come out anywhere where
you could see her.""I thought you said you told your people that you were married," he
exclaimed, wondering how this relationship of the child to the family
could have been adjusted."I did," she replied, "but I didn't want to tell you about her."I didn't know what was going to become of me when I went with you,
Lester.I didn't want to do her any harm if I could help it.I was
ashamed, afterward; when you said you didn't like children I was
afraid."He stopped, the simplicity of her answers removing a part of the
suspicion of artful duplicity which had originally weighed upon him.After all, there was not so much of that in it as mere wretchedness of
circumstance and cowardice of morals.What queer non-moral natures they must have to have brooked any such a
combination of affairs!"Didn't you know that you'd be found out in the long run?""Surely you might have seen that you couldn't raise her
that way.Why didn't you tell me in the first place?I wouldn't have
thought anything of it then."She stood there, the contradictory aspect of these questions and of
his attitude puzzling even herself.She did try to explain them after
a time, but all Lester could gain was that she had blundered along
without any artifice at all--a condition that was so manifest
that, had he been in any other position than that he was, he might
have pitied her.As it was, the revelation concerning Brander was
hanging over him, and he finally returned to that."You say your mother used to do washing for him.How did you come
to get in with him?"Jennie, who until now had borne his questions with unmoving pain,
winced at this.He was now encroaching upon the period that was by far
the most distressing memory of her life.What he had just asked seemed
to be a demand upon her to make everything clear."I was so young, Lester," she pleaded.I used to go to the hotel where he was stopping and get
his laundry, and at the end of the week I'd take it to him again."She paused, and as he took a chair, looking as if he expected to
hear the whole story, she continued: "We were so poor.He used to give
me money to give to my mother.She paused again, totally unable to go on, and he, seeing that it
would be impossible for her to explain without prompting, took up his
questioning again--eliciting by degrees the whole pitiful story.He had written to her, but before
he could come to her he died.It was followed by a period of five
minutes, in which Lester said nothing at all; he put his arm on the
mantel and stared at the wall, while Jennie waited, not knowing what
would follow--not wishing to make a single plea.Lester's face betrayed no sign of either thought or feeling.He was now quite calm, quite sober, wondering what he should do.Jennie was before him as the criminal at the bar.He, the righteous,
the moral, the pure of heart, was in the judgment seat.Now to
sentence her--to make up his mind what course of action he should
pursue.It was a disagreeable tangle, to be sure, something that a man of
his position and wealth really ought not to have anything to do with.This child, the actuality of it, put an almost unbearable face upon
the whole matter--and yet he was not quite prepared to speak.He
turned after a time, the silvery tinkle of the French clock on the
mantel striking three and causing him to become aware of Jennie, pale,
uncertain, still standing as she had stood all this while."Better go to bed," he said at last, and fell again to pondering
this difficult problem.But Jennie continued to stand there wide-eyed, expectant, ready to
hear at any moment his decision as to her fate.After a long time of musing he turned and went to the
clothes-rack near the door."Better go to bed," he said, indifferently.She turned instinctively, feeling that even in this crisis there
was some little service that she might render, but he did not see her.He went out, vouchsafing no further speech.She looked after him, and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she
felt as if she were doomed and hearing her own death-knell.She stood there a dissonance of
despair, and when the lower door clicked moved her hand out of the
agony of her suppressed hopelessness.In the light of a late dawn she was still sitting there pondering,
her state far too urgent for idle tears.CHAPTER XXX


The sullen, philosophic Lester was not so determined upon his
future course of action as he appeared to be.Stern as was his mood,
he did not see, after all, exactly what grounds he had for complaint.And yet the child's existence complicated matters considerably.He did
not like to see the evidence of Jennie's previous misdeeds walking
about in the shape of a human being; but, as a matter of fact, he
admitted to himself that long ago he might have forced Jennie's story
out of her if he had gone about it in earnest.She would not have
lied, he knew that.At the very outset he might have demanded the
history of her past.He had not done so; well, now it was too late.The one thing it did fix in his mind was that it would be useless to
ever think of marrying her.It couldn't be done, not by a man in his
position.The best solution of the problem was to make reasonable
provision for Jennie and then leave her.He went to his hotel with his
mind made up, but he did not actually say to himself that he would do
it at once.It is an easy thing for a man to theorize in a situation of this
kind, quite another to act.Our comforts, appetites and passions grow
with usage, and Jennie was not only a comfort, but an appetite, with
him.Almost four years of constant association had taught him so much
about her and himself that he was not prepared to let go easily or
quickly.He could think of it bustling
about the work of a great organization during the daytime, but when
night came it was a different matter.He could be lonely, too, he
discovered much to his surprise, and it disturbed him.One of the things that interested him in this situation was
Jennie's early theory that the intermingling of Vesta with him and her
in this new relationship would injure the child.Just how did she come
by that feeling, he wanted to know?His place in the world was better
than hers, yet it dawned on him after a time that there might have
been something in her point of view.She did not know who he was or
what he would do with her.Being
uncertain, she wished to protect her baby.Then
again, he was curious to know what the child was like.The daughter of
a man like Senator Brander might be somewhat of an infant.He was a
brilliant man and Jennie was a charming woman.He thought of this,
and, while it irritated him, it aroused his curiosity.He ought to go
back and see the child--he was really entitled to a view of
it--but he hesitated because of his own attitude in the
beginning.It seemed to him that he really ought to quit, and here he
was parleying with himself.These years of living with Jennie
had made him curiously dependent upon her.Who had ever been so close
to him before?His mother loved him, but her attitude toward him had
not so much to do with real love as with ambition.His
father--well, his father was a man, like himself.All of his
sisters were distinctly wrapped up in their own affairs; Robert and he
were temperamentally uncongenial.With Jennie he had really been
happy, he had truly lived.She was necessary to him; the longer he
stayed away from her the more he wanted her.He finally decided to
have a straight-out talk with her, to arrive at some sort of
understanding.She ought to get the child and take care of it.She
must understand that he might eventually want to quit.She ought to be
made to feel that a definite change had taken place, though no
immediate break might occur.That same evening he went out to the
apartment.Jennie heard him enter, and her heart began to flutter.Then she took her courage in both hands, and went to meet him."There's just one thing to be done about this as far as I can see,"
began Lester, with characteristic directness."Get the child and bring her here where you can take care of her.There's no use leaving her in the hands of strangers.""I will, Lester," said Jennie submissively."Very well, then, you'd better do it at once."He took an evening
newspaper out of his pocket and strolled toward one of the front
windows; then he turned to her."You and I might as well understand
each other, Jennie," he went on."I can see how this thing came about.It was a piece of foolishness on my part not to have asked you before,
and made you tell me.It was silly for you to conceal it, even if you
didn't want the child's life mixed with mine.You might have known
that it couldn't be done.That's neither here nor there, though, now.The thing that I want to point out is that one can't live and hold a
relationship such as ours without confidence.You and I had that, I
thought.I don't see my way clear to ever hold more than a tentative
relationship with you on this basis."Now, I don't propose to do anything hasty.For my part I don't see
why things can't go on about as they are--certainly for the
present--but I want you to look the facts in the face.""I know, Lester," she said, "I know."There were some trees in the
yard, where the darkness was settling.He wondered how this would
really come out, for he liked a home atmosphere.Should he leave the
apartment and go to his club?"You'd better get the dinner," he suggested, after a time, turning
toward her irritably; but he did not feel so distant as he looked.It
was a shame that life could not be more decently organized.He
strolled back to his lounge, and Jennie went about her duties.She was
thinking of Vesta, of her ungrateful attitude toward Lester, of his
final decision never to marry her.So that was how one dream had been
wrecked by folly.She spread the table, lighted the pretty silver candles, made his
favorite biscuit, put a small leg of lamb in the oven to roast, and
washed some lettuce-leaves for a salad.She had been a diligent
student of a cook-book for some time, and she had learned a good deal
from her mother.All the time she was wondering how the situation
would work out.He would leave her eventually--no doubt of that.He would go away and marry some one else."Oh, well," she thought finally, "he is not going to leave me right
away--that is something.She sighed
as she carried the things to the table.If life would only give her
Lester and Vesta together--but that hope was over.CHAPTER XXXI


There was peace and quiet for some time after this storm.Jennie
went the next day and brought Vesta away with her.The joy of the
reunion between mother and child made up for many other worries."Now
I can do by her as I ought," she thought; and three or four times
during the day she found herself humming a little song.He was trying to make
himself believe that he ought to do something toward reforming his
life--toward bringing about that eventual separation which he had
suggested.He did not like the idea of a child being in this
apartment--particularly that particular child.He fought his way
through a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to
the apartment more regularly.In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a
place of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.During the first days of Lester's return it was difficult for
Jennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost
uncontrollable child from annoying the staid, emphatic,
commercial-minded man.Jennie gave Vesta a severe talking to the first
night Lester telephoned that he was coming, telling her that he was a
very bad-tempered man who didn't like children, and that she mustn't
go near him."You mustn't talk," she said.Let mamma ask you what you want.Vesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the
full significance of the warning.Jennie, who had taken great pains to array
Vesta as attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give
her own toilet a last touch.As a
matter of fact, she had followed her mother to the door of the
sitting-room, where now she could be plainly seen.Lester hung up his
hat and coat, then, turning, he caught his first glimpse.The child
looked very sweet--he admitted that at a glance.She was arrayed
in a blue-dotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll collar and
cuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes.Her
corn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face.Blue eyes, rosy lips,
rosy cheeks completed the picture.Lester stared, almost inclined to
say something, but restrained himself.When Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had
arrived."Rather sweet-looking child," he said."Do you have much
trouble in making her mind?"Jennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of
their conversation.Didn't I tell you you mustn't
talk?"What might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen,
peevish, or all three, can scarcely be conjectured.Had Jennie been
less tactful, even in the beginning, he might have obtained a
disagreeable impression.As it was, the natural beauty of the child,
combined with the mother's gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the
background, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and
youth which is always pleasant.The thought struck him that Jennie had
been the mother of a child all these years; she had been separated
from it for months at a time; she had never even hinted at its
existence, and yet her affection for Vesta was obviously great."It's
queer," he said.One morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when
he thought he heard something stir.He turned, and was surprised to
see a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring
door--the effect was most disconcerting.It was not like the
ordinary eye, which, under such embarrassing circumstances, would have
been immediately withdrawn; it kept its position with deliberate
boldness.He turned his paper solemnly and looked again.He crossed his
legs and looked again.This little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with
the saving grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially
responsive.Although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude
of aloofness, he found his mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by
the mysterious appearance; the corners of his mouth were animated by a
desire to turn up.He did not give way to the feeling, and stuck by
his paper, but the incident remained very clearly in his mind.The
young wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon
him.Not long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast,
calmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused
by another visitation--this time not quite so simple.Jennie had
given Vesta her breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until
Lester should leave the house.Jennie was seated at the table, pouring
out the coffee, when Vesta suddenly appeared, very business-like in
manner, and marched through the room.Lester looked up, and Jennie
colored and arose.By this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a
little broom, and returned, a droll determination lighting her
face."I want my little broom," she exclaimed and marched sedately past,
at which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched internally,
this time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across
his mouth.The final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down
the feeling of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in
its place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a
human being.The developments of the next six months were of a kind to further
relax the strain of opposition which still existed in Lester's mind.Although not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in
which he was living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could
not persuade himself to give it up.It was too much like a bed of
down.The condition of unquestioned
liberty, so far as all his old social relationships were concerned,
coupled with the privilege of quiet, simplicity, and affection in the
home was too inviting.He lingered on, and began to feel that perhaps
it would be just as well to let matters rest as they were.During this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta
insensibly strengthened.He discovered that there was a real flavor of
humor about Vesta's doings, and so came to watch for its development.She was forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie
watched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him,
nevertheless Vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and
came straight home with her remarks.Once, for example, she was sawing
away at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife,
when Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a
little breakfast set.Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow,
reached over and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained
a desire to laugh.Another morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the
lumps of sugar in Lester's cup, when she broke in with, "I want two
lumps in mine, mamma.""No, dearest," replied Jennie, "you don't need any in yours."Uncle Lester has two," she protested."Yes," returned Jennie; "but you're only a little girl.Besides you
mustn't say anything like that at the table."Uncle Lester eats too much sugar," was her immediate rejoinder, at
which that fine gourmet smiled broadly."I don't know about that," he put in, for the first time deigning
to answer her directly."That sounds like the fox and grapes to me."Vesta smiled back at him, and now that the ice was broken she
chattered on unrestrainedly.One thing led to another, and at last
Lester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to him; he
was willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his
position and wealth might make possible--provided, of course,
that he stayed with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement
which would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which
was back of him, and which he had to keep constantly in mind.CHAPTER XXXII


The following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed,
and Lester removed his office to the new building.Heretofore, he had
been transacting all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the
club.From now on he felt himself to be firmly established in
Chicago--as if that was to be his future home.A large number of
details were thrown upon him--the control of a considerable
office force, and the handling of various important transactions.It
took away from him the need of traveling, that duty going to Amy's
husband, under the direction of Robert.The latter was doing his best
to push his personal interests, not only through the influence he was
bringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his reorganization of
the factory.Several men whom Lester was personally fond of were in
danger of elimination.But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane
senior was inclined to give Robert a free hand.He was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take
charge.Apparently he and Robert were on
better terms than ever before.Matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact
that Lester's private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be
permanently kept under cover.At times he was seen driving with her by
people who knew him in a social and commercial way.He was for
brazening it out on the ground that he was a single man, and at
liberty to associate with anybody he pleased.Jennie might be any
young woman of good family in whom he was interested.He did not
propose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always
made it a point to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others
might not attempt to detain and talk to him.At the theater, as has
been said, she was simply "Miss Gerhardt."The trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers
of life.They had no quarrel to pick with Lester's conduct.Only he
had been seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman.She must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly.Wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling.Rumors came
to Robert, who, however, kept his own counsel.If Lester wanted to do
this sort of thing, well and good.But there must come a time when
there would be a show-down.This came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester
and Jennie had been living in the north side apartment.It so happened
that, during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was
seized with a mild form of grip.When he felt the first symptoms he
thought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration,
and tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of
quinine.But the infection was stronger than he counted on; by morning
he was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a splitting
headache.His long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious.Policy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel
and endure his sickness alone.As a matter of fact, he was very glad
to be in the house with her.He had to call up the office to say that
he was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so; then he
yielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations.Jennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or
well.She persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe.She
brought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and hands in
cold water over and over.Later, when he was recovering, she made him
appetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.It was during this illness that the first real contretemps
occurred.Lester's sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St.Paul, and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on
her way, decided upon an earlier return than she had originally
planned.While Lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in
Chicago.Calling up the office, and finding that he was not there and
would not be down for several days, she asked where he could be
reached."I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific," said an
incautious secretary.Louise, a little
disturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told that Mr.Kane
had not been there for several days--did not, as a matter of
fact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week.Piqued by
this, she telephoned his club.It so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had
called up the apartment a number of times for Lester himself.He had
not been cautioned not to give its number--as a matter of fact,
it had never been asked for by any one else.When Louise stated that
she was Lester's sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied,
"I think he lives at 19 Schiller Place.""Whose address is that you're giving?""Well, don't be giving out addresses.The boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was
gone.About an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her
brother, Louise arrived at Schiller Place.Ascending the
steps--it was a two-apartment house--she saw the name of
Kane on the door leading to the second floor.Ringing the bell, she
was opened to by Jennie, who was surprised to see so fashionably
attired a young woman.Kane's apartment, I believe," began Louise,
condescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie.She
was a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were
as yet only vaguely aroused.Jennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried
to make some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and
station, swept past before Jennie could say a word.Once inside Louise
looked about her inquiringly.She found herself in the sitting-room,
which gave into the bedroom where Lester was lying.Vesta happened to
be playing in one corner of the room, and stood up to eye the
new-comer.The open bedroom showed Lester quite plainly lying in bed,
a window to the left of him, his eyes closed."Oh, there you are, old fellow!"Lester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized
in an instant how things were.He pulled himself up on one elbow, but
words failed him."Why, hello, Louise," he finally forced himself to say.I came back sooner than I thought," she answered lamely,
a sense of something wrong irritating her."I had a hard time finding
you, too.Who's your--" she was about to say "pretty
housekeeper," but turned to find Jennie dazedly gathering up certain
articles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught.His sister swept the place with an observing eye.It took in the
home atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive.There was a
dress of Jennie's lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which
caused Miss Kane to draw herself up warily.She looked at her brother,
who had a rather curious expression in his eyes--he seemed
slightly nonplussed, but cool and defiant."You shouldn't have come out here," said Lester finally, before
Louise could give vent to the rising question in her mind."You're my brother, aren't you?Why should you have any place that I
couldn't come.Well, I like that--and from you to me.""Listen, Louise," went on Lester, drawing himself up further on one
elbow."You know as much about life as I do.There is no need of our
getting into an argument.I didn't know you were coming, or I would
have made other arrangements.""Other arrangements, indeed," she sneered.She was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this
trap; it was really disgraceful of Lester."I wouldn't be so haughty about it," he declared, his color rising."I'm not apologizing to you for my conduct.I'm saying I would have
made other arrangements, which is a very different thing from begging
your pardon.If you don't want to be civil, you needn't.""I thought
better of you, honestly I did.I should think you would be ashamed of
yourself living here in open--" she paused without using the
word--"and our friends scattered all over the city.I thought you had more sense of decency and
consideration.""I tell you I'm not apologizing to
you.If you don't like this you know what you can do."she demanded, savagely and yet
curiously.If it were it wouldn't make any
difference.I wish you wouldn't busy yourself about my affairs."Jennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the
sitting-room, heard the cutting references to herself.I won't any more," retorted Louise."I
should think, though, that you, of all men, would be above anything
like this--and that with a woman so obviously beneath you.Why, I
thought she was--" she was again going to add "your housekeeper,"
but she was interrupted by Lester, who was angry to the point of
brutality."Never mind what you thought she was," he growled."She's better
than some who do the so-called superior thinking.It's neither here nor there, I tell you.I'm doing this, and I
don't care what you think."Well, I won't, I assure you," she flung back."It's quite plain
that your family means nothing to you.But if you had any sense of
decency, Lester Kane, you would never let your sister be trapped into
coming into a place like this.I'm disgusted, that's all, and so will
the others be when they hear of it."She turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look
being reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door
of the dining-room.Jennie came in a little
while later and closed the door.Lester,
his thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily
on his pillow."What a devilish trick of fortune," he thought.Now she
would go home and tell it to the family.His father would know, and
his mother.Robert, Imogene, Amy all would hear.He would have no
explanation to make--she had seen.Meanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for
reflection.So this was her real position in another woman's eyes.Now
she could see what the world thought.This family was as aloof from
her as if it lived on another planet.To his sisters and brothers, his
father and mother, she was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him
socially, far beneath him mentally and morally, a creature of the
streets.And she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes
of the world.It cut her as nothing before had ever done.The thought
tore a great, gaping wound in her sensibilities.She was really low
and vile in her--Louise's--eyes, in the world's eyes,
basically so in Lester's eyes.She went
about numb and still, but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it
all.Oh, if she could only see some way to make herself right with the
world, to live honorably, to be decent.How could that possibly be
brought about?CHAPTER XXXIII


Outraged in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to
Cincinnati, where she told the story of her discovery, embellished
with many details.According to her, she was met at the door by a
"silly-looking, white-faced woman," who did not even offer to invite
her in when she announced her name, but stood there "looking just as
guilty as a person possibly could."Lester also had acted shamefully,
having outbrazened the matter to her face.When she had demanded to
know whose the child was he had refused to tell her."It isn't mine,"
was all he would say.Kane, who was the first to hear
the story.exclaimed Louise emphatically, as though the
words needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality."I went there solely because I thought I could help him," continued
Louise."I thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be
seriously ill."To think he would come to
anything like that!"Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having
no previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old
Archibald, who came out from the factory and sat through the
discussion with a solemn countenance.So Lester was living openly with
a woman of whom they had never heard.He would probably be as defiant
and indifferent as his nature was strong.The standpoint of parental
authority was impossible.Lester was a centralized authority in
himself, and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made,
they would have to be very diplomatically executed.Archibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but
determined that something ought to be done.He held a consultation
with Robert, who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from
time to time, but had not wanted to say anything.Kane suggested
that Robert might go to Chicago and have a talk with Lester."He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him
irreparable damage," said Mr."He cannot hope to carry it off
successfully.He ought to marry her or he ought to quit.I
want you to tell him that for me.""All well and good," said Robert, "but who's going to convince him?I'm sure I don't want the job.""I hope to," said old Archibald, "eventually; but you'd better go
up and try, anyhow."I don't believe it," replied Robert.You see
how much good talk does down here.Still, I'll go if it will relieve
your feelings any."Yes, yes," said his father distractedly, "better go."Without allowing himself to anticipate any
particular measure of success in this adventure, he rode pleasantly
into Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of
morality and justice on his side.Upon Robert's arrival, the third morning after Louise's interview,
he called up the warerooms, but Lester was not there.He then
telephoned to the house, and tactfully made an appointment.Lester was
still indisposed, but he preferred to come down to the office, and he
did.He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way, and together they
talked business for a time."Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here," began Robert
tentatively."I think I could make a guess at it," Lester replied."They were all very much worried over the fact that you were
sick--mother particularly.You're not in any danger of having a
relapse, are you?""Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage
she ran into up here."The young woman Louise saw is just--" Robert waved his hand
expressively."I don't want to be inquisitive, Lester.I'm simply here because the family felt that I ought to come.Mother
was so very much distressed that I couldn't do less than see you for
her sake"--he paused, and Lester, touched by the fairness and
respect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at least made some
explanation due."I don't know that anything I can say will help matters much," he
replied thoughtfully.I have the
woman and the family has its objections.The chief difficulty about
the thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out."He stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly
reasoning in his mind.He seemed, as
usual, to be most convincingly sane."You're not contemplating marrying her, are you?""I hadn't come to that," answered Lester coolly.They looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert
turned his glance to the distant scene of the city."It's useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her, I
suppose," ventured Robert."I don't know whether I'd be able to discuss that divine afflatus
with you or not," returned Lester, with a touch of grim humor."I have
never experienced the sensation myself.All I know is that the lady is
very pleasing to me.""Well, it's all a question of your own well-being and the family's,
Lester," went on Robert, after another pause."Morality doesn't seem
to figure in it anyway--at least you and I can't discuss that
together.Your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone.But the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be
substantial enough ground to base a plea on.The family's feelings and
pride are also fairly important.Father's the kind of a man who sets
more store by the honor of his family than most men.You know that as
well as I do, of course.""I know how father feels about it," returned Lester."The whole
business is as clear to me as it is to any of you, though off-hand I
don't see just what's to be done about it.These matters aren't always
of a day's growth, and they can't be settled in a day.To a certain extent I'm responsible that she is here.While I'm
not willing to go into details, there's always more in these affairs
than appears on the court calendar.""Of course I don't know what your relations with her have been,"
returned Robert, "and I'm not curious to know, but it does look like a
bit of injustice all around, don't you think--unless you intend
to marry her?"This last was put forth as a feeler."I might be willing to agree to that, too," was Lester's baffling
reply, "if anything were to be gained by it.The point is, the woman
is here, and the family is in possession of the fact.Now if there is
anything to be done I have to do it.There isn't anybody else who can
act for me in this matter."Lester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor,
coming back after a time to say: "You say you haven't any idea of
marrying her--or rather you haven't come to it.It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life,
from every point of view.I don't want to orate, but a man of your
position has so much to lose; you can't afford to do it.Aside from
family considerations, you have too much at stake.You'd be simply
throwing your life away--"

He paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was
customary when he was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor
and simplicity of this appeal.He
was making an appeal to him, and this was somewhat different.The appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began
on a new tack, this time picturing old Archibald's fondness for Lester
and the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some
well-to-do Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at
least worthy of his station.Kane felt the same way; surely
Lester must realize that."I know just how all of them feel about it," Lester interrupted at
last, "but I don't see that anything's to be done right now.""You mean that you don't think it would be policy for you to give
her up just at present?""I mean that she's been exceptionally good to me, and that I'm
morally under obligations to do the best I can by her.What that may
be, I can't tell.""Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been
accustomed to live with me," replied Lester.Robert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal
futile."Can't family reasons persuade you to make some amicable
arrangements with her and let her go?""Not without due consideration of the matter; no.""You don't think you could hold out some hope that the thing will
end quickly--something that would give me a reasonable excuse for
softening down the pain of it to the family?""I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away
the edge of this thing for the family, but the truth's the truth, and
I can't see any room for equivocation between you and me.As I've said
before, these relationships are involved with things which make it
impossible to discuss them--unfair to me, unfair to the woman.No
one can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in
them, and even they can't always see.I'd be a damned dog to stand up
here and give you my word to do anything except the best I can."Lester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only
to come back after a time and say, "You don't think there's anything
to be done just at present?""Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going.I don't know
that there's anything else we can talk about.""Won't you stay and take lunch with me?I think I might manage to
get down to the hotel if you'll stay.""I believe I can make that one
o'clock train for Cincinnati.They stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid,
Robert clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the
difference time had already made.Robert was the clean, decisive man,
Lester the man of doubts.Robert was the spirit of business energy and
integrity embodied, Lester the spirit of commercial self-sufficiency,
looking at life with an uncertain eye.Together they made a striking
picture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were
now running through their minds."Well," said the older brother, after a time, "I don't suppose
there is anything more I can say.I had hoped to make you feel just as
we do about this thing, but of course you are your own best judge of
this.If you don't see it now, nothing I could say would make you.It
strikes me as a very bad move on your part though."He said nothing, but his face expressed an
unchanged purpose.Robert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door
together."I'll put the best face I can on it," said Robert, and walked
out.CHAPTER XXXIV


In this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be
limited to a plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to
the creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about
the sun.A fish, for instance, may not pass out of the circle of the
seas without courting annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of
the fishes without paying for it dearly.From the parasites of the
flowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the
circumscribed nature of their movements--the emphatic manner in
which life has limited them to a sphere; and we are content to note
the ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on
their part to depart from their environment.In the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of
limitations has not as yet been so clearly observed.The laws
governing our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit
of a clear generalization.Still, the opinions, pleas, and judgments
of society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being
intangible.When men or women err--that is, pass out from the
sphere in which they are accustomed to move--it is not as if the
bird had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the
haunts of man.People may do
no more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh
sarcastically, lift up their hands in protest.And yet so well defined
is the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is
doomed.Born and bred in this environment, the individual is
practically unfitted for any other state.He is like a bird accustomed
to a certain density of atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably
at either higher or lower level.Lester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother
had gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city.Yonder
was spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy,
hope, prosperity, and pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a
wind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being--his
prospects and purposes dissipated.Could he continue as cheerily in
the paths he had hitherto pursued?Would not his relations with Jennie
be necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition?Was not his
own home now a thing of the past so far as his old easy-going
relationship was concerned?All the atmosphere of unstained affection
would be gone out of it now.That hearty look of approval which used
to dwell in his father's eye--would it be there any longer?Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part
of his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of
Louise."It's unfortunate," was all that he thought to himself, and
therewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the
consideration of what, if anything, was to be done."I'm thinking I'd take a run up to Mt.Clemens to-morrow, or
Thursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough," he said to Jennie after he
had returned."I'm not feeling as well as I might.He wanted to get off by himself and think.Jennie packed his
bag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a
sullen, meditative mood.During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all
over, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of
making a decisive move at present.A few weeks more, one way or the
other, could not make any practical difference.Neither Robert nor any
other member of the family was at all likely to seek another
conference with him.His business relations would necessarily go on as
usual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;
certainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted.But the
consciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed
upon him."Bad business," he meditated--"bad business."For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs
continued.Lester did not go home for six months; then an important
business conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it
off quite as though nothing important had happened.His mother kissed
him affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his
customary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
concertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore
the one real issue.But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it
persisted.Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far
between as he could possibly make them.CHAPTER XXXV


In the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her
own.For the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude,
which had afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought
of her.She had yielded on two
occasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought
out differently.If she did not
always have this haunting sense of fear!If she could only make up her
mind to do the right thing!She loved him, but she could leave him, and it would be better for
him.Probably her father would live with her if she went back to
Cleveland.He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand.Yet
the thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to her--he had
been so good.As for her father, she was not sure whether he would
receive her or not.After the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a
little money, laying it aside as best she could from her allowance.Lester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly
fifteen dollars a week to maintain the family--as much as they
had lived on before, without any help from the outside.She spent
twenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of
everything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not.The
rent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone.She
thought how she might economize but this seemed wrong.Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the
thought that came to her.She thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise,
trying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act.Lester was consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that
he himself might wish it.Since the
scene with Louise it seemed to her that he had been a little
different.If she could only say to him that she was not satisfied
with the way she was living, and then leave.But he himself had
plainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her feelings on
that score could not matter so very much to him, since he thought the
presence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever
marrying her.It was her presence he wanted on another basis.And he
was so forceful, she could not argue with him very well.Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.She decided
if she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why.Then
maybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing
more about it.The condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving.Since
Jennie had left Martha had married.After several years of teaching in
the public schools of Cleveland she had met a young architect, and
they were united after a short engagement.Martha had been always a
little ashamed of her family, and now, when this new life dawned, she
was anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible.She barely
notified the members of the family of the approaching
marriage--Jennie not at all--and to the actual ceremony she
invited only Bass and George.Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented
the slight.She hoped that life would give her an
opportunity to pay her sister off.William, of course, did not mind
particularly.He was interested in the possibilities of becoming an
electrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had
pointed out to him as being attractive and promising.Jennie heard of Martha's marriage after it was all over, a note
from Veronica giving her the main details.She was glad from one point
of view, but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away
from her.A little while after Martha's marriage Veronica and William went to
reside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of
Gerhardt himself.Ever since his wife's death and the departure of the
other children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from
which he was not easily aroused.Life, it seemed, was drawing to a
close for him, although he was only sixty-five years of age.The
earthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever.He saw
Sebastian, Martha, and George out in the world practically ignoring
him, contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have
taken a dollar from Jennie.They
objected to leaving school and going to work, apparently preferring to
live on money which Gerhardt had long since concluded was not being
come by honestly.He was now pretty well satisfied as to the true
relations of Jennie and Lester.At first he had believed them to be
married, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the
humbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of
telling him about Vesta--somehow it all pointed to the same
thing.Gerhardt had never had sight
of her marriage certificate.Since she was away she might have been
married, but he did not believe it.The real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and
crotchety, and it was becoming impossible for young people to live
with him.They resented the way in which
he took charge of the expenditures after Martha left.He accused them
of spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a
smaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of
the money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess.As a matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order
to repay Jennie eventually.He thought it was sinful to go on in this
way, and this was his one method, out side of his meager earnings, to
redeem himself.If his other children had acted rightly by him he felt
that he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity
from one, who, despite her other good qualities, was certainly not
leading a righteous life.It ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his
complaining brother and sister on condition that they should get
something to do.Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited
them to take the furniture and go their way.His generosity shamed
them for the moment; they even tentatively invited him to come and
live with them, but this he would not do.He would ask the foreman of
the mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some
out-of-the-way garret.And this would
save him a little money.So in a fit of pique he did this, and there was seen the spectacle
of an old man watching through a dreary season of nights, in a lonely
trafficless neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere.He had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from
the tear and grind of the factory proper.In the afternoon he would take a little walk, strolling toward the
business center, or out along the banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake.As a rule his hands were below his back, his brow bent in meditation.He would even talk to himself a little--an occasional "By chops!"or "So it is" being indicative of his dreary mood.At dusk he would
return, taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of
duty.His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen's boarding-house,
such as he felt he must have.The nature of the old German's reflections at this time were of a
peculiarly subtle and somber character.What did it all come to after the struggle, and the
worry, and the grieving?People die; you hear
nothing more from them.Yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions.He
believed there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there.He believed that both had
sinned woefully.He believed that the just would be rewarded in
heaven.Sebastian
was a good boy, but he was cold, and certainly indifferent to his
father.Take Martha--she was ambitious, but obviously selfish.Somehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed self-centered.Bass
walked off when he got married, and did nothing more for anybody.Martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on.George had
contributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.Veronica and William had been content to live on Jennie's money so
long as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right.His
very existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his
children?Life was truly strange, and dark, and uncertain.Still he
did not want to go and live with any of his children.Actually they
were not worthy of him--none but Jennie, and she was not good.This woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for
some time.She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her
leaving, Jennie had been writing directly to Gerhardt.After
Veronica's departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was no
need of sending any more money.Veronica and William were going to
live with George.He himself had a good place in a factory, and would
live there a little while.He returned her a moderate sum that he had
saved--one hundred and fifteen dollars--with the word that
he would not need it.Jennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was
not sure but what it might be all right--her father was so
determined.But by degrees, however, a sense of what it really must
mean overtook her--a sense of something wrong, and she worried,
hesitating between leaving Lester and going to see about her father,
whether she left him or not.Yet if she did not get some work which paid well
they would have a difficult time.If she could get five
or six dollars a week they could live.This hundred and fifteen
dollars which Gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst
difficulties perhaps.CHAPTER XXXVI


The trouble with Jennie's plan was that it did not definitely take
into consideration Lester's attitude.He did care for her in an
elemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the
conventional world in which he had been reared.To say that he loved
her well enough to take her for better or worse--to legalize her
anomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he
had chosen a wife who suited him--was perhaps going a little too
far, but he did really care for her, and he was not in a mood, at this
particular time, to contemplate parting with her for good.Lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of
womanhood were fixed and not subject to change.Thus far, on his own
plane and within the circle of his own associates, he had met no one
who appealed to him as did Jennie.She was gentle, intelligent,
gracious, a handmaiden to his every need; and he had taught her the
little customs of polite society, until she was as agreeable a
companion as he cared to have.He was comfortable, he was
satisfied--why seek further?But Jennie's restlessness increased day by day.She tried writing
out her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally
worded one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings.It was a long letter for her, and it ran as follows:

"Lester dear, When you get this I won't be here, and I want you
not to think harshly of me until you have read it all.I am taking
Vesta and leaving, and I think it is really better that I should.You know when you met me we were very poor,
and my condition was such that I didn't think any good man would ever
want me.When you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly
able to think just what I ought to do.You made me love you, Lester,
in spite of myself."You know I told you that I oughtn't to do anything wrong any more
and that I wasn't good, but somehow when you were near me I couldn't
think just right, and I didn't see just how I was to get away from
you.Papa was sick at home that time, and there was hardly anything in
the house to eat.My brother George
didn't have good shoes, and mamma was so worried.I have often
thought, Lester, if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she
might be alive to-day.I thought if you liked me and I really liked
you--I love you, Lester--maybe it wouldn't make so much
difference about me.You know you told me right away you would like to
help my family, and I felt that maybe that would be the right thing to
do."Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way; it seems so mean,
but if you knew how I have been feeling these days you would forgive
me.Oh, I love you, Lester, I do, I do.But for months past--ever
since your sister came--I felt that I was doing wrong, and that I
oughtn't to go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is.It
was wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator Brander, but
I was such a girl then--I hardly knew what I was doing.It was
wrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I first met you, though I
thought I was doing right when I did it.It was terribly wrong of me
to keep her here all that time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of
you then--afraid of what you would say and do.When your sister
Louise came it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never
been able to think right about it since.It can't be right, Lester,
but I don't blame you."I don't ask you to marry me, Lester.I know how you feel about me
and how you feel about your family, and I don't think it would be
right.They would never want you to do it, and it isn't right that I
should ask you.At the same time I know I oughtn't to go on living
this way.Vesta is getting along where she understands everything.She
thinks you are her really truly uncle.I have thought of it all so
much.I have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to you
about it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and I don't seem
to be able to say what I want to.So I thought if I could just write
you this and then go you would understand.I know it's for the best for you and for
me.Please forgive me, Lester, please; and don't
think of me any more.But I love you--oh yes, I
do--and I will never be grateful enough for all you have done for
me.I wish you all the luck that can come to you."P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa.It's best that you
shouldn't."She put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in
her bosom, for the time being, awaited the hour when she could
conveniently take her departure.It was several days before she could bring herself to the actual
execution of the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned
that he would not be home for a day or two, she packed some necessary
garments for herself and Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an
expressman.She thought of telegraphing her father that she was
coming; but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as
well to go and find him.George and Veronica had not taken all the
furniture.The major portion of it was in storage--so Gerhard t
had written.She might take that and furnish a little home or flat.She was ready for the end, waiting for the expressman, when the door
opened and in walked Lester.For some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind.He was not in
the least psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings
had served him a peculiar turn.He had thought of going for a day's
duck-shooting with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of
Chicago, but had finally changed his mind; he even decided to go out
to the house early.As he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home
so early; then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle
of the room he stood dumfounded.What did it mean--Jennie dressed
and ready to depart?He stared in
amazement, his brown eyes keen in inquiry."Why--why--" she began, falling back."I thought I would go to Cleveland," she replied."Why--why--I meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn't
think I ought to stay here any longer this way.I thought I'd tell you, but I couldn't."What the deuce are you talking about?"There," she said, mechanically pointing to a small center-table
where the letter lay conspicuous on a large book."And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a
letter?"said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke."I
swear to heaven you are beyond me.He tore open the
envelope and looked at the beginning."Better send Vesta from the
room," he suggested.Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed,
looking at the wall, at the trunks, and at him.He shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the
paper on the floor."Well, I'll tell you, Jennie," he said finally, looking at her
curiously and wondering just what he was going to say.Here again was
his chance to end this relationship if he wished.He couldn't feel
that he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things were running.They
had gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now.He truly
loved her--there was no doubt of that.Still he did not want to
marry her--could not very well."You have this thing wrong," he went on slowly."I don't know
what comes over you at times, but you don't view the situation right.I've told you before that I can't marry you--not now, anyhow.There are too many big things involved in this, which you don't know
anything about.But my family has to be
taken into consideration, and the business.You can't see the
difficulties raised on these scores, but I can.Now I don't want you
to leave me.I can't prevent you, of
course.But I don't think you ought to want
to.Jennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen,
was now thoroughly nonplussed.To have him begin a quiet
argument--a plea as it were.He, Lester, pleading
with her, and she loved him so.She went over to him, and he took her hand."There's really nothing to be gained by
your leaving me at present."Well, how did you expect to get along?""I thought I'd take papa, if he'd come with me--he's alone
now--and get something to do, maybe.""Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have
done?You wouldn't expect to be a lady's maid again, would you?"I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper," she suggested.She had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most
promising idea that had occurred to her."No, no," he grumbled, shaking his head.There's nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion.Why, you
won't be any better off morally than you are right now.It doesn't make any difference, anyhow.I might in the future, but I can't tell anything about that, and
I don't want to promise anything.You're not going to leave me though
with my consent, and if you were going I wouldn't have you dropping
back into any such thing as you're contemplating.I'll make some
provision for you.You don't really want to leave me, do you,
Jennie?"Against Lester's strong personality and vigorous protest Jennie's
own conclusions and decisions went to pieces.Just the pressure of his
hand was enough to upset her."Don't cry, Jennie," he said."This thing may work out better than
you think.You're not
going to leave me any more, are you?""Let things rest as they are," he went on.I'm putting up with some things myself that I ordinarily
wouldn't stand for."He finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly
through her tears."Now you put those things away," he said genially, pointing to the
trunks."Besides, I want you to promise me one thing.""No more concealment of anything, do you hear?No more thinking
things out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about
it.If you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it.I'll help you solve it, or, if I can't, at least there won't be any
concealment between us.""I know, Lester," she said earnestly, looking him straight in the
eyes."I promise I'll never conceal anything any more--truly I
won't.I've been afraid, but I won't be now."That sounds like what you ought to be," he replied.A few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future
of Gerhardt came up for discussion.Jennie had been worrying about him
for several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to
talk over with Lester.Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner
what had happened in Cleveland."I know he is very unhappy there all
alone," she said, "and I hate to think of it.I was going to get him
if I went back to Cleveland.Now I don't know what to do about
it.""Why don't you send him some money?""He won't take any more money from me, Lester," she explained."He
thinks I'm not good--not acting right."He has pretty good reason, hasn't he?""I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory.He's so old and
lonely.""What's the matter with the rest of the family in Cleveland?Won't
they do anything for him?"I think maybe they don't want him, he's so cross," she said
simply."I hardly know what to suggest in that case," smiled Lester."The
old gentleman oughtn't to be so fussy.""I know," she said, "but he's old now, and he has had so much
trouble."Lester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork."I'll tell you
what I've been thinking, Jennie," he said finally."There's no use
living this way any longer, if we're going to stick it out.I've been
thinking that we might take a house out in Hyde Park.It's something
of a run from the office, but I'm not much for this apartment life.You and Vesta would be better off for a yard.In that case you might
bring your father on to live with us.He couldn't do any harm
pottering about; indeed, he might help keep things straight.""Oh, that would just suit papa, if he'd come," she replied."He
loves to fix things, and he'd cut the grass and look after the
furnace.But he won't come unless he's sure I'm married.""I don't know how that could be arranged unless you could show the
old gentleman a marriage certificate.He seems to want something that
can't be produced very well.A steady job he'd have running the
furnace of a country house," he added meditatively.Jennie did not notice the grimness of the jest.She was too busy
thinking what a tangle she had made of her life.Gerhardt would not
come now, even if they had a lovely home to share with him.And yet he
ought to be with Vesta again.She remained lost in a sad abstraction, until Lester, following the
drift of her thoughts, said: "I don't see how it can be arranged.Marriage certificate blanks aren't easily procurable.It's bad
business--a criminal offense to forge one, I believe.I wouldn't
want to be mixed up in that sort of thing.""Oh, I don't want you to do anything like that, Lester.I'm just
sorry papa is so stubborn.When he gets a notion you can't change
him.""Suppose we wait until we get settled after moving," he suggested."Then you can go to Cleveland and talk to him personally.It was
so decent that he rather wished he could help her carry out her
scheme.While not very interesting, Gerhardt was not objectionable to
Lester, and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around a big
place, why not?CHAPTER XXXVII


The plan for a residence in Hyde Park was not long in taking shape.After several weeks had passed, and things had quieted down again,
Lester invited Jennie to go with him to South Hyde Park to look for a
house.On the first trip they found something which seemed to suit
admirably--an old-time home of eleven large rooms, set in a lawn
fully two hundred feet square and shaded by trees which had been
planted when the city was young.It was ornate, homelike, peaceful.Jennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country, although
depressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home
under the right auspices.She had vaguely hoped that in planning to go
away she was bringing about a condition under which Lester might have
come after her and married her.She had
promised to stay, and she would have to make the best of it.She
suggested that they would never know what to do with so much room, but
he waved that aside."We will very likely have people in now and
then," he said."We can furnish it up anyhow, and see how it looks."He had the agent make out a five-year lease, with an option for
renewal, and set at once the forces to work to put the establishment
in order.The house was painted and decorated, the lawn put in order, and
everything done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance.There was a large, comfortable library and sitting-room, a big
dining-room, a handsome reception-hall, a parlor, a large kitchen,
serving-room, and in fact all the ground-floor essentials of a
comfortable home.On the second floor were bedrooms, baths, and the
maid's room.It was all very comfortable and harmonious, and Jennie
took an immense pride and pleasure in getting things in order.Immediately after moving in, Jennie, with Lester's permission,
wrote to her father asking him to come to her.She did not say that
she was married, but left it to be inferred.She descanted on the
beauty of the neighborhood, the size of the yard, and the manifold
conveniences of the establishment."It is so very nice," she added,
"you would like it, papa.Vesta is here and goes to school every day.Won't you come and stay with us?It's so much better than living in a
factory.Gerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance, Was it really
true?Would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently
united?Well, it was high time--but should he go?He had lived
alone this long time now--should he go to Chicago and live with
Jennie?Her appeal did touch him, but somehow he decided against it.That would be too generous an acknowledgment of the fact that there
had been fault on his side as well as on hers.Jennie was disappointed at Gerhardt's refusal.She talked it over
with Lester, and decided that she would go on to Cleveland and see
him.Accordingly, she made the trip, hunted up the factory, a great
rumbling furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city,
and inquired at the office for her father.The clerk directed her to a
distant warehouse, and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see
him.He crawled out of his humble cot and came down, curious as to who
it could be.When Jennie saw him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair
gray, his eye brows shaggy, coming out of the dark door, a keen sense
of the pathetic moved her again.He came
toward her, his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his
consciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit."I want you to come home with me, papa," she pleaded yearningly."I
don't want you to stay here any more.I can't think of you living
alone any longer.""So," he said, nonplussed, "that brings you?""Yes," she replied; "Won't you?"I have a good bed," he explained by way of apology for his
state."I know," she replied, "but we have a good home now and Vesta is
there."Yes," she replied, lying hopelessly."I have been married a long
time.She could scarcely look him
in the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her."Well," he said, "it is time.""Won't you come, papa?"He threw out his hands after his characteristic manner.The urgency
of her appeal touched him to the quick."Yes, I come," he said, and
turned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening.For answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his
things.CHAPTER XXXVIII


Gerhardt, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once
bestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively
concerned him.He took charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at
the thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had
nothing to do.The trees, he declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful
condition.If Lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would
attend to them in the spring.In Germany they knew how to care for
such things, but these Americans were so shiftless.Then he wanted
tools and nails, and in time all the closets and shelves were put in
order.He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away, and declared
that it was better than the one in Cleveland.The pastor, of course,
was a heaven-sent son of divinity.And nothing would do but that Vesta
must go to church with him regularly.Jennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with
some misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise.On the North
Side it had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing.Now they were occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate
neighbors would feel it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to
play the part of an experienced hostess.She and Lester had talked
this situation over.It might as well be understood here, he said,
that they were husband and wife.Vesta was to be introduced as
Jennie's daughter by her first marriage, her husband, a Mr.Stover
(her mother's maiden name), having died immediately after the child's
birth.Lester, of course, was the stepfather.This particular
neighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of Chicago that
Lester did not expect to run into many of his friends.He explained to
Jennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so that when
the first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.Within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs.Jacob Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular
section.She lived five doors from Jennie--the houses of the
neighborhood were all set in spacious lawns--and drove up in her
carriage, on her return from her shopping, one afternoon.she asked of Jeannette, the new maid."I think so, mam," answered the girl."Won't you let me have your
card?"The card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it
curiously.When Jennie came into the parlor Mrs.Stendahl, a tall dark,
inquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially."I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you," she said
most winningly.I live on the other side
of the street, some few doors up.Perhaps you have seen the
house--the one with the white stone gate-posts.""Oh, yes indeed," replied Jennie.Kane and I
were admiring it the first day we came out here.""I know of your husband, of course, by reputation.My husband is
connected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company."She knew that the latter concern must be
something important and profitable from the way in which Mrs."We have lived here quite a number of years, and I know how you
must feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city.I
hope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon."Indeed I shall," answered Jennie, a little nervously, for the
ordeal was a trying one.Kane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure he would
be most pleased to meet you and your husband.""You must both come over some evening," replied Mrs.Jennie smiled her assurances of good-will.Stendahl to the door, and shook hands with her."I'm so glad to find
you so charming," observed Mrs."Oh, thank you," said Jennie flushing a little."I'm sure I don't
deserve so much praise.""Well, now I will expect you some afternoon.Good-by," and she
waved a gracious farewell."That wasn't so bad," thought Jennie as she watched Mrs.Timothy Ballinger--all of whom left
cards, or stayed to chat a few minutes.Jennie found herself taken
quite seriously as a woman of importance, and she did her best to
support the dignity of her position.And, indeed, she did
exceptionally well.She had a
kindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded in making a
most favorable impression.She explained to her guests that she had
been living on the North Side until recently, that her husband,
Mr.Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park, that her father
and daughter were living here, and that Lester was the child's
stepfather.She said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and
to be a good neighbor.Lester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care
to meet these people.Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way.She liked
making new friends, and she was hoping that something definite could
be worked out here which would make Lester look upon her as a good
wife and an ideal companion.Perhaps, some day, he might really want
to marry her.First impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to
discover.The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too
hastily, and now rumors began to fly about.Sommerville,
calling on Mrs.Craig, one of Jennie's near neighbors, intimated that
she knew who Lester was--"oh, yes, indeed.You know, my dear,"
she went on, "his reputation is just a little--" she raised her
eyebrows and her hand at the same time."He looks like
such a staid, conservative person.""Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is," went on Mrs."His
family is of the very best.There was some young woman he went
with--so my husband tells me.I don't know whether this is the
one or not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such
name as that, when they were living together as husband and wife on
the North Side."Craig with her tongue at this
astonishing news.Come to think of it, it must be
the same woman.It
seems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with
her--at least there was a child.Whether he married her afterward
or not, I don't know.Anyhow, I understand his family will not have
anything to do with her.""And to think he
should have married her afterward, if he really did.I'm sure you
can't tell with whom you're coming in contact these days, can
you?""Well, it may be," went on her guest, "that this isn't the same
woman after all.She told me they had been living
on the North Side.""Then I'm sure it's the same person.How curious that you should
speak of her!""It is, indeed," went on Mrs.Craig, who was speculating as to what
her attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.There were people who had
seen Jennie and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been
introduced to her as Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family
thought.Of course her present position, the handsome house, the
wealth of Lester, the beauty of Vesta--all these things helped to
soften the situation.She was apparently too circumspect, too much the
good wife and mother, too really nice to be angry with; but she had a
past, and that had to be taken into consideration.An opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when
Vesta, returning from school, suddenly asked: "Mamma, who was my
papa?""His name was Stover, dear," replied her mother, struck at once by
the thought that there might have been some criticism--that some
one must have been saying something.continued Vesta, ignoring the last inquiry, and
interested in clearing up her own identity."Anita Ballinger said I didn't have any papa, and that you weren't
ever married when you had me.She said I wasn't a really, truly girl
at all--just a nobody.Ballinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious
and helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter
had said this to Vesta."You mustn't pay any attention to her, dearie," said Jennie at
last.Stover, and you were born
in Columbus.Of course they say
nasty things when they fight--sometimes things they don't really
mean.Just let her alone and don't go near her any more.Then she
won't say anything to you."It was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time
being."I'll slap her if she tries to slap me," she persisted."You mustn't go near her, pet, do you hear?Then she can't try to
slap you," returned her mother."Just go about your studies, and don't
mind her.She can't quarrel with you if you don't let her."Vesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words.It is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound
opened from time to time by additional stabs.One day Jennie, having
gone to call on Mrs.Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met
a Mrs.Williston Baker, who was there taking tea.Baker knew of
the Kanes, of Jennie's history on the North Side, and of the attitude
of the Kane family.She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman,
somewhat on the order of Mrs.Bracebridge, and very careful of her
social connections.Field a woman of
the same rigid circumspectness of attitude, and when she found Jennie
calling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated.Field, introducing her guests with a
smiling countenance."Indeed," she went on freezingly."I've heard a great deal about
Mrs.--" accenting the word "Mrs.--Lester Kane."Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started
an intimate conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share.Jennie stood helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would
be suitable to so trying a situation.Baker soon announced her
departure, although she had intended to stay longer."I can't remain
another minute," she said; "I promised Mrs.Neil that I would stop in
to see her to-day.I'm sure I've bored you enough already as it
is."She walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she
was nearly out of the room.Then she looked in her direction, and gave
her a frigid nod."We meet such curious people now and again," she observed finally
to her hostess as she swept away.Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was
in no notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other
middle-class woman of means, to get along.Williston Baker, who was socially so much more important than
Jennie.She came back to where Jennie was sitting, smiling
apologetically, but she was a little bit flustered.Jennie was out of
countenance, of course.Presently she excused herself and went home.She had been cut deeply by the slight offered her, and she felt that
Mrs.Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up.There would be no additional exchange of visits there--that she
knew.The old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a
failure.It couldn't be made right, or, if it could, it wouldn't be.Lester was not inclined to marry her and put her right.Time went on and matters remained very much as they were.To look
at this large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its
vines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing
themselves into a transparent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering
about the yard, Vesta coming home from school, Lester leaving in the
morning in his smart trap--one would have said that here is peace
and plenty, no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming
home.And as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run
smoothly.It is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only
a very few of them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the
deprivation was hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to
please and interest.Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play
quite well.Jennie was a charming figure
in blue, lavender, and olive-green house-gowns as she went about her
affairs, sewing, dusting, getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that
things generally were put to rights.Gerhardt busied himself about his
multitudinous duties, for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands
into all the domestic economies of the household.One of his
self-imposed tasks was to go about the house after Lester, or the
servants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs which might
accidentally have been left burning.Again, Lester's expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside
after a few month's use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old
German.Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of
a few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole.Gerhardt was for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old
man's querulous inquiry as to what was wrong "with them shoes" by
saying that they weren't comfortable any more.No
good can come of anything like that, It will mean want one of these
days.""He can't help it, papa," Jennie excused."That's the way he was
raised."These Americans, they know nothing of
economy.Then they would know
what a dollar can do."Lester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled.Another grievance was Lester's extravagant use of matches.He had
the habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of
lighting his cigar, and then throwing it away.Sometimes he would
begin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually
do so, tossing aside match after match.There was a place out in one
corner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer
evening, smoking and throwing away half-burned matches.Jennie would
sit with him, and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out
on the lawn.At one time, while engaged in cutting the grass, Gerhardt
found, to his horror, not a handful, but literally boxes of
half-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the
fallen blades.He gathered up
this damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the
sitting-room where Jennie was sewing.That man,
he has no more sense of economy than a--than a--" the right
term failed him."He sits and smokes, and this is the way he uses
matches.Five cents a box they cost--five cents.How can a man
hope to do well and carry on like that, I like to know."Lester is extravagant," she
said.At least they should be
burned in the furnace.He would have used them as lighters for his own
pipe, sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers
were better, and he had stacks of these--another evidence of his
lord and master's wretched, spendthrift disposition.It was a sad
world to work in.Still he fought
as valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance.He would wear the same suit of
black--cut down from one of Lester's expensive investments of
years before--every Sunday for a couple of years.Lester's shoes,
by a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit,
and these he wore.His old ties also--the black ones--they
were fine.If he could have cut down Lester's shirts he would have
done so; he did make over the underwear, with the friendly aid of the
cook's needle.Lester's socks, of course, were just right.There was
never any expense for Gerhardt's clothing.The remaining stock of Lester's discarded clothing--shoes,
shirts, collars, suits, ties, and what not--he would store away
for weeks and months, and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he
would call in a tailor, or an old-shoe man, or a ragman, and dispose
of the lot at the best price he could.He learned that all second-hand
clothes men were sharks; that there was no use in putting the least
faith in the protests of any rag dealer or old-shoe man.They all claimed to be very poor, when as a matter of fact they
were actually rolling in wealth.Gerhardt had investigated these
stories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they were doing
with the things he sold them."They offer me ten cents for a pair of
shoes, and then I see them hanging out in front of their places marked
two dollars.They could afford to give me a
dollar."It was only to her that he complained, for he could
expect no sympathy from' Lester.So far as his own meager store of
money was concerned, he gave the most of it to his beloved church,
where he was considered to be a model of propriety, honesty,
faith--in fact, the embodiment of all the virtues.And so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially,
Jennie was now leading the dream years of her existence.Lester, in
spite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of
his career, was invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to
enjoy his home life.she would ask when he came in of an
evening.he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.She would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take
his coat and hat.In the winter-time they would sit in the library
before the big grate-fire.In the spring, summer, or fall Lester
preferred to walk out on the porch, one corner of which commanded a
sweeping view of the lawn and the distant street, and light his
before-dinner cigar.Jennie would sit on the side of his chair and
stroke his head."Your hair is not getting the least bit thin, Lester;
aren't you glad?"she would say; or, "Oh, see how your brow is
wrinkled now.You didn't change your tie, mister,
this morning."Oh, I forgot," he would answer, or he would cause the wrinkles to
disappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if
he wasn't so now.In the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was
not less loving, though a little more circumspect.She loved odd
puzzles like pigs in clover, the spider's hole, baby billiards, and
the like.He would work by
the hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right.Jennie
was clever at solving these mechanical problems.Sometimes she would
have to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely
pleased with herself.At other times she would stand behind him
watching, her chin on his shoulder, her arms about his neck.He seemed
not to mind--indeed, he was happy in the wealth of affection she
bestowed.Her cleverness, her gentleness, her tact created an
atmosphere which was immensely pleasing; above all her youth and
beauty appealed to him.It made him feel young, and if there was one
thing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up into an
aimless old age."I want to keep young, or die young," was one of his
pet remarks; and Jennie came to understand.She was glad that she was
so much younger now for his sake.Another pleasant feature of the home life was Lester's steadily
increasing affection for Vesta.The child would sit at the big table
in the library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would
sew, and Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran
papers.It grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go
to a German Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to
nothing of the sort."We'll not have any thick-headed German training
in this," he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had
complained."The public schools are good enough for any child.There were really some delightful hours among the four.Lester
liked to take the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees
and tease her.He liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to
propound its paradoxes, and watch how the child's budding mind took
them.he would ask; and being informed that it was
"what we drink," he would stare and say, "That's so, but what is it?Don't they teach you any better than that?""Well, it is what we drink, isn't it?""The fact that we drink it doesn't explain what it is," he would
retort."You ask your teacher what water is"; and then he would leave
her with this irritating problem troubling her young soul.Food, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its
chemical constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these
dark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance
of things until she was actually in awe of him.She had a way of
showing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the
morning, a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her
appearance.He wanted her to look smart, he insisted on a big bow of
blue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her shoes be changed from
low quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons'
and that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her
complexion and disposition."That child's light and gay by disposition.Don't put anything
somber on her," he once remarked.Jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and
would say, "Run to your papa and show him how you look."Vesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,
"See."He grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when
they drove he would always have her in between them.He insisted that
Jennie send her to dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself
with rage and grief."Such
devil's fol-de-rol.To make a no-good
out of her--a creature to be ashamed of?""Oh no, papa," replied Jennie.A fine lot he knows about what is good
for a child.A card-player, a whisky-drinker!""Now, hush, papa; I won't have you talk like that," Jennie would
reply warmly."He's a good man, and you know it."When Lester was near he said nothing, and
Vesta could wind him around her finger."Oh you," she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled
cheek.There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this.He
lost control of himself--something welled up and choked his
throat."Yes, I know how you do," he would exclaim.It was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless
she herself willed it.Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do
anything with him; he was always her devoted servitor.CHAPTER XXXIX


During this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with
Lester's irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger.That it could
not help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was
sufficiently obvious to them.People
seemed to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said
directly.Kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to
fly in the face of conventions in this manner.If the woman had been
some one of distinction--some sorceress of the stage, or of the
world of art, or letters, his action would have been explicable if not
commendable, but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities, as
Louise had described her, this putty-faced nobody--he could not
possibly understand it.Lester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had
not settled down in the ordinary way.Look at the women in Cincinnati
who knew him and liked him.Why in the
name of common sense had he not married her?She was good looking,
sympathetic, talented.The old man grieved bitterly, and then, by
degrees, he began to harden.It seemed a shame that Lester should
treat him so.It wasn't natural, or justifiable, or decent.Archibald
Kane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be
enforced, but just what it should be he could not say.Lester was his
own boss, and he would resent any criticism of his actions.Certain changes helped along an approaching denouement.Louise
married not many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago,
and then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting
grandchildren.Lester did not attend the wedding, though he was
invited.Kane died, making a readjustment of
the family will necessary.Lester came home on this occasion, grieved
to think he had lately seen so little of his mother--that he had
caused her so much pain--but he had no explanation to make.His
father thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because
of his obvious gloom.He went back to Chicago, and there were more
months of silence.Kane's death and Louise's marriage, the father went to
live with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his
greatest pleasure in his old age.The business, except for the final
adjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert's hands.The latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their
husbands and to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped
to obtain.He was not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a
shrewd, cold business man, far shrewder than his brother gave him
credit for.He was already richer than any two of the other children
put together, but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty
of fortune.He realized the danger of envy, and preferred a Spartan
form of existence, putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very
ready and very hard cash.While Lester was drifting Robert was
working--working all the time.Robert's scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in
the control of the business was really not very essential, for his
father, after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation,
had come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his
property ought not to go to Lester.Obviously, Lester was not so
strong a man as he had thought him to be.Of the two brothers, Lester
might be the bigger intellectually or
sympathetically--artistically and socially there was no
comparison--but Robert got commercial results in a silent,
effective way.If Lester was not going to pull himself together at
this stage of the game, when would he?Better leave his property to
those who would take care of it.Archibald Kane thought seriously of
having his lawyer revise his will in such a way that, unless Lester
should reform, he would be cut off with only a nominal income.But he
decided to give Lester one more chance--to make a plea, in fact,
that he should abandon his false way of living, and put himself on a
sound basis before the world.Old
Archibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at
his convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was
in Cincinnati."I thought I'd have one more talk with you, Lester, on a subject
that's rather difficult for me to bring up," began the elder Kane."Yes, I know," replied Lester, calmly."I used to think, when I was much younger that my son's matrimonial
ventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that score
when I got a little farther along.I began to see through my business
connections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and
then I got rather anxious that my boys should marry well.I used to
worry about you, Lester, and I'm worrying yet.This recent connection
you've made has caused me no end of trouble.It worried your mother up
to the very last.Don't you think you
have gone far enough with it?What
it is in Chicago I don't know, but it can't be a secret.That can't
help the house in business there.The
whole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects
all around, and yet you continue."I suppose because I love her," Lester replied."You can't be serious in that," said his father."If you had loved
her, you'd have married her in the first place.Surely you wouldn't
take a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,
disgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her.You
may have a passion for her, but it isn't love.""How do you know I haven't married her?"He
wanted to see how his father would take to that idea.The old gentleman propped himself up on his
arms and looked at him."No, I'm not," replied Lester, "but I might be.I can't believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,
Lester.Why, you've lived in open adultery
with her for years, and now you talk of marrying her.Why, in heaven's
name, if you were going to do anything like that, didn't you do it in
the first place?Disgrace your parents, break your mother's heart,
injure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause
of it?"Don't get excited, father," said Lester quickly."We won't get
anywhere that way.She's not a bad woman, and
I wish you wouldn't talk about her as you do."I know enough," insisted old Archibald, determinedly."I know that
no good woman would act as she has done.Why, man, she's after your
money.It's as plain as the nose on your
face.""Father," said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, "why do you
talk like that?You wouldn't know her from
Adam's off ox.Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and
you people swallow it whole.She isn't as bad as you think she is, and
I wouldn't use the language you're using about her if I were you.You're doing a good woman an injustice, and you won't, for some
reason, be fair."Is it
fair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the
streets and live with her?Is it--"

"Stop now, father," exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand.You're talking about the woman
that I'm living with--that I may marry.I love you, but I won't
have you saying things that aren't so.She isn't a woman of the
streets.You know, as well as you know anything, that I wouldn't take
up with a woman of that kind.We'll have to discuss this in a calmer
mood, or I won't stay here.But I won't
listen to any such language as that."In spite of his opposition, he
respected his son's point of view.He sat back in his chair and stared
at the floor."No, we've moved out to Hyde Park."Well, that's a God's blessing.""I didn't say that," replied his son.exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling again.How do you
suppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune
to a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as
right and proper?Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family,
your personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you.I
can't understand what has happened to your pride.It seems like some
wild, impossible fancy.""It's pretty hard to explain, father, and I can't do it very well.I simply know that I'm in this affair, and that I'm bound to see it
through.I'm not prepared now to say what I'll do.Old Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly."You've made a bad mess of this, Lester," he said finally.But I suppose you are determined to go your way.Nothing
that I have said appears to move you.""Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration
for the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will
make a difference in my will.I can't go on countenancing this thing,
and not be a party to it morally and every other way.You can leave her, or you can marry her.You certainly ought to do one
or the other.If you leave her, everything will be all right.You can
make any provision for her you like.I'll
gladly pay whatever you agree to.You will share with the rest of the
children, just as I had planned.If you marry her it will make a
difference.I'm doing what I think is my bounden duty.Now you think
that over and let me know."He felt that
his father probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie,
and justify himself to himself?The old gentleman loved him even now--he could see
it.Lester felt troubled and distressed; this attempt at coercion
irritated him.The idea--he, Lester Kane, being made to do such a
thing to throw Jennie down.Old Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet."Well," said Lester finally, "there's no use of our discussing it
any further now--that's certain, isn't it?I can't say what I'll
do.Lester was sorry for the world's
attitude and for his father's keen feeling about the affair.Kane
senior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing
through.He wasn't sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but he
was hopeful."Good-by, father," said Lester, holding out his hand."I think I'll
try and make that two-ten train.There isn't anything else you wanted
to see me about?"The old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply.What a foolhardy
persistence in evil and error!He
was the one to control a business.It was a long time
before he stirred.And still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring
son continued to appeal to him.CHAPTER XL


Lester returned to Chicago.He realized that he had offended his
father seriously, how seriously he could not say.In all his personal
relations with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up.But
even now Lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he
hardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he
hoped to retain his father's affection and confidence.As for the
world at large, what did it matter how much people talked or what they
said.People turn so
quickly from weakness or the shadow of it.To get away from
failure--even the mere suspicion of it--that seems to be a
subconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid
non-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious.Lester was
soon to feel the force of this prejudice.One day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire
head of Dodge, Holbrook & Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the
dry-goods world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world.Dodge had been one of Lester's best friends.He knew him as intimately
as he knew Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of
Cincinnati.He visited at his handsome home on the North Shore Drive,
and they met constantly in a business and social way.But since Lester
had moved out to Hyde Park, the old intimacy had lapsed.Now they came
face to face on Michigan Avenue near the Kane building."Why, Lester, I'm glad to see you again," said Dodge.He extended a formal hand, and seemed just a little cool."I hear
you've gone and married since I saw you.""No, nothing like that," replied Lester, easily, with the air of
one who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense."Why so secret about it, if you have?"asked Dodge, attempting to
smile, but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth.He was trying
to be nice, and to go through a difficult situation gracefully."We
fellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing."Well," said Lester, feeling the edge of the social blade that was
being driven into him, "I thought I'd do it in a new way.I'm not much
for excitement in that direction, anyhow.""It is a matter of taste, isn't it?""You're living in the city, of course?"And he
deftly changed the subject before waving him a perfunctory
farewell.Lester missed at once the inquiries which a man like Dodge would
have made if he had really believed that he was married.Under
ordinary circumstances his friend would have wanted to know a great
deal about the new Mrs.There would have been all those little
familiar touches common to people living on the same social plane.Dodge would have asked Lester to bring his wife over to see them,
would have definitely promised to call.Nothing of the sort happened,
and Lester noticed the significant omission.It was the same with the Burnham Moores, the Henry Aldriches, and a
score of other people whom he knew equally well.Apparently they all
thought that he had married and settled down.They were interested to
know where he was living, and they were rather disposed to joke him
about being so very secretive on the subject, but they were not
willing to discuss the supposed Mrs.He was beginning to see
that this move of his was going to tell against him notably.One of the worst stabs--it was the cruelest because, in a way,
it was the most unintentional--he received from an old
acquaintance, Will Whitney, at the Union Club.Lester was dining there
one evening, and Whitney met him in the main reading-room as he was
crossing from the cloak-room to the cigar-stand.The latter was a
typical society figure, tall, lean, smooth-faced, immaculately garbed,
a little cynical, and to-night a little the worse for liquor.he called out, "what's this talk about a menage
of yours out in Hyde Park?How are you going
to explain all this to your wife when you get married?""I don't have to explain it," replied Lester irritably."Why should
you be so interested in my affairs?You're not living in a stone
house, are you?"that's pretty good now, isn't it?You didn't marry
that little beauty you used to travel around with on the North Side,
did you?You didn't, now,
did you?""Cut it out, Whitney," said Lester roughly."Pardon, Lester," said the other aimlessly, but sobering.Eight whisky-sours
straight in the other room there.I'll talk to you some time
when I'm all right.I'm a little loose,
that's right.Lester could not get over that cacophonous "ha!It cut him,
even though it came from a drunken man's mouth."That little beauty
you used to travel with on the North Side.You didn't marry her, did
you?"He quoted Whitney's impertinences resentfully.He had never endured anything like this
before--he, Lester Kane.Certainly he was
paying dearly for trying to do the kind thing by Jennie.CHAPTER XLI


But worse was to follow.The American public likes gossip about
well-known people, and the Kanes were wealthy and socially prominent.The report was that Lester, one of its principal heirs, had married a
servant girl.What a
piquant morsel for the newspapers!Very soon the paragraphs began to
appear.A small society paper, called the South Side Budget,
referred to him anonymously as "the son of a famous and wealthy
carriage manufacturer of Cincinnati," and outlined briefly what it
knew of the story.----" it went on, sagely, "not
so much is known, except that she once worked in a well-known
Cleveland society family as a maid and was, before that, a
working-girl in Columbus, Ohio.After such a picturesque love-affair
in high society, who shall say that romance is dead?"He did not take the paper, but some kind soul
took good care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him.It
irritated him greatly, for he suspected at once that it was a scheme
to blackmail him.But he did not know exactly what to do about it.He
preferred, of course, that such comments should cease, but he also
thought that if he made any effort to have them stopped he might make
matters worse.Naturally, the paragraph in the
Budget attracted the attention of other newspapers.It sounded
like a good story, and one Sunday editor, more enterprising than the
others, conceived the notion of having this romance written up.A
full-page Sunday story with a scare-head such as "Sacrifices Millions
for His Servant Girl Love," pictures of Lester, Jennie, the house at
Hyde Park, the Kane manufactory at Cincinnati, the warehouse on
Michigan Avenue--certainly, such a display would make a
sensation.The Kane Company was not an advertiser in any daily or
Sunday paper.If Lester had been
forewarned he might have put a stop to the whole business by putting
an advertisement in the paper or appealing to the publisher.He did
not know, however, and so was without power to prevent the
publication.The editor made a thorough job of the business.Local
newspaper men in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus were instructed
to report by wire whether anything of Jennie's history was known in
their city.The Bracebridge family in Cleveland was asked whether
Jennie had ever worked there.A garbled history of the Gerhardts was
obtained from Columbus.Jennie's residence on the North Side, for
several years prior to her supposed marriage, was discovered and so
the whole story was nicely pieced together.It was not the idea of the
newspaper editor to be cruel or critical, but rather complimentary.All the bitter things, such as the probable illegitimacy of Vesta, the
suspected immorality of Lester and Jennie in residing together as man
and wife, the real grounds of the well-known objections of his family
to the match, were ignored.The idea was to frame up a Romeo and
Juliet story in which Lester should appear as an ardent,
self-sacrificing lover, and Jennie as a poor and lovely working-girl,
lifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion of her
millionaire lover.An exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to make
scenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing
was handled in the most approved yellow-journal style.There was a
picture of Lester obtained from his Cincinnati photographer for a
consideration; Jennie had been surreptitiously "snapped" by a staff
artist while she was out walking.And so, apparently out of a clear sky, the story
appeared--highly complimentary, running over with sugary phrases,
but with all the dark, sad facts looming up in the background.Jennie
did not see it at first.Lester came across the page accidentally, and
tore it out.He was stunned and chagrined beyond words."To think the
damned newspaper would do that to a private citizen who was quietly
minding his own business!"He went out of the house, the
better to conceal his deep inward mortification.He avoided the more
populous parts of the town, particularly the down-town section, and
rode far out on Cottage Grove Avenue to the open prairie.He wondered,
as the trolley-car rumbled along, what his friends were
thinking--Dodge, and Burnham Moore, and Henry Aldrich, and the
others.The best he could do was to put a
brave face on it and say nothing, or else wave it off with an
indifferent motion of the hand.One thing was sure--he would
prevent further comment.He returned to the house calmer, his
self-poise restored, but he was eager for Monday to come in order that
he might get in touch with his lawyer, Mr.Watson it was soon agreed between the two men that it would be
foolish to take any legal action.It was the part of wisdom to let the
matter drop."But I won't stand for anything more," concluded
Lester."I'll attend to that," said the lawyer, consolingly."It's amazing--this damned country of ours!""A man with a little money hasn't any more privacy than a
public monument.""A man with a little money," said Mr.Watson, "is just like a cat
with a bell around its neck.Every rat knows exactly where it is and
what it is doing.""That's an apt simile," assented Lester, bitterly.Jennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days.Lester felt that he could not talk it over, and Gerhardt never read
the wicked Sunday newspapers.Finally, one of Jennie's neighborhood
friends, less tactful than the others, called her attention to the
fact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it."Why, I hadn't seen it," she said."Are you
sure it was about us?"I'll send Marie over with it when
I get back."I wish you would," she said, weakly.She was wondering where they had secured her picture, what the
article said.Above all, she was dismayed to think of its effect upon
Lester.Why had he not spoken to her about
it?The neighbor's daughter brought over the paper, and Jennie's heart
stood still as she glanced at the title-page.There it all
was--uncompromising and direct.How dreadfully conspicuous the
headline--"This Millionaire Fell in Love With This Lady's Maid,"
which ran between a picture of Lester on the left and Jennie on the
right.There was an additional caption which explained how Lester, son
of the famous carriage family of Cincinnati, had sacrificed great
social opportunity and distinction to marry his heart's desire.Below
were scattered a number of other pictures--Lester addressing
Jennie in the mansion of Mrs.Bracebridge, Lester standing with her
before an imposing and conventional-looking parson, Lester driving
with her in a handsome victoria, Jennie standing beside the window of
an imposing mansion (the fact that it was a mansion being indicated by
most sumptuous-looking hangings) and gazing out on a very modest
working-man's cottage pictured in the distance.Jennie felt as though
she must die for very shame.She did not so much mind what it meant to
her, but Lester, Lester, how must he feel?Now they
would have another club with which to strike him and her.She tried to
keep calm about it, to exert emotional control, but again the tears
would rise, only this time they were tears of opposition to defeat.She did not want to be hounded this way.Why couldn't the world help her,
instead of seeking to push her down?CHAPTER XLII


The fact that Lester had seen this page was made perfectly clear to
Jennie that evening, for he brought it home himself, having concluded,
after mature deliberation, that he ought to.He had told her once that
there was to be no concealment between them, and this thing, coming so
brutally to disturb their peace, was nevertheless a case in point.He
had decided to tell her not to think anything of it--that it did
not make much difference, though to him it made all the difference in
the world.The effect of this chill history could never be undone.The
wise--and they included all his social world and many who were
not of it--could see just how he had been living.The article
which accompanied the pictures told how he had followed Jennie from
Cleveland to Chicago, how she had been coy and distant and that he had
to court her a long time to win her consent.This was to explain their
living together on the North Side.Lester realized that this was an
asinine attempt to sugar-coat the true story and it made him angry.Still he preferred to have it that way rather than in some more brutal
vein.He took the paper out of his pocket when he arrived at the
house, spreading it on the library table.Jennie, who was close by,
watched him, for she knew what was coming."Here's something that will interest you, Jennie," he said dryly,
pointing to the array of text and pictures."I've already seen it, Lester," she said wearily.Stendahl
showed it to me this afternoon."Rather high-flown description of my attitude, isn't it?I didn't
know I was such an ardent Romeo.""I'm awfully sorry, Lester," said Jennie, reading behind the dry
face of humor the serious import of this affair to him.She had long
since learned that Lester did not express his real feeling, his big
ills in words.He was inclined to jest and make light of the
inevitable, the inexorable.This light comment merely meant "this
matter cannot be helped, so we will make the best of it.""Oh, don't feel badly about it," he went on."It isn't anything
which can be adjusted now.We just
happen to be in the limelight.""I understand," said Jennie, coming over to him."I'm sorry,
though, anyway."Dinner was announced a moment later and the incident
was closed.But Lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting
in a bad way.His father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at
the last interview, and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the
climax.He might as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his
old world.It would have none of him, or at least the more
conservative part of it would not.There were a few bachelors, a few
gay married men, some sophisticated women, single and married, who saw
through it all and liked him just the same, but they did not make
society.He was virtually an outcast, and nothing could save him but
to reform his ways; in other words, he must give up Jennie once and
for all.The thought was painful to
him--objectionable in every way.Jennie was growing in mental
acumen.She was beginning to see things quite as clearly as he did.She was not a cheap, ambitious, climbing creature.She was a big woman
and a good one.It would be a shame to throw her down, and besides she
was good-looking.He was forty-six and she was twenty-nine; and she
looked twenty-four or five.It is an exceptional thing to find beauty,
youth, compatibility, intelligence, your own point of
view--softened and charmingly emotionalized--in another.He
had made his bed, as his father had said.It was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper
incident that Lester had word that his father was quite ill and
failing; it might be necessary for him to go to Cincinnati at any
moment.Pressure of work was holding him pretty close when the news
came that his father was dead.Lester, of course, was greatly shocked
and grieved, and he returned to Cincinnati in a retrospective and
sorrowful mood.His father had been a great character to him--a
fine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside from his
relationship to him as his son.He remembered him now dandling him
upon his knee as a child, telling him stories of his early life in
Ireland, and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a
little older, impressing the maxims of his business career and his
commercial wisdom on him as he grew to manhood.Old Archibald had been
radically honest.It was to him that Lester owed his instincts for
plain speech and direct statement of fact."Never lie," was
Archibald's constant, reiterated statement."Never try to make a thing
look different from what it is to you.It's the breath of
life--truth--it's the basis of real worth, while commercial
success--it will make a notable character of any one who will
stick to it."He admired his father intensely
for his rigid insistence on truth, and now that he was really gone he
felt sorry.He wished he might have been spared to be reconciled to
him.He half fancied that old Archibald would have liked Jennie if he
had known her.He did not imagine that he would ever have had the
opportunity to straighten things out, although he still felt that
Archibald would have liked her.When he reached Cincinnati it was snowing, a windy, blustery snow.The traffic of the city
had a muffled sound.When he stepped down from the train he was met by
Amy, who was glad to see him in spite of all their past differences.Of all the girls she was the most tolerant.Lester put his arms about
her, and kissed her."It seems like old times to see you, Amy," he said, "your coming to
meet me this way.Well,
poor father, his time had to come.Still, he lived to see everything
that he wanted to see.I guess he was pretty well satisfied with the
outcome of his efforts.""Yes," replied Amy, "and since mother died he was very lonely."They rode up to the house in kindly good feeling, chatting of old
times and places.All the members of the immediate family, and the
various relatives, were gathered in the old family mansion.Lester
exchanged the customary condolences with the others, realizing all the
while that his father had lived long enough.He had had a successful
life, and had fallen like a ripe apple from the tree.Lester looked at
him where he lay in the great parlor, in his black coffin, and a
feeling of the old-time affection swept over him.He smiled at the
clean-cut, determined, conscientious face."The old gentleman was a big man all the way through," he said to
Robert, who was present."We won't find a better figure of a man
soon.""We will not," said his brother, solemnly.After the funeral it was decided to read the will at once.Louise's
husband was anxious to return to Buffalo; Lester was compelled to be
in Chicago.A conference of the various members of the family was
called for the second day after the funeral, to be held at the offices
of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, counselors of the late
manufacturer.As Lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father
had not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests.It had not been
so very long since they had had their last conversation; he had been
taking his time to think about things, and his father had given him
time.He always felt that he had stood well with the old gentleman,
except for his alliance with Jennie.His business judgment had been
valuable to the company.Why should there be any discrimination
against him?When they reached the offices of the law firm, Mr.O'Brien, a
short, fussy, albeit comfortable-looking little person, greeted all
the members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a
hearty handshake.He had been personal counsel to Archibald Kane for
twenty years.He knew his whims and idiosyncrasies, and considered
himself very much in the light of a father confessor.He liked all the
children, Lester especially."Now I believe we are all here," he said, finally, extracting a
pair of large horn reading-glasses from his coat pocket and looking
sagely about.I will
just read the will without any preliminary remarks."He turned to his desk, picked up a paper lying upon it, cleared his
throat, and began.It was a peculiar document, in some respects, for it began with all
the minor bequests; first, small sums to old employees, servants, and
friends.It then took up a few institutional bequests, and finally
came to the immediate family, beginning with the girls.Imogene, as a
faithful and loving daughter was left a sixth of the stock of the
carriage company and a fourth of the remaining properties of the
deceased, which roughly aggregated (the estate--not her share)
about eight hundred thousand dollars.Amy and Louise were provided for
in exactly the same proportion.The grandchildren were given certain
little bonuses for good conduct, when they should come of age.Then it
took up the cases of Robert and Lester."Owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of
my son Lester," it began, "I deem it my duty to make certain
conditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of my
property, to wit: One-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing
Company and one-fourth of the remainder of my various properties,
real, personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to go to my beloved son
Robert, in recognition of the faithful performance of his duty, and
one-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing Company and the
remaining fourth of my various properties, real, personal, moneys,
stocks and bonds, to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his
brother Lester, until such time as such conditions as may hereinafter
be set forth shall have been complied with.And it is my wish and
desire that my children shall concur in his direction of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, and of such other interests as are entrusted to
him, until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such control,
or shall indicate another arrangement which shall be better."His cheeks changed color, but he did
not move.It appeared that he was
not even mentioned separately.The conditions "hereinafter set forth" dealt very fully with his
case, however, though they were not read aloud to the family at the
time, Mr.O'Brien stating that this was in accordance with their
father's wish.Lester learned immediately afterward that he was to
have ten thousand a year for three years, during which time he had the
choice of doing either one of two things: First, he was to leave
Jennie, if he had not already married her, and so bring his life into
moral conformity with the wishes of his father.In this event Lester's
share of the estate was to be immediately turned over to him.Secondly, he might elect to marry Jennie, if he had not already done
so, in which case the ten thousand a year, specifically set aside to
him for three years, was to be continued for life--but for his
life only.Jennie was not to have anything of it after his death.The
ten thousand in question represented the annual interest on two
hundred shares of L. S. and M. S. stock which were also to be held in
trust until his decision had been reached and their final disposition
effected.If Lester refused to marry Jennie, or to leave her, he was
to have nothing at all after the three years were up.At Lester's
death the stock on which his interest was drawn was to be divided pro
rata among the surviving members of the family.If any heir or assign
contested the will, his or her share was thereby forfeited
entirely.It was astonishing to Lester to see how thoroughly his father had
taken his case into consideration.He half suspected, on reading these
conditions, that his brother Robert had had something to do with the
framing of them, but of course he could not be sure.Robert had not
given any direct evidence of enmity.he demanded of O'Brien, a little later."Well, we all had a hand in it," replied O'Brien, a little
shamefacedly."It was a very difficult document to draw up.Kane, there was no budging your father.He has
come very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses.Of
course, you know, we had nothing to do with its spirit.I hated very much to have to do it."During the reading of the will Lester had sat as stolid as an
ox.He got up after a time, as did the others, assuming an air of
nonchalance.Robert, Amy, Louise and Imogene all felt shocked, but not
exactly, not unqualifiedly regretful."I think the old gentleman has been a little rough in this," said
Robert, who had been sitting next him."I certainly did not expect him
to go as far as that.So far as I am concerned some other arrangement
would have been satisfactory."Imogene, Amy, and Louise were anxious to be consolatory, but they
did not know what to say."I
don't think papa acted quite right, Lester," ventured Amy, but Lester
waved her away almost gruffly.He figured out, as he stood there, what his income would be in case
he refused to comply with his father's wishes.Two hundred shares of
L. S. and M. S., in open market, were worth a little over one thousand
each.They yielded from five to six per cent., sometimes more,
sometimes less.At this rate he would have ten thousand a year, not
more.The family gathering broke up, each going his way, and Lester
returned to his sister's house.He wanted to get out of the city
quickly, gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one,
and caught the earliest train back to Chicago.So this was how much his father really cared for him!He, Lester Kane, ten thousand a year, for only three
years, and then longer only on condition that he married Jennie!"Ten
thousand a year," he thought, "and that for three years!To think he should have done that to
me!"CHAPTER XLIII


This attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely
set Lester in opposition to his family, at least for the time being.He had realized clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake;
first in not having married Jennie, thus avoiding scandal; and in the
second place in not having accepted her proposition at the time when
she wanted to leave him; There were no two ways about it, he had made
a mess of this business.He could not afford to lose his fortune
entirely.He did not have enough money of his own.Jennie was unhappy,
he could see that.Did he want
to accept the shabby ten thousand a year, even if he were willing to
marry her?Finally, did he want to lose Jennie, to have her go out of
his life once and for all?He could not make up his mind; the problem
was too complicated.When Lester returned to his home, after the funeral, Jennie saw at
once that something was amiss with him, something beyond a son's
natural grief for his father's death was weighing upon his spirits.She tried to draw near to him
sympathetically, but his wounded spirit could not be healed so easily.When hurt in his pride he was savage and sullen--he could have
struck any man who irritated him.She watched him interestedly,
wishing to do something for him, but he would not give her his
confidence.He grieved, and she could only grieve with him.Days passed, and now the financial situation which had been created
by his father's death came up for careful consideration.The factory
management had to be reorganized.Robert would have to be made
president, as his father wished.Lester's own relationship to the
business would have to come up for adjudication.Unless he changed his
mind about Jennie, he was not a stockholder.As a matter of fact, he
was not anything.To continue to be secretary and treasurer, it was
necessary that he should own at least one share of the company's
stock.Would the other members of the family care to do
anything which would infringe on Robert's prerogatives under the will?They were all rather unfriendly to Lester at present, and he realized
that he was facing a ticklish situation.The solution was--to get
rid of Jennie.If he did that he would not need to be begging for
stock.If he didn't, he was flying in the face of his father's last
will and testament.He turned the matter over in his mind slowly and
deliberately.He could quite see how things were coming out.He must
abandon either Jennie or his prospects in life.Despite Robert's assertion, that so far as he was concerned another
arrangement would have been satisfactory, he was really very well
pleased with the situation; his dreams were slowly nearing completion.Robert had long had his plans perfected, not only for a thorough
reorganization of the company proper, but for an extension of the
business in the direction of a combination of carriage companies.If
he could get two or three of the larger organizations in the East and
West to join with him, selling costs could be reduced, over-production
would be avoided, and the general expenses could be materially scaled
down.Through a New York representative, he had been picking up stock
in outside carriage companies for some time and he was almost ready to
act.In the first place he would have himself elected president of the
Kane Company, and since Lester was no longer a factor, he could select
Amy's husband as vice-president, and possibly some one other than
Lester as secretary and treasurer.Under the conditions of the will,
the stock and other properties set aside temporarily for Lester, in
the hope that he would come to his senses, were to be managed and
voted by Robert.His father had meant, obviously, that he, Robert,
should help him coerce his brother.He did not want to appear mean,
but this was such an easy way.It gave him a righteous duty to
perform.Lester must come to his senses or he must let Robert run the
business to suit himself.Lester, attending to his branch duties in Chicago, foresaw the
drift of things.He realized now that he was permanently out of the
company, a branch manager at his brother's sufferance, and the thought
irritated him greatly.Nothing had been said by Robert to indicate
that such a change had taken place--things went on very much as
before--but Robert's suggestions were now obviously law.Lester
was really his brother's employee at so much a year.There came a time, after a few weeks, when he felt as if he could
not stand this any longer.Hitherto he had been a free and independent
agent.The approaching annual stockholder's meeting which hitherto had
been a one-man affair and a formality, his father doing all the
voting, would be now a combination of voters, his brother presiding,
his sisters very likely represented by their husbands, and he not
there at all.It was going to be a great come-down, but as Robert had
not said anything about offering to give or sell him any stock which
would entitle him to sit as a director or hold any official position
in the company, he decided to write and resign.That would bring
matters to a crisis.It would show his brother that he felt no desire
to be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which
was not his--and gladly so--by right of ability and the
desire of those with whom he was associated.If he wanted to move back
into the company by deserting Jennie he would come in a very different
capacity from that of branch manager.He dictated a simple,
straight-forward business letter, saying:

"DEAR ROBERT, I know the time is drawing near when the company
must be reorganized under your direction.Not having any stock, I am
not entitled to sit as a director, or to hold the joint position of
secretary and treasurer.I want you to accept this letter as formal
notice of my resignation from both positions, and I want to have your
directors consider what disposition should be made of this position
and my services.I am not anxious to retain the branch-managership as
a branch-managership merely; at the same time I do not want to do
anything which will embarrass you in your plans for the future.You
see by this that I am not ready to accept the proposition laid down in
father's will--at least, not at present.I would like a definite
understanding of how you feel in this matter."Yours,

"LESTER."Robert, sitting in his office at Cincinnati, considered this letter
gravely.It was like his brother to come down to "brass tacks."If
Lester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct,
what a man he would be!But there was no guile in the man--no
subtlety.He would never do a snaky thing--and Robert knew, in
his own soul, that to succeed greatly one must."You have to be
ruthless at times--you have to be subtle," Robert would say to
himself."Why not face the facts to yourself when you are playing for
big stakes?"He would, for one, and he did.Robert felt that although Lester was a tremendously decent fellow
and his brother, he wasn't pliable enough to suit his needs.He was
too outspoken, too inclined to take issue.If Lester yielded to his
father's wishes, and took possession of his share of the estate, he
would become, necessarily, an active partner in the affairs of the
company.Lester would be a barrier in Robert's path.He much preferred that Lester should hold
fast to Jennie, for the present at least, and so be quietly shelved by
his own act.After long consideration, Robert dictated a politic letter.He
hadn't made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do.He did not know
what his sisters' husbands would like.For his part, he would be very glad to have Lester remain as
secretary and treasurer, if it could be arranged.Perhaps it would be
better to let the matter rest for the present.What did Robert mean by beating around the bush?He
knew well enough how it could be arranged.One share of stock would be
enough for Lester to qualify.Robert was afraid of him--that was
the basic fact.Well, he would not retain any branch-managership,
depend on that.Lester accordingly wrote
back, saying that he had considered all sides, and had decided to look
after some interests of his own, for the time being.If Robert could
arrange it, he would like to have some one come on to Chicago and take
over the branch agency.In a few
days came a regretful reply, saying that Robert was awfully sorry, but
that if Lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any
plans he might have in view.Imogene's husband, Jefferson Midgely, had
long thought he would like to reside in Chicago.He could undertake
the work for the time being.Evidently Robert was making the best of a very
subtle situation.Robert knew that he, Lester, could sue and tie
things up, and also that he would be very loath to do so.The
newspapers would get hold of the whole story.This matter of his
relationship to Jennie was in the air, anyhow.He could best solve the
problem by leaving her.CHAPTER XLIV


For a man of Lester's years--he was now forty-six--to be
tossed out in the world without a definite connection, even though he
did have a present income (including this new ten thousand) of fifteen
thousand a year, was a disturbing and discouraging thing.He realized
now that, unless he made some very fortunate and profitable
arrangements in the near future, his career was virtually at an end.That would give him the ten thousand
for the rest of his life, but it would also end his chance of getting
his legitimate share of the Kane estate.Again, he might sell out the
seventy-five thousand dollars' worth of moderate interest-bearing
stocks, which now yielded him about five thousand, and try a practical
investment of some kind--say a rival carriage company.But did he
want to jump in, at this stage of the game, and begin a running fight
on his father's old organization?Moreover, it would be a hard row to
hoe.There was the keenest rivalry for business as it was, with the
Kane Company very much in the lead.Lester's only available capital
was his seventy-five thousand dollars.Did he want to begin in a
picayune, obscure way?It took money to get a foothold in the carriage
business as things were now.The trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine
imagination and considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless,
narrow-minded insistence on his individual superiority which is a
necessary element in almost every great business success.To be a
forceful figure in the business world means, as a rule, that you must
be an individual of one idea, and that idea the God-given one that
life has destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field
you have chosen.It means that one thing, a cake of soap, a new
can-opener, a safety razor, or speed-accelerator, must seize on your
imagination with tremendous force, burn as a raging flame, and make
itself the be-all and end-all of your existence.As a rule, a man
needs poverty to help him to this enthusiasm, and youth.The thing he
has discovered, and with which he is going to busy himself, must be
the door to a thousand opportunities and a thousand joys.Happiness
must be beyond or the fire will not burn as brightly as it
might--the urge will not be great enough to make a great
success.Lester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm.Life had already shown him the greater part of its so-called joys.He
saw through the illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled
pleasure.Money, of course, was essential, and he had already had
money--enough to keep him comfortably.Certainly he could not
comfortably contemplate the thought of sitting by and watching other
people work for the rest of his days.In the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into
things.He was, as he said to himself, in no hurry; he was not going
to make a mistake.He would first give the trade, the people who were
identified with v he manufacture and sale of carriages, time to
realize that he was out of the Kane Company, for the time being,
anyhow, and open to other connections.So he announced that he was
leaving the Kane Company and going to Europe, ostensibly for a rest.He had never been abroad, and Jennie, too, would enjoy it.Vesta could
be left at home with Gerhardt and a maid, and he and Jennie would
travel around a bit, seeing what Europe had to show.He wanted to
visit Venice and Baden-Baden, and the great watering-places that had
been recommended to him.Cairo and Luxor and the Parthenon had always
appealed to his imagination.After he had had his outing he could come
back and seriously gather up the threads of his intentions.The spring after his father died, he put his plan into execution.He had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a pleasant
deliberation had studied out a tour.He made Jennie his confidante,
and now, having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a
steamer from New York to Liverpool.After a few weeks in the British
Isles they went to Egypt.From there they came back, through Greece
and Italy, into Austria and Switzerland, and then later, through
France and Paris, to Germany and Berlin.Lester was diverted by the
novelty of the experience and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that
he was wasting his time.Great business enterprises were not built by
travelers, and he was not looking for health.Jennie, on the other hand, was transported by what she saw, and
enjoyed the new life to the full.Before Luxor and Karnak--places
which Jennie had never dreamed existed--she learned of an older
civilization, powerful, complex, complete.Millions of people had
lived and died here, believing in other gods, other forms of
government, other conditions of existence.For the first time in her
life Jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is.Now from
this point of view--of decayed Greece, of fallen Rome, of
forgotten Egypt, she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties, our
minor beliefs.Her father's Lutheranism--it did not seem so
significant any more; and the social economy of Columbus,
Ohio--rather pointless, perhaps.Her mother had worried so of
what people--her neighbors--thought, but here were dead
worlds of people, some bad, some good.Lester explained that their
differences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate,
sometimes to religious beliefs, and sometimes to the rise of peculiar
personalities like Mohammed.Lester liked to point out how small
conventions bulked in this, the larger world, and vaguely she began to
see.Admitting that she had been bad--locally it was important,
perhaps, but in the sum of civilization, in the sum of big forces,
what did it all amount to?They would be dead after a little while,
she and Lester and all these people.Did anything matter except
goodness--goodness of heart?CHAPTER XLV


It was while traveling abroad that Lester came across, first at the
Carlton in London and later at Shepheards in Cairo, the one girl,
before Jennie, whom it might have been said he truly
admired--Letty Pace.He had not seen her for a long time, and she
had been Mrs.Malcolm Gerald for nearly four years, and a charming
widow for nearly two years more.Malcolm Gerald had been a wealthy
man, having amassed a fortune in banking and stock-brokering in
Cincinnati, and he had left Mrs.She was
the mother of one child, a little girl, who was safely in charge of a
nurse and maid at all times, and she was invariably the picturesque
center of a group of admirers recruited from every capital of the
civilized world.Letty Gerald was a talented woman, beautiful,
graceful, artistic, a writer of verse, an omnivorous reader, a student
of art, and a sincere and ardent admirer of Lester Kane.In her day she had truly loved him, for she had been a wise
observer of men and affairs, and Lester had always appealed to her as
a real man.He was so sane, she thought, so calm.He was always
intolerant of sham, and she liked him for it.He was inclined to wave
aside the petty little frivolities of common society conversation, and
to talk of simple and homely things.Many and many a time, in years
past, they had deserted a dance to sit out on a balcony somewhere, and
talk while Lester smoked.He had argued philosophy with her, discussed
books, described political and social conditions in other
cities--in a word, he had treated her like a sensible human
being, and she had hoped and hoped and hoped that he would propose to
her.More than once she had looked at his big, solid head with its
short growth of hardy brown hair, and wished that she could stroke it.It was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to Chicago; at
that time she knew nothing of Jennie, but she felt instinctively that
her chance of winning him was gone.Then Malcolm Gerald, always an ardent admirer, proposed for
something like the sixty-fifth time, and she took him.She did not
love him, but she was getting along, and she had to marry some one.He
was forty-four when he married her, and he lived only four
years--just long enough to realize that he had married a
charming, tolerant, broad-minded woman.Gerald was a rich widow, sympathetic, attractive, delightful in
her knowledge of the world, and with nothing to do except to live and
to spend her money.She was not inclined to do either indifferently.She had long since
had her ideal of a man established by Lester.These whipper-snappers
of counts, earls, lords, barons, whom she met in one social world and
another (for her friendship and connections had broadened notably with
the years), did not interest her a particle.She was terribly weary of
the superficial veneer of the titled fortune-hunter whom she met
abroad.A good judge of character, a student of men and manners, a
natural reasoner along sociologic and psychologic lines, she saw
through them and through the civilization which they represented."I
could have been happy in a cottage with a man I once knew out in
Cincinnati," she told one of her titled women friends who had been an
American before her marriage."He was the biggest, cleanest, sanest
fellow.If he had proposed to me I would have married him if I had had
to work for a living myself."He was comfortably rich, but that did not make
any difference to me."It would have made a difference in the long run," said the
other."You misjudge me," replied Mrs."I waited for him for a
number of years, and I know."Lester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories
of Letty Pace, or Mrs.He had been fond of her
in a way, very fond.He had asked himself
that question time and again.She would have made him an ideal wife,
his father would have been pleased, everybody would have been
delighted.Instead he had drifted and drifted, and then he had met
Jennie; and somehow, after that, he did not want her any more.Now
after six years of separation he met her again.She was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an
affair--she had heard that he had subsequently married the woman
and was living on the South Side.She did not know of the loss of his
fortune.She ran across him first in the Carlton one June evening.The
windows were open, and the flowers were blooming everywhere, odorous
with that sense of new life in the air which runs through the world
when spring comes back.For the moment she was a little beside
herself.Something choked in her throat; but she collected herself and
extended a graceful arm and hand.It seems truly like a breath
of spring to see you again.Kane, but
I'm delighted to see your husband.I'm ashamed to say how many years
it is, Lester, since I saw you last!I feel quite old when I think of
it.Why, Lester, think; it's been all of six or seven years!And I've
been married and had a child, and poor Mr.Gerald has died, and oh,
dear, I don't know what all hasn't happened to me.""You don't look it," commented Lester, smiling.He was pleased to
see her again, for they had been good friends.She liked him
still--that was evident, and he truly liked her.She was glad to see this old friend of Lester's.This woman, trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale,
mother-of-pearl satin, her round, smooth arms bare to the shoulder,
her corsage cut low and a dark red rose blowing at her waist, seemed
to her the ideal of what a woman should be.She liked looking at
lovely women quite as much as Lester; she enjoyed calling his
attention to them, and teasing him, in the mildest way, about their
charms."Wouldn't you like to run and talk to her, Lester, instead of
to me?"she would ask when some particularly striking or beautiful
woman chanced to attract her attention.Lester would examine her
choice critically, for he had come to know that her judge of feminine
charms was excellent."Oh, I'm pretty well off where I am," he would
retort, looking into her eyes; or, jestingly, "I'm not as young as I
used to be, or I'd get in tow of that.""What would you do if I really should?""Why, Lester, I wouldn't do anything.You'd come back to me,
maybe."But if you felt that you wanted to, I wouldn't
try to stop you.I wouldn't expect to be all in all to one man, unless
he wanted me to be.""Where do you get those ideas, Jennie?"he asked her once, curious
to test the breadth of her philosophy."Oh, I don't know, why?""They're so broad, so good-natured, so charitable.They're not
common, that's sure.""Why, I don't think we ought to be selfish, Lester.Some women think differently, I know, but a man and a woman ought
to want to live together, or they ought not to--don't you think?It doesn't make so much difference if a man goes off for a little
while--just so long as he doesn't stay--if he wants to come
back at all."Lester smiled, but he respected her for the sweetness of her point
of view--he had to.To-night, when she saw this woman so eager to talk to Lester, she
realized at once that they must have a great deal in common to talk
over; whereupon she did a characteristic thing."Won't you excuse me
for a little while?""I left some things uncared
for in our rooms.She went away, remaining in her room as long as she reasonably
could, and Lester and Letty fell to discussing old times in earnest.He recounted as much of his experiences as he deemed wise, and Letty
brought the history of her life up to date."Now that you're safely
married, Lester," she said daringly, "I'll confess to you that you
were the one man I always wanted to have propose to me--and you
never did.""Maybe I never dared," he said, gazing into her superb black eyes,
and thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not married.He
felt that she had grown more beautiful in every way.She seemed to him
now to be an ideal society figure-perfection itself--gracious,
natural, witty, the type of woman who mixes and mingles well, meeting
each new-comer upon the plane best suited to him or her.Daniel travelled to the kitchen."Anyhow, I allow you some credit."Jennie has her good points," he replied simply.Yes, I suppose I'm happy--as happy as any one
can be who sees life as it is.You know I'm not troubled with many
illusions.""Not any, I think, kind sir, if I know you.""Very likely, not any, Letty; but sometimes I wish I had a few.Really, I look on my life as a kind of
failure, you know, in spite of the fact that I'm almost as rich as
Croesus--not quite.I think he had some more than I have.""What talk from you--you, with your beauty and talent, and
money--good heavens!"Travel, talk, shoo away silly
fortune-hunters.Oh, dear, sometimes I get so tired!"In spite of Jennie, the old feeling came
back.They were as
comfortable together as old married people, or young lovers.She looked at him, and her eyes fairly spoke."We'll have to brace up and talk of
other things."Yes, I know," she replied, and turned on Jennie a radiant
smile.Jennie felt a faint sense of misgiving.She thought vaguely that
this might be one of Lester's old flames.This was the kind of woman
he should have chosen--not her.She was suited to his station in
life, and he would have been as happy--perhaps happier.Then she put away the uncomfortable thought;
pretty soon she would be getting jealous, and that would be
contemptible.Gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward
the Kanes.She invited them the next day to join her on a drive
through Rotten Row.There was a dinner later at Claridge's, and then
she was compelled to keep some engagement which was taking her to
Paris.She bade them both an affectionate farewell, and hoped that
they would soon meet again.She was envious, in a sad way, of Jennie's
good fortune.Lester had lost none of his charm for her.If anything,
he seemed nicer, more considerate, more wholesome.She wished
sincerely that he were free.And Lester--subconsciously
perhaps--was thinking the same thing.No doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it, he had
been led over mentally all of the things which might have happened if
he had married her.They were so congenial now, philosophically,
artistically, practically.There was a natural flow of conversation
between them all the time, like two old comrades among men.She knew
everybody in his social sphere, which was equally hers, but Jennie did
not.They could talk of certain subtle characteristics of life in a
way which was not possible between him and Jennie, for the latter did
not have the vocabulary.Her ideas did not flow as fast as those of
Mrs.Jennie had actually the deeper, more comprehensive,
sympathetic, and emotional note in her nature, but she could not show
it in light conversation.Actually she was living the thing she was,
and that was perhaps the thing which drew Lester to her.Just now, and
often in situations of this kind, she seemed at a disadvantage, and
she was.It seemed to Lester for the time being as if Mrs.Gerald
would perhaps have been a better choice after all--certainly as
good, and he would not now have this distressing thought as to his
future.In the
gardens about the hotel they suddenly encountered her, or rather
Lester did, for he was alone at the time, strolling and smoking."Well, this is good luck," he exclaimed.I didn't know I was coming until last
Thursday.You know I
wondered where you might be.Then I remembered that you said you were
going to Egypt."In her bath, I fancy, at this moment.This warm weather makes
Jennie take to water.Letty was in light blue silk, with
a blue and white parasol held daintily over her shoulder, and looked
very pretty.she suddenly ejaculated, "I wonder sometimes
what I am to do with myself.I think
I'll go back to the States to live."I haven't
any one to marry now--that I want."She glanced at Lester
significantly, then looked away."Oh, you'll find some one eventually," he said, somewhat awkwardly."You can't escape for long--not with your looks and money."she inquired lightly, thinking of a ball
which was to be given at the hotel that evening.He had danced so well
a few years before."Now, Lester, you don't mean to say that you have gone and
abandoned that last charming art.Come to
think of it, I suppose that is my fault.I haven't thought of dancing
in some time."It occurred to him that he hadn't been going to functions of any
kind much for some time.The opposition his entanglement had generated
had put a stop to that."Come and dance with me to-night."I'll have to think about that," replied Lester.Dancing will probably go hard with me at my time of
life.""Oh, hush, Lester," replied Mrs.Mercy alive, you'd think you were an old
man!""Pshaw, that simply makes us more attractive," replied his old
flame.CHAPTER XLVI


That night after dinner the music was already sounding in the
ball-room of the great hotel adjacent to the palm-gardens when Mrs.Gerald found Lester smoking on one of the verandas with Jennie by his
side.The latter was in white satin and white slippers, her hair lying
a heavy, enticing mass about her forehead and ears.Lester was
brooding over the history of Egypt, its successive tides or waves of
rather weak-bodied people; the thin, narrow strip of soil along either
side of the Nile that had given these successive waves of population
sustenance; the wonder of heat and tropic life, and this hotel with
its modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among ancient,
soul-weary, almost despairing conditions.He and Jennie had looked
this morning on the pyramids.They had taken a trolley to the Sphinx!They had watched swarms of ragged, half-clad, curiously costumed men
and boys moving through narrow, smelly, albeit brightly colored, lanes
and alleys."It all seems such a mess to me," Jennie had said at one place.I like it, but somehow they seem tangled
up, like a lot of worms."Lester chuckled, "You're almost right.Life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions.To-night he was brooding over this, the moon shining down into the
grounds with an exuberant, sensuous luster."Well, at last I've found you!""I couldn't
get down to dinner, after all.I've made your husband agree to dance with me, Mrs.Kane," she went on
smilingly.She, like Lester and Jennie, was under the sensuous
influence of the warmth, the spring, the moonlight.There were rich
odors abroad, floating subtly from groves and gardens; from the remote
distance camel-bells were sounding and exotic cries, "Ayah!"as though a drove of strange animals were
being rounded up and driven through the crowded streets."You're welcome to him," replied Jennie pleasantly."You ought to take lessons right away then," replied Lester
genially."I'll do my best to keep you company.I'm not as light on my
feet as I was once, but I guess I can get around.""Oh, I don't want to dance that badly," smiled Jennie."But you two
go on, I'm going up-stairs in a little while, anyway.""Why don't you come sit in the ball-room?I can't do more than a
few rounds.Then we can watch the others," said Lester rising.Gerald in dark wine-colored silk, covered with
glistening black beads, her shapely arms and neck bare, and a flashing
diamond of great size set just above her forehead in her dark hair.Her lips were red, and she had an engaging smile, showing an even row
of white teeth between wide, full, friendly lips.Lester's strong,
vigorous figure was well set off by his evening clothes, he looked
distinguished."That is the woman he should have married," said Jennie to herself
as he disappeared.She fell into a reverie, going over the steps of
her past life.Sometimes it seemed to her now as if she had been
living in a dream.At other times she felt as though she were in that
dream yet.Life sounded in her ears much as this night did.But back of it were
subtleties that shaded and changed one into the other like the
shifting of dreams.Why had
Lester been so eager to follow her?She
thought of her life in Columbus, when she carried coal; to-night she
was in Egypt, at this great hotel, the chatelaine of a suite of rooms,
surrounded by every luxury, Lester still devoted to her.He had
endured so many things for her!Still she felt humble, out of place,
holding handfuls of jewels that did not belong to her.Again she
experienced that peculiar feeling which had come over her the first
time she went to New York with Lester--namely, that this fairy
existence could not endure.She would go back to simple things, to a side street, a poor
cottage, to old clothes.And then as she thought of her home in Chicago, and the attitude of
his friends, she knew it must be so.She would never be received, even
if he married her.She could look into
the charming, smiling face of this woman who was now with Lester, and
see that she considered her very nice, perhaps, but not of Lester's
class.She was saying to herself now no doubt as she danced with
Lester that he needed some one like her.He needed some one who had
been raised in the atmosphere of the things to which he had been
accustomed.He couldn't very well expect to find in her, Jennie, the
familiarity with, the appreciation of the niceties to, which he had
always been accustomed.Her mind had
awakened rapidly to details of furniture, clothing, arrangement,
decorations, manner, forms, customs, but--she was not to the
manner born.If she went away Lester would return to his old world, the world of
the attractive, well-bred, clever woman who now hung upon his arm.The
tears came into Jennie's eyes; she wished, for the moment, that she
might die.Gerald, or sitting out between the waltzes talking over old
times, old places, and old friends.As he looked at Letty he marveled
at her youth and beauty.She was more developed than formerly, but
still as slender and shapely as Diana.She had strength, too, in this
smooth body of hers, and her black eyes were liquid and lusterful."I swear, Letty," he said impulsively, "you're really more
beautiful than ever."You know I do, or I wouldn't say so."Oh, Lester, you bear, can't you allow a woman just a little
coyness?Don't you know we all love to sip our praise, and not be
compelled to swallow it in one great mouthful?"You're such a big, determined,
straightforward boy.They strolled into the garden as the music ceased, and he squeezed
her arm softly.He couldn't help it; she made him feel as if he owned
her.She said to herself, as they sat
looking at the lanterns in the gardens, that if ever he were free, and
would come to her, she would take him.She was almost ready to take
him anyhow--only he probably wouldn't.He was so straight-laced,
so considerate.He wouldn't, like so many other men she knew, do a
mean thing.He
and Jennie were going farther up the Nile in the morning--toward
Karnak and Thebes and the water-washed temples at Phylae.They
would have to start at an unearthly early hour, and he must get to
bed."Yes; we sail from Hamburg on the ninth--the
Fulda.""I may be going back in the fall," laughed Letty."Don't be
surprised if I crowd in on the same boat with you.I'm very unsettled
in my mind.""Come along, for goodness sake," replied Lester."I hope you do....
I'll see you to-morrow before we leave."He paused, and she looked at
him wistfully."Cheer up," he said, taking her hand."You never can tell what life
will do.We sometimes find ourselves right when we thought we were all
wrong."He was thinking that she was sorry to lose him, and he was sorry
that she was not in a position to have what she wanted.As for
himself, he was saying that here was one solution that probably he
would never accept; yet it was a solution.Why had he not seen this
years before?"And yet she wasn't as beautiful then as she is now, nor as wise,
nor as wealthy."But he couldn't be unfaithful to Jennie
nor wish her any bad luck.She had had enough without his willing, and
had borne it bravely.CHAPTER XLVII


The trip home did bring another week with Mrs.Gerald, for after
mature consideration she had decided to venture to America for a
while.Chicago and Cincinnati were her destinations, and she hoped to
see more of Lester.Her presence was a good deal of a surprise to
Jennie, and it started her thinking again.Gerald would marry Lester;
that was certain.As it was--well, the question was a complicated
one.Letty was Lester's natural mate, so far as birth, breeding, and
position went.And yet Jennie felt instinctively that, on the large
human side, Lester preferred her.Perhaps time would solve the
problem; in the mean time the little party of three continued to
remain excellent friends.Gerald went
her way, and Jennie and Lester took up the customary thread of their
existence.On his return from Europe Lester set to work in earnest to find a
business opening.None of the big companies made him any overtures,
principally because he was considered a strong man who was looking for
a control in anything he touched.The nature of his altered fortunes
had not been made public.All the little companies that he
investigated were having a hand-to-mouth existence, or manufacturing a
product which was not satisfactory to him.He did find one company in
a small town in northern Indiana which looked as though it might have
a future.It was controlled by a practical builder of wagons and
carriages--such as Lester's father had been in his day--who,
however, was not a good business man.He was making some small money
on an investment of fifteen thousand dollars and a plant worth, say,
twenty-five thousand.Lester felt that something could be done here if
proper methods were pursued and business acumen exercised.There would never be a great fortune in it.He was thinking of making an offer to the small manufacturer
when the first rumors of a carriage trust reached him.Robert had gone ahead rapidly with his scheme for reorganizing the
carriage trade.He showed his competitors how much greater profits
could be made through consolidation than through a mutually
destructive rivalry.So convincing were his arguments that one by one
the big carriage manufacturing companies fell into line.Within a few
months the deal had been pushed through, and Robert found himself
president of the United Carriage and Wagon Manufacturers' Association,
with a capital stock of ten million dollars, and with assets
aggregating nearly three-fourths of that sum at a forced sale.While all this was going forward Lester was completely in the dark.His trip to Europe prevented him from seeing three or four minor
notices in the newspapers of some of the efforts that were being made
to unite the various carriage and wagon manufactories.He returned to
Chicago to learn that Jefferson Midgely, Imogene's husband, was still
in full charge of the branch and living in Evanston, but because of
his quarrel with his family he was in no position to get the news
direct.Accident brought it fast enough, however, and that rather
irritatingly.The individual who conveyed this information was none other than
Mr.Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, into whom he ran at the Union
Club one evening after he had been in the city a month."I hear you're out of the old company," Bracebridge remarked,
smiling blandly."Yes," said Lester, "I'm out.""Oh, I have a deal of my own under consideration, I'm thinking
something of handling an independent concern.""Surely you won't run counter to your brother?He has a pretty good
thing in that combination of his."I hadn't heard of it," said Lester."I've just got
back from Europe.""Well, you want to wake up, Lester," replied Bracebridge."He's got
the biggest thing in your line.The
Lyman-Winthrop Company, the Myer-Brooks Company, the Woods
Company--in fact, five or six of the big companies are all in.Your brother was elected president of the new concern.I dare say he
cleaned up a couple of millions out of the deal."Bracebridge could see that he had given him a vital stab."Well, so long, old man," he exclaimed."When you're in Cleveland
look us up.You know how fond my wife is of you."He strolled away to the smoking-room, but the news took all the
zest out of his private venture.Where would he be with a shabby
little wagon company and his brother president of a carriage trust?Robert could put him out of business in a year.Why, he
himself had dreamed of such a combination as this.It is one thing to have youth, courage, and a fighting spirit to
meet the blows with which fortune often afflicts the talented.It is
quite another to see middle age coming on, your principal fortune
possibly gone, and avenue after avenue of opportunity being sealed to
you on various sides.Jennie's obvious social insufficiency, the
quality of newspaper reputation which had now become attached to her,
his father's opposition and death, the loss of his fortune, the loss
of his connection with the company, his brother's attitude, this
trust, all combined in a way to dishearten and discourage him.He
tried to keep a brave face--and he had succeeded thus far, he
thought, admirably, but this last blow appeared for the time being a
little too much.He went home, the same evening that he heard the
news, sorely disheartened.She realized it, as a matter
of fact, all during the evening that he was away.She felt blue and
despondent herself.When he came home she saw what it
was--something had happened to him.Her first impulse was to say,
"What is the matter, Lester?"but her next and sounder one was to
ignore it until he was ready to speak, if ever.She tried not to let
him see that she saw, coming as near as she might affectionately
without disturbing him."Vesta is so delighted with herself to-day," she volunteered by way
of diversion."That's good," he replied solemnly.She showed me some of her
new dances to-night.You haven't any idea how sweet she looks.""I'm glad of it," he grumbled."I always wanted her to be perfect
in that.It's time she was going into some good girls' school, I
think.""And papa gets in such a rage.She teases him
about it--the little imp.She offered to teach him to dance
to-night.If he didn't love her so he'd box her ears.""I can see that," said Lester, smiling."She's not the least bit disturbed by his storming, either."He was very fond of Vesta, who was now
quite a girl.So Jennie tripped on until his mood was modified a little, and then
some inkling of what had happened came out.It was when they were
retiring for the night."Robert's formulated a pretty big thing in a
financial way since we've been away," he volunteered."Oh, he's gotten up a carriage trust.It's something which will
take in every manufactory of any importance in the country.Bracebridge was telling me that Robert was made president, and that
they have nearly eight millions in capital.""Well, then you won't want to do
much with your new company, will you?""No; there's nothing in that, just now," he said."Later on I fancy
it may be all right.I'll wait and see how this thing comes out.You
never can tell what a trust like that will do."She wished sincerely that she might do
something to comfort him, but she knew that her efforts were useless."Oh, well," she said, "there are so many interesting things in this
world.If I were you I wouldn't be in a hurry to do anything, Lester.She didn't trust herself to say anything more, and he felt that it
was useless to worry.After all, he had an ample income
that was absolutely secure for two years yet.He could have more if he
wanted it.Only his brother was moving so dazzlingly onward, while he
was standing still--perhaps "drifting" would be the better word.It did seem a pity; worst of all, he was beginning to feel a little
uncertain of himself.CHAPTER XLVIII


Lester had been doing some pretty hard thinking, but so far he had
been unable to formulate any feasible plan for his re-entrance into
active life.The successful organization of Robert's carriage trade
trust had knocked in the head any further thought on his part of
taking an interest in the small Indiana wagon manufactory.He could
not be expected to sink his sense of pride and place, and enter a
petty campaign for business success with a man who was so obviously
his financial superior.He had looked up the details of the
combination, and he found that Bracebridge had barely indicated how
wonderfully complete it was.It
would have every little manufacturer by the throat.Should he begin
now in a small way and "pike along" in the shadow of his giant
brother?He would be
running around the country trying to fight a new trust, with his own
brother as his tolerant rival and his own rightful capital arrayed
against him.If not--well, he had his
independent income and the right to come back into the Kane Company if
he wished.It was while Lester was in this mood, drifting, that he received a
visit from Samuel E. Ross, a real estate dealer, whose great, wooden
signs might be seen everywhere on the windy stretches of prairie about
the city.Lester had seen Ross once or twice at the Union Club, where
he had been pointed out as a daring and successful real estate
speculator, and he had noticed his rather conspicuous offices at La
Salle and Washington streets.Ross was a magnetic-looking person of
about fifty years of age, tall, black-bearded, black-eyed, an arched,
wide-nostriled nose, and hair that curled naturally, almost
electrically.Lester was impressed with his lithe, cat-like figure,
and his long, thin, impressive white hands.Ross had a real estate proposition to lay before Mr.Ross admitted fully that he
knew all about Mr.Norman
Yale, of the wholesale grocery firm of Yale, Simpson & Rice, he
had developed "Yalewood."Only within six weeks the last lots in the Ridgewood section of
"Yalewood" had been closed out at a total profit of forty-two per
cent.He went over a list of other deals in real estate which he had
put through, all well-known properties.He admitted frankly that there
were failures in the business; he had had one or two himself.But the
successes far outnumbered the bad speculations, as every one knew.Now
Lester was no longer connected with the Kane Company.He was probably
looking for a good investment, and Mr.Ross had a proposition to lay
before him.Lester consented to listen, and Mr.Ross blinked his
cat-like eyes and started in.The idea was that he and Lester should enter into a one-deal
partnership, covering the purchase and development of a forty-acre
tract of land lying between Fifty-fifth, Seventy-first, Halstead
streets, and Ashland Avenue, on the southwest side.There were
indications of a genuine real estate boom there--healthy,
natural, and permanent.The city was about to pave Fifty-fifth Street.There was a plan to extend the Halstead Street car line far below its
present terminus.The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, which ran near
there, would be glad to put a passenger station on the property.The
initial cost of the land would be forty thousand dollars which they
would share equally.Grading, paving, lighting, tree planting,
surveying would cost, roughly, an additional twenty-five thousand.There would be expenses for advertising--say ten per cent, of the
total investment for two years, or perhaps three--a total of
nineteen thousand five hundred or twenty thousand dollars.All told,
they would stand to invest jointly the sum of ninety-five thousand, or
possibly one hundred thousand dollars, of which Lester's share would
be fifty thousand.The character of the land, its salability, and the likelihood of a
rise in value could be judged by the property adjacent, the sales that
had been made north of Fifty-fifth Street and east of Halstead.Take,
for instance, the Mortimer plot, at Halstead and Fifty-fifth streets,
on the south-east corner.Here was a piece of land that in 1882 was
held at forty-five dollars an acre.In 1886 it had risen to five
hundred dollars an acre, as attested by its sale to a Mr.John L.
Slosson at that time.In 1889, three years later, it had been sold to
Mr.Mortimer for one thousand per acre, precisely the figure at which
this tract was now offered.It could be parceled out into lots fifty
by one hundred feet at five hundred dollars per lot.Ross went on, somewhat boastfully, to explain just how real estate
profits were made.It was useless for any outsider to rush into the
game, and imagine that he could do in a few weeks or years what
trained real estate speculators like himself had been working on for a
quarter of a century.There was something in prestige, something in
taste, something in psychic apprehension.Supposing that they went
into the deal, he, Ross, would be the presiding genius.He had a
trained staff, he controlled giant contractors, he had friends in the
tax office, in the water office, and in the various other city
departments which made or marred city improvements.If Lester would
come in with him he would make him some money--how much he would
not say exactly--fifty thousand dollars at the lowest--one
hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand in all likelihood.Would
Lester let him go into details, and explain just how the scheme could
be worked out?After a few days of quiet cogitation, Lester decided to
accede to Mr.Ross's request; he would look into this thing.CHAPTER XLIX


The peculiarity of this particular proposition was that it had the
basic elements of success.Ross had the experience and the
judgment which were quite capable of making a success of almost
anything he undertook.He was in a field which was entirely familiar.He could convince almost any able man if he could get his ear
sufficiently long to lay his facts before him.Lester was not convinced at first, although, generally speaking, he
was interested in real estate propositions.He
considered it a sound investment providing you did not get too much of
it.He had never invested in any, or scarcely any, solely because he
had not been in a realm where real estate propositions were talked of.As it was he was landless and, in a way, jobless.It was easy
to verify his statements, and he did verify them in several
particulars.There were his signs out on the prairie stretches, and
here were his ads in the daily papers.It seemed not a bad way at all
in his idleness to start and make some money.The trouble with Lester was that he had reached the time where he
was not as keen for details as he had formerly been.All his work in
recent years--in fact, from the very beginning--had been
with large propositions, the purchasing of great quantities of
supplies, the placing of large orders, the discussion of things which
were wholesale and which had very little to do with the minor details
which make up the special interests of the smaller traders of the
world.In the factory his brother Robert had figured the pennies and
nickels of labor-cost, had seen to it that all the little leaks were
shut off.Lester had been left to deal with larger things, and he had
consistently done so.When it came to this particular proposition his
interest was in the wholesale phases of it, not the petty details of
selling.He could not help seeing that Chicago was a growing city, and
that land values must rise.What was now far-out prairie property
would soon, in the course of a few years, be well built-up suburban
residence territory.Scarcely any land that could be purchased now
would fall in value.It might drag in sales or increase, but it
couldn't fall.He knew it of his own
judgment to be true.The several things on which he did not speculate sufficiently were
the life or health of Mr.Ross; the chance that some obnoxious
neighborhood growth would affect the territory he had selected as
residence territory; the fact that difficult money situations might
reduce real estate values--in fact, bring about a flurry of real
estate liquidation which would send prices crashing down and cause the
failure of strong promoters, even such promoters for instance, as Mr.For several months he studied the situation as presented by his new
guide and mentor, and then, having satisfied himself that he was
reasonably safe, decided to sell some of the holdings which were
netting him a beggarly six per cent, and invest in this new
proposition.The first cash outlay was twenty thousand dollars for the
land, which was taken over under an operative agreement between
himself and Ross; this was run indefinitely--so long as there was
any of this land left to sell.The next thing was to raise twelve
thousand five hundred dollars for improvements, which he did, and then
to furnish some twenty-five hundred dollars more for taxes and
unconsidered expenses, items which had come up in carrying out the
improvement work which had been planned.It seemed that hard and soft
earth made a difference in grading costs, that trees would not always
flourish as expected, that certain members of the city water and gas
departments had to be "seen" and "fixed" before certain other
improvements could be effected.Ross attended to all this, but the
cost of the proceedings was something which had to be discussed, and
Lester heard it all.After the land was put in shape, about a year after the original
conversation, it was necessary to wait until spring for the proper
advertising and booming of the new section; and this advertising began
to call at once for the third payment.Lester disposed of an
additional fifteen thousand dollars worth of securities in order to
follow this venture to its logical and profitable conclusion.Up to this time he was rather pleased with his venture.Ross had
certainly been thorough and business-like in his handling of the
various details.It was given a
rather attractive title--"Inwood," although, as Lester noted,
there was precious little wood anywhere around there.But Ross assured
him that people looking for a suburban residence would be attracted by
the name; seeing the vigorous efforts in tree-planting that had been
made to provide for shade in the future, they would take the will for
the deed.The first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the
form of a rumor that the International Packing Company, one of the big
constituent members of the packing house combination at Halstead and
Thirty-ninth streets, had determined to desert the old group and lay
out a new packing area for itself.The papers explained that the
company intended to go farther south, probably below Fifty-fifth
Street and west of Ashland Avenue.This was the territory that was
located due west of Lester's property, and the mere suspicion that the
packing company might invade the territory was sufficient to blight
the prospects of any budding real estate deal.He decided, after quick
deliberation, that the best thing to do would be to boom the property
heavily, by means of newspaper advertising, and see if it could not be
disposed of before any additional damage was likely to be done to it.He laid the matter before Lester, who agreed that this would be
advisable.They had already expended six thousand dollars in
advertising, and now the additional sum of three thousand dollars was
spent in ten days, to make it appear that In wood was an ideal
residence section, equipped with every modern convenience for the
home-lover, and destined to be one of the most exclusive and beautiful
suburbs of the city.A few lots were sold, but the
rumor that the International Packing Company might come was persistent
and deadly; from any point of view, save that of a foreign population
neighborhood, the enterprise was a failure.To say that Lester was greatly disheartened by this blow is to put
it mildly.Practically fifty thousand dollars, two-thirds of all his
earthly possessions, outside of his stipulated annual income, was tied
up here; and there were taxes to pay, repairs to maintain, actual
depreciation in value to face.He suggested to Ross that the area
might be sold at its cost value, or a loan raised on it, and the whole
enterprise abandoned; but that experienced real estate dealer was not
so sanguine.He had had one or two failures of this kind before.He
was superstitious about anything which did not go smoothly from the
beginning.If it didn't go it was a hoodoo--a black
shadow--and he wanted no more to do with it.Other real estate
men, as he knew to his cost, were of the same opinion.Some three years later the property was sold under the sheriff's
hammer.Lester, having put in fifty thousand dollars all told,
recovered a trifle more than eighteen thousand; and some of his wise
friends assured him that he was lucky in getting off so easily.CHAPTER L


While the real estate deal was in progress Mrs.She had been staying in Cincinnati for a few months,
and had learned a great deal as to the real facts of Lester's
irregular mode of life.The question whether or not he was really
married to Jennie remained an open one.The garbled details of
Jennie's early years, the fact that a Chicago paper had written him up
as a young millionaire who was sacrificing his fortune for love of
her, the certainty that Robert had practically eliminated him from any
voice in the Kane Company, all came to her ears.She hated to think
that Lester was making such a sacrifice of himself.He had let nearly
a year slip by without doing anything.In two more years his chance
would be gone.He had said to her in London that he was without many
illusions.Did he really love her, or was he just
sorry for her?Letty wanted very much to find out for sure.Gerald leased in Chicago was a most imposing
one on Drexel Boulevard."I'm going to take a house in your town this
winter, and I hope to see a lot of you," she wrote to Lester."I'm
awfully bored with life here in Cincinnati.After Europe it's
so--well, you know.You ought to know that you have a loving friend in her.Her
daughter is going to marry Jimmy Severance in the spring."Lester thought of her coming with mingled feelings of pleasure and
uncertainty.Would she
foolishly begin by attempting to invite him and Jennie?That meant that Jennie would have to
be eliminated.He would have to make a clean breast of the whole
affair to Letty.Then she could do as she pleased about their future
intimacy.Seated in Letty's comfortable boudoir one afternoon, facing
a vision of loveliness in pale yellow, he decided that he might as
well have it out with her.Just at this time he
was beginning to doubt the outcome of the real estate deal, and
consequently he was feeling a little blue, and, as a concomitant, a
little confidential.He could not as yet talk to Jennie about his
troubles."You know, Lester," said Letty, by way of helping him to his
confession--the maid had brought tea for her and some brandy and
soda for him, and departed--"that I have been hearing a lot of
things about you since I've been back in this country.Aren't you
going to tell me all about yourself?You know I have your real
interests at heart.""What have you been hearing, Letty?""Oh, about your father's will for one thing, and the fact that
you're out of the company, and some gossip about Mrs.Kane which
doesn't interest me very much.Aren't you going
to straighten things out, so that you can have what rightfully belongs
to you?It seems to me such a great sacrifice, Lester, unless, of
course, you are very much in love.Lester paused and deliberated before replying."I really don't know
how to answer that last question, Letty," he said."Sometimes I think
that I love her; sometimes I wonder whether I do or not.I'm going to
be perfectly frank with you.I was never in such a curious position in
my life before.You like me so much, and I--well, I don't say
what I think of you," he smiled."But anyhow, I can talk to you
frankly."I thought as much," she said, as he paused."And I'm not married because I have never been able to make up my
mind just what to do about it.When I first met Jennie I thought her
the most entrancing girl I had ever laid eyes on.""That speaks volumes for my charms at that time," interrupted his
vis-a-vis."Don't interrupt me if you want to hear this," he smiled."Tell me one thing," she questioned, "and then I won't."There was something about her so--"

"Love at first sight," again interpolated Letty foolishly."Are you going to let me tell this?"I can't help a twinge or two.""Well, anyhow, I lost my head.I thought she was the most perfect
thing under the sun, even if she was a little out of my world.I thought that I could just take her, and
then--well, you know.I didn't
think that would prove as serious as it did.I never cared for any
other woman but you before and--I'll be frank--I didn't know
whether I wanted to marry you.I thought I didn't want to marry any
woman.I said to myself that I could just take Jennie, and then, after
a while, when things had quieted down some, we could separate."Yes, I understand," replied his confessor."Well, you see, Letty, it hasn't worked out that way.She's a woman
of a curious temperament.She possesses a world of feeling and
emotion.She's not educated in the sense in which we understand that
word, but she has natural refinement and tact.She's the most affectionate
creature under the sun.Her devotion to her mother and father was
beyond words.Her love for her--daughter she's hers, not
mine--is perfect.She hasn't any of the graces of the smart
society woman.She can't join in any
rapid-fire conversation.Some of
her big thoughts never come to the surface at all, but you can feel
that she is thinking and that she is feeling.""You pay her a lovely tribute, Lester," said Letty."She's a good woman, Letty; but, for all
that I have said, I sometimes think that it's only sympathy that's
holding me.""Don't be too sure," she said warningly."Yes, but I've gone through with a great deal.The thing for me to
have done was to have married her in the first place.There have been
so many entanglements since, so much rowing and discussion, that I've
rather lost my bearings.I
stand to lose eight hundred thousand if I marry her--really, a
great deal more, now that the company has been organized into a trust.If I don't marry her, I lose
everything outright in about two more years.Of course, I might
pretend that I have separated from her, but I don't care to lie.I
can't work it out that way without hurting her feelings, and she's
been the soul of devotion.Right down in my heart, at this minute, I
don't know whether I want to give her up.Honestly, I don't know what
the devil to do."Lester looked, lit a cigar in a far-off, speculative fashion, and
looked out of the window.questioned Letty, staring at the
floor.She rose, after a few moments of silence, and put her hands on
his round, solid head.Her yellow, silken house-gown, faintly scented,
touched his shoulders."You certainly have
tied yourself up in a knot.But it's a Gordian knot, my dear, and it
will have to be cut.Why don't you discuss this whole thing with her,
just as you have with me, and see how she feels about it?""It seems such an unkind thing to do," he replied."You must take some action, Lester dear," she insisted.Frankly, I
can't advise you to marry her; and I'm not speaking for myself in
that, though I'll take you gladly, even if you did forsake me in the
first place.I'll be perfectly honest--whether you ever come to
me or not--I love you, and always shall love you.""I know it," said Lester, getting up.He took her hands in his, and
studied her face curiously."But you're too big a man, Lester, to settle down on ten thousand a
year," she continued."You're too much of a social figure to drift.You ought to get back into the social and financial world where you
belong.All that's happened won't injure you, if you reclaim your
interest in the company.And if you
tell her the truth she won't object, I'm sure.If she cares for you,
as you think she does, she will be glad to make this sacrifice.You can provide for her handsomely, of course.""It isn't the money that Jennie wants," said Lester, gloomily."Well, even if it isn't, she can live without you and she can live
better for having an ample income.""She will never want if I can help it," he said solemnly."You must leave her," she urged, with a new touch of decisiveness.Why don't you make
up your mind to act at once--to-day, for that matter?To tell
you the truth, I hate to do it.I'm not one to run around and discuss my affairs with other people.I've refused to talk about this to any one heretofore--my father,
my mother, any one.But somehow you have always seemed closer to me
than any one else, and, since I met you this time, I have felt as
though I ought to explain--I have really wanted to.I don't know whether you understand how that can be under the
circumstances.You're nearer to me intellectually and
emotionally than I thought you were.You want the truth,
don't you?Now explain me to myself, if you
can.""I don't want to argue with you, Lester," she said softly, laying
her hand on his arm.I understand quite
well how it has all come about.I'm sorry--" she hesitated--"for Mrs.But she isn't the woman for
you, Lester; she really isn't.It seems so
unfair for us two to discuss her in this way, but really it isn't.We
all have to stand on our merits.And I'm satisfied, if the facts in
this case were put before her, as you have put them before me, she
would see just how it all is, and agree.Why, Lester, if I were in her position I would let you go.It would
hurt me, but I'd do it.It will hurt her, but she'll do it.Now, mark
you my words, she will.I think I understand her as well as you
do--better--for I am a woman.Oh," she said, pausing, "I
wish I were in a position to talk to her.Lester looked at Letty, wondering at her eagerness.She was
beautiful, magnetic, immensely worth while.She paused, a little crestfallen but determined."This is the time to act," she repeated, her whole soul in her
eyes.She wanted this man, and she was not ashamed to let him see that
she wanted him."Well, I'll think of it," he said uneasily, then, rather hastily,
he bade her good-by and went away.CHAPTER LI


Lester had thought of his predicament earnestly enough, and he
would have been satisfied to act soon if it had not been that one of
those disrupting influences which sometimes complicate our affairs
entered into his Hyde Park domicile.Gerhardt's health began rapidly
to fail.Little by little he had been obliged to give up his various duties
about the place; finally he was obliged to take to his bed.He lay in
his room, devotedly attended by Jennie and visited constantly by
Vesta, and occasionally by Lester.There was a window not far from his
bed, which commanded a charming view of the lawn and one of the
surrounding streets, and through this he would gaze by the hour,
wondering how the world was getting on without him.He suspected that
Woods, the coachman, was not looking after the horses and harnesses as
well as he should, that the newspaper carrier was getting negligent in
his delivery of the papers, that the furnace man was wasting coal, or
was not giving them enough heat.A score of little petty worries,
which were nevertheless real enough to him.He knew how a house should
be kept.He was always rigid in his performance of his self-appointed
duties, and he was so afraid that things would not go right.Jennie
made for him a most imposing and sumptuous dressing-gown of basted
wool, covered with dark-blue silk, and bought him a pair of soft,
thick, wool slippers to match, but he did not wear them often.He
preferred to lie in bed, read his Bible and the Lutheran papers, and
ask Jennie how things were getting along."I want you should go down in the basement and see what that feller
is doing.He's not giving us any heat," he would complain."I bet I
know what he does.He sits down there and reads, and then he forgets
what the fire is doing until it is almost out.The beer is right there
where he can take it.You don't know what kind
of a man he is.Jennie would protest that the house was fairly comfortable, that
the man was a nice, quiet, respectable-looking American--that if
he did drink a little beer it would not matter.Gerhardt would
immediately become incensed."That is always the way," he declared vigorously.You are always so ready to let things go if I am not
there.How do you know he is a nice man?If you don't watch
him he will be just like the others, no good.You should go around and
see how things are for yourself.""All right, papa," she would reply in a genial effort to soothe
him, "I will.Don't you
want a cup of coffee now and some toast?""No," Gerhardt would sigh immediately, "my stomach it don't do
right.I don't know how I am going to come out of this."Makin, the leading physician of the vicinity, and a man of
considerable experience and ability, called at Jennie's request and
suggested a few simple things--hot milk, a wine tonic, rest, but
he told Jennie that she must not expect too much."You know he is
quite well along in years now.If he were twenty
years younger we might do a great deal for him.As it is he is quite
well off where he is.He may get up and be
around again, and then he may not.I
have never any care as to what may happen to me.Jennie felt sorry to think that her father might die, but she was
pleased to think that if he must it was going to be under such
comfortable circumstances.It soon became evident that this was Gerhardt's last illness, and
Jennie thought it her duty to communicate with her brothers and
sisters.She wrote Bass that his father was not well, and had a letter
from him saying that he was very busy and couldn't come on unless the
danger was an immediate one.He went on to say that George was in
Rochester, working for a wholesale wall-paper house--the
Sheff-Jefferson Company, he thought.Martha and her husband had gone
to Boston.Her address was a little suburb named Belmont, just outside
the city.William was in Omaha, working for a local electric company.Veronica was married to a man named Albert Sheridan, who was connected
with a wholesale drug company in Cleveland."She never comes to see
me," complained Bass, "but I'll let her know."They
were very sorry, and would she let them know if anything happened.George wrote that he could not think of coming to Chicago unless his
father was very ill indeed, but that he would like to be informed from
time to time how he was getting along.William, as he told Jennie some
time afterward, did not get her letter.The progress of the old German's malady toward final dissolution
preyed greatly on Jennie's mind; for, in spite of the fact that they
had been so far apart in times past, they had now grown very close
together.Gerhardt had come to realize clearly that his outcast
daughter was goodness itself--at least, so far as he was
concerned.She never quarreled with him, never crossed him in any way.Now that he was sick, she was in and out of his room a dozen times in
an evening or an afternoon, seeing whether he was "all right," asking
how he liked his breakfast, or his lunch, or his dinner.As he grew
weaker she would sit by him and read, or do her sewing in his room.One day when she was straightening his pillow he took her hand and
kissed it.He was feeling very weak--and despondent.She looked
up in astonishment, a lump in her throat."You're a good girl, Jennie," he said brokenly.I've been hard and cross, but I'm an old man."Oh, papa, please don't," she pleaded, tears welling from her eyes.I'm the one who has been all
wrong.""No, no," he said; and she sank down on her knees beside him and
cried.He put his thin, yellow hand on her hair."There, there," he
said brokenly, "I understand a lot of things I didn't.She left the room, ostensibly to wash her face and hands, and cried
her eyes out.She tried to be more attentive, but that was impossible.But
after this reconciliation he seemed happier and more contented, and
they spent a number of happy hours together, just talking.Once he
said to her, "You know I feel just like I did when I was a boy.If it
wasn't for my bones I could get up and dance on the grass."Jennie fairly smiled and sobbed in one breath."You'll get
stronger, papa," she said.She was so glad she had been able to make him
comfortable these last few years.As for Lester, he was affectionate and considerate."Well, how is it to-night?"he would ask the moment he entered the
house, and he would always drop in for a few minutes before dinner to
see how the old man was getting along."He looks pretty well," he
would tell Jennie."He's apt to live some time yet.Vesta also spent much time with her grandfather, for she had come
to love him dearly.She would bring her books, if it didn't disturb
him too much, and recite some of her lessons, or she would leave his
door open, and play for him on the piano.Lester had bought her a
handsome music-box also, which she would sometimes carry to his room
and play for him.At times he wearied of everything and everybody save
Jennie; he wanted to be alone with her.She would sit beside him quite
still and sew.She could see plainly that the end was only a little
way off.Gerhardt, true to his nature, took into consideration all the
various arrangements contingent upon his death.He wished to be buried
in the little Lutheran cemetery, which was several miles farther out
on the South Side, and he wanted the beloved minister of his church to
officiate."Just my black suit and those
Sunday shoes of mine, and that black string tie.Jennie begged him not to talk of it, but he would.One day at four
o'clock he had a sudden sinking spell, and at five he was dead.Jennie
held his hands, watching his labored breathing; once or twice he
opened his eyes to smile at her."I don't mind going," he said, in
this final hour."Don't talk of dying, papa," she pleaded.The finish which time thus put to this troubled life affected
Jennie deeply.Strong in her kindly, emotional relationships, Gerhardt
had appealed to her not only as her father, but as a friend and
counselor.She saw him now in his true perspective, a hard-working,
honest, sincere old German, who had done his best to raise a
troublesome family and lead an honest life.Truly she had been his one
great burden, and she had never really dealt truthfully with him to
the end.She wondered now if where he was he could see that she had
lied.Telegrams were sent to all the children.Bass wired that he was
coming, and arrived the next day.The others wired that they could not
come, but asked for details, which Jennie wrote.The Lutheran minister
was called in to say prayers and fix the time of the burial service.A
fat, smug undertaker was commissioned to arrange all the details.Some
few neighborhood friends called--those who had remained most
faithful--and on the second morning following his death the
services were held.Lester accompanied Jennie and Vesta and Bass to
the little red brick Lutheran church, and sat stolidly through the
rather dry services.He listened wearily to the long discourse on the
beauties and rewards of a future life and stirred irritably when
reference was made to a hell.Bass was rather bored, but considerate.He looked upon his father now much as he would on any other man.Only
Jennie wept sympathetically.She saw her father in perspective, the
long years of trouble he had had, the days in which he had had to saw
wood for a living, the days in which he had lived in a factory loft,
the little shabby house they had been compelled to live in in
Thirteenth Street, the terrible days of suffering they had spent in
Lorrie Street, in Cleveland, his grief over her, his grief over Mrs.Gerhardt, his love and care of Vesta, and finally these last days."Oh, he was a good man," she thought.They sang
a hymn, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," and then she sobbed.He was moved to the danger-line himself
by her grief."You'll have to do better than this," he whispered."My
God, I can't stand it.I'll have to get up and get out."Jennie
quieted a little, but the fact that the last visible ties were being
broken between her and her father was almost too much.At the grave in the Cemetery of the Redeemer, where Lester had
immediately arranged to purchase a lot, they saw the plain coffin
lowered and the earth shoveled in.Lester looked curiously at the bare
trees, the brown dead grass, and the brown soil of the prairie turned
up at this simple graveside.There was no distinction to this burial
plot.It was commonplace and shabby, a working-man's resting-place,
but so long as he wanted it, it was all right.He studied Bass's keen,
lean face, wondering what sort of a career he was cutting out for
himself.Bass looked to him like some one who would run a cigar store
successfully.He watched Jennie wiping her red eyes, and then he said
to himself again, "Well, there is something to her."The woman's
emotion was so deep, so real."There's no explaining a good woman," he
said to himself.On the way home, through the wind-swept, dusty streets, he talked
of life in general, Bass and Vesta being present."Jennie takes things
too seriously," he said.Life isn't as
bad as she makes out with her sensitive feelings.We all have our
troubles, and we all have to stand them, some more, some less.We
can't assume that any one is so much better or worse off than any one
else."I can't help it," said Jennie."I feel so sorry for some
people.""Jennie always was a little gloomy," put in Bass.He was thinking what a fine figure of a man Lester was, how
beautifully they lived, how Jennie had come up in the world.He was
thinking that there must be a lot more to her than he had originally
thought.At one time he thought Jennie
was a hopeless failure and no good."You ought to try to steel yourself to take things as they come
without going to pieces this way," said Lester finally.Jennie stared thoughtfully out of the carriage window.There was
the old house now, large and silent without Gerhardt.Just think, she
would never see him any more.They finally turned into the drive and
entered the library.Jeannette, nervous and sympathetic, served tea.She wondered curiously
where she would be when she died.CHAPTER LII


The fact that Gerhardt was dead made no particular difference to
Lester, except as it affected Jennie.He had liked the old German for
his many sterling qualities, but beyond that he thought nothing of him
one way or the other.He took Jennie to a watering-place for ten days
to help her recover her spirits, and it was soon after this that he
decided to tell her just how things stood with him; he would put the
problem plainly before her.It would be easier now, for Jennie had
been informed of the disastrous prospects of the real-estate deal.She
was also aware of his continued interest in Mrs.Lester did
not hesitate to let Jennie know that he was on very friendly terms
with her.Gerald had, at first, formally requested him to bring
Jennie to see her, but she never had called herself, and Jennie
understood quite clearly that it was not to be.Now that her father
was dead, she was beginning to wonder what was going to become of her;
she was afraid that Lester might not marry her.Certainly he showed no
signs of intending to do so.By one of those curious coincidences of thought, Robert also had
reached the conclusion that something should be done.He did not, for
one moment, imagine that he could directly work upon Lester--he
did not care to try--but he did think that some influence might
be brought to bear on Jennie.If
Lester had not married her already, she must realize full well that he
did not intend to do so.Suppose that some responsible third person
were to approach her, and explain how things were, including, of
course, the offer of an independent income?Might she not be willing
to leave Lester, and end all this trouble?After all, Lester was his
brother, and he ought not to lose his fortune.Robert had things very
much in his own hands now, and could afford to be generous.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, would be
the proper intermediary, for O'Brien was suave, good-natured, and
well-meaning, even if he was a lawyer.He might explain to Jennie very
delicately just how the family felt, and how much Lester stood to lose
if he continued to maintain his connection with her.If Lester had
married Jennie, O'Brien would find it out.A liberal provision would
be made for her--say fifty or one hundred thousand, or even one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.O'Brien and gave
him his instructions.As one of the executors of Archibald Kane's
estate, it was really the lawyer's duty to look into the matter of
Lester's ultimate decision.On reaching the city, he called
up Lester, and found out to his satisfaction that he was out of town
for the day.He went out to the house in Hyde Park, and sent in his
card to Jennie.She came down-stairs in a few minutes quite
unconscious of the import of his message; he greeted her most
blandly.he asked, with an interlocutory jerk of his
head."I am, as you see by my card, Mr.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley &
O'Brien," he began."We are the attorneys and executors of the late
Mr.You'll think it's
rather curious, my coming to you, but under your husband's father's
will there were certain conditions stipulated which affect you and Mr.These provisions are so important that I think
you ought to know about them--that is if Mr.I--pardon me--but the peculiar nature of them
makes me conclude that--possibly--he hasn't."He paused, a
very question-mark of a man--every feature of his face an
interrogation."I don't quite understand," said Jennie."I don't know anything
about the will.If there's anything that I ought to know, I suppose
Mr.Now, if you will allow me I'll go into the matter briefly.Then you
can judge for yourself whether you wish to hear the full particulars.Jennie seated
herself, and Mr.O'Brien pulled up a chair near to hers."I need not say to you, of course, that
there was considerable opposition on the part of Mr.Kane's father, to
this--ah--union between yourself and his son.""I know--" Jennie started to say, but checked herself.She was
puzzled, disturbed, and a little apprehensive.Kane senior died," he went on, "he indicated to
your--ah--to Mr.Lester Kane, that he felt this way.In his
will he made certain conditions governing the distribution of his
property which made it rather hard for his son,
your--ah--husband, to come into his rightful share.Ordinarily, he would have inherited one-fourth of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, worth to-day in the neighborhood of a million
dollars, perhaps more; also one-fourth of the other properties, which
now aggregate something like five hundred thousand dollars.Kane senior was really very anxious that his son should inherit
this property.But owing to the conditions which
your--ah--which Mr.Lester Kane
cannot possibly obtain his share, except by complying with
a--with a--certain wish which his father had expressed."O'Brien paused, his eyes moving back and forth side wise in
their sockets.In spite of the natural prejudice of the situation, he
was considerably impressed with Jennie's pleasing appearance.He could
see quite plainly why Lester might cling to her in the face of all
opposition.He continued to study her furtively as he sat there
waiting for her to speak.she finally asked, her nerves becoming
just a little tense under the strain of the silence."I am glad you were kind enough to ask me that," he went on."The
subject is a very difficult one for me to introduce--very
difficult.I come as an emissary of the estate, I might say as one of
the executors under the will of Mr.I know how keenly
your--ah--how keenly Mr.I know how
keenly you will probably feel about it.But it is one of those very
difficult things which cannot be helped--which must be got over
somehow.And while I hesitate very much to say so, I must tell you
that Mr.Kane senior stipulated in his will that unless,
unless"--again his eyes were moving sidewise to and fro--"he
saw fit to separate from--ah--you" he paused to get
breath--"he could not inherit this or any other sum or, at least,
only a very minor income of ten thousand a year; and that only on
condition that he should marry you.""I should add,"
he went on, "that under the will he was given three years in which to
indicate his intentions.He paused, half expecting some outburst of feeling from Jennie, but
she only looked at him fixedly, her eyes clouded with surprise,
distress, unhappiness.Lester was sacrificing his
fortune for her.His recent commercial venture was an effort to
rehabilitate himself, to put himself in an independent position.The
recent periods of preoccupation, of subtle unrest, and of
dissatisfaction over which she had grieved were now explained.He was
unhappy, he was brooding over this prospective loss, and he had never
told her.So his father had really disinherited him!O'Brien sat before her, troubled himself.He was very sorry for
her, now that he saw the expression of her face."I'm sorry," he said, when he saw that she was not going to make
any immediate reply, "that I have been the bearer of such unfortunate
news.It is a very painful situation that I find myself in at this
moment, I assure you.I bear you no ill will personally--of
course you understand that.The family really bears you no ill will
now--I hope you believe that.As I told your--ah--as I
told Mr.Kane, at the time the will was read, I considered it most
unfair, but, of course, as a mere executive under it and counsel for
his father, I could do nothing.I really think it best that you should
know how things stand, in order that you may help your--your
husband"--he paused, significantly--"if possible, to some
solution.It seems a pity to me, as it does to the various other
members of his family, that he should lose all this money."Jennie had turned her head away and was staring at the floor."He mustn't lose it," she said; "it isn't fair
that he should.""I am most delighted to hear you say that, Mrs.--Mrs.Kane,"
he went on, using for the first time her improbable title as Lester's
wife, without hesitation."I may as well be very frank with you, and
say that I feared you might take this information in quite another
spirit.Of course you know to begin with that the Kane family is very
clannish.Kane, your--ah--your husband's mother, was a
very proud and rather distant woman, and his sisters and brothers are
rather set in their notions as to what constitute proper family
connections.They look upon his relationship to you as irregular,
and--pardon me if I appear to be a little cruel--as not
generally satisfactory.As you know, there had been so much talk in
the last few years that Mr.Kane senior did not believe that the
situation could ever be nicely adjusted, so far as the family was
concerned.He felt that his son had not gone about it right in the
first place.One of the conditions of his will was that if your
husband--pardon me--if his son did not accept the
proposition in regard to separating from you and taking up his
rightful share of the estate, then to inherit anything at
all--the mere ten thousand a year I mentioned before--he
must--ah--he must pardon me, I seem a little brutal, but not
intentionally so--marry you."It was such a cruel thing to say this to her face.This whole attempt to live together illegally had proved disastrous at
every step.There was only one solution to the unfortunate
business--she could see that plainly.She must leave him, or he
must leave her.Lester living on ten
thousand dollars a year!He was thinking that Lester
both had and had not made a mistake.Why had he not married her in the
first place?"There is just one other point which I wish to make in this
connection, Mrs.Kane," he went on softly and easily."I see now that
it will not make any difference to you, but I am commissioned and in a
way constrained to make it.I hope you will take it in the manner in
which it is given.I don't know whether you are familiar with your
husband's commercial interests or not?""Well, in order to simplify matters, and to make it easier for you,
should you decide to assist your husband to a solution of this very
difficult situation--frankly, in case you might possibly decide
to leave on your own account, and maintain a separate establishment of
your own I am delighted to say that--ah--any sum,
say--ah--"

Jennie rose and walked dazedly to one of the windows, clasping her
hands as she went.In the event of your deciding to end the
connection it has been suggested that any reasonable sum you might
name, fifty, seventy-five, a hundred thousand dollars"--Mr.O'Brien was feeling very generous toward her--"would be gladly
set aside for your benefit--put in trust, as it were, so that you
would have it whenever you needed it."Please don't," said Jennie, hurt beyond the power to express
herself, unable mentally and physically to listen to another word.But please don't talk to
me any more, will you?"O'Brien, coming
to a keen realization of her sufferings.It has been very hard for me to do
this--very hard.I will come any time you suggest, or you can write me.I hope you will see fit
to say nothing to your husband of my visit--it will be advisable
that you should keep your own counsel in the matter.I value his
friendship very highly, and I am sincerely sorry."O'Brien went out into the hall to get his coat.Jennie touched
the electric button to summon the maid, and Jeannette came.Jennie
went back into the library, and Mr.O'Brien paced briskly down the
front walk.When she was really alone she put her doubled hands to her
chin, and stared at the floor, the queer design of the silken Turkish
rug resolving itself into some curious picture.She saw herself in a
small cottage somewhere, alone with Vesta; she saw Lester living in
another world, and beside him Mrs.She saw this house vacant,
and then a long stretch of time, and then--

"Oh," she sighed, choking back a desire to cry.With her hands she
brushed away a hot tear from each eye."It must be," she said to herself in thought.And then--"Oh, thank God that papa
is dead Anyhow, he did not live to see this."CHAPTER LIII


The explanation which Lester had concluded to be inevitable,
whether it led to separation or legalization of their hitherto banal
condition, followed quickly upon the appearance of Mr.O'Brien called he had gone on a journey to Hegewisch, a small
manufacturing town in Wisconsin, where he had been invited to witness
the trial of a new motor intended to operate elevators--with a
view to possible investment.When he came out to the house, interested
to tell Jennie something about it even in spite of the fact that he
was thinking of leaving her, he felt a sense of depression everywhere,
for Jennie, in spite of the serious and sensible conclusion she had
reached, was not one who could conceal her feelings easily.She was
brooding sadly over her proposed action, realizing that it was best to
leave but finding it hard to summon the courage which would let her
talk to him about it.She could not go without telling him what she
thought.She was absolutely convinced
that this one course of action--separation--was necessary
and advisable.She could not think of him as daring to make a
sacrifice of such proportions for her sake even if he wanted to.It was astonishing to her that he had let things go
along as dangerously and silently as he had.When he came in Jennie did her best to greet him with her
accustomed smile, but it was a pretty poor imitation.she asked, using her customary phrase of
inquiry.She walked with him to the library, and he
poked at the open fire with a long-handled poker before turning around
to survey the room generally.It was five o'clock of a January
afternoon.Jennie had gone to one of the windows to lower the shade.As she came back he looked at her critically."You're not quite your
usual self, are you?"he asked, sensing something out of the common in
her attitude."Why, yes, I feel all right," she replied, but there was a peculiar
uneven motion to the movement of her lips--a rippling tremor
which was unmistakable to him."I think I know better than that," he said, still gazing at her
steadily.She turned away from him a moment to get her breath and collect her
senses."There is something," she managed to
say."I know you have," he agreed, half smiling, but with a feeling that
there was much of grave import back of this.She was silent for a moment, biting her lips.She did not quite
know how to begin.Finally she broke the spell with: "There was a man
here yesterday--a Mr."He came to talk to me about you and your father's will."She paused, for his face clouded immediately."Why the devil should
he be talking to you about my father's will!""Please don't get angry, Lester," said Jennie calmly, for she
realized that she must remain absolute mistress of herself if anything
were to be accomplished toward the resolution of her problem."He
wanted to tell me what a sacrifice you are making," she went on."He
wished to show me that there was only a little time left before you
would lose your inheritance."What the devil does he mean by
putting his nose in my private affairs?"This is some
of Robert's work.Why should Knight, Keatley & O'Brien be meddling
in my affairs?This whole business is getting to be a nuisance!"He
was in a boiling rage in a moment, as was shown by his darkening skin
and sulphurous eyes.He came to himself sufficiently after a time to add:

"Well."He said that if you married me you would only get ten thousand a
year.That if you didn't and still lived with me you would get nothing
at all.If you would leave me, or I would leave you, you would get all
of a million and a half.Don't you think you had better leave me
now?"She had not intended to propound this leading question so quickly,
but it came out as a natural climax to the situation.She realized
instantly that if he were really in love with her he would answer with
an emphatic "no."If he didn't care, he would hesitate, he would
delay, he would seek to put off the evil day of reckoning."I don't see that," he retorted irritably."I don't see that
there's any need for either interference or hasty action.What I
object to is their coming here and mixing in my private affairs."Jennie was cut to the quick by his indifference, his wrath instead
of affection.To her the main point at issue was her leaving him or
his leaving her.To him this recent interference was obviously the
chief matter for discussion and consideration.The meddling of others
before he was ready to act was the terrible thing.She had hoped, in
spite of what she had seen, that possibly, because of the long time
they had lived together and the things which (in a way) they had
endured together, he might have come to care for her deeply--that
she had stirred some emotion in him which would never brook real
separation, though some seeming separation might be necessary.He had
not married her, of course, but then there had been so many things
against them.Now, in this final hour, anyhow, he might have shown
that he cared deeply, even if he had deemed it necessary to let her
go.She felt for the time being as if, for all that she had lived with
him so long, she did not understand him, and yet, in spite of this
feeling, she knew also that she did.He could
not care for any one enthusiastically and demonstratively.He could
care enough to seize her and take her to himself as he had, but he
could not care enough to keep her if something more important
appeared.She was in a quandary, hurt,
bleeding, but for once in her life, determined.Whether he wanted to
or not, she must not let him make this sacrifice.She must leave
him--if he would not leave her.It was not important enough that
she should stay."Don't you think you had better act soon?"she continued, hoping
that some word of feeling would come from him."There is only a little
time left, isn't there?"Jennie nervously pushed a book to and fro on the table, her fear
that she would not be able to keep up appearances troubling her
greatly.It was hard for her to know what to do or say.Lester was so
terrible when he became angry.Still it ought not to be so hard for
him to go, now that he had Mrs.Gerald, if he only wished to do
so--and he ought to.His fortune was so much more important to
him than anything she could be."Don't worry about that," he replied stubbornly, his wrath at his
brother, and his family, and O'Brien still holding him.I don't know what I want to do yet.I like the effrontery of
these people!But I won't talk any more about it; isn't dinner nearly
ready?"He was so injured in his pride that he scarcely took the
trouble to be civil.He was forgetting all about her and what she was
feeling.He hated his brother Robert for this affront.He would have
enjoyed wringing the necks of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien,
singly and collectively.The question could not be dropped for good and all, and it came up
again at dinner, after Jennie had done her best to collect her
thoughts and quiet her nerves.They could not talk very freely because
of Vesta and Jeannette, but she managed to get in a word or two."I could take a little cottage somewhere," she suggested softly,
hoping to find him in a modified mood.I would not know what to do with a big house like this alone.""I wish you wouldn't discuss this business any longer, Jennie," he
persisted.I don't know that I'm going to do
anything of the sort.I don't know what I'm going to do."He was so
sour and obstinate, because of O'Brien, that she finally gave it up.Vesta was astonished to see her stepfather, usually so courteous, in
so grim a mood.Jennie felt a curious sense that she might hold him if she would,
for he was doubting; but she knew also that she should not wish.It was not fair to herself, or kind, or
decent."Oh yes, Lester, you must," she pleaded, at a later time."I won't
talk about it any more, but you must.I won't let you do anything
else."There were hours when it came up afterward--every day, in
fact--in their boudoir, in the library, in the dining-room, at
breakfast, but not always in words.She was sure that he should be made to
act.Since he was showing more kindly consideration for her, she was
all the more certain that he should act soon.Just how to go about it
she did not know, but she looked at him longingly, trying to help him
make up his mind.She would be happy, she assured herself--she
would be happy thinking that he was happy once she was away from him.He was a good man, most delightful in everything, perhaps, save his
gift of love.He really did not love her--could not perhaps,
after all that had happened, even though she loved him most earnestly.But his family had been most brutal in their opposition, and this had
affected his attitude.She could see
now how his big, strong brain might be working in a circle.He was too
decent to be absolutely brutal about this thing and leave her, too
really considerate to look sharply after his own interests as he
should, or hers--but he ought to."You must decide, Lester," she kept saying to him, from time to
time.Maybe, when this thing is all over you might want to come back
to me."I'm not ready to come to a decision," was his invariable reply."I
don't know that I want to leave you.This money is important, of
course, but money isn't everything.I can live on ten thousand a year
if necessary."Oh, but you're so much more placed in the world now, Lester," she
argued.Look how much it costs to run this house
alone.And a million and a half of dollars--why, I wouldn't let
you think of losing that."Where would you think of going if it came to that?"Do you remember that little town of
Sandwood, this side of Kenosha?I have often thought it would be a
pleasant place to live.""I don't like to think of this," he said finally in an outburst of
frankness.The conditions have all been against
this union of ours.I suppose I should have married you in the first
place.Jennie choked in her throat, but said nothing."Anyhow, this won't be the last of it, if I can help it," he
concluded.He was thinking that the storm might blow over; once he had
the money, and then--but he hated compromises and
subterfuges.It came by degrees to be understood that, toward the end of
February, she should look around at Sandwood and see what she could
find.She was to have ample means, he told her, everything that she
wanted.After a time he might come out and visit her occasionally.And
he was determined in his heart that he would make some people pay for
the trouble they had caused him.O'Brien
shortly and talk things over.He wanted for his personal satisfaction
to tell him what he thought of him.At the same time, in the background of his mind, moved the shadowy
figure of Mrs.Gerald--charming, sophisticated, well placed in
every sense of the word.He did not want to give her the broad reality
of full thought, but she was always there."Perhaps I'd better," he half concluded.When February came he was
ready to act.CHAPTER LIV


The little town of Sandwood, "this side of Kenosha," as Jennie had
expressed it, was only a short distance from Chicago, an hour and
fifteen minutes by the local train.It had a population of some three
hundred families, dwelling in small cottages, which were scattered
over a pleasant area of lake-shore property.The houses were not worth more than from three to five
thousand dollars each, but, in most cases, they were harmoniously
constructed, and the surrounding trees, green for the entire year,
gave them a pleasing summery appearance.Jennie, at the time they had
passed by there--it was an outing taken behind a pair of fast
horses--had admired the look of a little white church steeple,
set down among green trees, and the gentle rocking of the boats upon
the summer water."I should like to live in a place like this some time," she had
said to Lester, and he had made the comment that it was a little too
peaceful for him."I can imagine getting to the place where I might
like this, but not now.It came to her when
she thought that the world was trying.If she had to be alone ever and
could afford it she would like to live in a place like Sandwood.There
she would have a little garden, some chickens, perhaps, a tall pole
with a pretty bird-house on it, and flowers and trees and green grass
everywhere about.If she could have a little cottage in a place like
this which commanded a view of the lake she could sit of a summer
evening and sew.Vesta could play about or come home from school.She
might have a few friends, or not any.She was beginning to think that
she could do very well living alone if it were not for Vesta's social
needs.Books were pleasant things--she was finding that
out--books like Irving's Sketch Book, Lamb's Elia,
and Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales.Vesta was coming to be quite
a musician in her way, having a keen sense of the delicate and refined
in musical composition.She had a natural sense of harmony and a love
for those songs and instrumental compositions which reflect
sentimental and passionate moods; and she could sing and play quite
well.Her voice was, of course, quite untrained--she was only
fourteen--but it was pleasant to listen to.She was beginning to
show the combined traits of her mother and father--Jennie's
gentle, speculative turn of mind, combined with Brander's vivacity of
spirit and innate executive capacity.She could talk to her mother in
a sensible way about things, nature, books, dress, love, and from her
developing tendencies Jennie caught keen glimpses of the new worlds
which Vesta was to explore.The nature of modern school life, its
consideration of various divisions of knowledge, music, science, all
came to Jennie watching her daughter take up new themes.Vesta was
evidently going to be a woman of considerable ability--not
irritably aggressive, but self-constructive.She would be able to take
care of herself.All this pleased Jennie and gave her great hopes for
Vesta's future.The cottage which was finally secured at Sandwood was only a story
and a half in height, but it was raised upon red brick piers between
which were set green lattices and about which ran a veranda.The house
was long and narrow, its full length--some five rooms in a
row--facing the lake.There was a dining-room with windows
opening even with the floor, a large library with built-in shelves for
books, and a parlor whose three large windows afforded air and
sunshine at all times.The plot of ground in which this cottage stood was one hundred feet
square and ornamented with a few trees.The former owner had laid out
flower-beds, and arranged green hardwood tubs for the reception of
various hardy plants and vines.The house was painted white, with
green shutters and green shingles.It had been Lester's idea, since this thing must be, that Jennie
might keep the house in Hyde Park just as it was, but she did not want
to do that.At first, she did not think she would take
anything much with her, but she finally saw that it was advisable to
do as Lester suggested--to fit out the new place with a selection
of silverware, hangings, and furniture from the Hyde Park house."You have no idea what you will or may want," he said.A lease of the cottage was taken for two years, together with an
option for an additional five years, including the privilege of
purchase.So long as he was letting her go, Lester wanted to be
generous.He could not think of her as wanting for anything, and he
did not propose that she should.His one troublesome thought was, what
explanation was to be made to Vesta.He liked her very much and wanted
her "life kept free of complications."Why not send her off to a boarding-school until spring?"he
suggested once; but owing to the lateness of the season this was
abandoned as inadvisable.Later they agreed that business affairs made
it necessary for him to travel and for Jennie to move.Later Vesta
could be told that Jennie had left him for any reason she chose to
give.It was a trying situation, all the more bitter to Jennie because
she realized that in spite of the wisdom of it indifference to her was
involved.He really did not care enough, as much as he
cared.The relationship of man and woman which we study so passionately in
the hope of finding heaven knows what key to the mystery of existence
holds no more difficult or trying situation than this of mutual
compatibility broken or disrupted by untoward conditions which in
themselves have so little to do with the real force and beauty of the
relationship itself.These days of final dissolution in which this
household, so charmingly arranged, the scene of so many pleasant
activities, was literally going to pieces was a period of great trial
to both Jennie and Lester.On her part it was one of intense
suffering, for she was of that stable nature that rejoices to fix
itself in a serviceable and harmonious relationship, and then stay so.For her life was made up of those mystic chords of sympathy and memory
which bind up the transient elements of nature into a harmonious and
enduring scene.One of those chords--this home was her home,
united and made beautiful by her affection and consideration for each
person and every object.Now the time had come when it must cease.If she had ever had anything before in her life which had been like
this it might have been easier to part with it now, though, as she had
proved, Jennie's affections were not based in any way upon material
considerations.Her love of life and of personality were free from the
taint of selfishness.She went about among these various rooms
selecting this rug, that set of furniture, this and that ornament,
wishing all the time with all her heart and soul that it need not be.Just to think, in a little while Lester would not come any more of an
evening!She would not need to get up first of a morning and see that
coffee was made for her lord, that the table in the dining-room looked
just so.It had been a habit of hers to arrange a bouquet for the
table out of the richest blooming flowers of the conservatory, and she
had always felt in doing it that it was particularly for him.Now it
would not be necessary any more--not for him.When one is
accustomed to wait for the sound of a certain carriage-wheel of an
evening grating upon your carriage drive, when one is used to listen
at eleven, twelve, and one, waking naturally and joyfully to the echo
of a certain step on the stair, the separation, the ending of these
things, is keen with pain.These were the thoughts that were running
through Jennie's brain hour after hour and day after day.Lester on his part was suffering in another fashion.His was not
the sorrow of lacerated affection, of discarded and despised love, but
of that painful sense of unfairness which comes to one who knows that
he is making a sacrifice of the virtues--kindness, loyalty,
affection--to policy.Policy was dictating a very splendid course
of action from one point of view.Free of Jennie, providing for her
admirably, he was free to go his way, taking to himself the mass of
affairs which come naturally with great wealth.He could not help
thinking of the thousand and one little things which Jennie had been
accustomed to do for him, the hundred and one comfortable and pleasant
and delightful things she meant to him.The virtues which she
possessed were quite dear to his mind.He had gone over them time and
again.Now he was compelled to go over them finally, to see that she
was suffering without making a sign.Her manner and attitude toward
him in these last days were quite the same as they had always
been--no more, no less.She was not indulging in private
hysterics, as another woman might have done; she was not pretending a
fortitude in suffering she did not feel, showing him one face while
wishing him to see another behind it.She was calm, gentle,
considerate--thoughtful of him--where he would go and what
he would do, without irritating him by her inquiries.He was struck
quite favorably by her ability to take a large situation largely, and
he admired her.There was something to this woman, let the world think
what it might.It was a shame that her life was passed under such a
troubled star.The sound of its
voice was in his ears.It had on occasion shown him its bared teeth.The last hour came, when having made excuses to this and that
neighbor, when having spread the information that they were going
abroad, when Lester had engaged rooms at the Auditorium, and the mass
of furniture which could not be used had gone to storage, that it was
necessary to say farewell to this Hyde Park domicile.Jennie had
visited Sandwood in company with Lester several times.He had
carefully examined the character of the place.He was satisfied that
it was nice but lonely.Spring was at hand, the flowers would be
something.She was going to keep a gardener and man of all work."Very well," he said, "only I want you to be comfortable."In the mean time Lester had been arranging his personal affairs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien through his own
attorney, Mr.Watson, that he would expect them to deliver his share
of his father's securities on a given date.He had made up his mind
that as long as he was compelled by circumstances to do this thing he
would do a number of other things equally ruthless.He would sit as a director in the United Carriage
Company--with his share of the stock it would be impossible to
keep him out.Gerald's money he would become a
controlling factor in the United Traction of Cincinnati, in which his
brother was heavily interested, and in the Western Steel Works, of
which his brother was now the leading adviser.What a different figure
he would be now from that which he had been during the past few
years!Jennie was depressed to the point of despair.When she first came here
and neighbors had begun to drop in she had imagined herself on the
threshold of a great career, that some day, possibly, Lester would
marry her.Now, blow after blow had been delivered, and the home and
dream were a ruin.Jeannette, Harry Ward, and Mrs.Frissell had been discharged, the furniture for a good part was in
storage, and for her, practically, Lester was no more.She realized
clearly that he would not come back.If he could do this thing now,
even considerately, he could do much more when he was free and away
later.Immersed in his great affairs, he would forget, of course.Had not everything--everything
illustrated that to her?Love was not enough in this world--that
was so plain.One needed education, wealth, training, the ability to
fight and scheme, She did not want to do that.The day came when the house was finally closed and the old life was
at an end.Lester traveled with Jennie to Sandwood.He spent some
little while in the house trying to get her used to the idea of
change--it was not so bad.He intimated that he would come again
soon, but he went away, and all his words were as nothing against the
fact of the actual and spiritual separation.When Jennie saw him going
down the brick walk that afternoon, his solid, conservative figure
clad in a new tweed suit, his overcoat on his arm, self-reliance and
prosperity written all over him, she thought that she would die.She
had kissed Lester good-by and had wished him joy, prosperity, peace;
then she made an excuse to go to her bedroom.Vesta came after a time,
to seek her, but now her eyes were quite dry; everything had subsided
to a dull ache.The new life was actually begun for her--a life
without Lester, without Gerhardt, without any one save Vesta.she thought, as she went
into the kitchen, for she had determined to do at least some of her
own work.If it
were not for Vesta she would have sought some regular outside
employment.Anything to keep from brooding, for in that direction lay
madness.CHAPTER LV


The social and business worlds of Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
and other cities saw, during the year or two which followed the
breaking of his relationship with Jennie, a curious rejuvenation in
the social and business spirit of Lester Kane.He had become rather
distant and indifferent to certain personages and affairs while he was
living with her, but now he suddenly appeared again, armed with
authority from a number of sources, looking into this and that matter
with the air of one who has the privilege of power, and showing
himself to be quite a personage from the point of view of finance and
commerce.It must be admitted that he was in
some respects a mentally altered Lester.Up to the time he had met
Jennie he was full of the assurance of the man who has never known
defeat.To have been reared in luxury as he had been, to have seen
only the pleasant side of society, which is so persistent and so
deluding where money is concerned, to have been in the run of big
affairs not because one has created them, but because one is a part of
them and because they are one's birthright, like the air one breathes,
could not help but create one of those illusions of solidarity which
is apt to befog the clearest brain.It is so hard for us to know what
we have not seen.It is so difficult for us to feel what we have not
experienced.Like this world of ours, which seems so solid and
persistent solely because we have no knowledge of the power which
creates it, Lester's world seemed solid and persistent and real enough
to him.It was only when the storms set in and the winds of adversity
blew and he found himself facing the armed forces of convention that
he realized he might be mistaken as to the value of his personality,
that his private desires and opinions were as nothing in the face of a
public conviction; that he was wrong.The race spirit, or social
avatar, the "Zeitgeist" as the Germans term it, manifested itself as
something having a system in charge, and the organization of society
began to show itself to him as something based on possibly a
spiritual, or, at least, superhuman counterpart.He could not fly in
the face of it.The
people of his time believed that some particular form of social
arrangement was necessary, and unless he complied with that he could,
as he saw, readily become a social outcast.His own father and mother
had turned on him--his brother and sisters, society, his friends.Dear heaven, what a to-do this action of his had created!Why, even
the fates seemed adverse.His real estate venture was one of the most
fortuitously unlucky things he had ever heard of.Were the gods
battling on the side of a to him unimportant social arrangement?Anyhow, he had been compelled to quit, and here he was,
vigorous, determined, somewhat battered by the experience, but still
forceful and worth while.And it was a part of the penalty that he had become measurably
soured by what had occurred.He was feeling that he had been compelled
to do the first ugly, brutal thing of his life.It was a shame to forsake her after all the devotion she had
manifested.Truly she had played a finer part than he.Worst of all,
his deed could not be excused on the grounds of necessity.He could
have lived on ten thousand a year; he could have done without the
million and more which was now his.He could have done without the
society, the pleasures of which had always been a lure.He could have,
but he had not, and he had complicated it all with the thought of
another woman.That was a question which always rose
before him.Wasn't she deliberately scheming under
his very eyes to win him away from the woman who was as good as his
wife?Was it the thing a truly big woman would do?Ought he
to marry any one seeing that he really owed a spiritual if not a legal
allegiance to Jennie?Was it worth while for any woman to marry him?He could not shut
out the fact that he was doing a cruel and unlovely thing.Material error in the first place was now being complicated with
spiritual error.He was attempting to right the first by committing
the second.He was
thinking, thinking, all the while he was readjusting his life to the
old (or perhaps better yet, new) conditions, and he was not feeling
any happier.As a matter of fact he was feeling worse--grim,
revengeful.If he married Letty he thought at times it would be to use
her fortune as a club to knock other enemies over the head, and he
hated to think he was marrying her for that.He took up his abode at
the Auditorium, visited Cincinnati in a distant and aggressive spirit,
sat in council with the board of directors, wishing that he was more
at peace with himself, more interested in life.But he did not change
his policy in regard to Jennie.Gerald had been vitally interested in Lester's
rehabilitation.She waited tactfully some little time before sending
him any word; finally she ventured to write to him at the Hyde Park
address (as if she did not know where he was), asking, "Where are
you?"By this time Lester had become slightly accustomed to the change
in his life.He was saying to himself that he needed sympathetic
companionship, the companionship of a woman, of course.Social
invitations had begun to come to him now that he was alone and that
his financial connections were so obviously restored.He had made his
appearance, accompanied only by a Japanese valet, at several country
houses, the best sign that he was once more a single man.No reference
was made by any one to the past.Gerald's note he decided that he ought to go and
see her.For months preceding his
separation from Jennie he had not gone near her.Even now he waited
until time brought a 'phoned invitation to dinner.Gerald was at her best as a hostess at her perfectly appointed
dinner-table.Alboni, the pianist, was there on this occasion,
together with Adam Rascavage, the sculptor, a visiting scientist from
England, Sir Nelson Keyes, and, curiously enough, Mr.Berry
Dodge, whom Lester had not met socially in several years.Gerald
and Lester exchanged the joyful greetings of those who understand each
other thoroughly and are happy in each other's company."Aren't you
ashamed of yourself, sir," she said to him when he made his
appearance, "to treat me so indifferently?You are going to be
punished for this."I
suppose something like ninety stripes will serve me about right."What is it they do to evil-doers in Siam?""Boil them in oil, I suppose.""Well, anyhow, that's more like."Be sure and tell me when you decide," he laughed, and passed on to
be presented to distinguished strangers by Mrs.Lester was always at his ease
intellectually, and this mental atmosphere revived him.Presently he
turned to greet Berry Dodge, who was standing at his elbow."We
haven't seen you in--oh, when?Dodge is waiting to have a
word with you."Lester noticed the change in Dodge's attitude."Some time, that's sure," he replied easily."I'm living at the
Auditorium.""I was asking after you the other day.We were thinking of running up into Canada for some
hunting.He had seen Lester's election as a
director of the C. H.& D. Obviously he was coming back into the
world.But dinner was announced and Lester sat at Mrs."Aren't you coming to pay me a dinner call some afternoon after
this?"Gerald confidentially when the conversation was
brisk at the other end of the table."I am, indeed," he replied, "and shortly.Seriously, I've been
wanting to look you up.He felt as if he must talk with her; he
was feeling bored and lonely; his long home life with Jennie had made
hotel life objectionable.He felt as though he must find a
sympathetic, intelligent ear, and where better than here?Letty was
all ears for his troubles.She would have pillowed his solid head upon
her breast in a moment if that had been possible."Well," he said, when the usual fencing preliminaries were over,
"what will you have me say in explanation?""I'm not so sure," he replied gravely."And I can't say that I'm
feeling any too joyous about the matter as a whole.""I knew how it would be with you.I can see you wading through this mentally, Lester.I have been
watching you, every step of the way, wishing you peace of mind.These
things are always so difficult, but don't you know I am still sure
it's for the best.You couldn't afford to sink back into a mere shell-fish life.You
are not organized temperamentally for that any more than I am.You may
regret what you are doing now, but you would have regretted the other
thing quite as much and more.You couldn't work your life out that
way--now, could you?""I don't know about that, Letty.I've wanted to
come and see you for a long time, but I didn't think that I ought to.The fight was outside--you know what I mean.""Yes, indeed, I do," she said soothingly.I don't know whether
this financial business binds me sufficiently or not.I'll be frank
and tell you that I can't say I love her entirely; but I'm sorry, and
that's something.""She's comfortably provided for, of course," she commented rather
than inquired.She's retiring by nature and doesn't care for show.I've taken a cottage for her at Sandwood, a little place north of here
on the lake; and there's plenty of money in trust, but, of course, she
knows she can live anywhere she pleases.""I understand exactly how she feels, Lester.She is going to suffer very keenly for a while--we all do when we
have to give up the thing we love.But we can get over it, and we do.It will go hard at first, but after a
while she will see how it is, and she won't feel any the worse toward
you.""Jennie will never reproach me, I know that," he replied."I'm the
one who will do the reproaching.The trouble is with my particular turn of mind.I can't tell, for the
life of me, how much of this disturbing feeling of mine is
habit--the condition that I'm accustomed to--and how much is
sympathy.I sometimes think I'm the the most pointless individual in
the world.You're lonely living where you are, aren't you?""Why not come and spend a few days down at West Baden?"I could come Thursday, for a few days."We can walk and talk things out
down there.She came toward him, trailing a lavender lounging robe."You're
such a solemn philosopher, sir," she observed comfortably, "working
through all the ramifications of things."I can't help it," he replied."Well, one thing I know--" and she tweaked his ear gently."You're not going to make another mistake through sympathy if I can
help it," she said daringly."You're going to stay disentangled long
enough to give yourself a chance to think out what you want to do.And I wish for one thing you'd take over the management of my
affairs.You could advise me so much better than my lawyer."He arose and walked to the window, turning to look back at her
solemnly."I know what you want," he said doggedly.She
looked at him pleadingly, defiantly."You don't know what you're doing," he grumbled; but he kept on
looking at her; she stood there, attractive as a woman of her age
could be, wise, considerate, full of friendship and affection."You ought not to want to marry me.It won't be
worth anything in the long run.""It will be worth something to me," she insisted.Finally he drew her to him, and
put his arms about her waist.he said; "I'm not worth
it."No, I'll not," she replied.I don't care
what you think you are worth.""If you keep on I venture to say you'll have me," he returned."Oh," she exclaimed, and hid her hot face against his breast."This is bad business," he thought, even as he held her within the
circle of his arms."It isn't what I ought to be doing."Still he held her, and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he
kissed her again and again.CHAPTER LVI


It is difficult to say whether Lester might not have returned to
Jennie after all but for certain influential factors.After a time,
with his control of his portion of the estate firmly settled in his
hands and the storm of original feeling forgotten, he was well aware
that diplomacy--if he ignored his natural tendency to fulfil even
implied obligations--could readily bring about an arrangement
whereby he and Jennie could be together.But he was haunted by the
sense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the
form of Mrs.He was compelled to set over against his natural
tendency toward Jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the
personality and fortunes of her rival, who was one of the most
significant and interesting figures on the social horizon.For think
as he would, these two women were now persistently opposed in his
consciousness.The one polished, sympathetic,
philosophic--schooled in all the niceties of polite society, and
with the means to gratify her every wish; the other natural,
sympathetic, emotional, with no schooling in the ways of polite
society, but with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely
things in human relationship which made her beyond any question an
exceptional woman.Her criticism
of Lester's relationship with Jennie was not that she was not worth
while, but that conditions made it impolitic.On the other hand, union
with her was an ideal climax for his social aspirations.He would be as happy with her as he would
be with Jennie--almost--and he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that this Western social and financial world held no more
significant figure than himself.It was not wise to delay either this
latter excellent solution of his material problems, and after thinking
it over long and seriously he finally concluded that he would not.He
had already done Jennie the irreparable wrong of leaving her.What
difference did it make if he did this also?She was possessed of
everything she could possibly want outside of himself.She had herself
deemed it advisable for him to leave.By such figments of the brain,
in the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions, he was becoming
used to the idea of a new alliance.The thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in
some form with Jennie was the constant presence of Mrs.Circumstances conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental
quandary at this time.Alone he could do nothing save to make visits
here and there, and he did not care to do that.He was too indifferent
mentally to gather about him as a bachelor that atmosphere which he
enjoyed and which a woman like Mrs.Their home then, wherever it
was, would be full of clever people.He would need to do little save
to appear and enjoy it.She understood quite as well as any one how he
liked to live.She enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting.There were so many things they could do together nicely.He visited
West Baden at the same time she did, as she suggested.He gave himself
over to her in Chicago for dinners, parties, drives.Her house was
quite as much his own as hers--she made him feel so.She talked
to him about her affairs, showing him exactly how they stood and why
she wished him to intervene in this and that matter.She did not wish
him to be much alone.She did not want him to think or regret.She
came to represent to him comfort, forgetfulness, rest from care.With
the others he visited at her house occasionally, and it gradually
became rumored about that he would marry her.Because of the fact that
there had been so much discussion of his previous relationship, Letty
decided that if ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair.She
wanted a simple explanation in the papers of how it had come about,
and then afterward, when things were normal again and gossip had
subsided, she would enter on a dazzling social display for his
sake."Why not let us get married in April and go abroad for the summer?"she asked once, after they had reached a silent understanding that
marriage would eventually follow.Then we can come
back in the fall, and take a house on the drive."Lester had been away from Jennie so long now that the first severe
wave of self-reproach had passed.He was still doubtful, but he
preferred to stifle his misgivings."Very well," he replied, almost
jokingly."Only don't let there be any fuss about it."she exclaimed, looking over at
him; they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and
chatting."I've thought about it a long while," he replied.She came over to him and sat on his knee, putting her arms upon his
shoulders."I can scarcely believe you said that," she said, looking at him
curiously.But my, what a
trousseau I will prepare!"He smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head; there was
a missing note somewhere in this gamut of happiness; perhaps it was
because he was getting old.CHAPTER LVII


In the meantime Jennie was going her way, settling herself in the
markedly different world in which henceforth she was to move.It
seemed a terrible thing at first--this life without Lester.Despite her own strong individuality, her ways had become so involved
with his that there seemed to be no possibility of disentangling them.Constantly she was with him in thought and action, just as though they
had never separated.In the mornings when she woke it was with
the sense that he must be beside her.At night as if she could not go
to bed alone.He would come after a while surely--ah, no, of
course he would not come.Again there were so many little trying things to adjust, for a
change of this nature is too radical to be passed over lightly.The
explanation she had to make to Vesta was of all the most important.This little girl, who was old enough now to see and think for herself,
was not without her surmises and misgivings.Vesta recalled that her
mother had been accused of not being married to her father when she
was born.She had seen the article about Jennie and Lester in the
Sunday paper at the time it had appeared--it had been shown to
her at school--but she had had sense enough to say nothing about
it, feeling somehow that Jennie would not like it.Lester's
disappearance was a complete surprise; but she had learned in the last
two or three years that her mother was very sensitive, and that she
could hurt her in unexpected ways.Jennie was finally compelled to
tell Vesta that Lester's fortune had been dependent on his leaving
her, solely because she was not of his station.Vesta listened soberly
and half suspected the truth.She felt terribly sorry for her mother,
and, because of Jennie's obvious distress, she was trebly gay and
courageous.She refused outright the suggestion of going to a
boarding-school and kept as close to her mother as she could.She
found interesting books to read with her, insisted that they go to see
plays together, played to her on the piano, and asked for her mother's
criticisms on her drawing and modeling.She found a few friends in the
excellent Sand wood school, and brought them home of an evening to add
lightness and gaiety to the cottage life.Jennie, through her growing
appreciation of Vesta's fine character, became more and more drawn
toward her.Lester was gone, but at least she had Vesta.That prop
would probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence.There was also her history to account for to the residents of
Sandwood.In many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life
it is not necessary to say much of one's past, but as a rule something
must be said.People have the habit of inquiring--if they are no
more than butchers and bakers.By degrees one must account for this
and that fact, and it was so here.She could not say that her husband
was dead.She had to say that she had left
him--to give the impression that it would be she, if any one, who
would permit him to return.This put her in an interesting and
sympathetic light in the neighborhood.It was the most sensible thing
to do.She then settled down to a quiet routine of existence, waiting
what denouement to her life she could not guess.Sandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature, and
this, with the devotion of Vesta, offered some slight solace.There
was the beauty of the lake, which, with its passing boats, was a
never-ending source of joy, and there were many charming drives in the
surrounding country.Jennie had her own horse and carryall--one
of the horses of the pair they had used in Hyde Park.Other household
pets appeared in due course of time, including a collie, that Vesta
named Rats; she had brought him from Chicago as a puppy, and he had
grown to be a sterling watch-dog, sensible and affectionate.There was
also a cat, Jimmy Woods, so called after a boy Vesta knew, and to whom
she insisted the cat bore a marked resemblance.There was a singing
thrush, guarded carefully against a roving desire for bird-food on the
part of Jimmy Woods, and a jar of goldfish.So this little household
drifted along quietly and dreamily indeed, but always with the
undercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep.There was no word from Lester for the first few weeks following his
departure; he was too busy following up the threads of his new
commercial connections and too considerate to wish to keep Jennie in a
state of mental turmoil over communications which, under the present
circumstances, could mean nothing.He preferred to let matters rest
for the time being; then a little later he would write her sanely and
calmly of how things were going.He did this after the silence of a
month, saying that he had been pretty well pressed by commercial
affairs, that he had been in and out of the city frequently (which was
the truth), and that he would probably be away from Chicago a large
part of the time in the future.He inquired after Vesta and the
condition of affairs generally at Sandwood."I may get up there one of
these days," he suggested, but he really did not mean to come, and
Jennie knew that he did not.Another month passed, and then there was a second letter from him,
not so long as the first one.Jennie had written him frankly and
fully, telling him just how things stood with her.She concealed
entirely her own feelings in the matter, saying that she liked the
life very much, and that she was glad to be at Sand wood.She
expressed the hope that now everything was coming out for the best for
him, and tried to show him that she was really glad matters had been
settled."You mustn't think of me as being unhappy," she said in one
place, "for I'm not.I am sure it ought to be just as it is, and I
wouldn't be happy if it were any other way.Lay out your life so as to
give yourself the greatest happiness, Lester," she added.Whatever you do will be just right for me.Gerald in mind, and he suspected as much, but he felt that her
generosity must be tinged greatly with self-sacrifice and secret
unhappiness.It was the one thing which made him hesitate about taking
that final step.The written word and the hidden thought--how they conflict!After six months the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on
his part, and at eight it had ceased temporarily.One morning, as she was glancing over the daily paper, she saw
among the society notes the following item:

The engagement of Mrs.Malcolm Gerald, of 4044 Drexel Boulevard,
to Lester Kane, second son of the late Archibald Kane, of Cincinnati,
was formally announced at a party given by the prospective bride on
Tuesday to a circle of her immediate friends.For a few minutes she sat perfectly
still, looking straight ahead of her.She had known that it must
come, and yet--and yet she had always hoped that it would not.Had not she
herself suggested this very thing in a roundabout way?The idea was
objectionable to her.And yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers
absolutely.In the hands of a trust company in La Salle Street were
railway certificates aggregating seventy-five thousand dollars, which
yielded four thousand five hundred annually, the income being paid to
her direct.Jennie felt hurt through and through by this denouement, and yet as
she sat there she realized that it was foolish to be angry.Life was
always doing this sort of a thing to her.If she went out in the world and earned her own living
what difference would it make to him?Here she was walled in this little place, leading an
obscure existence, and there was he out in the great world enjoying
life in its fullest and freest sense.Her eyes indeed were dry, but her very soul seemed to be torn in
pieces within her.She rose carefully, hid the newspaper at the bottom
of a trunk, and turned the key upon it.CHAPTER LVIII


Now that his engagement to Mrs.Gerald was an accomplished, fact,
Lester found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the
new order of things; undoubtedly it was all for the best.He was sorry
for Jennie--very sorry.Gerald; but there was a
practical unguent to her grief in the thought that it was best for
both Lester and the girl.And
Jennie would eventually realize that she had done a wise and kindly
thing; she would be glad in the consciousness that she had acted so
unselfishly.Gerald, because of her indifference to the
late Malcolm Gerald, and because she was realizing the dreams of her
youth in getting Lester at last--even though a little
late--she was intensely happy.She could think of nothing finer
than this daily life with him--the places they would go, the
things they would see.Lester Kane
the following winter was going to be something worth remembering.And
as for Japan--that was almost too good to be true.Lester wrote to Jennie of his coming marriage to Mrs.He
said that he had no explanation to make.It wouldn't be worth anything
if he did make it.He
thought he ought to let her (Jennie) know.He
wanted her always to feel that he had her real interests at heart.He
would do anything in his power to make life as pleasant and agreeable
for her as possible.And would she
remember him affectionately to Vesta?She ought to be sent to a
finishing school.She knew that Lester had
been drawn to Mrs.Gerald from the time he met her at the Carlton in
London.She was glad to write and tell him
so, explaining that she had seen the announcement in the papers.Lester read her letter thoughtfully; there was more between the lines
than the written words conveyed.Her fortitude was a charm to him even
in this hour.In spite of all he had done and what he was now going to
do, he realized that he still cared for Jennie in a way.She was a
noble and a charming woman.If everything else had been all right he
would not be going to marry Mrs.The ceremony was performed on April fifteenth, at the residence of
Mrs.Gerald, a Roman Catholic priest officiating.Lester was a poor
example of the faith he occasionally professed.He was an agnostic,
but because he had been reared in the church he felt that he might as
well be married in it.Some fifty guests, intimate friends, had been
invited.There were
jubilant congratulations and showers of rice and confetti.While the
guests were still eating and drinking Lester and Letty managed to
escape by a side entrance into a closed carriage, and were off.Fifteen minutes later there was pursuit pell-mell on the part of the
guests to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific depot; but by that time
the happy couple were in their private car, and the arrival of the
rice throwers made no difference.More champagne was opened; then the
starting of the train ended all excitement, and the newly wedded pair
were at last safely off."Well, now you have me," said Lester, cheerfully pulling Letty down
beside him into a seat, "what of it?""This of it," she exclaimed, and hugged him close, kissing him
fervently.In four days they were in San Francisco, and two days later
on board a fast steamship bound for the land of the Mikado.In the meanwhile Jennie was left to brood.The original
announcement in the newspapers had said that he was to be married in
April, and she had kept close watch for additional information.Finally she learned that the wedding would take place on April
fifteenth at the residence of the prospective bride, the hour being
high noon.In spite of her feeling of resignation, Jennie followed it
all hopelessly, like a child, hungry and forlorn, looking into a
lighted window at Christmas time.On the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve o'clock
to strike; it seemed as though she were really present--and
looking on.She could see in her mind's eye the handsome residence,
the carriages, the guests, the feast, the merriment, the
ceremony--all.Telepathically and psychologically she received
impressions of the private car and of the joyous journey they were
going to take.The papers had stated that they would spend their
honeymoon in Japan.She could see her now--the new Mrs.Kane that ever was, lying in his arms.There was a solid lump in
her throat as she thought of this.She sighed to herself,
and clasped her hands forcefully; but it did no good.She was just as
miserable as before.When the day was over she was actually relieved; anyway, the deed
was done and nothing could change it.Vesta was sympathetically aware
of what was happening, but kept silent.She too had seen the report in
the newspaper.When the first and second day after had passed Jennie
was much calmer mentally, for now she was face to face with the
inevitable.But it was weeks before the sharp pain dulled to the old
familiar ache.Then there were months before they would be back again,
though, of course, that made no difference now.Only Japan seemed so
far off, and somehow she had liked the thought that Lester was near
her--somewhere in the city.The spring and summer passed, and now it was early in October.One
chilly day Vesta came home from school complaining of a headache.When
Jennie had given her hot milk--a favorite remedy of her
mother's--and had advised a cold towel for the back of her head,
Vesta went to her room and lay down.The following morning she had a
slight fever.This lingered while the local physician, Dr.Emory,
treated her tentatively, suspecting that it might be typhoid, of which
there were several cases in the village.This doctor told Jennie that
Vesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it off, but
it might be that she would have a severe siege.Mistrusting her own
skill in so delicate a situation, Jennie sent to Chicago for a trained
nurse, and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination
of fear, longing, hope, and courage.Now there could be no doubt; the disease was typhoid.Jennie
hesitated about communicating with Lester, who was supposed to be in
New York; the papers had said that he intended to spend the winter
there.But when the doctor, after watching the case for a week,
pronounced it severe, she thought she ought to write anyhow, for no
one could tell what would happen.Lester had been so fond of Vesta.The letter sent to him did not reach him, for at the time it
arrived he was on his way to the West Indies.Jennie was compelled to
watch alone by Vesta's sick-bed, for although sympathetic neighbors,
realizing the pathos of the situation were attentive, they could not
supply the spiritual consolation which only those who truly love us
can give.There was a period when Vesta appeared to be rallying, and
both the physician and the nurse were hopeful; but afterward she
became weaker.Emory that her heart and kidneys had
become affected.There came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was
imminent.The doctor's face was grave, the nurse was non-committal in
her opinion.Jennie hovered about, praying the only prayer that is
prayer--the fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one
issue--that Vesta should get well.The child had come so close to
her during the last few years!She was
beginning to realize clearly what her life had been.And Jennie,
through her, had grown to a broad understanding of responsibility.She
knew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have children.If
Lester had not objected to it, and she had been truly married, she
would have been glad to have others.Again, she had always felt that
she owed Vesta so much--at least a long and happy life to make up
to her for the ignominy of her birth and rearing.Jennie had been so
happy during the past few years to see Vesta growing into beautiful,
graceful, intelligent womanhood.Emory
finally sent to Chicago for a physician friend of his, who came to
consider the case with him.He was an old man, grave, sympathetic,
understanding."The treatment has been correct," he
said."Her system does not appear to be strong enough to endure the
strain.Some physiques are more susceptible to this malady than
others."It was agreed that if within three days a change for the
better did not come the end was close at hand.No one can conceive the strain to which Jennie's spirit was
subjected by this intelligence, for it was deemed best that she should
know.She hovered about white-faced--feeling intensely, but
scarcely thinking.She seemed to vibrate consciously with Vesta's
altering states.If there was the least improvement she felt it
physically.If there was a decline her barometric temperament
registered the fact.Davis, a fine, motherly soul of fifty, stout and
sympathetic, who lived four doors from Jennie, and who understood
quite well how she was feeling.She had co-operated with the nurse and
doctor from the start to keep Jennie's mental state as nearly normal
as possible."Now, you just go to your room and lie down, Mrs.Kane," she would
say to Jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the bedside or
wandering to and fro, wondering what to do.Lord bless you, don't you
think I know?I've been the mother of seven and lost three.Jennie put her head on her big, warm shoulder one
day and cried.And she led her
to her sleeping-room.She came back after a few minutes
unrested and unrefreshed.Finally one midnight, when the nurse had
persuaded her that all would be well until morning anyhow, there came
a hurried stirring in the sick-room.Jennie was lying down for a few
minutes on her bed in the adjoining room.Davis had come in, and she and the nurse were conferring as to Vesta's
condition--standing close beside her.She came up and looked at her daughter keenly.Vesta's pale, waxen face told the story.She was breathing faintly,
her eyes closed."She's very weak," whispered the nurse.The moments passed, and after a time the clock in the hall struck
one.Miss Murfree, the nurse, moved to the medicine-table several
times, wetting a soft piece of cotton cloth with alcohol and bathing
Vesta's lips.At the striking of the half-hour there was a stir of the
weak body--a profound sigh."There, there, you poor dear," she
whispered when she began to shake.Jennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed Vesta's still
warm hand."Oh no, Vesta," she pleaded."There, dear, come now," soothed the voice of Mrs."Can't
you leave it all in God's hands?Can't you believe that everything is
for the best?"Jennie felt as if the earth had fallen.There
was no light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence.CHAPTER LIX


This added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to
throw Jennie back into that state of hyper-melancholia from which she
had been drawn with difficulty during the few years of comfort and
affection which she had enjoyed with Lester in Hyde Park.It was
really weeks before she could realize that Vesta was gone.The
emaciated figure which she saw for a day or two after the end did not
seem like Vesta.Where was the joy and lightness, the quickness of
motion, the subtle radiance of health?Only this pale,
lily-hued shell--and silence.Jennie had no tears to shed; only a
deep, insistent pain to feel.If only some counselor of eternal wisdom
could have whispered to her that obvious and convincing
truth--there are no dead.Davis, and some others among the
neighbors were most sympathetic and considerate.Davis sent a
telegram to Lester saying that Vesta was dead, but, being absent,
there was no response.The house was looked after with scrupulous care
by others, for Jennie was incapable of attending to it herself.She
walked about looking at things which Vesta had owned or
liked--things which Lester or she had given her--sighing
over the fact that Vesta would not need or use them any more.She gave
instructions that the body should be taken to Chicago and buried in
the Cemetery of the Redeemer, for Lester, at the time of Gerhardt's
death, had purchased a small plot of ground there.She also expressed
her wish that the minister of the little Lutheran church in Cottage
Grove Avenue, where Gerhardt had attended, should be requested to say
a few words at the grave.There were the usual preliminary services at
the house.The local Methodist minister read a portion of the first
epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, and a body of Vesta's classmates
sang "Nearer My God to Thee."There were flowers, a white coffin, a
world of sympathetic expressions, and then Vesta was taken away.The
coffin was properly incased for transportation, put on the train, and
finally delivered at the Lutheran cemetery in Chicago.She was dazed, almost to the point
of insensibility.Five of her neighborhood friends, at the
solicitation of Mrs.At the
grave-side when the body was finally lowered she looked at it, one
might have thought indifferently, for she was numb from suffering.She
returned to Sandwood after it was all over, saying that she would not
stay long.She wanted to come back to Chicago, where she could be near
Vesta and Gerhardt.After the funeral Jennie tried to think of her future.She fixed
her mind on the need of doing something, even though she did not need
to.She thought that she might like to try nursing, and could start at
once to obtain the training which was required.He was unmarried, and perhaps he might be willing to come and
live with her.Only she did not know where he was, and Bass was also
in ignorance of his whereabouts.She finally concluded that she would
try to get work in a store.She
could not live alone here, and she could not have her neighbors
sympathetically worrying over what was to become of her.Miserable as
she was, she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in Chicago,
and looking for something to do, or living in a cottage somewhere near
the Cemetery of the Redeemer.It also occurred to her that she might
adopt a homeless child.There were a number of orphan asylums in the
city.Some three weeks after Vesta's death Lester returned to Chicago
with his wife, and discovered the first letter, the telegram, and an
additional note telling him that Vesta was dead.He was truly grieved,
for his affection for the girl had been real.He was very sorry for
Jennie, and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her.Perhaps
he could suggest something which would help her.He took the train to
Sandwood, but Jennie had gone to the Hotel Tremont in Chicago.He went
there, but Jennie had gone to her daughter's grave; later he called
again and found her in.When the boy presented his card she suffered
an upwelling of feeling--a wave that was more intense than that
with which she had received him in the olden days, for now her need of
him was greater.Lester, in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the
restoration of his wealth, power, and dignities, had had time to think
deeply of what he had done.His original feeling of doubt and
dissatisfaction with himself had never wholly quieted.It did not ease
him any to know that he had left Jennie comfortably fixed, for it was
always so plain to him that money was not the point at issue with her.Without it she was like a rudderless
boat on an endless sea, and he knew it.She needed him, and he was
ashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his sense of
self-preservation and his desire for material advantage.To-day as the
elevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry, though he
knew now that no act of his could make things right.He had been to
blame from the very beginning, first for taking her, then for failing
to stick by a bad bargain.The best
thing he could do was to be fair, to counsel with her, to give her the
best of his sympathy and advice."Hello, Jennie," he said familiarly as she opened the door to him
in her hotel room, his glance taking in the ravages which death and
suffering had wrought.She was thinner, her face quite drawn and
colorless, her eyes larger by contrast."I'm awfully sorry about
Vesta," he said a little awkwardly."I never dreamed anything like
that could happen."It was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her
since Vesta died--since Lester had left her, in fact.It touched
her that he had come to sympathize; for the moment she could not
speak.Tears welled over her eyelids and down upon her cheeks."Don't cry, Jennie," he said, putting his arm around her and
holding her head to his shoulder.I've been sorry for a
good many things that can't be helped now."Beside papa," she said, sobbing."Too bad," he murmured, and held her in silence.She finally gained
control of herself sufficiently to step away from him; then wiping her
eyes with her handkerchief, she asked him to sit down."I'm so sorry," he went on, "that this should have happened while I
was away.I would have been with you if I had been here.I suppose you
won't want to live out at Sand wood now?""I can't, Lester," she replied.I didn't want to be a bother to those people
out there.I thought I'd get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby
maybe, or get something to do."That isn't a bad idea," he said, "that of adopting a baby.It
would be a lot of company for you.You know how to go about getting
one?""You just ask at one of these asylums, don't you?""I think there's something more than that," he replied
thoughtfully."There are some formalities--I don't know what they
are.They try to keep control of the child in some way.You had better
consult with Watson and get him to help you.Pick out your baby, and
then let him do the rest.Lester saw that she needed companionship badly."He's in Rochester, but he couldn't come.Bass said he was
married," she added."There isn't any other member of the family you could persuade to
come and live with you?""I might get William, but I don't know where he is.""Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park," he suggested,
"if you want a house here in Chicago?I see some nice cottages out
that way.Just rent until you see how well you're
satisfied."Jennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester.It was
good of him to take this much interest in her affairs.She wasn't
entirely separated from him after all.She asked
him how his wife was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he
was going to stay in Chicago.All the while he was thinking that he
had treated her badly.He went to the window and looked down into
Dearborn Street, the world of traffic below holding his attention.The
great mass of trucks and vehicles, the counter streams of hurrying
pedestrians, seemed like a puzzle.It was
growing dusk, and lights were springing up here and there."I want to tell you something, Jennie," said Lester, finally
rousing himself from his fit of abstraction."I may seem peculiar to
you, after all that has happened, but I still care for you--in my
way.I've thought of you right along since I left.I thought it good
business to leave you--the way things were.I thought I liked
Letty well enough to marry her.From one point of view it still seems
best, but I'm not so much happier.I was just as happy with you as I
ever will be.It isn't myself that's important in this transaction
apparently; the individual doesn't count much in the situation.I
don't know whether you see what I'm driving at, but all of us are more
or less pawns.We're moved about like chessmen by circumstances over
which we have no control.""After all, life is more or less of a farce," he went on a little
bitterly.The best we can do is to hold our
personality intact.It doesn't appear that integrity has much to do
with it."Jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew
it meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry
for her."Don't worry over me, Lester," she consoled."I'm all right; I'll
get along.It did seem terrible to me for a while--getting used
to being alone."I want you to feel that my attitude hasn't changed," he continued
eagerly.Mrs.--Letty
understands that.When you get settled I'll
come in and see how you're fixed.I'll come around here again in a few
days.You understand how I feel, don't you?"He took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own."Don't
worry," he said."I don't want you to do that.You're still Jennie to me, if you don't mind.I'm pretty bad, but I'm
not all bad."You probably are happy since--"

"Now, Jennie," he interrupted; then he pressed affectionately her
hand, her arm, her shoulder."Want to kiss me for old times' sake?"She put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes,
then kissed him.Jennie saw his agitation, and tried hard to speak."You'd better go now," she said firmly.He went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to
remain; she was still the one woman in the world for him.And Jennie
felt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its
finality.She did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and
ethical entanglements of the situation.She was not, like so many,
endeavoring to put the ocean into a tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting
universe in a mess of strings called law.Lester still cared for her a
little.She had hoped once
that he might want her only.Since he did not, was his affection worth
nothing?She could not think, she could not feel that.CHAPTER LX


The drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and
Jennie still farther apart; they settled naturally into their
respective spheres, without the renewal of the old time relationship
which their several meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to
foreshadow.Lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs;
he walked in paths to which Jennie's retiring soul had never aspired.Jennie's own existence was quiet and uneventful.There was a simple
cottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson
Park, on the South Side, where she lived in retirement with a little
foster-child--a chestnut-haired girl taken from the Western Home
for the Friendless--as her sole companion.J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of
Kane.Lester Kane when resident in Chicago were the
occupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where
parties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times
almost pyrotechnic succession.Lester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and
well-entertained existence.He had cut from his list of acquaintances
and associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or
overfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which
to him was a memory merely.He was a director, and in several cases
the chairman of a board of directors, in nine of the most important
financial and commercial organizations of the West--The United
Traction Company of Cincinnati, The Western Crucible Company, The
United Carriage Company, The Second National Bank of Chicago, the
First National Bank of Cincinnati, and several others of equal
importance.He was never a personal factor in the affairs of The
United Carriage Company, preferring to be represented by
counsel--Mr.Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in its
affairs.He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven
years.He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three.Louise, Amy, their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances
were practically strangers.The firm of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien
had nothing whatever to do with his affairs.The truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little
phlegmatic, was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life.He
could not make out what it was all about.In distant ages a queer
thing had come to pass.There had started on its way in the form of
evolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced
itself by division, had early learned to combine itself with others,
to organize itself into bodies, strange forms of fish, animals, and
birds, and had finally learned to organize itself into man.Man, on
his part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was pushing
himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by
means of union and organization with other men.Here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of
talent, and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now
scarcely believed he deserved, only luck had favored him.But he could
not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any
more than himself, seeing that his use of it was as conservative and
constructive and practical as the next one's.He might have been born
poor, in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next
one--not more so.Why should he complain, why worry, why
speculate?--the world was going steadily forward of its own
volition, whether he would or no.And was there any need
for him to disturb himself about it?He fancied at
times that it might as well never have been started at all."The one
divine, far-off event" of the poet did not appeal to him as having any
basis in fact.Lester Kane was of very much the same opinion.Jennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose
Perpetua, was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life.She
had not the incisive reasoning capacity of either Mr.She had seen a great deal, suffered a great deal, and had read
some in a desultory way.Her mind had never grasped the nature and
character of specialized knowledge.History, physics, chemistry,
botany, geology, and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain
as they were in Lester's and Letty's.Instead there was the feeling
that the world moved in some strange, unstable way.Apparently no one
knew clearly what it was all about.Some
believed that the world had been made six thousand years before; some
that it was millions of years old.Was it all blind chance, or was
there some guiding intelligence--a God?Almost in spite of
herself she felt there must be something--a higher power which
produced all the beautiful things--the flowers, the stars, the
trees, the grass.If at times life seemed
cruel, yet this beauty still persisted.The thought comforted her; she
fed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness.It has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn.She liked to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked.She was of matronly proportions in these days--not disagreeably
large, but full bodied, shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her
cares.Her hair was still of a rich
brown, but there were traces of gray in it.Her neighbors spoke of her
as sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable.They knew nothing of her
history, except that she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before
that in Cleveland.She was very reticent as to her past.Jennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care
of sick people, that she might get to be a trained nurse.But she was
obliged to abandon that idea, for she found that only young people
were wanted.She also thought that some charitable organization might
employ her, but she did not understand the new theory of charity which
was then coming into general acceptance and practice--namely,
only to help others to help themselves.She believed in giving, and
was not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who
asked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency
after another met with indifference, if not unqualified rebuke.She
finally decided to adopt another child for Rose Perpetua's sake; she
succeeded in securing a boy, four years old, who was known as
Henry--Henry Stover.Her support was assured, for her income was
paid to her through a trust company.She had no desire for speculation
or for the devious ways of trade.The care of flowers, the nature of
children, the ordering of a home were more in her province.One of the interesting things in connection with this separation
once it had been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for
these two since the reading of the will a number of years before had
never met.He had followed
his success since he had left Jennie with interest.Gerald with pleasure; he had always considered her an
ideal companion for his brother.He knew by many signs and tokens that
his brother, since the unfortunate termination of their father's
attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the Kane
Company, did not like him.Still they had never been so far apart
mentally--certainly not in commercial judgment.Lester was
prosperous now.And after all, he had done his best to aid his brother to
come to his senses--and with the best intentions.There were
mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends.He
wondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with
him.Time passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the
friends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore
in order to see the splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied.He knew
its location from hearsay and description.When he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to
him.Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a
conservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in
Cincinnati.That same night he sat down and wrote Lester asking if he
would not like to dine with him at the Union Club.He was only in town
for a day or two, and he would like to see him again.There was some
feeling he knew, but there was a proposition he would like to talk to
him about.On the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown
study.He had never really been healed of the wound that his father
had given him.He had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert
had deserted him so summarily.He realized now that the stakes his
brother had been playing for were big.But, after all, he had been his
brother, and if he had been in Robert's place at the time, he would
not have done as he had done; at least he hoped not.Then he thought he would
write and say no.But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear
what he had to say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came
over him; he decided to write yes.They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but
the damage had been done.Could a broken bowl be mended and called
whole?It might be called whole, but what of it?He wrote and intimated that he would come.On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to
remind him of the engagement.Lester listened curiously to the sound
of his voice."All right," he said, "I'll be with you."At noon he
went down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union
Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other again.Robert was
thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer.His
eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either
side.Lester was noticeably of
another type--solid, brusque, and indifferent.Men spoke of
Lester these days as a little hard.Robert's keen blue eyes did not
disturb him in the least--did not affect him in any way.He saw
his brother just as he was, for he had the larger philosophic and
interpretative insight; but Robert could not place Lester exactly.He
could not fathom just what had happened to him in these years.Lester
was stouter, not gray, for some reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking
like a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it.Lester looked at his brother with a keen, steady eye.The latter
shifted a little, for he was restless.Sandra went to the bathroom.He could see that there was no
loss of that mental force and courage which had always been
predominant characteristics in Lester's make-up."I thought I'd like to see you again, Lester," Robert remarked,
after they had clasped hands in the customary grip."It's been a long
time now--nearly eight years, hasn't it?"I don't
often go to bed with anything."We don't see much of Ralph and Berenice since they married, but
the others are around more or less.I suppose your wife is all right,"
he said hesitatingly.Lester eyed him without a change of expression.They drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired
after the business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene.He admitted frankly
that he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays."The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you, Lester,"
said Robert finally, "is this matter of the Western Crucible Steel
Company.You haven't been sitting there as a director in person I
notice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for you.The management isn't right--we all know that.We need
a practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going to
pay properly.I have voted my stock with yours right along because the
propositions made by Watson have been right.He agrees with me that
things ought to be changed.Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares
held by Rossiter's widow.That with yours and mine would give us
control of the company.I would like to have you take them, though it
doesn't make a bit of difference so long as it's in the family.You
can put any one you please in for president, and we'll make the thing
come out right."Watson had told him
that Robert's interests were co-operating with him.Lester had long
suspected that Robert would like to make up.This was the olive
branch--the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a
million and a half."That's very nice of you," said Lester solemnly."It's a rather
liberal thing to do."Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester," replied Robert, "I
never did feel right about that will business.I never did feel right
about that secretary-treasurership and some other things that have
happened.I don't want to rake up the past--you smile at
that--but I can't help telling you how I feel.I've been pretty
ambitious in the past.I was pretty ambitious just about the time that
father died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was
afraid you might not like it.I have thought since that I ought not to
have done it, but I did.I suppose you're not anxious to hear any more
about that old affair.This other thing though--"

"Might be handed out as a sort of compensation," put in Lester
quietly."Not exactly that, Lester--though it may have something of
that in it.I know these things don't matter very much to you now.I
know that the time to do things was years ago--not now.Still I
thought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition.Frankly, I thought it might patch up
matters between us."Yes," said Lester, "we're brothers."He was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation.How
much had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past?Robert had
practically forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie
had been really the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling
angry.It was true that Robert had not cut him out of his one-fourth
of his father's estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get it,
and now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things.It hurt him--Lester--a little."I can't see it, Robert," he said finally and determinedly."I can
appreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer.But I can't
see the wisdom of my taking it.We can make all the changes you suggest if you take
the stock.I'm perfectly
willing to talk with you from time to time.This
other thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound.You
want my friendship and so far as I'm concerned you have that.I don't
hold any grudge against you.He admired Lester in
spite of all that he had done to him--in spite of all that Lester
was doing to him now."I don't know but what you're right, Lester," he admitted finally."I didn't make this offer in any petty spirit though.I wanted to
patch up this matter of feeling between us.I won't say anything more
about it.You're not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?""I don't expect to," replied Lester."If you do I'd like to have you come and stay with us."I'll be glad to," he said, without emotion.But he remembered that
in the days of Jennie it was different.They would never have receded
from their position regarding her."Well," he thought, "perhaps I
can't blame them."I'll have to leave you soon," he said, looking at his
watch."I ought to go, too," said Robert."Well, anyhow," he
added, as they walked toward the cloakroom, "we won't be absolute
strangers in the future, will we?""I'll see you from time to time."There was a sense of
unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in Robert's mind as he saw his
brother walking briskly away.Why was it that
there was so much feeling between them--had been even before
Jennie had appeared?Then he remembered his old thoughts about "snaky
deeds."That was what his brother lacked, and that only.He was not
crafty; not darkly cruel, hence.On his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition
to, but also of sympathy for, his brother.He was not so terribly
bad--not different from other men.What would he
have done if he had been in Robert's place?He could see now how it all came about--why he had
been made the victim, why his brother had been made the keeper of the
great fortune."It's the way the world runs," he thought.CHAPTER LXI


The days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according
to that supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore
years and ten.It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by
mouth-to-mouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths.As a
matter of fact, man, even under his mortal illusion, is organically
built to live five times the period of his maturity, and would do so
if he but knew that it is spirit which endures, that age is an
illusion, and that there is no death.Yet the race-thought, gained
from what dream of materialism we know not, persists, and the death of
man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily
registered.Lester was one of those who believed in this formula.He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost
to live--perhaps not so long.No complaint or resistance would issue from
him.Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly show anyhow.He admitted that it was mostly illusion--easily proved to be
so.That it might all be one he sometimes suspected.It was very much
like a dream in its composition truly--sometimes like a very bad
dream.All he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from
hour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material
proposition and that--people, meetings of boards of directors,
individuals and organizations planning to do this and that, his wife's
social functions Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a
philosopher.She admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined,
phlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance.All the
winds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb
Lester.He refused to budge from his
beliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed away from them,
still believing, if he were gotten away at all.He refused to do
anything save as he always said, "Look the facts in the face" and
fight.He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon, but
only in a stubborn, resisting way.His plan was to resist every effort
to coerce him to the last ditch.If he had to let go in the end he
would when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go
were quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.His views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in
creature comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of
everything.If the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he
was for having them torn out and sold and the house done over.If he
traveled, money must go ahead of him and smooth the way.He did not
want argument, useless talk, or silly palaver as he called it.Every
one must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all.She would chuck him under the chin
mornings, or shake his solid head between her hands, telling him he
was a brute, but a nice kind of a brute."Yes, yes," he would growl.You're a seraphic suggestion of
attenuated thought.""No; you hush," she would reply, for at times he could cut like a
knife without really meaning to be unkind.Then he would pet her a
little, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized
that she was more or less dependent upon him.It was always so plain
to her that he could get along without her.For reasons of kindliness
he was trying to conceal this, to pretend the necessity of her
presence, but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her
easily enough.It was something, in
so shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and determined a
quantity as this bear-man.It was like being close to a warmly glowing
lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold.Lester was not
afraid of anything.He felt that he knew how to live and to die.It was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its
solid, material manifestation at every point.Having his financial
affairs well in hand, most of his holding being shares of big
companies, where boards of solemn directors merely approved the
strenuous efforts of ambitious executives to "make good," he had
leisure for living.He and Letty were fond of visiting the various
American and European watering-places.He gambled a little, for he
found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting
sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he
took more and more to drinking, not in the sense that a drunkard takes
to it, but as a high liver, socially, and with all his friends.He was
inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight
whiskey--champagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and
effervescent white wines.When he drank he could drink a great deal,
and he ate in proportion.Nothing must be served but the
best--soup, fish, entree, roast, game, dessert--everything
that made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only
a high-priced chef was worth while.They had found an old cordon
bleu, Louis Berdot, who had served in the house of one of the
great dry goods princes, and this man he engaged.He cost Lester a
hundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that he only
had one life to live.The trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing,
improved nothing, left everything to drift on toward an indefinite
end.If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the comparatively
meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same
attitude to the end.It would have led him to a stolid indifference to
the social world of which now necessarily he was a part.He would have
drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have
accepted him for what he was--a good fellow--and Jennie in
the end would not have been so much better off than she was now.One of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes
transferred their residence to New York.Kane had become very
intimate with a group of clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or
nine hundred, and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of
her activities to New York.She finally did so, leasing a house in
Seventy-eighth Street, near Madison Avenue.She installed a novelty
for her, a complete staff of liveried servants, after the English
fashion, and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods.Lester smiled at her vanity and love of show."You talk about your democracy," he grunted one day."You have as
much democracy as I have religion, and that's none at all."I'm merely accepting the logic of the situation."Do you call a butler and doorman in
red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?""Maybe not the necessity exactly,
but the spirit surely.You're the first one to
insist on perfection--to quarrel if there is any flaw in the
order of things.""Oh, I don't mean that literally.But you demand
perfection--the exact spirit of the occasion, and you know
it.""Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?"I'm as democratic in spirit as
any woman.Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as
possible for comfort's sake, and so do you.Don't you throw rocks at
my glass house, Mister Master.Yours is so transparent I can see every
move you make inside.""I'm democratic and you're not," he teased; but he approved
thoroughly of everything she did.She was, he sometimes fancied, a
better executive in her world than he was in his.Drifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of
this curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking
no physical exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous,
quick-moving, well-balanced organism into one where plethora of
substance was clogging every essential function.His liver, kidneys,
spleen, pancreas--every organ, in fact--had been overtaxed
for some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination.In
the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy.His kidneys
were weak, and so were the arteries of his brain.By dieting, proper
exercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty
or ninety.As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into
a physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous.It so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a
cruise with a party of friends.Lester, in order to attend to some
important business, decided to return to Chicago late in November; he
arranged to have his wife meet him in New York just before the
Christmas holidays.He wrote Watson to expect him, and engaged rooms
at the Auditorium, for he had sold the Chicago residence some two
years before and was now living permanently in New York.One late November day, after having attended to a number of details
and cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with
what the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in
the intestines--a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other
weakness, either of the blood or of some organ.He suffered great
pain, and the usual remedies in that case were applied.There were
bandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing, and specifics were
also administered.He experienced some relief, but he was troubled
with a sense of impending disaster.He had Watson cable his
wife--there was nothing serious about it, but he was ill.A
trained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door
to prevent annoyance of any kind.It was plain that Letty could not
reach Chicago under three weeks.He had the feeling that he would not
see her again.Curiously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because
he had never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking
about her constantly at this time.He had intended to go out and see
her just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and
before he left the city.He had asked Watson how she was getting
along, and had been informed that everything was well with her.She
was living quietly and looking in good health, so Watson said.Lester
wished he could see her.This thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better.He was
suffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that
seemed to tie his viscera into knots, and left him very weak.Several
times the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to
relieve him of useless pain.After one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told
him to send the nurse away, and then said: "Watson, I'd like to have
you do me a favor.Stover if she won't come here to see me.Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet)
away for the afternoon, or while she's here.If she comes at any other
time I'd like to have her admitted."He wondered what the world
would think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with
so prominent a man.The latter was only too glad to serve him in any way.He called a carriage and rode out to Jennie's residence.He found
her watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his
unusual presence."I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs.Stover," he said,
using her assumed name.Kane is quite sick at
the Auditorium.His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I
wouldn't come out here and ask you to come and see him.He wanted me
to bring you, if possible."Why yes," said Jennie, her face a study.An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen.But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she
had had several nights before.It had seemed to her that she was out
on a dark, mystic body of water over which was hanging something like
a fog, or a pall of smoke.She heard the water ripple, or stir
faintly, and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared.It
was a little boat, oarless, or not visibly propelled, and in it were
her mother, and Vesta, and some one whom she could not make out.Her
mother's face was pale and sad, very much as she had often seen it in
life.She looked at Jennie solemnly, sympathetically, and then
suddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was
Lester.He looked at her gloomily--an expression she had never
seen on his face before--and then her mother remarked, "Well, we
must go now."The boat began to move, a great sense of loss came over
her, and she cried, "Oh, don't leave me, mamma!"But her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and
the boat was gone.She woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her.She stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up
in the dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone.A great
sense of depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted
her.Then, when it seemed as if it were nothing, Mr.She went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her
thoughts.She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly
woman, well dressed and shapely.She had never been separated mentally
from Lester, just as he had never grown entirely away from her.She
was always with him in thought, just as in the years when they were
together.Her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted
her in Cleveland--the days when he had carried her off, much as
the cave-man seized his mate--by force.Now she longed to do what
she could for him.For this call was as much a testimony as a shock.He loved her--he loved her, after all.The carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky
down-town district.It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was
escorted to Lester's room.He had talked
little, leaving her to her thoughts.In this great hotel she felt
diffident after so long a period of complete retirement.As she
entered the room she looked at Lester with large, gray, sympathetic
eyes.He was lying propped up on two pillows, his solid head with its
growth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed.He looked at her
curiously out of his wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection
shining in them--weary as they were.His pale face, slightly drawn from suffering, cut her like
a knife.She took his hand, which was outside the coverlet, and
pressed it."I'm so sorry, Lester," she murmured.You're not
very sick though, are you?You must get well, Lester--and soon!""Yes, Jennie, but I'm pretty bad," he said."I don't feel right
about this business.I don't seem able to shake it off.But tell me,
how have you been?""Oh, just the same, dear," she replied.You mustn't
talk like that, though.You're going to be all right very soon
now."He shook his head, for he
thought differently."Sit down, dear," he went on, "I'm not worrying
about that.He
sighed and shut his eyes for a minute.She drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and
took his hand.It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send
for her.Her eyes showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and
gratitude of her heart.At the same time fear gripped her; how ill he
looked!"I can't tell what may happen," he went on.I've wanted to see you again for some time.We are living in New York, you know.You're a little stouter,
Jennie.""Yes, I'm getting old, Lester," she smiled."Oh, that doesn't make any difference," he replied, looking at her
fixedly.A slight twinge of pain
reminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through.He couldn't
stand many more paroxysms like the last one."I couldn't go, Jennie, without seeing you again," he observed,
when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again."I've
always wanted to say to you, Jennie," he went on, "that I haven't been
satisfied with the way we parted.It wasn't the right thing, after
all.I wish now, for my own
peace of mind, that I hadn't done it.""Don't say that, Lester," she demurred, going over in her mind all
that had been between them.This was such a testimony to their real
union--their real spiritual compatibility.I wouldn't
have been satisfied to have you lose your fortune.I've been a lot better satisfied as it is.It's been hard, but,
dear, everything is hard at times."The thing wasn't worked out right
from the start; but that wasn't your fault.I'm glad I'm here to do it.""Don't talk that way, Lester--please don't," she pleaded.Why, when I think--" she
stopped, for it was hard for her to speak.She was choking with
affection and sympathy.She was recalling the
house he took for her family in Cleveland, his generous treatment of
Gerhardt, all the long ago tokens of love and kindness."Well, I've told you now, and I feel better.You're a good woman,
Jennie, and you're kind to come to me this way."It seems strange, but you're the
only woman I ever did love truly.It was the one thing she had waited for
all these years--this testimony.It was the one thing that could
make everything right--this confession of spiritual if not
material union."Oh, Lester,"
she exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand."Oh, they're lovely," she answered, entering upon a detailed
description of their diminutive personalities.He listened
comfortably, for her voice was soothing to him.When it came time for her to go he seemed
desirous of keeping her."I can stay just as well as not, Lester," she volunteered."You needn't do that," he said, but she could see that he wanted
her, that he did not want to be alone.From that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of
the hotel.CHAPTER LXII


The end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside
almost constantly.The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a
relief and company, but the physician was inclined to object.Lester,
however, was stubborn."This is my death," he said, with a touch of
grim humor."If I'm dying I ought to be allowed to die in my own
way."Watson smiled at the man's unfaltering courage.He had never seen
anything like it before.There were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the
newspaper.Robert saw an item in the Inquirer and decided to go
to Chicago.Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to
Lester's room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers.The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be
talked to much.When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, "Imogene
has changed a good deal."Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the
afternoon Lester died.He had been meditating whether anything more
could be done for Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it.Certainly it was useless to leave her more money.He had been wondering where Letty was and how near her actual arrival
might be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain.Before
relief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was
dead.It developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble
which killed him, but a lesion of a major blood-vessel in the
brain.Jennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying,
was beside herself with grief.He had been a part of her thought and
feeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had
died.She had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any
one, and he had always shown that he cared for her--at least in
some degree.She could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in
tears--only a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to make her
insensible to pain.He looked so strong--her Lester--lying
there still in death.His expression was unchanged--defiant,
determined, albeit peaceful.Kane that she
would arrive on the Wednesday following.Watson that it was to be transferred to
Cincinnati, where the Paces had a vault.Because of the arrival of
various members of the family, Jennie withdrew to her own home; she
could do nothing more.The final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the
anomalies of existence.Kane by wire that
the body should be transferred to Imogene's residence, and the funeral
held from there.Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry
Dodge, Imogene's husband; Mr.Midgely, and three other citizens of
prominence were selected as pall-bearers.Louise and her husband came
from Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati.The house was full
to overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it
expedient to call.Because of the fact that Lester and his family were
tentatively Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual
of that Church was carried out.It was curious to see him lying in the
parlor of this alien residence, candles at his head and feet, burning
sepulchrally, a silver cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen
fingers.He would have smiled if he could have seen himself, but the
Kane family was too conventional, too set in its convictions, to find
anything strange in this.She was greatly distraught, for her
love, like Jennie's, was sincere.She left her room that night when
all was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of
the burning candles Lester's beloved features.Tears trickled down her
cheeks, for she had been happy with him.She caressed his cold cheeks
and hands.No
one told her that he had sent for Jennie.Meanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was
enduring alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss.Through
all these years the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every
circumstance, that somehow life might bring him back to her.He had
come, it is true--he really had in death--but he had gone
again.Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt, whither Vesta had
gone?She could not hope to see him again, for the papers had informed
her of his removal to Mrs.Midgely's residence, and of the fact that
he was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial.The last
ceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman
Catholic churches of the South Side, St.Michael's, of which the
Midgelys were members.She would have liked so much to have
had him buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave
occasionally, but this was not to be.She was never a master of her
fate.She thought of him as being taken
from her finally by the removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though
distance made any difference.She decided at last to veil herself
heavily and attend the funeral at the church.The paper had explained
that the services would be at two in the afternoon.Then at four the
body would be taken to the depot, and transferred to the train; the
members of the family would accompany it to Cincinnati.A little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the
church there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in
black, heavily veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner.She
was a little nervous at first, for, seeing that the church was dark
and empty, she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place; but
after ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began
to toll solemnly.Shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and
white surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side
of the altar.A hushed stirring of feet in the choir-loft indicated
that the service was to be accompanied by music.Some loiterers,
attracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few acquaintances and
citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.Never in her life had
she been inside a Catholic church.The gloom, the beauty of the
windows, the whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles
impressed her.She was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty,
and mystery.Life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified
by this scene.As the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of
altar-boys.The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first,
bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross.In the hands of each
subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall, lighted candle.The
priest, in black cloth and lace, attended by an acolyte on either
hand, followed.The procession passed out the entrance into the
vestibule of the church, and was not seen again until the choir began
a mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for mercy and
peace.Then, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance.There came the silver cross, the candles, the dark-faced priest,
reading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester
in a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the
pall-bearers, who kept an even pace.Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her
nerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current.She
did not know any of these men.Of the long company of notables who followed two by
two she recognized only three, whom Lester had pointed out to her in
times past.Kane she saw, of course, for she was directly behind
the coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger; behind her walked Mr.He gave a quick glance to either side,
evidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her, he
turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on.Jennie looked with all
her eyes, her heart gripped by pain.She seemed so much a part of this
solemn ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.The procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down.A white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was
put over it, and the great candles were set beside it.There were the
chanted invocations and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with
holy water, the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the
mumbled responses of the auditors to the Lord's Prayer and to its
Catholic addition, the invocation to the Blessed Virgin.Jennie was
overawed and amazed, but no show of form colorful, impression
imperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense of infinite
loss.To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were
beautiful.They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made
it vibrate through the depths of her being.She was as a house filled
with mournful melody and the presence of death.Kane was sobbing convulsively
also.When it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was
borne to the station.All the guests and strangers departed, and
finally, when all was silent, she arose.Now she would go to the depot
also, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train.They
would have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in
Vesta's case.She took a car, and a little later she entered the
waiting-room of the depot.She lingered about, first in the concourse,
where the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks,
and then in the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of
proceedings.She finally observed the group of immediate relatives
waiting--Mrs.Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
and the others.She actually succeeded in identifying most of them,
though it was not knowledge in this case, but pure instinct and
intuition.No one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was
Thanksgiving Eve.Throughout the great railroad station there was a
hum of anticipation, that curious ebullition of fancy which springs
from the thought of pleasures to come.Announcers were
calling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the
time of its departure drew near.Jennie heard with a desperate ache
the description of a route which she and Lester had taken more than
once, slowly and melodiously emphasized."Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,
Buffalo, and New York."There were cries of trains for "Fort Wayne,
Columbus, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and points East," and then finally
for "Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
South."Several times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the
waiting-room and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which
separated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the
coffin, or the great wooden box which held it, before it was put on
the train.There was a baggage porter pushing a
truck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop.On it was Lester, that last shadow of his substance, incased in the
honors of wood, and cloth, and silver.There was no thought on the
part of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here.He
could not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to
her mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided her eternally from
her beloved.Was not her life a patchwork
of conditions made and affected by these things which she
saw--wealth and force--which had found her unfit?She had
evidently been born to yield, not seek.This panoply of power had been
paraded before her since childhood.What could she do now but stare
vaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by?She looked through the
grating, and once more there came the cry of "Indianapolis,
Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points South."A long red train,
brilliantly lighted, composed of baggage cars, day coaches, a
dining-car, set with white linen and silver, and a half dozen
comfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped.A great black engine,
puffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.As the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in
blue, looking out of the car, called to some one within.All she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear.All she could feel was that this train would start presently, and then
it would all be over.There were Robert, and Amy, and Louise, and Midgely--all making
for the Pullman cars in the rear.They had said their farewells to
their friends.A trio of assistants "gave a
hand" at getting the great wooden case into the car.Jennie saw it
disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.There were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the
baggage car half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine
sounded.There was the insistent calling of "all aboard" from this
quarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move.Its
bell was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a
great black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall.The fireman, conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming
furnace door to throw in coal.Jennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her
face white, her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one
thought in her mind--they were taking his body away.A leaden
November sky was ahead, almost dark.She looked, and looked until the
last glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in
the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the
far-stretching yard."Yes," said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the
anticipation of coming pleasures."We're going to have a great time
down there.Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt Ella."Jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle
around her.Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down
which she was steadily gazing.There
were those two orphan children to raise.They would marry and leave
after a while, and then what?Days and days in endless reiteration,
and then--?"The Princely Parasol-Holder groaned, and chattered his teeth together
to express his anguish."'Unique Umbrella-Opener,' continued the Emperor, 'our petticoat is
completely saturated.'"The Unique Umbrella-Opener tore his clothes, and shook his hair wildly
about his face, with moans of agony."'Let this man's head be removed at sunrise to-morrow!'"Then we all, lying on our faces, wept and cried aloud, and besought the
celestial mercy for our comrade.We told the Emperor of Ly-Chee's long
and faithful service; of his upright and devout life; of his wife and
children, who looked to him for their daily bread.He repeated, in dreadful tones, his former words:--

"'Our feet are wet.Let this man's head be
removed at sunrise to-morrow.'"Then the Unique Umbrella-Holder, who is a kindly man, made also
intercession for Ly-Chee.But now the Emperor waxed wroth, and he
said:--

"'Are our clothes to be changed, or do we stand here all day in wetness
because of this dog?We swear that unless the Golden Dragon himself come
down from his altar and beg for this man's life, he shall die!And with these words he withdrew into the palace."So thou seest, my son," said the old man, sadly, "that all is over with
thy poor father.He is now in the prison of the condemned, and to-morrow
at sunrise he must die.Go home, boy, and comfort thy poor mother,
telling her this sad thing as gently as thou mayest."Chop-Chin arose, kissed the old man's hand in token of gratitude for his
kindness, and left the court-yard without a word.His head was in a
whirl, and strange thoughts darted through it.He went home, but did not
tell his mother of the fate which awaited her husband on the morrow.He
could not feel that it was true.It _could not be_ that the next day,
all in a moment, his father would cease to live.There must be some
way,--_some_ way to save him.And then he seemed to hear the dreadful
words, "Unless the Golden Dragon himself come down from his altar and
beg for this man's life, he shall die."He told his mother, in answer to
her anxious questions, that his father meant to pass the night in the
court-yard, as he would be wanted very early in the morning; and as it
was a hot day, and promised a warm night, the good woman felt no
uneasiness, but turned again to her pots and pans.But Chop-Chin sat on the bench in front of the house, with his head in
his hands thinking deeply.*       *       *       *       *

That evening, at sunset, a boy was seen walking slowly along the
well-paved street which led to the great temple of the Golden Dragon.He
was clad in a snow-white tunic falling to his knees; his arms and legs
were bare; and his pig-tail, unbraided and hanging in a crinkly mass
below his waist, showed that he was bent on some sacred mission.In his
hands, raised high above his head, he carried a bronze bowl of curious
workmanship.Many people turned to look at the boy, for his face and
figure were of singular beauty."He carries the prayers of some great prince," they said, "to offer at
the shrine of the Golden Dragon."And, indeed, it was at the great bronze gate of the Temple that the boy
stopped.Poising the bronze bowl gracefully on his head with one hand,
with the other he knocked three times on the gate.It opened, and
revealed four guards clad in black armor, who stood with glittering
pikes crossed, their points towards the boy."What seekest thou," asked the leader, "in the court of the Holy
Dragon?"Chop-Chin (for I need not tell you the boy was he) lowered the bowl from
his head, and offered it to the soldier with a graceful reverence."Tong-Ki-Tcheng," he said, "sends you greeting, and a draught of cool
wine.He begs your prayers to the Holy Dragon that he may recover from
his grievous sickness, and prays that I may pass onward to the shrine."The guards bowed low at the name of Tong-Ki-Tcheng, a powerful Prince of
the Empire, who lay sick of a fever in his palace, as all the city knew.Each one in turn took a draught from the deep bowl, and the leader
said:--

"Our prayers shall go up without ceasing for Tong-Ki-Tcheng, the noble
and great.Pass on, fair youth, and good success go with thee!"They lowered their pikes, and Chop-Chin passed slowly through the
court-yard paved with black marble, and came to the second gate, which
was of shining steel.Here he knocked again, and the gate was opened by
four guards clad in steel from top to toe, and glittering in the evening
light."What seekest thou," they asked, "in the court of the Holy Dragon?"Chop-Chin answered as before:--

"Tong-Ki-Tcheng sends you greeting, and a draught of cool wine.He begs
your prayers to the Holy Dragon that he may recover from his grievous
sickness, and prays that I may pass onward to the shrine."The guards drank deeply from the bowl, and their leader replied: "Our
prayers shall not cease to go up for Tong-Ki-Tcheng.Pass on, and good
success go with thee!"Onward the boy went, holding the bronze bowl high above his head.He
crossed the white marble court-yard, and his heart beat when he came to
the third gate, which was of whitest ivory, for he knew that beyond the
third court-yard was the Temple itself,--the House of Gold, in which
dwelt the mighty Dragon, the most sacred idol in all China.He paused a
moment, and then with a steady hand knocked at the gate.It opened
without a sound, and there stood four guards in white armor inlaid with
gold.They drank from the
bowl, promised their prayers for Tong-Ki-Tcheng, and then bade the boy
pass onward to the golden gate, which gleamed at the farther end of the
court-yard."But see that thou touch not the gate!""It is
the gate of the Temple itself, and no profane hand may rest upon it.Speak only, and the priests will hear and open to thee."Softly Chop-Chin paced across the last court, which was paved with
blocks of ivory and silver, laid in cunning patterns.Halting before the
gate of gold, he raised the bowl in his hands, and said softly:--

    "Ka Ho Yai!Tong-Ki-Tcheng Lo Hum Ki Ni!"The gates opened, and showed four priests in robes of cloth-of-gold,
with golden censers in hand.said the chief priest, "by what right or by whose order
comest thou here, to the Sacred Shrine of the Holy Dragon?"Chop-Chin knelt upon the threshold of the golden gate, and, with bowed
head and downcast eyes, held out the bronze bowl."By the right of mortal sickness, most holy priest, come I hither!"he
said, "and by order of the noble Tong-Ki-Tcheng.He prays thee and thy
brethren to drink to his recovery from his grievous malady, and that
your prayers may go up with mine at the Jewelled Shrine itself."The priest drank solemnly from the bowl, and handed it to his
assistants, the last of whom drained the last drop of wine."Our prayers shall truly go up for Tong-Ki-Tcheng," he said."Give me
thy hand, fair youth, and I will lead thee to the Jewelled Shrine.But
first I will cover thine eyes, for none save ourselves, priests of the
First Order of the Saki-Pan, may look upon the face of the Holy Dragon."So saying, he bound a silk handkerchief firmly over the boy's eyes, and
taking his hand, led him slowly forward.Chop-Chin's heart was beating so violently that he was half suffocated.He felt the floor suddenly cold, cold, beneath his feet, and knew that
he was walking on the golden floor of the Temple.A few steps farther,
the hand of the priest drew him downward, and together with the four
priests he lay prostrate on his face before the shrine of the Golden
Dragon.The warm, incense-laden air was stirred by no
sound save the breathing of the five suppliants.No breeze rustled the
heavy satin curtains which shrouded the windows; no hum of insect or
song of bird came from the outer world, which was fast settling down
into night.The boy Chop-Chin lay as still as if he were carved in marble.He held
his breath from time to time, and his whole being seemed strained to one
effort,--that of listening.Was the breathing of
the four priests changing a little,--growing deeper, growing louder?was that a whisper of prayer, or was it--could
it be--the faintest suspicion of a snore?He lay still; waited and
listened, listened and waited.After a little while there could be no
doubt about it,--the four men were breathing heavily, slowly, regularly;
and one of them rolled out a sonorous, a majestic snore, which resounded
through the heavy perfumed air of the Temple, yet caused no movement
among the other three.There could be no doubt about it,--the priests
were asleep!Slowly, softly, the boy lifted his head; then he rose to his knees, and
looked fearfully at the sleepers.There they lay, flat on their faces,
their hands clasped over their heads.He touched one of them,--there was
no answering movement.He shook another by the shoulders; he shook them
all.They snored in concert, but gave no other sign of life.The drugged
wine had done its work.Then, and not till then, did Chop-Chin venture to lift his eyes and look
upon the awful mystery which was hidden by these golden walls.He
trembled, he turned white as the tunic which covered his dusky limbs;
but standing erect, he gazed firmly at the Golden Dragon.From the floor
rose a splendid altar of gold, studded thick with precious gems.Rubies,
sapphires, and emeralds, set in mystic lines and figures, formed the
characters which told the thirty-two names of the world-renowned dragon;
and on the top of this glittering pedestal, fifteen feet in the air,
stood the idol itself.It was, indeed, a marvellous thing to look upon.Ten feet long, composed
entirely of thin scales of the purest gold, laid over and over each
other, and each scale tipped with a diamond.Two magnificent rubies
glowed in the eye-sockets, and the head was surmounted by a crown of
emeralds worth any ordinary kingdom.the tail was the
wonder of wonders.Millions of delicate gold wires as fine as silk waved
gracefully from the scaly tip a length of three feet, and each one was
tipped with a diamond, a ruby, or an emerald of surpassing beauty and
lustre.So wonderful was the shimmering light of the stones that the
whole tail seemed to sway and curl to and fro, as if some living
creature were moving it, and rays of rainbow- light darted from
it on every side, dazzling the eyes of the beholder.Chop-Chin gazed and gazed, and hid his eyes and trembled, and gazed
again.At last he shook himself together, and whispered, "My father!Then softly, surely, he began to climb up the golden altar.Stepping carefully from glittering point to point, holding on here by a
projecting ornament of carven amethyst, there by a block of jasper or
onyx, he reached the top; then steadying himself, he leaned forward and
lifted the Holy Dragon from its stand.To his amazement, instead of
being barely able to move it, he found he could easily carry it, for the
golden plates which formed it were so delicate that the weight of the
whole great creature was incredibly small.Lightly the boy lifted it in
his arms, and slowly, surely, noiselessly bore it to the ground.Here
he paused, and looked keenly at the sleeping priests.Did that one's
eyelids quiver; did his mouth twitch, as if he were waking from his
sleep?Was that a movement of yon other man's arm, as if he were
stealthily preparing to rise, to spring upon the sacrilegious robber?it was but the play of the  light on the faces and raiment of
the sleepers.The voice of their snoring still went up, calmly, evenly,
regularly.Then Chop-Chin took off the sash which bound his tunic at the waist, and
shook out its folds.It was a web of crimson silk, so fine and soft that
it could be drawn through a finger-ring, and yet, when spread out, so
ample that the boy found no difficulty in completely covering with it
his formidable prize.Thus enwrapped, he bore the Golden Dragon swiftly
from the Temple, closing the doors of gold softly behind him.He crossed
the ivory and silver pavement of the inner court, and came to the ivory
gate.It was closed, and beside it lay the four white-clad warriors,
sunk in profound slumber.Stepping lightly over their prostrate forms,
Chop-Chin opened the gate softly, and found himself in the second court.This, also, he traversed safely, finding the armed guardians of the
steel gate also sleeping soundly, with their mouths wide open, and their
shining spears pointing valiantly at nothing.A touch upon the
glittering gate,--it opened, and Chop-Chin began to breathe more freely
when he saw the bronze gates of the outer court-yard, and knew that in
another minute, if all went well, he would be in the open street.the four guards clad in black armor, who kept watch by the outer
gate, had been the first to drink the drugged wine, and already the
effect of the powerful narcotic which it contained had begun to wear
off.As Chop-Chin, bearing in his arms the shrouded figure of the mighty
idol, approached the gate, one of the four sleepers stirred, yawned,
rubbed his eyes, and looked about him.It was quite dark, but his eye
caught the faint glimmer of the boy's white robe, and seizing his pike,
he exclaimed,--

"Who goes there?"Chop-Chin instantly stepped to his side, and said in a low whisper,--

"It is I, Nai-Ping, second priest of the Saki-Pan, bound on business of
the Temple.Let me pass, and quickly, for the chief priest waits my
return."The sentinel bowed low, and undid the fastenings of the huge bronze
gates.They swung open silently, and the boy passed through with his
awful burden.soliloquized the guard, as he drew the massive bolts again."I never knew one of the priests to go out at this time of night.But I
dared not say anything, lest he should find out that I was asleep at my
post.And now that he is gone," he added, "I may as well just take forty
winks, as he may be away some time."So saying, he curled himself up on the marble pavement, and fell this
time into a natural slumber.The outer gates of the royal palace were
closed, though lights still shone in many of the windows.Outside the
gate a sentinel was pacing up and down, armed with pike and broadsword.Every time he turned on his beat, he looked up and down the narrow
street to see if anything or anybody were approaching.Suddenly, as he
wheeled about, he saw before him a figure which seemed to have sprung
all in a moment out of the blackness of the night.It was the figure of
a boy, carrying a burden considerably larger than himself,--a dark and
shapeless mass, which yet seemed not to be heavy in proportion to its
size."Who art thou, and what
monstrous burden is this thou carriest so lightly?"said the boy, speaking in an awestruck whisper, "speak not so
loud, friend!The sentinel recoiled, and stared in dismay at the dark bundle."His Celestial Majesty," replied Chop-Chin, "threw it in anger at his
Putter-on-of-Slippers yesterday, and broke one of its legs.All day my
master, the Chief Cabinet-maker, has been at work on it, and now he has
sent me with it by nightfall, that no profane eye may see clearly even
the outer covering of the sacred object.""Pass in," said the sentinel, opening the gate."But tell me, knowest
thou how it will fare with the Putter-on-of-Slippers?He is cousin to my
stepfather's aunt by marriage, and I would not that aught of ill should
befall so near a relative."I know not," said the boy, hastening forward."I fear it may go
hard with him."The sentinel shook his head sadly, and resumed his walk; while Chop-Chin
crept softly through the court-yard, keeping close to the wall, and
feeling as he went along for a certain little door he knew of, which led
by a staircase cut in the thickness of the wall to a certain unused
closet, near the Celestial Bed-chamber.While all this was going on, the Emperor of China, the great and mighty
Wah-Song, was going to bed.He had sipped his night-draught of hot wine
mingled with honey and spices, sitting on the edge of the Celestial Bed,
with the Celestial Nightcap of cloth-of-silver tied comfortably under
his chin, and the Celestial Dressing-gown wrapped around him.He had
scolded the Chief Pillow-thumper because the pillows were not fat
enough, and because there were only ten of them instead of twelve.He
had boxed the ears of the Tyer-of-the-Strings-of-the-Nightcap, and had
thrown his golden goblet at the Principal Pourer, who brought him the
wine.And when all these things were done, his Celestial Majesty
Wah-Song got into bed, and was tucked in by the Finishing Toucher, who
got his nose well tweaked by way of thanks.Then the taper of perfumed
wax was lighted, and the shade of alabaster put over it, and then the
other lights were extinguished; and then the attendants all crawled out
backwards on their hands and knees, and shut the door after them; and
then His Celestial Majesty went to sleep.[Illustration: At last the Emperor began to dream.He heard an awful
voice, the voice of the Golden Dragon.Peacefully the Emperor slept,--one hour, two hours, three
hours,--discoursing eloquently the while in the common language of
mankind,--the language of the nose.At last he began to dream,--a
dreadful dream.He was in the Golden Temple, praying before the Jewelled
Shrine.He heard an awful voice,--the voice of the Golden Dragon.It
called his name; it glared upon him with its ruby eyes; it lifted its
crowned head, and stretched its long talons toward him.The
Emperor tried to scream, but he could make no sound.Once more the
dreadful voice was heard:--

"Wah-Song!The Emperor sprang up in bed, and looked about him with eyes wild with
terror.what was that?--that glittering form standing at the foot of
his bed; that crowned head raised high as if in anger; those glaring
red eyes fixed menacingly upon him!With one long howl of terror and anguish, His Celestial Majesty Wah-Song
rolled off the bed and under it, in one single motion, and lay there
flat on his face, with his hands clasped over his head.Quaking in every
limb, his teeth chattering, and a cold sweat pouring from him, he
listened as the awful voice spoke again.said the Golden Dragon, "thou hast summoned me, and I am
here!""I--I--I sum-summon thee, most Golden and Holy Dragon?""May I be b-b-bastinadoed if I did!"said the Dragon, sternly, "and venture not to speak save when
I ask thee a question.Yesterday morning, in consequence of thine own
caprice in going out unannounced, thy silly shoes and thy pusillanimous
petticoat became wet.For this nothing, thou has condemned to death my
faithful servant Ly-Chee, who has brought me fresh melons every Tuesday
afternoon for thirty years.When others, less inhuman than thou,
interceded for his life, thou madest reply, 'We swear, that unless the
Golden Dragon himself come down from his altar and beg for this man's
life, he shall die!'"The Emperor groaned, and clawed the carpet in his anguish."Therefore, Wah-Song," continued the Dragon, "I AM HERE!I come not to
beg, but to command.I--I--didn't know he brought thee melons.I brought thee two dozen
pineapples myself, the other day," he added piteously."Thou didst,
_slave!_ and they were half-rotten.and he gave a little jump on
the floor, making his glittering tail wave, and his flaming eyes glared
yet more fiercely at the unfortunate Wah-Song, who clung yet more
closely to the carpet, and drummed on it with his heels in an extremity
of fear."Listen, now," said the Fiery Idol, "to my commands.Before day-break
thou wilt send a free pardon to Ly-Chee, who now lies in the prison of
the condemned, expecting to die at sunrise.""Moreover," continued the Dragon, "thou wilt send him, by a trusty
messenger, twenty bags of goodly ducats, one for every hour that he has
spent in prison."The Emperor moaned feebly, for he loved his goodly ducats."Furthermore, thou wilt make Ly-Chee thy Chief Sweeper for life, with
six brooms of gilded straw, with ivory handles, as his yearly
perquisite, besides three dozen pairs of scrubbing-shoes; and his son,
Chop-Chin, shalt thou appoint as Second Sweeper, to help his father."The Emperor moaned again, but very faintly, for he dared not make any
objection."Obey them strictly and
speedily, and thine offence may be pardoned.Neglect them, even in the
smallest particular, and--Ha!Wurra-_wurra_-G-R-R-R-R-R-R!"and
here the Dragon opened his great red mouth, and uttered so fearful a
growl that the miserable Emperor lost hold of such little wits as had
remained to him, and fainted dead away.Ten minutes later, the sentinel at the gate was amazed at the sight of
the Chief Cabinet-maker's apprentice, reappearing suddenly before him,
with his monstrous burden still in his arms.The boy's hair was
dishevelled, and his face was very pale.In truth, it had been very hard
work to get in and out of the hollow golden monster, and Chop-Chin was
well-nigh exhausted by his efforts, and the great excitement which had
nerved him to carry out his bold venture.said Chop-Chin, "alas!Was it my fault that
the mended leg was a hair-breadth shorter than the others?Good soldier,
I have been most grievously belabored, even with the Sacred Footstool
itself, which, although it be a great honor, is nevertheless a painful
one.And now must I take it back to my master, for it broke again the
last time His Celestial Majesty brought it down on my head.Wherefore
let me pass, good sentinel, for I can hardly stand for weariness.""And yet--stay a
moment!thinkest thou that aught would be amiss if I were to take just
one peep at the Celestial Footstool?Often have I heard of its
marvellous workmanship, and its tracery of pearl and ebony.Do but lift
one corner of the mantle, good youth, and let me see at least a leg of
the wonder.""Knowest
thou not that the penalty is four hundred lashes?Not a single glance
have I ventured to cast at it, for they say its color changes if any
profane eye rest upon its polished surface.""Pass on, then, in the name of the Dragon!"said the sentinel, opening
the gate; and bidding him a hasty good-night, Chop-Chin hurried away
into the darkness.*       *       *       *       *

Now, while all this was going on, it chanced that the four priests of
the First Order of the Saki-Pan awoke from their slumber.What their
feelings were when they lifted their eyes and saw that the Golden Dragon
was gone, is beyond my power to tell.Their terror was so extreme that
they did not dare to move, but after the first horrified glance at the
bare altar flung themselves flat on their faces again, and howled and
moaned in their anguish.they cried, in a doleful chant of misery."Yea, verily slept
we.we know not why;
     Wow!Thou raisedst the paw of strength and the
hind-feet of swiftness.Because we slept, thou hast gone away, and we
are desolate, awaiting the speedily-advancing death.Punka-wunka-woggle!Punka-wunka-wogg!"While thus the wretched priests lay on the golden floor, bewailing their
sin and its dreadful consequences, there fell suddenly on their ears a
loud and heavy sound.It was at some distance,--a heavy clang, as of
some one striking on metal.And now came
other sounds,--the opening and shutting of gates, the tread of hasty
feet, the sound of hurried voices, and finally a loud knocking at the
door of the Temple itself."Open, most holy Priests of the Saki-Pan!""We have
strange and fearful news!The unhappy priests hurried to the door, and flung it open with
trembling hands.Without stood all the guards of all the gates, the
white and the steel-clad soldiers clustering about the four black-clad
guardians of the outer gate.said the chief priest in great agitation, "what is your
errand?"said the black guards, trembling with excitement, "we heard
a great knocking at the gate."cried the priest, "I know it.said the guards, "we were affrighted, so great was the
noise; so we opened the gate but a little way, and peeped through; and
we saw--we saw--" They paused, and gasped for breath.shrieked the priest, "_what_ did you see?""He
is sitting up--on his hind-legs--with his mouth open!and he knocked--he
knocked--"

But the priests of the Saki-Pan waited to hear no more.Rushing through
the court-yards, they flung wide open the great bronze gates.They
caught up the Golden Dragon, they raised it high on their shoulders, and
with shouts of rejoicing they bore it back to the Temple, while the
guards prostrated themselves before it."He walked abroad, for the glory and
welfare of his subjects.He cast upon the city the eye of beneficence;
he waved over it the plenipotentiary tail!Glory to the Holy Dragon, and happiness and peace to the city and the
people!"*       *       *       *       *

But in the house of Ly-Chee all was sunshine and rejoicing.At daybreak
a procession had come down the little street,--a troop of soldiers in
the imperial uniform, with music sounding before them, and gay banners
flaunting in the morning air.In the midst of the troop rode Ly-Chee, on
a splendid black horse.He was dressed in a robe of crimson satin
embroidered with gold, and round his neck hung strings of jewels most
glorious to see.Behind him walked twenty slaves, each carrying a fat
bag of golden ducats; and after the troop came more slaves, bearing
gilded brooms with ivory handles and scrubbing-shoes of the finest
quality.And all the soldiers and all the slaves cried aloud,
continually:--

"Honor to Ly-Chee, the Chief-Sweeper of the court-yard!Honor and peace
to him and all his house!"The procession stopped before the little house, and the good sweeper,
stupefied still with astonishment at his wonderful good fortune,
dismounted and clasped his wife and children in his arms.And they wept
together for joy, and the soldiers and the slaves and all the people
wept with them.But the Celestial Emperor, Wah-Song, lay in bed for two weeks, speaking
to no man, and eating nothing but water-gruel.And when he arose, at the
end of that time, behold!he was as meek as a six-years old child.THE grandmother's story was received with great approbation, and the
different members of the family commented on it, each after his fashion."I should like to have been Chop-Chin!"Only think, <DW53>, of talking to the Emperor in that way,
and scolding him as if he were a little boy.""Well, I never saw an Emperor," said the raccoon; "but I certainly
should not wish to talk to one, if they are all such wretched creatures
as Wah-Song._I_ should like to have been the Finishing-Toucher; then if
he had pulled _my_ nose--hum!"Dear Madam," said the bear, who had been staring meditatively into the
fire, "there is one thing in the story that I do not understand; that
is--well--you spoke of the boy's having a pig-tail.""A Chinese pig-tail, you know.""A Chinese pig's tail it would naturally
be.Now, I confess I do not see _how_ a pig's tail could be worn on the
head, or how it could be unbraided; that is, if the Chinese pigs have
tails like that of our friend in the sty yonder."Toto laughed aloud at this, and even the grandmother could not help
smiling a very little; but she gently told Bruin what a Chinaman's
pig-tail was, and how he wore it.Meantime, Miss Mary, the parrot,
looked on with an air of dignified amusement."My respected father," she said presently, "spent some years in China.It is a fine country, though too far from Africa for my taste.""Tell us about your father, Miss Mary!""Fine
old bird he must have been, eh?"replied the parrot, with some emotion.His beak, which I am said to have inherited, was the envy of every
parrot in Central Africa.He could whistle in nine languages, and his
tail--but as the famous poet Gabblio has sweetly sung,--

    "'All languages and tongues must fail,
      In speaking of Polacko's tail.'"Polacko was my father's name," she explained."But how came he to go to China?""He was captured, my dear, and taken there when very young.He lived
there for twenty years, with one of the chief mandarins of the empire.He led a happy life, with a perch and ring of ebony and silver, the
freedom of the house, and chow-chow four times a day.At last, however,
the young grandson of the mandarin insisted upon my father's learning to
eat with chopsticks.The lofty spirit of Polacko could not brook this
outrage, and the door being left open one day he flew away and made his
way to Africa, the home of his infancy, where he passed the rest of his
life.I drop a tear," added Miss Mary, raising her claw gracefully to
her eyes, "to his respected memory."Nobody saw the tear, but all looked grave and sympathetic, and the
good-natured bear said, "Quite right, I'm sure.But now the grandmother rose and folded up her knitting."Dear friends, and Toto, boy," she said, "it is bed-time, now, for the
clock has struck nine.Good-night, and pleasant dreams to you all.My
good Bruin, you will cover the fire, and lock up the house?""Trust me for that, dear Madam!""Come, then, Cracker," said the old lady."Your basket is all ready for
you, and it is high time you were in it."And with the squirrel perched
on her shoulder she went into her own little room, closing the door
behind her.After exchanging mutual "good-nights," the other members of the family
sought their respective sleeping-places.The birds flew to their
perches, and each, tucking her head and one leg away in some mysterious
manner, became suddenly a very queer looking creature indeed."<DW53>," said Toto, "come and sleep on my bed, won't you?My feet were
cold, last night, and you do make such a delightful foot-warmer."It won't be
as warm for _me_ as my basket, though no doubt it would be nice for
you.""I'll put the big blue dressing-gown over you," said Toto."You know you
like that, because you can put your nose in the pocket, and keep it
warm."Bruin now proceeded to rake the ashes over the fire, covering it neatly
and carefully.He filled the kettle; he drew the bolts of door and
windows; and finally, when all was snug and safe, the good bear laid
himself down on the hearth-rug, and soon was fast asleep.Outside, the snow still fell,
softly, steadily, silently.In the shed, Bridget, the cow, was sleeping
soundly, with a cock and three hens roosting on her back, according to
their invariable custom.In the warm, covered sty the pig also slept.He
had no name, the pig; he would have scorned one."I am a pig," he was wont to say, "and as such every one knows me.There
is no danger of my being mistaken for anything else."But though slumber held fast, apparently, all the dwellers in cottage,
shed, and sty, there were in reality two pairs of eyes which were
particularly wide-awake at this moment.They were very black eyes, very
bright eyes, and they were, if you wish to know, peeping into the
kitchen through the crack under the cellar-door, to see what they could
see."Do you think we can get through the crack?"And the next moment they were in the kitchen.It was nearly dark, but not quite, for the covered embers still sent out
a dusky glow.It was warm; the floor was smooth and flat; there was a
smell as if there might be something to eat, somewhere.Altogether, it
was a very pleasant place for two little mice to play in; and as they
had it all to themselves, why should they not play?Play they did,
therefore, with right good-will; scampering hither and thither, rolling
over and over each other, poking their little sharp noses into every
crack and cranny they could find.how pleasant the dry, warm air, after their damp cellar-home!Playing and romping
is hungry work, and the two little brown mouse-stomachs are empty.It
seems to come from under that cupboard door.The crack is wide enough to
let out the smell, but not quite wide enough to let in Messrs.If they could enlarge it a bit, now, with the sharp little
tools which they always carry in their mouths!It is very fatiguing work;
but, see!If one made oneself _very_ small, now?It is
done, and the two mice find themselves in the immediate neighborhood of
a large piece of squash pie.too great for speech
or squeak, but just right for attack.and soon the plate shines white and empty, with only the smell of the
roses--I mean the pie--clinging round it still.There is nothing else to
eat in the cupboard, is there?what is this paper package which
smells so divinely, sending a warm, spicy, pungent fragrance through the
air?pie was good, but this will be better!Nibble through the paper
quickly, and then-- Alas!the spicy fragrance means _ginger_, and
it is not only warm, but _hot_.fire is
in our mouths, in our noses, our throats, our little brown stomachs, now
only too well filled.or we die, and never see our cool,
beloved cellar again.Hurry down from the shelf, creep through the
crack, rush frantically round the kitchen.Surely there is a smell of
water?there it is, in that tin basin, yonder.Into it we go,
splashing, dashing, drinking in the silver coolness, washing this fiery
torment from our mouths and throats.Thoroughly sobered by this adventure, the two little mice sat on the
floor beside the basin, dripping and shivering, the water trickling from
their long tails, their short ears, their sharp-pointed noses.They
blinked sadly at each other with their bright black eyes."Shall we go home now, Scrabble?""It is late, and Mother
Mouse will be looking for us.""I'm so c-c-c-cold!"shivered Scrabble, who a moment before had been
devoured by burning heat."Don't you think we might dry ourselves before
that fire before we go down?"replied Squeak, "we will.But--what is that great black thing in
front of the fire?"Shall
we climb over it, or go round it?""The exercise will help to warm
us; and it is such a queer-looking hill, I want to explore it."So they began to climb up the vast black mass, which occupied the whole
space in front of the fireplace."Because it is near the fire, stupid!""And what is this tall black stuff that grows so thick all over it?It
isn't a bit like grass, or trees either.""It _is_ grass, of course, stupid!"Scrabble," said little brown Squeak, stopping short, "you may call me
stupid as much as you please, but _I_ don't like this place.I--I--I
think it is moving.""_Moving?_" said little brown Scrabble, in a tone of horror.And then the two little mice clutched each other with their little paws,
and wound their little tails round each other, and held on tight, tight,
for the black mass _was_ moving!There was a long, stretching,
undulating movement, slow but strong; and then came a quick, violent,
awful shake, which sent the two brothers slipping, sliding, tumbling
headlong to the floor.Picking themselves up as well as they could, and
casting one glance back at the black hill, they rushed shrieking and
squeaking to the cellar-door, and literally flung themselves through the
crack.For in that glance they had seen a vast red cavern, a yawning
gulf of fire, open suddenly in the black mass, which was now heaving and
shuddering all over.And from this fiery cavern came smoke and flame (at
least so the mice said when they got home to the maternal hole), and an
awful roaring sound, which shook the whole house and made the windows
rattle.and never, never,
will we leave our cellar again!"But Bruin sat up on his haunches, and scratched himself and stretched
himself, and gave another mighty yawn."Haw-wa-wow-you-_wonk_!""Those must have been very
lively fleas, to wake me out of a sound sleep.I wonder where they have
crept to!And stretching his huge length once more along the floor, Bruin slept
again.AT dinner the next day, it was noticed that <DW53> was very melancholy.He
shook his head frequently, and sighed so deeply and sorrowfully that the
kind heart of the wood-pigeon was moved to pity."Are you not well, my dear <DW53>?""Something has gone amiss
with you, evidently.The raccoon shook his head again, and looked unutterably doleful."I knew how it would be, <DW53>," said the bear."You shouldn't have eaten
that third pie for supper.Two pies are enough for anybody, after such a
quantity of bread and honey and milk as you had."<DW53> sighed again, more deeply than before."I _didn't_ eat it all," he said; "I only wish I had!""Why, <DW53>," queried Toto, "what's the trouble?""Well," said <DW53>, "there was a piece left.I couldn't eat any more, so
I put it away in the cupboard, thinking I would have it for lunch
to-day.I never saw such a squash pie as that
was, anyhow, and that piece--"

He paused, and seemed lost in the thought of the pie."_Well!_" exclaimed Toto."So you _did_ eat it for your lunch, and now
you are unhappy because you didn't keep it for dinner.replied the other, "not at all!I trust I am not _greedy_,
Toto, _whatever_ my faults may be.I went to get it for my luncheon, for
I had been working all the morning like a--"

"Dormouse!"murmured the squirrel, the bear, and Toto,
simultaneously."I can say no more than that;
and I was desperately hungry.I went to the cupboard to get my piece of
pie, and it was--gone!"exclaimed the grandmother; "why, who can have taken it?""It was some small creature, for
it got in through the crack under the cupboard door, gnawing away the
wood.I have examined the marks," he added, "and they are the marks of
small, very sharp teeth.""What do you mean by looking at me in that way?"demanded little
Cracker, whisking his tail fiercely, and bristling all over."I've a
good mind to bite your ears with my sharp teeth.If you say I did, I'll throw this cheese--"

"Cracker!said the grandmother, gently, "you forget yourself!I am sure," she added, as Cracker hung
his head and looked much ashamed, "that none of us think seriously for a
moment that you took the pie.<DW53> loves his joke; but he has a good
heart, and he would not really give you pain, I know.Am I not right, <DW53>?"It is only justice to the raccoon to say that he was rather abashed at
this.He rubbed his nose, and gave a deprecatory wink at Bruin, who was
looking very serious; then, recovering himself, he beamed expansively on
the squirrel, who still looked fierce, though respect for "Madam" kept
him silent."Dear Madam, do I _ever_ mean
anything,--anything unkind, at least?"he added hastily, as Toto looked
up with a suppressed chuckle."I beg your pardon, Cracker, my boy, and I
hope you won't bear malice.As for those marks--"

"Those marks," interrupted the bear, who had risen from his seat and was
examining the cupboard door, "were made by mice."So am I," said Miss Mary, quietly."Two brown mice," said Miss Mary, "came out from under the cellar-door
about midnight.They gnawed at the cupboard till they had made the crack
wide enough to pass through.Then I heard them say, 'Squash pie!'and
heard them nibbling, or rather gobbling.After a while they came rushing
out as if the cat were after them, and jumped into the water-basin.Then
they tried to climb up Bruin's back, but he yawned like an alligator,
and shook them off, and they ran hurry-scurry under the cellar-door
again."A great laugh broke out at this recital of Messrs.Squeak and Scrabble's
nocturnal adventure, and under cover of the laughter the raccoon
approached the parrot."Why didn't you give the alarm," he asked, "or drive off the mice
yourself?You knew it was my pie, for you saw me put it there."Miss Mary cocked her bright yellow eye at him expressively."I lost two feathers from my tail, yesterday," she said."Somebody bit
them off while I was asleep.They were fine feathers, and I cannot
replace them."At length--

"Miss Mary," said the raccoon aloud, "what was the color of your
lamented husband?You told us once, but I am ashamed to say I'm not
positive that I remember."replied Miss Mary, in some surprise,--"a remarkably fine
emerald green."That explains his
choice of a wife.--Walk, Toto, did you say?and
in three bounds he was out of the door, and leaping and frolicking about
in the new-fallen snow.Toto caught up his cap and followed him, and the two together made their
way out of the yard, and walked, ran, leaped, jumped, tumbled,
scrambled, toward the forest.The sky had cleared, and the sun shone
brilliantly on the fresh white world.On every hand lay the snow,--here
heaped and piled in fantastic drifts and strange half-human shapes;
there spread smooth, like a vast counterpane.The tall trees of the
forest bent under white feathery masses, which came tumbling down on
Toto and his companion, as they lightly pushed the branches aside and
entered the woods.It is always a good thing for any one who
has eyes in his head, but it is especially good when you see all that
<DW53> and Toto saw; when you know, from every tiny track or footmark,
what little creatures have been running or hopping about; when many of
these little creatures are your friends, and all of them at least
acquaintances.how soft and powdery and
generally delightful the snow!What a pleasant world it was, on the
whole!said the raccoon, stopping and looking about him."It is
just about here that Chucky's aunt lives.You see
that oak-stump yonder, with the moss on it?Well, her burrow is just
under that.Suppose we give her a call, and tell her how her hopeful
nephew is."said Toto, "she is as fast asleep as he is, of course.We
couldn't wake her if we tried, and why should we try?""Might have a game of ball with her," suggested the raccoon."But I
don't know that it's worth while, after all.""Who lives in that hollow tree, now?""The wild-cat used to
live there, you know.It is a very comfortable tree, if I remember
right.""You found it so once, didn't you, Toto?""Do you remember
that day, when a thunder-shower came up, and you crept into that hollow
tree for shelter?_do_ you remember that day, my boy?""I am not likely to
forget it.It was raining guns and pitchforks, and the lightning was
cracking and zigzagging all through the forest, it seemed, and the
thunder crashing and bellowing and roaring--"

"Like Bruin, when the bumble-bee stung his nose!""There I was, curled up well in the hollow,
thinking how lucky I was, when suddenly came two green eyes glowering at
me, and a great spitting and spluttering and meowling.'F-s-s-s-s-yeh-yow-s-s-s-s-s-s!"'My dear Madam,' I said, 'it is really more than you can expect.You
are already thoroughly wet, and if you come here you will only drip all
over the nice dry hole and spoil it.Now, _I_ am quite dry; and to tell
you the truth, I mean to remain so.'"'My name is Klawtobitz!''I have lived in this tree for
seven years, and I am not going to be turned out of it by a thing with
two legs and no tail.cried I, getting angry in my turn.'I wouldn't have a
tail if I was paid for it; and I will _not_ leave this hole!'"And then the old cat humped her back, and grinned till I saw every
tooth in her head, and came flying at me,--claws spread, and tail as big
round as my arm.There we fought, tooth and nail, fist and claw, till we
were both out of breath.Finally I got her by the throat, and she made
her teeth meet in my arm, and there we both were.I had heard no noise
save the cat's screeching in my ear; but now, suddenly, a great growly
voice, close beside us, cried,--

"'Fair play!"We both dropped our hold, and looking up, saw--"

"Bruin and me!""We were taking a
quiet prowl in the rain, and hearing the scuffle, stopped to see what
was going on.Such a pretty fight I had not seen in a long time, and it
was really too bad of Bruin to stop it.How old Ma'am Wildcat's tail
went down, though, when she saw him!""I am very glad he did stop it," said Toto."I was quite a little chap
then, you see,--only seven years old,--and it was going hard with me.I
was frightened enough, though, I can tell you, when I saw Bruin standing
there.He looked as big as an elephant, and I fully expected to be eaten
up the next minute.But he said, in his great hearty voice,--

"'Give us your paw, my little fighting-cock!I gave you warning a week ago, when you killed the wood-pigeon's
nestlings.Off with you, now, quick, or--'"

"And she went!""Oh, yes, my dear, she went!I chased that cat for ten miles, to the very farthest end of
the forest.She had the start of me, and kept it pretty well, but I was
just overhauling her when we came to the open; she gave a flying leap
from the last tree, and went crash through the window of a farmhouse
which stood close at hand!I thought she would probably be attended to
there; so I went back, and found Bruin and you as sociable and friendly
as if you had been brought up in the same den,--you sitting in the hole,
with your funny red legs hanging out (you were the queerest-looking
animal I had ever seen, Toto!), and he sitting up on his haunches,
talking to you.""Don't you remember,
<DW53>?That was the first time I had ever seen any of you people, and I
was dreadfully afraid that I should be the supper myself.But we went to
his den, and had a jolly supper.Bruin ate three large watermelons, I
remember.He _said_ a man gave them to him.""I think it very likely that he did," said <DW53>, "if Bruin asked him.""And I showed you how to play leap-frog," continued Toto; "and we played
it over Bruin's back till it was time for me to go home.And then you
both walked with me to the edge of the forest, and there we swore
eternal friendship."said the raccoon, "that we did, my boy; and well have we kept the
vow!And so long as <DW53>'s tail has a single hair in it, will he ever
cherish-- Hello!he cried with a sudden start, as a tiny
brown creature darted swiftly across the path.stop a minute; you are just the fellow I want to see."The woodmouse stopped and turned round, and greeted the two friends
cordially."I haven't seen you for an age!""<DW53>, I supposed you had been
asleep for a couple of months, at least.How does it happen that you are
prowling about at this season?"<DW53> briefly explained the state of the case, and then added:--

"I am specially glad to meet you, Woodmouse, for I want to consult you
about something.There are some mice in the cellar of the
cottage,--brown mice.Very troublesome, thieving creatures they are, and
we want to get rid of them.Now, I suppose they are relatives of yours,
eh?"well--yes," the woodmouse admitted reluctantly."Distant, you
know, quite distant; but--a--yes, they _are_ relatives.A wretched,
disreputable set, I have heard, though I never met any of them.""They are a
great annoyance to the Madam, and to all of us.They almost take the
food out of our mouths; they destroy things in the cellar, and--and in
fact, we want to get rid of them."The woodmouse stared at him in amazement.<DW53>," he said,
laughing, "I should not have supposed, from my past acquaintance with
you, that you would have any difficulty in getting rid of them."Raccoons cannot blush, or our <DW53> certainly would have done so.He
rubbed his nose helplessly, somewhat after the fashion of Bruin, and
cast a half-comical, half-rueful glance at Toto.Finally he replied,--

"Well, you see, Woodmouse, things are rather different from usual this
winter.The fact is, our Madam has a strong objection to--a--in point of
fact, to slaughter; and she made it a condition of our coming to spend
the winter with her, that we should not kill other creatures unless it
were necessary.So I thought if we _could_ get rid of those mice in any
other way, it would please her.I suppose there is plenty of room in the
forest for another family of mice?"as far as room goes," replied the woodmouse, "they have a range of
ten miles in which to choose their home.I cannot promise to call on
them, you know; that could not be expected.But if they behave
themselves, they may in time overcome the prejudice against them.""Very well," said <DW53>, "I shall send them, then.he added, "and what is going on in your set?"Now it was the woodmouse's turn to look confused."My son is to be married on the second evening after this," he said."That is the only thing I know of."Why, he is one of my best
friends!How strange that I should have heard nothing of it!""We didn't know--we really thought--we supposed you were asleep!""And so you chose this time for the wedding?""Now, I
call that unfriendly, Woodmouse, and I shouldn't have thought it of
you."The woodmouse stroked his whiskers, and looked piteously at his
formidable acquaintance."Don't be offended, <DW53>!""Perhaps--perhaps you will come to the wedding, after all."Yes, to be sure I will come!""_I_ don't
bear malice.I will come, and Toto shall come, too."We--we have engaged the cave for the evening," said the woodmouse, with
some diffidence."We have a large family connection, you know, and it is
the only place big enough to hold them all."<DW53> stared in amazement, and Toto gave a long whistle."I should say this was to be something very
grand indeed.I should like very much to come, Woodmouse, if you think
it would not trouble any of your family.I promise you that <DW53> shall
be on his very best behavior, and--I'll tell you what!"he added, "I
will provide the music, as I did last summer, at the Rabbit's Rinktum."cried the little woodmouse, his
slender tail quivering with delight."We shall be infinitely obliged,
Mr.Bring
Cracker, too, and any other friends who may be staying with you.said Toto, gravely, "I think not.My grandmother never goes
out in the evening."suggested <DW53>, with a sly wink at Toto.But here the poor little woodmouse looked so unutterably distressed,
that the two friends burst out laughing; and reassuring him by a word,
bade him good-day, and proceeded on their walk."AND now," said the squirrel, when the tea-things were cleared away that
evening, "now for dancing-school.If we are going to a ball, we really
must be more sure of our steps than we are now.<DW53>, oblige me with a
whisk of your tail over the hearth.Some coals have fallen from the
fire, and we shall be treading on them.""When the coals are cold," replied the raccoon, "I shall be happy to
oblige you.And meantime, as I have no idea
of dancing immediately after my supper, I will, if you like, tell you
the story of the Useful Coal, which your request brings to my mind.It
is short, and will not take much time from the dancing-lesson."Right willingly the family all seated themselves around the blazing
fire, and the raccoon began as follows:--


THE USEFUL COAL.There was once a king whose name was Sligo.He was noted both for his
riches and his kind heart.One evening, as he sat by his fireside, a
coal fell out on the hearth.The King took up the tongs, intending to
put it back on the fire, but the coal said:--

"If you will spare my life, and do as I tell you, I will save your
treasure three times, and tell you the name of the thief who steals it."These words gave the King great joy, for much treasure had been stolen
from him of late, and none of his officers could discover the culprit.So he set the coal on the table, and said:--

"Pretty little black and red bird, tell me, what shall I do?""Put me in your waistcoat pocket," said the coal, "and take no more
thought for to-night."Accordingly the King put the coal in his pocket, and then, as he sat
before the warm fire, he grew drowsy, and presently fell fast asleep.When he had been asleep some time, the door opened, very softly, and the
High Cellarer peeped cautiously in.This was the one of the King's
officers who had been most eager in searching for the thief.He now
crept softly, softly, toward the King, and seeing that he was fast
asleep, put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket; for in that
waistcoat-pocket King Sligo kept the key of his treasure-chamber, and
the High Cellarer was the thief.He put his hand into the waistcoat
pocket.S-s-s-s-s!the coal burned it so frightfully that he gave a loud
shriek, and fell on his knees on the hearth.cried the King, waking with a start.your Majesty," said the High Cellarer, thrusting his burnt
fingers into his bosom, that the King might not see them."You were just
on the point of falling forward into the fire, and I cried out, partly
from fright and partly to waken you."The King thanked the High Cellarer, and gave him a ruby ring as a
reward.But when he was in his chamber, and making ready for bed, the
coal said to him:--

"Once already have I saved your treasure, and to-night I shall save it
again.Only put me on the table beside your bed, and you may sleep with
a quiet heart."So the King put the coal on the table, and himself into the bed, and was
soon sound asleep.At midnight the door of the chamber opened very
softly, and the High Cellarer peeped in again.He knew that at night
King Sligo kept the key under his pillow, and he was coming to get it.He crept softly, softly, toward the bed, but as he drew near it, the
coal cried out:--

"One eye sleeps, but the other eye wakes!one eye sleeps, but the other
eye wakes!Who is this comes creeping, while honest men are sleeping?"The High Cellarer looked about him in affright, and saw the coal
burning fiery red in the darkness, and looking for all the world like a
great flaming eye.In an agony of fear he fled from the chamber,
crying,--

    "Black and red!The King has a devil to guard his bed."And he spent the rest of the night shivering in the farthest garret he
could find.The next morning the coal said to the King:--

"Again this night have I saved your treasure, and mayhap your life as
well.Yet a third time I shall do it, and this time you shall learn the
name of the thief.But if I do this, you must promise me one thing, and
that is that you will place me in your royal crown and wear me as a
jewel.replied King Sligo, "for a jewel indeed you
are.""It is true that I am dying; but no
matter.It is a fine thing to be a jewel in a king's crown, even if one
is dead.As soon as I am
quite black and dead,--which will be in about ten minutes from now,--you
must take me in your hand and rub me all over and around the handle of
the door of the treasure-chamber.A good part of me will be rubbed off,
but there will be enough left to put in your crown.When you have
thoroughly rubbed the door, lay the key of the treasure-chamber on your
table, as if you had left it there by mistake.You may then go hunting
or riding, but not for more than an hour; and when you return, you must
instantly call all your court together, as if on business of the
greatest importance.Invent some excuse for asking them to raise their
hands, and then arrest the man whose hands are black.replied King Sligo, fervently, "I do, and my warmest thanks,
good Coal, are due to you for this--"

But here he stopped, for already the coal was quite black, and in less
than ten minutes it was dead and cold.Then the King took it and rubbed
it carefully over the door of the treasure-chamber, and laying the key
of the door in plain sight on his dressing-table, he called his huntsmen
together, and mounting his horse, rode away to the forest.As soon as he
was gone, the High Cellarer, who had pleaded a headache when asked to
join the hunt, crept softly to the King's room, and to his surprise
found the key on the table.Full of joy, he sought the treasure-chamber
at once, and began filling his pockets with gold and jewels, which he
carried to his own apartment, returning greedily for more.In this way
he opened and closed the door many times.Suddenly, as he was stooping
over a silver barrel containing sapphires, he heard the sound of a
trumpet, blown once, twice, thrice.The wicked thief started, for it was
the signal for the entire court to appear instantly before the King, and
the penalty of disobedience was death.Hastily cramming a handful of
sapphires into his pocket, he stumbled to the door, which he closed and
locked, putting the key also in his pocket, as there was no time to
return it.He flew to the presence-chamber, where the lords of the
kingdom were hastily assembling.The King was seated on his throne, still in his hunting-dress, though he
had put on his crown over his hat, which presented a peculiar
appearance.It was with a majestic air, however, that he rose and
said:--

"Nobles, and gentlemen of my court!I have called you together to pray
for the soul of my lamented grandmother, who died, as you may remember,
several years ago.In token of respect, I desire you all to raise your
hands to Heaven."The astonished courtiers, one and all, lifted their hands high in air.the hands of the High Cellarer were as
black as soot!The King caused him to be arrested and searched, and the
sapphires in his pocket, besides the key of the treasure-chamber, gave
amble proof of his guilt.His head was removed at once, and the King had
the useful coal, set in sapphires, placed in the very front of his
crown, where it was much admired and praised as a BLACK DIAMOND.*       *       *       *       *

"And _now_, Cracker, my boy," continued the raccoon, rising from his
seat by the fire, "as you previously remarked, now for dancing-school!"With these words he proceeded to sweep the hearth carefully and
gracefully with his tail, while Toto and Bruin moved the chairs and
tables back against the wall.The grandmother's armchair was moved into
the warm chimney-corner, where she would be comfortably out of the way
of the dancers; and Pigeon Pretty perched on the old lady's shoulder,
"that the two sober-minded members of the family might keep each other
in countenance," she said.Toto ran into his room, and returned with a
little old fiddle which had belonged to his grandfather, and stationed
himself at one end of the kitchen, while the bear, the raccoon, and the
squirrel formed in line at the other."Now, then," said Master Toto, tapping smartly on the fiddle."Stand up
straight, all of you!Up they all went,--little Cracker sitting up jauntily, his tail cocked
over his left ear, <DW53> pawing the air gracefully, but not quite sure of
himself; while Bruin raised his huge form erect, and stood like a shaggy
black giant, waiting further orders.<DW53> and Cracker bowed to each other; and Bruin, having no partner,
gravely saluted Miss Mary, who stood on one leg and surveyed the
proceedings in silent but deep disdain.Bruin dropped on
all-fours, and frantically endeavored to stand on his fore-paws, with
his hind-legs in the air, throwing up first one great shaggy leg and
then another, and finally losing his balance and falling flat, with a
thump that shook the whole house.cried the grandmother, starting from her chair.Madam," cried the bear, rising with surprising agility for one
of his size; "it's nothing!I--I was only
jumping and changing my feet.he added, in an
aggrieved tone, to Toto."It isn't possible, you know, for a fellow of
my build to--a--do that sort of thing.You shouldn't, really--"

"Oh, Bruin!cried Toto, wiping the tears from his eyes, as he
leaned against the dresser in a paroxysm of merriment."I didn't _mean_
you to do that!You jump--_so!_ and change
your feet--_so!_ as you come down.There, look at <DW53>; he has the idea,
perfectly!"The astute <DW53>, in truth, seeing Bruin's error, had stood quietly in
his place till he saw Toto perform the mystic manoeuvre of "jump and
change feet," and had then begun to practise it with a quiet grace and
ease, as if he had done it all his life.[Illustration: "Now, then, attention all!And he
played a lively air on his fiddle.--PAGE 97.]The squirrel, meanwhile, had obeyed the first part of the order by
jumping to the top of the clock, where he sat inspecting his little
black feet with an air of comical perplexity."Come down and
take your place at once!and he played a lively air on his fiddle.he said, "I am all right when we
come to forward and back.Tum-tiddy tum-tum, tum-tum-tum!"and he
pranced forward, put out one foot, and slid back again, with an air of
enjoyment that was pleasant to behold."Stand a little
straighter, Bruin!Cracker, you don't point your toe enough.Hold your
head up, <DW53>, and don't be looking round at your tail every minute._Tum_-tiddy tum-tum, _tum_-tum-tum!_tiddy_-iddy tum-tum,
_tum_-tum-tum!There, now you may rest a moment
before you begin on the waltz step."that is _my_ delight," said the squirrel."What a sensation we
shall make at the wedding!One of the woodmouse's daughters is very
pretty, with such a nice little nose, and such bright eyes!I shall ask
her to waltz with me.""There won't be any one of my size there, I suppose," said the raccoon."You and I will have to be partners, Toto.""And I must stay at home and waltz alone!""It is a misfortune, in some ways, to be so big.""But great good fortune in others, Bruin, dear!"said Pigeon Pretty,
affectionately."I, for one, would not have you smaller, for the world!""Bruin, my friend and
protector, your size and strength are the greatest possible comfort to
me, coupled as they are with a kind heart and a willing--"

"Paw!""Your sentiments are most correct, Granny, dear; but
Bruin _must_ not stand bowing in the middle of the room, even if he is
grateful.Go in the corner, Bruin, and practise your steps, while I take
a turn with <DW53>.And you, Cracker, can--"

But Master Cracker did not wait for instructions.He had been watching
the parrot for some minutes, with his head on one side and his eyes
twinkling with merriment; and now, springing suddenly upon her perch, he
caught the astonished bird round the body, leaped with her to the floor,
and began to whirl her round the room at a surprising rate, in tolerably
good time to the lively waltz that Toto was whistling.Miss Mary gasped
for breath, and fluttered her wings wildly, trying to escape from her
tormentor, and presently, finding her voice, she shrieked aloud:--

"Ke-ke-kee!Let me go
this instant, or I'll peck your eyes out!I will--"

"Oh, no, you won't, my dear!""You wouldn't have the heart
to do that; for then how could I look at you, the delight of my life?tiddy-_tum_ tum-tum!just see what a pretty
step it is!You will enjoy it immensely, as soon as you know it a little
better."And he whirled her round faster and faster, trying to keep pace
with <DW53> and Toto, who were circling in graceful curves.she cried, "did
you put that custard pie out in the snow to cool?Bruin doesn't like it
hot, you know."Toto, his head still dizzy from waltzing, looked about him in
bewilderment.I don't remember what I did
with it."It is there, on that
chair.Thus adjured, the good bear, who had been gravely revolving by himself
in the corner until he was quite blind, tried to stop short; at the same
instant the squirrel and the parrot, stumbling against his shaggy paw,
fell over it in a confused heap of feathers and fur.He stepped hastily
back to avoid treading on them, lost his balance, and sat down
heavily--on the custard pie!At the crash of the platter, the squirrel released Miss Mary, who flew
screaming to her perch; the grandmother wrung her hands and lamented,
begging to be told what had happened, and who was hurt; and the
unfortunate Bruin, staggering to his feet, stared aghast at the ruin he
had wrought.It was a very complete ruin, certainly, for the platter was
in small fragments, while most of its contents were clinging to his own
shaggy black coat."Well, old fellow," said Toto, "you have done it now, haven't you?I
tried to stop you, but I was too late.""Yes," replied the bear, solemnly, "I have done it now!And I have also
done _with_ it now.Dear Madam," he added, turning to the old lady,
"please forgive me!I have spoiled your pie, and broken your platter;
but I have also learned a lesson, which I ought to have learned
before,--that is, that waltzing is not my forte, and that, as the old
saying is, 'A bullfrog cannot dance in a grasshopper's nest.'IT was a bright clear night, when Toto, accompanied by the raccoon and
the squirrel, started from home to attend the wedding of the woodmouse's
eldest son.The moon was shining gloriously, and her bright cold rays
turned everything they touched to silver.The long icicles hanging from
the eaves of the cottage glittered like crystal spears; the snow
sparkled as if diamond-dust were strewn over its powdery surface.The
raccoon shook himself as he walked along, and looked about him with his
keen bright eyes."What a fine night this would be for a hunt!"he said, sniffing the cold
bracing air eagerly."There is the track of one
yonder.""It's a--it's
a cat!I wonder
how a cat came here, anyhow.It is a long
time since I chased a cat.""Oh, never mind the cat now, <DW53>!""We are late for the
wedding as it is, with all your prinking.Besides," he added slyly, "I
didn't lend you that red cravat to chase cats in."The raccoon instantly threw off his professional eagerness, and resumed
the air of complacent dignity with which he had begun the walk.Never
before had he been so fully impressed with the sense of his own charms.The red ribbon which he had begged from Toto set off his dark fur and
bright eyes to perfection; and he certainly was a very handsome fellow,
as he frisked daintily along, his tail curling gracefully over his back.he said cheerfully; "we shall certainly
make a sensation."I do, indeed," replied Toto; "though it is a great pity that you and
Cracker didn't let me put your tails in curl-papers last night, as I
offered to do.You can't think what an improvement it would have been.""The cow offered to lend me her bell," said Cracker, "to wear round my
neck, but it was too big, you know.She's the dearest old thing, that
cow!I had a grand game, this morning, jumping over her back and
balancing myself on her horns.Why doesn't she live in the house, with
the rest of us?"said Toto, "one _couldn't_ have a cow in the house.She's too big,
in the first place; and besides, Granny would not like it.One could not
make a companion of a cow!I don't know exactly why, but that sort of
animal is entirely different from you wood-creatures.""The difference is, my dear," said the raccoon, loftily, "that we have
been accustomed to good society, and know something of its laws; while
persons like Mrs."Why, only yesterday I
went out to the barn, and being in need of a little exercise, thought I
would amuse myself by swinging on her tail.And the creature, instead of
saying, 'Mr.<DW53>, I am sensible of the honor you bestow upon me, but
your well-proportioned figure is perhaps heavier than you are aware of,'
or something of that sort, just kicked me off, without saying a word.said the squirrel, "I think I should have done the same in her
place.But see, here we are at the cave.Just look at the tracks in the
snow!Why, there must be a thousand persons here, at least."Indeed, the snow was covered in every direction with the prints of
little feet,--feet that had hopped, had run, had crept from all sides of
the forest, and had met in front of this low opening, from which the
brambles and creeping vines had been carefully cleared away.Torches of
light-wood were blazing on either side, lighting up the gloomy entrance
for several feet, and from within came a confused murmur of many voices,
as of hundreds of small creatures squeaking, piping, and chattering in
every variety of tone.So much the better; we
shall make all the more sensation.Toto, is my neck-tie straight?""You look like--like--"

"Like a popinjay!"muttered the squirrel, who had no neck-tie."Come
along, will you, <DW53>?"And the three companions entered the cave
together.A brilliant scene it was that presented itself before their eyes.The
cave was lighted not only by glow-worms, but by light-wood torches stuck
in every available crack and cranny of the walls.The floor was
sprinkled with fine white sand, clean and glittering, while branches of
holly and alder placed in the corners added still more to the general
air of festivity.As to the guests, they were evidently enjoying
themselves greatly, to judge from the noise they were making.There were
a great many of them,--hundreds, or perhaps even thousands, though it
was impossible to count them, as they were constantly moving, hopping,
leaping, jumping, creeping, trotting, running, even flying.Never were
so many tiny creatures seen together.There were woodmice, of course, by
the hundred,--old and young, big and little; cousins, uncles, aunts,
grandmothers, of the bride and bridegroom.There were respectable
field-mice, looking like well-to-do farmers, as indeed they were; frisky
kangaroo-mice, leaping about on their long hind-legs, to the admiration
of all those whose legs were short.There were all the moles, of both
families,--those who wore plain black velvet without any ornament, and
those who had lovely rose- stars at the end of their noses.These
last gentlemen were very aristocratic indeed, and the woodmice felt
highly honored by their presence.Besides all these, the squirrels had
been invited, and had come in full force, the Grays and the Reds and the
Chipmunks; and Mr.Titmouse were there, and old Mrs.Shrew and
her daughters, and I don't know how many more.Hundreds and hundreds of
guests, none of them bigger than a squirrel, and most of them much
smaller.You can perhaps imagine the effect that was produced on this gay
assembly by the sudden appearance among them of a RACCOON and a BOY!There was a confused murmur for a moment, a quick affrighted glance, and
then dead silence.Not a creature dared to move; not a tail waved, not a
whisker quivered; all the tiny creatures stood as if turned to stone,
gazing in mute terror and supplication at their formidable visitors.The
bride, who had just entered from a side-cave on her father's arm,
prepared to faint; the bridegroom threw his arms about her and glared
fiercely at the intruders, his tiny heart swelling as high as if he were
a lion instead of a very small red mouse.Woodmouse, Senior, alone
retained his presence of mind.He hastened to greet his formidable
guests, and bade them welcome in a voice which, though tremulous, tried
hard to be cordial.<DW53>," he said, "you are welcome, most welcome.Toto, your most
obedient, sir.Cracker, I am delighted to see you.Very good of you all,
I'm sure, to honor this little occasion with your distinguished
presence.Will you--ah!--hum--will you sit down?"The little host hesitated over this invitation; it would not be polite
to ask his guests to be careful lest they should sit down _on_ the other
guests, and yet they were so _very_ large, and took up so _much_
room,--two of them, at least!<DW53>, delighted at the sensation he had
produced, was as gracious as possible, and sitting down with great care
so as to avoid any catastrophe, looked about him with so benign an
expression that the rest of the company began to take heart, and
whiskers were pricked and tails were cocked again.he said heartily,--"this is really
delightful!But I do not see your son, the
happy-- Ah!Prick-ear, you rascal, come here!Are you too
proud to speak to your old friends?"Thus adjured, the young woodmouse left his bride in her mother's care
and came forward, looking half pleased and half angry."Good evening,
<DW53>!""I was not sure whether you _were_ a friend, after our
last meeting.But I am very glad to see you, and I bear no malice."And with this he shook paws with an air of magnanimity.<DW53> rubbed his
nose, as he was apt to do when a little confused."I had quite forgotten that little
matter.But say no more about it, my boy; say no more about it!By-gones
are by-gones, and we should think of nothing but pleasure on an occasion
like the present."With a graceful and condescending wave of his paw he
dismissed the past, and continued: "Pray, introduce me to your charming
bride!I assure you I am positively longing to make her acquaintance.and he crossed the room and joined the
bridal party."What trouble did your son have with <DW53>?"said his host, in some embarrassment, "it came _near_
being serious,--at least Prick-ear thought it did.<DW53> one day last autumn, when he was bringing home a load of
checkerberries for supper.<DW53> wanted the checkerberries,
and--ah!--in point of fact, ate them; and when Prick-ear remonstrated,
he chased him all round the forest, vowing that if he caught him he
would--if you will excuse my mentioning such a thing--eat _him_ too.Now, that sort of thing is very painful, Mr.Toto; very painful indeed
it is, I assure you, sir.And though Prick-ear escaped by running into
a mole's burrow, I must confess that he has _not_ felt kindly toward Mr."Very natural," said Toto, gravely."It _has_ occurred to me," continued the woodmouse, "that possibly it
may have been only a joke on Mr.Seeing him so friendly and condescending here to-night, one can hardly
suppose that he _really_--eh?--could have intended--"

"He certainly would not do such a thing _now_," said Toto, decidedly,
"certainly not.He has the kindest feeling for all your family.""Most
gratifying, I'm sure.But I see that the ceremony is about to begin.If
you _would_ excuse me, Mr.Toto--"

And the little host bowed himself away, leaving Toto to seat himself at
leisure and watch the proceedings.The bride, an extremely pretty little mouse, was attired in
a very becoming travelling-dress of brown fur, which fitted her to
perfection.The ceremony was performed by a star-nosed mole of high
distinction, who delivered a learned and impressive discourse to the
young couple, and ended by presenting them with three leaves of
wintergreen, of which one was eaten by each separately, while they
nibbled the third together, in token of their united lives.When they
met in the middle of the leaf, they rubbed noses together, and the
ceremony was finished.Then everybody advanced to rub noses with the bride, and to shake paws
with the happy bridegroom.One of the first to do so was the raccoon,
who comported himself with a grace and dignity which attracted the
admiration of all.The little bride was nearly frightened to death, it
is true; but she bore up bravely, for her husband whispered in her ear
that Mr.<DW53> was one of his dearest friends, _now_.Meanwhile, no one was enjoying the festivity more thoroughly than our
little friend Cracker.He was whisking and frisking about from one group
to another, greeting old friends, making new acquaintances, hearing all
the wood-gossip of the winter, and telling in return of the wonderful
life that he and Bruin and <DW53> were leading.His own relations were
most deeply interested in all he had to tell; but while his cousins were
loud in their expressions of delight and of envy, some of the elders
shook their heads.Uncle Munkle, a sedate and portly chipmunk, looked
very grave as he heard of all the doings at the cottage, and presently
he beckoned Cracker to one side, and addressed him in a low tone."Cracker, my boy," he said, "I don't quite like all this, do you know?Toto and his grandmother are all very well, though they seem to have a
barbarous way of living; but who is this Mrs.Cow, about whom you have
so much to say; not a domestic animal, I trust?"Cracker admitted, rather reluctantly, "she _is_ a domestic
animal, Uncle; but she is a very good one, I assure you, and not
objectionable in any way.""I did not expect this of you,
Cracker!"he said severely, "I did not, indeed.This is the first time,
to my knowledge, that a member of my family has had anything to do with
a domestic animal.I am disappointed in you, sir; distinctly
disappointed!"There was a pause, in which the delinquent Cracker found nothing to say,
and then his uncle added:--

"And in what condition are your teeth, pray?I suppose you are letting
them grow, while you eat those wretched messes of soft food.Have you
_any_ proper food, at all?""Indeed, Uncle Munkle, my teeth are in
excellent condition.and he exhibited two shining
rows of teeth as sharp as those of a newly-set saw."We have plenty of
nuts; more than I ever had before, I assure you.Toto got quantities of
them in the autumn, on purpose for me; and there are great heaps of
hazels and beech-nuts and hickories piled up in the barn-chamber, where
I can go and help myself when I please."Oh, they are _so_ jolly!"Uncle Munkle looked mollified; he even seemed interested."They are foreign nuts, and don't grow in this part
of the world.Where did Toto get them, do you
think?""He bought them of a pedler," said Cracker."I know he would give you
some, Uncle, if you asked him.Why won't you come out and see us, some
day?"At this moment a loud and lively whistle was heard,--first three notes
of warning, and then Toto's merriest jig,--which put all serious
thoughts to flight, and set the whole company dancing.Cracker flew
across the room to a charming young red squirrel on whom he had had his
eye for some time, made his bow, and was soon showing off to her
admiring gaze the fine steps which he had learned in the kitchen at
home.The woodmice skipped and hopped merrily about; the kangaroo-mice
danced with long, graceful bounds,--three short hops after each one.It
is easy to do when you know just how.As for the moles, they ran round
and round in a circle, with their noses to the ground, and thought very
well of themselves.Presently Toto changed his tune from a jig to a waltz; and then he and
<DW53> danced together, to the admiration of all beholders.Round they
went, and round and round, circling in graceful curves,--Toto never
pausing in his whistle, <DW53>'s scarlet neck-tie waving like a banner in
the breeze."Yes, that is a sight worth seeing!""It is
a pity, just for this once, that you have not eyes to see it.""And have they
stars on their noses?I have no desire to _see_ them, as you call it."That is of more consequence, to my
mind.One can show one's skill in dancing, but that does not fill the
stomach, and mine warns me that it is empty."At this very moment the music stopped, and the voice of the host was
heard announcing that supper was served in the side-cave.The mole
waited to hear no more, but rushed as fast as his legs would carry him,
following his unerring nose in the direction where the food lay.Bolting
into the supper-room, he ran violently against a neatly arranged pyramid
of hazel-nuts, and down it came, rattling and tumbling over the greedy
mole, and finally burying him completely.The rest of the company coming
soberly in, each gentleman with his partner, saw the heaving and quaking
mountain of nuts beneath which the mole was struggling, and he was
rescued amid much laughter and merriment.There were nuts of all kinds,--butternuts,
chestnuts, beech-nuts, hickories, and hazels.There were huge piles of
acorns, of several kinds,--the long slender brown-satin ones, and the
fat red-and-brown ones, with a woolly down on them.There were
partridge-berries and checkerberries, and piles of fragrant, spicy
leaves of wintergreen.And there was sassafras-bark and spruce-gum, and
a great dish of golden corn,--a present from the field-cousins.Really,
it gives one an appetite only to think of it!And I verily believe that
there never was such a nibbling, such a gnawing, such a champing and
cracking and throwing away of shells, since first the forest was a
forest.When the guests were thirsty, there was root-beer, served in
birch-bark goblets; and when one had drunk all the beer one ate the
goblet; which was very pleasant, and moreover saved some washing of
dishes.And so all were very merry, and the star-nosed moles ate so much
that their stars turned purple, and they had to be led home by their
fieldmouse neighbors.At the close of the feast, the bride and groom departed for their own
home, which was charmingly fitted up under an elder-bush, from the
berries of which they could make their own wine.And finally, after a last wild dance, the company
separated, the lights were put out, and "the event of the season" was
over.TOTO and his companions walked homeward in high spirits.The air was
crisp and tingling; the snow crackled merrily beneath their feet; and
though the moon had set, the whole sky was ablaze with stars, sparkling
with the keen, winter radiance which one sees only in cold weather."Very pretty," said Toto; "very pretty indeed.What good people they are, those little woodmice.they made me fill all my pockets with checkerberries and nuts for the
others at home, and they sent so many messages of regret and apology to
Bruin that I shall not get any of them straight."said the squirrel, who had been gazing up into the sky, "what's
that?""_That!_" repeated Cracker."That big thing with a tail, up among the
stars."His companions both stared upward in their turn, and Toto exclaimed,--

"Why, it's a comet!I never saw one before, but I know what they look
like, from the pictures."And _what_, if I may be so bold as to ask," said <DW53>, "_is_ a comet?""Why, it's--it's--THAT, you know!""What a clear way you have of putting things, to
be sure!""Well," cried Toto, laughing, "I'm afraid I cannot put it _very_
clearly, because I don't know just _exactly_ what comets are, myself.But they are heavenly bodies, and they come and go in the sky, with
tails; and sometimes you don't see one again for a thousand years; and
though you don't see them move, they are really going like lightning all
the time."<DW53> and Cracker looked at each other, as if they feared that their
companion was losing his wits."They have no legs," replied Toto, "nothing but heads and tails; and I
don't believe they live on anything, unless," he added, with a twinkle
in his eye, "they get milk from the milky way."The raccoon looked hard at Toto, and then equally hard at the comet,
which for its part spread its shining tail among the constellations, and
took no notice whatever of him."Can't you give us a little more of this precious information?""It is so valuable, you know, and we are so likely to
believe it, Cracker and I, being two greenhorns, as you seem to think."Toto flushed, and his brow clouded for an instant, for <DW53> could be so
_very_ disagreeable when he tried; but the next moment he threw back his
head and laughed merrily."I _will_ give you more information, old
fellow.I will tell you a story I once heard about a comet.It isn't
true, you know, but what of that?You will believe it just as much as
you would the truth.Listen, now, both you cross fellows, to the story
of


THE NAUGHTY COMET.In the great court-yard stood
hundreds of comets, of all sizes and shapes.Some were puffing and
blowing, and arranging their tails, all ready to start; others had just
come in, and looked shabby and forlorn after their long journeyings,
their tails drooping disconsolately; while others still were switched
off on side-tracks, where the tinker and the tailor were attending to
their wants, and setting them to rights.In the midst of all stood the
Comet Master, with his hands behind him, holding a very long stick with
a very sharp point.The comets knew just how the point of that stick
felt, for they were prodded with it whenever they misbehaved
themselves; accordingly, they all remained very quiet, while he gave
his orders for the day.In a distant corner of the court-yard lay an old comet, with his tail
comfortably curled up around him.He was too old to go out, so he
enjoyed himself at home in a quiet way.Beside him stood a very young
comet, with a very short tail.He was quivering with excitement, and
occasionally cast sharp impatient glances at the Comet Master.he exclaimed, but in an undertone, so that
only his companion could hear."He knows I am dying to go out, and for
that very reason he pays no attention to me.I dare not leave my place,
for you know what he is."said the old comet, slowly, "if you had been out as often as I
have, you would not be in such a hurry.Hot, tiresome work, _I_ call it."What _does_ it all
amount to?That is what I am determined to find out.I cannot understand
your going on, travelling and travelling, and never finding out why you
do it._I_ shall find out, you may be very sure, before I have finished
my first journey.""You'll only get into
trouble.Nobody knows except the Comet Master and the Sun.The Master
would cut you up into inch pieces if you asked him, and the Sun--"

"Well, what about the Sun?"rang suddenly, clear and sharp, through the
court-yard.The young comet started as if he had been shot, and in three bounds he
stood before the Comet Master, who looked fixedly at him."You have never been out before," said the Master.73; and he knew better than to add another word."You will go out now," said the Comet Master."You will travel for
thirteen weeks and three days, and will then return.You will avoid the
neighborhood of the Sun, the Earth, and the planet Bungo.You will turn
to the left on meeting other comets, and you are not allowed to speak to
meteors.At the word, the comet shot out of the gate and off into space, his
short tail bobbing as he went.No longer shut up in that
tiresome court-yard, waiting for one's tail to grow, but out in the
free, open, boundless realm of space, with leave to shoot about here and
there and everywhere--well, _nearly_ everywhere--for thirteen whole
weeks!How well his
tail looked, even though it was still rather short!What a fine fellow
he was, altogether!For two or three weeks our comet was the happiest creature in all space;
too happy to think of anything except the joy of frisking about.But
by-and-by he began to wonder about things, and that is always dangerous
for a comet."I wonder, now," he said, "why I may not go near the planet Bungo.I
have always heard that he was the most interesting of all the planets.how I _should_ like to know a little more about the Sun!And, by the way, that reminds me that all this time I have never found
out _why_ I am travelling.It shows how I have been enjoying myself,
that I have forgotten it so long; but now I must certainly make a point
of finding out.So he turned out to the left, and waited till No.The
latter was a middle-aged comet, very large, and with an uncommonly long
tail,--quite preposterously long, our little No.73 thought, as he shook
his own tail and tried to make as much of it as possible.he said as soon as the other was within
speaking distance."Would you be so very good as to tell me what you are
travelling for?""Started a
month ago; five months still to go.""I mean _why_ are
you travelling at all?"_Why_ do we travel for weeks and months and years?"What's
more, don't care!"The little comet fairly shook with amazement and indignation.And how long, may I ask, have you been
travelling hither and thither through space, without knowing or caring
why?""Long enough to learn not to ask stupid questions!"And without another word he was off, with his preposterously long tail
spreading itself like a luminous fan behind him.The little comet looked
after him for some time in silence.At last he said:--

"Well, _I_ call that simply _disgusting_!An ignorant, narrow-minded
old--"

"Hello, cousin!"Our roads seem to go in the same
direction."The comet turned and saw a bright and sparkling meteor."I--I--must not
speak to you!""N-nothing that I know of," answered No."Then why mustn't you speak to me?"persisted the meteor, giving a
little skip and jump.answered the little comet, slowly, for he was ashamed
to say boldly, as he ought to have done, that it was against the orders
of the Comet Master.But a fine high-spirited young fellow like you isn't going
to be afraid of that old tyrant.If there were any
_real reason_ why you should not speak to me--"

"That's just what I say," interrupted the comet, eagerly.After a little more hesitation, the comet yielded, and the two frisked
merrily along, side by side.73 confided all his
vexations to his new friend, who sympathized warmly with him, and spoke
in most disrespectful terms of the Comet Master."A pretty sort of person to dictate to you, when he hasn't the smallest
sign of a tail himself!"As
to the other orders, some of them are not so bad.Of course, nobody
would want to go near that stupid, poky Earth, if he could possibly help
it; and the planet Bungo is--ah--is not a very nice planet, I believe.[The fact is, the planet Bungo contains a large reform school for unruly
meteors, but our friend made no mention of that.]But as for the
Sun,--the bright, jolly, delightful Sun,--why, I am going to take a
nearer look at him myself.We will go together, in spite of the
Comet Master."Again the little comet hesitated and demurred; but after all, he had
already broken one rule, and why not another?He would be punished in
any case, and he might as well get all the pleasure he could.Reasoning
thus, he yielded once more to the persuasions of the meteor, and
together they shot through the great space-world, taking their way
straight toward the Sun.When the Sun saw them coming, he smiled and seemed much pleased.He
stirred his fire, and shook his shining locks, and blazed brighter and
brighter, hotter and hotter.The heat seemed to have a strange effect on
the comet, for he began to go faster and faster."Something is drawing me forward,
faster and faster!"On he went at a terrible rate, the meteor following as best he might.Several planets which he passed shouted to him in warning tones, but he
could not hear what they said.The Sun stirred his fire again, and
blazed brighter and brighter, hotter and hotter; and forward rushed the
wretched little comet, faster and faster, faster and faster!"Catch hold of my tail and stop me!""I am
shrivelling, burning up, in this fearful heat!Stop me, for pity's
sake!"But the meteor was already far behind, and had stopped short to watch
his companion's headlong progress.And now,--ah, me!--now the Sun opened
his huge fiery mouth.The comet made one desperate effort to stop
himself, but it was in vain.An awful, headlong plunge through the
intervening space; a hissing and crackling; a shriek,--and the fiery
jaws had closed on Short-Tail No.I quite forgot that the
Sun ate comets.I must be off, or I shall get an aeon in the Reform
School for this.I am really very sorry, for he was a nice little
comet!"And away frisked the meteor, and soon forgot all about it.But in the great court-yard in front of the Comet House, the Master took
a piece of chalk, and crossed out No.73 from the list of short-tailed
comets on the slate that hangs on the door.and the swiftest of all the comets stood before
him, brilliant and beautiful, with a bewildering magnificence of tail.The Comet Master spoke sharply and decidedly, as usual, but not
unkindly.73, Short-Tail," he said, "has disobeyed orders, and has in
consequence been devoured by the Sun."Here there was a great sensation among the comets.1," continued the Master, "you will start immediately, and travel
until you find a runaway meteor, with a red face and blue hair.You are
permitted to make inquiries of respectable bodies, such as planets or
satellites.When found, you will arrest him and take him to the planet
Bungo.My compliments to the Meteor Keeper, and I shall be obliged if he
will give this meteor two aeons in the Reform School.I trust," he
continued, turning to the assembled comets, "that this will be a lesson
to all of you!""BRUIN, what do you think?Thus spoke
the little squirrel as he sat perched on his big friend's shoulder, the
day after the wedding party."Why, I think that you are
tickling my ear, Master Cracker, and that if you do not stop, I shall be
under the painful necessity of knocking you off on the floor.""Oh, that isn't the kind of thinking I mean!"replied Cracker,
impudently flirting the tip of his tail into the good bear's eye."_That_ is of no consequence, you great big fellow!What are your ears
for, if not for me to tickle?I mean, what do you think I heard at the
party, last night?""Bruin, I shall certainly be obliged to shake you!""I shall shake you till your teeth rattle, if you give me any more of
this impudence.So behave yourself now, and listen to me.I was talking
with Chipper last night,--my cousin, you know, who lives at the other
end of the wood,--and he told me something that really quite troubled
me.said Bruin, "I should say I did.He hasn't been in our part
of the wood again, has he?""He is not likely to go anywhere for a long
time, I should say.He has broken his leg, Chipper tells me, and has
been shut up in his cavern for a week and more."How
does the poor old man get his food?""Chipper didn't seem to think he _could_ get any," replied the squirrel."He peeped in at the door, yesterday, and saw him lying in his bunk,
looking very pale and thin.He tried once or twice to get up, but fell
back again; and Chipper is sure there was nothing to eat in the cave.I
thought I wouldn't say anything to <DW53> or Toto last night, but would
wait till I had told you.""I will go
myself, and take care of the poor man till his leg is well.Where are
the Madam and Toto?The blind grandmother was in the kitchen, rolling out pie-crust.She
listened, with exclamations of pity and concern, to Cracker's account of
the poor old hermit, and agreed with Bruin that aid must be sent to him
without delay."I will pack a basket at once," she said, "with
nourishing food, bandages for the broken leg, and some simple medicines;
and Toto, you will take it to the poor man, will you not, dear?"But Bruin said: "No, dear Madam!Our Toto's heart is
big, but he is not strong enough to take care of a sick person.It is
surely best for me to go.""Dear Bruin," she said, "of course you
_would_ be the best nurse on many accounts; but if the man is weak and
nervous, I am afraid--you alarmed him once, you know, and possibly the
sight of you, coming in suddenly, might--"

"Speak out, Granny!""You think Bruin would simply
frighten the man to death, or at best into a fit; and you are quite
right.he added, turning to Bruin, who
looked sadly crestfallen at this throwing of cold water on the fire of
his kindly intentions, "we will go together, and then the whole thing
will be easily managed.I will go in first, and tell the hermit all
about you; and then, when his mind is prepared, you can come in and make
him comfortable."The good bear brightened up at this, and gladly assented to Toto's
proposition; and the two set out shortly after, Bruin carrying a large
basket of food, and Toto a small one containing medicines and bandages.Part of the food was for their own lunch, as they had a long walk before
them, and would not be back till long past dinner-time.They trudged
briskly along,--Toto whistling merrily as usual, but his companion very
grave and silent.asked the boy, when a couple of miles had
been traversed in this manner."Has our account of the wedding made you
pine with envy, and wish yourself a mouse?"replied the bear, slowly, "oh, no!I should not like to be a
mouse, or anything of that sort.But I do wish, Toto, that I was not so
frightfully ugly!"cried Toto, indignantly, "who said you were ugly?What put such
an idea into your head?""Why, you yourself," said the bear, sadly."You said I would frighten
the man to death, or into a fit.Now, one must be horribly ugly to do
that, you know.""My _dear_ Bruin," cried Toto, "it isn't because you are _ugly_; why,
you are a perfect beauty--for a bear.But--well--you are _very_ large,
you know, and somewhat shaggy, if you don't mind my saying so; and you
must remember that most bears are very savage, disagreeable creatures.How is anybody who sees you for the first time to know that you are the
best and dearest old fellow in the world?Besides," he added, "have you
forgotten how you frightened this very hermit when he stole your honey,
last year?"Bruin hung his head, and looked very sheepish."I shouldn't roar, now,
of course," he said."I meant to be very gentle, and just put one paw
in, and then the end of my nose, and so get into the cave by degrees,
you know."Toto had his doubts as to the soothing effect which would have been
produced by this singular measure, but he had not the heart to say so;
and after a pause, Bruin continued:--

"Of course, however, you and Madam were quite right,--quite right you
were, my boy.But I was wondering, just now, whether there were not
some way of making myself less frightful.Now, you and Madam have no
hair on your faces,--none anywhere, in fact, except a very little on the
top of your head.That gives you a gentle expression, you see.Do you
think--would it be possible--would you advise me to--to--in fact, to
shave the hair off my face?"The excellent bear looked wistfully at Toto, to mark the effect of this
proposition; but Toto, after struggling for some moments to preserve his
gravity, burst into a peal of laughter, so loud and clear that it woke
the echoes of the forest.Bruin,
dear, you really _must_ excuse me, but I cannot help it.Bruin looked hurt and vexed for a moment, but it was only a moment.Toto's laughter was too contagious to be resisted; the worthy bear's
features relaxed, and the next instant he was laughing himself,--or
coming as near to it as a black bear can."I am a foolish old fellow, I suppose!""We will say no more
about it, Toto.It sounded like a crow,
only it was too feeble."They listened, and presently the sound was heard again; and this time it
certainly was a faint but distinct "Caw!"and apparently at no great
distance from them.The two companions looked about, and soon saw the
owner of the voice perched on a stump, and croaking dismally.A more
miserable-looking bird was never seen.His feathers drooped in limp
disorder, and evidently had not been trimmed for days; his eyes were
half-shut, and save when he opened his beak to utter a despairing "Caw!"he might have been mistaken for a stuffed bird,--and a badly stuffed
bird at that.shouted Toto, in his cheery voice."What is the matter
that you look so down in the beak?"The crow raised his head, and looked sadly at the two strangers."I am
sick," he said, "and I can't get anything to eat for myself or my
master.""He is a hermit," replied the crow."He lives in a cave near by; but
last week he broke his leg, and has not been able to move since then.He
has nothing to eat, for he will not touch raw snails, and I cannot find
anything else for him.I fear he will die soon, and I shall probably die
too."said the bear, "don't let me hear any nonsense of that
kind.Here, take that, sir, and don't talk foolishness!""That" was neither more nor less than the wing of a roast chicken which
Bruin had pulled hastily from the basket.The famished crow fell upon
it, beak and claw, without more ado; and a silence ensued, while the two
friends, well pleased, watched the first effect of their charitable
mission."Were you ever so hungry as that, Bruin?"said the bear, carelessly, "often and often.When I came out
in the spring, you know.But I never stayed hungry very long," he
added, with a significant grimace."This crow is sick, you see, and
probably cannot help himself much.he
said, addressing the crow, who had polished the chicken-bone till it
shone again, and now looked up with a twinkle in his eyes very different
from the wretched, lacklustre expression they had at first worn.he said warmly; "you have positively
given me life.And now, tell me how I can serve
you, for you are evidently bent on some errand.""We have come to see your master," said Toto."We heard of his accident,
and thought he must be in need of help.So, if you will show us the
way--"

The crow needed no more, but joyfully spread his wings, and half hopped,
half fluttered along the ground as fast as he could go.he cried, "our humble dwelling is close at hand.Follow me,
I pray you, and blessings attend your footsteps."The two friends followed, and soon came upon the entrance to a cave,
around which a sort of rustic porch had been built.Vines were trained
over it, and a rude chair and table stood beneath the pleasant shade."This is my master's study," said the crow."Here we have spent many
happy and profitable hours.May it please you to enter, worshipful
sirs?"asked Toto, glancing at his companion."Shall
we go in, or send the crow first, to announce us?""You had better go in alone," said the bear, decidedly."I will stay
here with Master Crow, and when--that is, _if_ you think it best for me
to come in, later, you have but to call me."Accordingly Toto entered the cavern, which was dimly lighted by a hole
in the roof.As soon as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom, he
perceived a rude pallet at one side, on which was stretched the form of
a tall old man.His long white hair and beard were matted and tangled;
his thin hands lay helpless by his side; it seemed as if he were
scarcely alive.He opened his eyes, however, at the sound of footsteps,
and looked half-fearfully at the boy, who bent softly over him.said Toto, not knowing what else to say."Is your
leg better, to-day?"murmured the old man, feebly.He started for the mouth of the cave, but before he reached it, a huge,
shaggy, black paw was thrust in at the aperture, holding out a bark
dish, while a sort of enormous whisper, which just _was_ not a growl,
murmured, "Here it is!""Thank you, Bru--I mean, thank you!"said Toto, in some confusion,
glancing apprehensively toward the bed.But the old man noticed nothing,
till the clear cool water was held to his lips.He drank eagerly, and
seemed to gain a little strength at once, for he now gazed earnestly at
Toto, and presently said, in a feeble voice:--

"Who are you, dear child, and what good angel has sent you to save my
life?""My name is Toto," replied the boy."As to how I came here, I will tell
you all that by-and-by; but now you are too weak either to talk or to
listen, and I must see at once about getting you some--"

"_Food!_" came the huge whisper again, rolling like a distant muttering
of thunder through the cavern; and again the shaggy paw appeared,
solemnly waving a bowl of jelly.Toto flew to take it, but paused for a moment, overcome with amusement
at the aspect presented by his friend.The good bear had wedged his huge
bulk tightly into a corner behind a jutting fragment of rock.Here he
sat, with the basket of provisions between his knees, and an air of deep
and solemn mystery in his look and bearing.Not seeing Toto, he still
held the bowl of jelly in his outstretched paw, and opening his
cavernous jaws, was about to send out another rolling thunder-whisper of
"Food!"when Toto sprang quickly on the jelly, and taking a spoon from
the basket, rapped the bear on the nose with it, and then returned to
his charge.The poor hermit submitted meekly to being fed with a spoon, and at every
mouthful seemed to gain strength.A faint color stole into his wan
cheek, his eyes brightened, and before the bowl was two thirds empty, he
actually smiled."I little thought I should ever taste jelly again," he said."Indeed, I
had fully made up my mind that I must starve to death here; for I was
unable to move, and never thought of human aid coming to me in this
lonely spot.Even my poor crow, my faithful companion for many years,
has left me.I trust he has found some other shelter, for he was feeble
and lame, himself.""It was he who showed us the
way here; and he's outside now, talking to--that is--talking to himself,
you know."Why does he not come in, and let me thank him also for his kindness?""He--oh--he--he doesn't like to be
thanked."I
am distressed to think of his staying outside."He isn't a boy," said Toto.what a muddle I'm making of it!He's bigger than a boy, sir, a great deal bigger.And--I hope you won't
mind, but--he's black!""My dear boy, I have no
prejudice against the Ethiopian race.I believe they are generally called either
Caesar or Pompey.Pomp--"

"Oh, stop!""His name _isn't_ Pompey, it's
Bruin.And he wouldn't come in yet if I were to--"

"Cut him into inch pieces!"came rolling like muffled thunder through
the doorway.The old hermit started as if he had been shot.He is the best,
dearest, kindest old fellow _in the world_, and it isn't his fault,
because he was--"

"Born so!"resounded from without; and the poor hermit, now speechless
with terror, could only gasp, and gaze at Toto with eyes of agonized
entreaty."And we might have been bears
ourselves, you know, if we had happened to have them for fathers and
mothers; so--" But here he paused in dismay, for the hermit, without
more ado, quietly fainted away."I am afraid he is dead, or
dying.At this summons the crow came hopping and fluttering in, followed by the
unhappy bear, who skulked along, hugging the wall and making himself as
small as possible, while he cast shamefaced and apologetic glances
toward the bed."Oh, you needn't mind now!"Do
you think he is dead, Crow?But the crow never had; and the three were standing beside the bed in
mute dismay, when suddenly a light flutter of wings was heard, and a
soft voice cooed, "Toto!and the next moment Pigeon Pretty came
flying into the cave, with a bunch of dried leaves in her bill.A glance
showed her the situation, and alighting softly on the old man's breast
she held the leaves to his nostrils, fanning him the while with her
outspread wings.she said, "I have flown so fast I am quite out of breath.You see,
dears, I was afraid that something of this sort might happen, as soon as
I heard of your going.I was in the barn, you know, when you were
talking about it, and getting ready.So I flew to my old nest and got
these leaves, of which I always keep a store on hand.See, he is
beginning to revive already."In truth, the pungent fragrance of the leaves, which now filled the air,
seemed to have a magical effect on the sick man.His eyelids fluttered,
his lips moved, and he muttered faintly, "The bear!The wood-pigeon motioned to Bruin and Toto to withdraw, which they
speedily did, casting remorseful glances at one another.Silently and
sadly they sat down in the porch, and here poor Bruin abandoned himself
to despair, clutching his shaggy hair, and even pulling out several
handfuls of it, while he inwardly called himself by every hard name he
could think of.Toto sat looking gloomily at his boots for a long time,
but finally he said, in a whisper:--

"Cheer up, old fellow!I do suppose I am the
stupidest boy that ever lived.If I had only managed a little
better--hark!Both listened, and heard the soft voice of the wood-pigeon calling,
"Bruin!Hermit understands all
about it now, and is ready to welcome _both_ his visitors."Much amazed, the two friends rose, and slowly and hesitatingly
re-entered the cave, the bear making more desperate efforts even than
before to conceal his colossal bulk.To his astonishment, however, the
hermit, who was now lying propped up by an improvised pillow of dry
moss, greeted him with an unflinching gaze, and even smiled and held out
his hand.Bruin," he said, "I am glad to meet you, sir!This sweet bird has
told me all about you, and I am sincerely pleased to make your
acquaintance.So you have walked ten miles and more to bring help and
comfort to an old man who stole your honey!"But this was more than the good bear could stand.He sat down on the
ground, and thrusting his great shaggy paws into his eyes, fairly began
to blubber.At this, I am ashamed to say, all the others fell to
laughing.First, Toto laughed--but Toto, bless him!was always
laughing; and then Pigeon Pretty laughed; and then Jim Crow; and then
the hermit; and finally, Bruin himself.And so they all laughed
together, till the forest echoes rang, and the woodchucks almost stirred
in their holes.IT was late in the afternoon of the same day.In the cottage at home all
was quiet and peaceful.The grandmother was taking a nap in her room,
with the squirrel curled up comfortably on the pillow beside her.In the
kitchen, the fire and the kettle were having it all their own way, for
though two other members of the family were in the room, they were
either asleep or absorbed in their own thoughts, for they gave no sign
of their presence.The kettle was in its glory, for Bruin had polished
it that very morning, and it shone like the good red gold.It sang its
merriest song, and puffed out clouds of snow-white steam from its
slender spout.I
feel almost sure that I must have turned into gold, for I never used to
look like this.A golden kettle is rather a rare thing, I flatter
myself.It really seems a pity that there is no one here except the
stupid parrot, who has gone to sleep, and that odious raccoon, who
always looks at me as if I were a black pot, and a cracked pot at that."I admire you immensely, as you know, and it is my
greatest pleasure to see myself reflected in your bright face.cr-r-r-r-rickety!"And they performed
really a very creditable duet together.Now it happened that the parrot was not asleep, though she had had the
bad taste to turn her back on the fire and the kettle.She was looking
out of the window, in fact, and wondering when the wood-pigeon would
come back.Though not a bird of specially affectionate nature, Miss Mary
was still very fond of Pigeon Pretty, and always missed her when she
was away.This afternoon had seemed particularly long, for no one had
been in the kitchen save <DW53>, with whom she was not on very good terms.Now, she thought, it was surely time for her friend to return; and she
stretched her neck, and peered out of the window, hoping to catch the
flutter of the soft brown wings.Instead of this, however, she caught
sight of something else, which made her start and ruffle up her
feathers, and look again with a very different expression.Outside the cottage stood a man,--an ill-looking fellow, with a heavy
pack strapped on his back.He was looking all about him, examining the
outside of the cottage carefully, and evidently listening for any sound
that might come from within.All being silent, he stepped to the window
(not Miss Mary's window, but the other), and took a long survey of the
kitchen; and then, seeing no living creature in it (for the raccoon
under the table and the parrot on her perch were both hidden from his
view), he laid down his pack, opened the door, and quietly stepped in.An ill-looking fellow, Miss Mary had thought him at the first glance;
but now, as she noiselessly turned on her perch and looked more closely
at him, she thought his aspect positively villanous.He had a hooked
nose and a straggling red beard, and his little green eyes twinkled with
an evil light as he looked about the cosey kitchen, with all its neat
and comfortable appointments.First he stepped to the cupboard, and after examining its contents he
drew out a mutton-bone (which had been put away for Bruin), a hunch of
bread, and a cranberry tart, on which he proceeded to make a hearty
meal, without troubling himself about knife or fork.He ate hurriedly,
looking about him the while,--though, curiously enough, he saw neither
of the two pairs of bright eyes which were following his every movement.The parrot on her perch sat motionless, not a feather stirring; the
raccoon under the table lay crouched against the wall, as still as if
he were carved in stone.Even the kettle had stopped singing, and only
sent out a low, perturbed murmur from time to time.His meal finished, the rascal--his confidence increasing as the moments
went by without interruption--proceeded to warm himself well by the
fire, and then on tiptoe to walk about the room, peering into cupboards
and lockers, opening boxes and pulling out drawers.The parrot's blood
boiled with indignation at the sight of this "unfeathered vulture," as
she mentally termed him, ransacking all the Madam's tidy and well-kept
stores; but when he opened the drawer in which lay the six silver
teaspoons (the pride of the cottage), and the porringer that Toto had
inherited from his great-grandfather,--when he opened this drawer, and
with a low whistle of satisfaction drew the precious treasures from
their resting-place, Miss Mary could contain herself no longer, but
clapped her wings and cried in a clear distinct voice, "Stop thief!"The man started violently, and dropping the silver back into the drawer,
looked about him in great alarm.At first he saw no one, but presently
his eyes fell on the parrot, who sat boldly facing him, her yellow eyes
gleaming with anger.His terror changed to fury, and with a muttered
oath he stepped forward."You'll never say 'Stop thief'
again, my fine bird, for I'll wring your neck before I'm half a minute
older."[Illustration: But at this last mishap the robber, now fairly beside
himself, rushed headlong from the cottage.--PAGE 163.]He stretched his hand toward the parrot, who for her part prepared to
fly at him and fight for her life; but at that moment something
happened.There was a rushing in the air; there was a yell as if a dozen
wild-cats had broken loose, and a heavy body fell on the robber's
back,--a body which had teeth and claws (an endless number of claws, it
seemed, and all as sharp as daggers); a body which yelled and scratched
and bit and tore, till the ruffian, half mad with terror and pain,
yelled louder than his assailant.Vainly trying to loosen the clutch
of those iron claws, the wretch staggered backward against the hob.Was
it accident, or did the kettle by design give a plunge, and come down
with a crash, sending a stream of boiling water over his legs?But at this last mishap the robber,
now fairly beside himself, rushed headlong from the cottage, and still
bearing his terrible burden, fled screaming down the road.At the same moment the door of the grandmother's room was opened
hurriedly, and the old lady cried, in a trembling voice, "What has
happened?"<DW53> has--has just
stepped out, with--in fact, with an acquaintance.He will be back
directly, no doubt.""Was that--"

"The acquaintance, dear Madam!""He was
excited!--about something, and he raised his voice, I confess, higher
than good breeding usually allows.The good old lady, still much mystified, though her fears were set at
rest by the parrot's quiet confidence, returned to her room to put on
her cap, and to smooth the pretty white curls which her Toto loved.No
sooner was the door closed than the squirrel, who had been fairly
dancing up and down with curiosity and eagerness, opened a fire of
questions:--

"Who was it?Why didn't you want Madam to know?"Miss Mary entered into a full account of the thrilling adventure, and
had but just finished it when in walked the raccoon, his eyes sparkling,
his tail cocked in its airiest way.cried the parrot, eagerly, "is he gone?""Yes, my dear, he is gone!"Why didn't you come too, Miss Mary?You might
have held on by his hair.Yes, I went on
quite a good bit with him, just to show him the way, you know.And then
I bade him good-by, and begged him to come again; but he didn't say he
would."<DW53> shook himself, and fairly chuckled with glee, as did also his two
companions; but presently Miss Mary, quitting her perch, flew to the
table, and holding out her claw to the raccoon, said gravely:--

"<DW53>, you have saved my life, and perhaps the Madam's and Cracker's
too.Give me your paw, and receive my warmest thanks for your timely
aid.We have not been the best of friends, lately," she added, "but I
trust all will be different now.And the next time you are invited to a
party, if you fancy a feather or so to complete your toilet, you have
only to mention it, and I shall be happy to oblige you.""And for my part, Miss Mary," responded the raccoon warmly, "I beg you
to consider me the humblest of your servants from this day forth.If you
fancy any little relish, such as snails or fat spiders, as a change from
your every-day diet, it will be a pleasure to me to procure them for
you.Beauty," he continued, with his most gallant bow, "is enchanting,
and valor is enrapturing; but beauty and valor _combined_, are--"

"Oh, come!"said the squirrel, who felt rather crusty, perhaps, because
he had not seen the fun, and so did not care for the fine speeches,
"stop bowing and scraping to each other, you two, and let us put this
distracted-looking room in order before Madam comes in again.Pick up
the kettle, will you, <DW53>?the water is running all over the
floor."The raccoon did not answer, being apparently very busy setting the
chairs straight; so Cracker repeated his request, in a sharper voice."Do you hear me, <DW53>?I cannot do it
myself, for it is twice as big as I am, but I should think you could
lift it easily, now that it is empty."The raccoon threw a perturbed glance at the kettle, and then said in a
tone which tried to be nonchalant, "Oh!It will
get up, I suppose, when it feels like it.If it should ask me to help
it, of course I would; but perhaps it may prefer the floor for a change.I--I often lie on the floor, myself," he added.The raccoon beckoned him aside, and said in a low tone, "My good
Cracker, Toto _says_ a great many things, and no doubt he thinks they
are all true.But he is a young boy, and, let me tell you, he does _not_
know everything in the world.If that thing is not alive, why did it
jump off its seat just at the critical moment, and pour hot water over
the robber's legs?"And I don't deny that it was a great help, Cracker, and that I was
very glad the kettle did it.when a creature has no more
self-respect than to lie there for a quarter of an hour, with its head
on the other side of the room, without making the smallest attempt to
get up and put itself together again, why, I tell you frankly _I_ don't
feel much like assisting it.You never knew one of _us_ to behave in
that sort of way, did you, now?""But then, if any of us were to lose
our heads, we should be dead, shouldn't we?""And when that thing loses
its head, it _isn't_ dead.Sandra moved to the garden.It can go without
its head for an hour!I've seen it, when Toto took it off--the head, I
mean--and forgot to put it on again.I tell you, it just _pretends_ to
be dead, so that it can be taken care of, and carried about like a baby,
and given water whenever it is thirsty.A secret, underhand, sly
creature, I call it, and I sha'n't touch it to put its head on again!"And that was all the thanks the kettle got for its pains.CHAPTER X.


WHEN Toto came home, as he did just when night was closing in around the
little cottage, he was whistling merrily, as usual; and the first sound
of his clear and tuneful whistle brought <DW53>, Cracker, and Miss Mary
all running to the door, to greet, to tell, and to warn him.The boy
listened wide-eyed to the story of the attempted robbery, and at the end
of it he drew a long breath of relief."I am _so_ glad you didn't let Granny know!"what a
good fellow you are, <DW53>!And Miss Mary, you are a
trump, and I would give you a golden nose-ring like your Princess's if
you had a nose to wear it on.To think of you two defending the castle,
and putting the enemy to flight, horse, foot, and dragoons!""I don't think he had any
about him, unless it was concealed.He had no horse, either; but he had
two feet,--and very ugly ones they were.He danced on them when the
kettle poured hot water over his legs,--danced higher than ever you did,
Toto."laughed Toto, who was in high spirits.But," he added, "it is so dark that you do not see our
guest, whom I have brought home for a little visit.Thus adjured, the crow hopped solemnly forward, and made his best bow to
the three inmates, who in turn saluted him, each after his or her
fashion.The raccoon was gracious and condescending, the squirrel
familiar and friendly, the parrot frigidly polite, though inwardly
resenting that a crow should be presented to her,--to _her_, the
favorite attendant of the late lamented Princess of Central
Africa,--without her permission having been asked first.As for the
crow, he stood on one leg and blinked at them all in a manner which
meant a great deal or nothing at all, just as you chose to take it.he said, gravely, "it is with pleasure that I
make your acquaintance.May this day be the least happy of your lives!Lady Parrot," he added, addressing himself particularly to Miss Mary,
"grant me the honor of leading you within.The evening air is chill for
one so delicate and fragile."Miss Mary, highly delighted at being addressed by such a stately title
as "Lady Parrot," relaxed at once the severity of her mien, and
gracefully sidled into the house in company with the sable-clad
stranger, while Toto and the two others followed, much amused.After a hearty supper, in the course of which Toto related as much of
his and Bruin's adventures in the hermit's cave as he thought proper,
the whole family gathered around the blazing hearth.Toto brought the
pan of apples and the dish of nuts; the grandmother took up her
knitting, and said, with a smile: "And who will tell us a story, this
evening?We have had none for two evenings now, and it is high time that
we heard something new.Cracker, my dear, is it not your turn?""I think it is," said the squirrel, hastily cramming a couple of very
large nuts into his cheek-pouches, "and if you like, I will tell you a
story that Mrs.It is about a cow that
jumped over the moon.""Why, I've known that story ever since I was a baby!And it isn't a story, either, it's a rhyme,--

    "Hey diddle diddle,
     The cat and the fiddle,
     The cow--"

"Yes, yes!I know, Toto," interrupted the squirrel."She told me that,
too, and said it was a pack of lies, and that people like you didn't
know anything about the real truth of the matter.So now, if you will
just listen to me, I will tell you how it really happened."There once was a young cow, and she had a calf.said Toto, in rather a provoking manner."No, it isn't, it's only the beginning," said the little squirrel,
indignantly; "and if you would rather tell the story yourself, Toto, you
are welcome to do so."Crackey," said Toto, apologetically."Won't do so again,
Crackey; go on, that's a dear!"and the squirrel, who never bore malice
for more than two minutes, put his little huff away, and continued:--

       *       *       *       *       *

This young cow, you see, she was very fond of her calf,--very fond
indeed she was,--and when they took it away from her, she was very
unhappy, and went about roaring all day long.There's a
piece of poetry about it that I learned once:--

    "'The lowing herd--'

do something or other, I don't remember what.""'The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,'"

quoted the grandmother, softly."Yarn, or a chain-pump like the
one in the yard, or what?""I don't know what you mean by _low_, Toto!"said the squirrel, without
noticing <DW53>'s remarks."Your cow roared so loud the other day that I
fell off her horn into the hay.I don't see anything _low_ in that.""Why, Cracker, can't you understand?""They _low_ when they
_moo_!I don't mean that they moo _low_, but'moo' _is_ 'low,' don't you
see?""No, I do _not_ see!""And I don't
believe there is anything _to_ see, I don't.At this point Madam interfered, and with a few gentle words made the
matter clear, and smoothed the ruffled feathers--or rather fur.The raccoon, who had been listening with ears pricked up, and keen eyes
glancing from one to the other of the disputants, now murmured, "Ah,
yes!and relapsed
into his former attitude of graceful and dignified ease.The squirrel repeated to himself, "Moo!several
times, shook his head, refreshed himself with a nut, and finally, at the
general request, continued his story:

       *       *       *       *       *

So, as I said, this young cow was very sad, and she looed--I mean
mowed--all day to express her grief.And she thought, "If I could only
know where my calf is, it would not be quite so dreadfully bad.But they
would not tell me where they were taking him, though I asked them
politely in seven different tones, which is more than any other cow here
can use."Now, when she was thinking these thoughts it chanced that the maid came
to milk the cows, and with the maid came a young man, who was talking
very earnestly to her."Doesn't thee know me well enough?""I knows a moon-calf when I sees him!"says the maid; and with that she
boxed his ears, and sat down to milk the cow, and he went away in a
huff.But the cow heard what the maid said, and began to wonder what
moon-calves were, and whether they were anything like her calf.Presently, when the maid had gone away with the pail of milk, she said
to the Oldest Ox, who happened to be standing near,--

"Old Ox, pray tell me, what is a moon-calf?"The Oldest Ox did not know anything about moon-calves, but he had no
idea of betraying his ignorance to anybody, much less to a very young
cow; so he answered promptly, "It's a calf that lives in the moon, of
course.""Is it--are they--like other calves?"inquired the cow, timidly, "or a
different sort of animal?""When a creature is called a calf," replied the Ox, severely, "it _is_ a
calf.If it were a cat, a hyena, or a toad with three tails, it would be
called by its own name.Then he shut his eyes and pretended to be asleep, for he did not like to
answer questions on matters of which he knew nothing; it fatigued his
brain, and oxen should always avoid fatigue of the brain.But the young cow had one more question to ask, and could not rest till
it was answered; so mustering all her courage, she said, desperately,
"Oh, Old Ox!before you go to sleep, please--_please_, tell me if people
ever take calves to the moon from here?"and in a few minutes he really was asleep.She thought so hard that when
the farmer's boy came to drive the cattle into the barn, she hardly saw
where she was going, but stumbled first against the door and then
against the wall, and finally walked into Old Brindle's stall instead of
her own, and got well prodded by the latter's horns in consequence."I must give her a warm mash,
and cut an inch or two off her tail to-morrow."Next day the cows were driven out into the pasture, for the weather was
warm, and they found it a pleasant change from the barn-yard.They
cropped the honey-clover, well seasoned with buttercups and with just
enough dandelions scattered about to "give it character," as Mother
Brindle said.They stood knee-deep in the cool, clear stream which
flowed under the willows, and lay down in the shade of the great
oak-tree, and altogether were as happy as cows can possibly be.She cared nothing for any of the pleasures
which she had once enjoyed so keenly; she only walked up and down, up
and down, thinking of her lost calf, and looking for the moon.For she
had fully made up her mind by this time that her darling Bossy had been
taken to the moon, and had become a moon-calf; and she was wondering
whether she might not see or hear something of him when the moon rose.The day passed, and when the evening was still all rosy in the west, a
great globe of shining silver rose up in the east.It was the full moon,
coming to take the place of the sun, who had put on his nightcap and
gone to bed.The young cow ran towards it, stretching out her neck, and
calling,--

"Bossy!Then she listened, and thought she heard a distant voice which said,
"There!"she cried, frantically, "I knew it!Bossy is now a
moon-calf.Something must be done about it at once, if I only knew
what!"And she ran to Mother Brindle, who was standing by the fence, talking to
the neighbor's black cow,--her with the spotted nose."Have you ever had a calf taken to the
moon?My calf, my Bossy, is there, and is now a moon-calf.tell me, how to get at him, I beseech you!"You are excited, and will injure your milk, and that would
reflect upon the whole herd.As for your calf, why should you be better
off than other people?I have lost ten calves, the finest that ever were
seen, and I never made half such a fuss about them as you make over this
puny little red creature.""But he is _there_, in the moon!""I must find him
and get him down."Decidedly, your wits must be in the moon, my dear," said the neighbor's
black cow, not unkindly.Who ever heard
of calves in the moon?Not I, for one; and I am not more ignorant than
others, perhaps."The red cow was about to reply, when suddenly across the meadow came
ringing the farm-boy's call, "Co, Boss!said Mother Brindle, "can it really be milking-time?And you,
child," she added, turning to the red cow, "come straight home with me.I heard James promise you a warm mash, and that will be the best thing
for you."But at these words the young cow started, and with a wild bellow ran to
the farthest end of the pasture.she cried, staring wildly up
at the silver globe, which was rising steadily higher and higher in the
sky, "you are going away from me!Jump down from the moon, and come to
your mother!_Come!_"

And then a distant voice, floating softly down through the air,
answered, "Come!"My darling calls me, and I go.I will
go to the moon; I will be a moon-cow!She ran forward like an antelope, gave a sudden leap into the air, and
went up, up, up,--over the haystacks, over the trees, over the
clouds,--up among the stars.in her frantic desire to reach the moon she overshot the
mark; jumped clear over it, and went down on the other side, nobody
knows where, and she never was seen or heard of again.And Mother Brindle, when she saw what had happened, ran straight home
and gobbled up the warm mash before any of the other cows could get
there, and ate so fast that she made herself ill.*       *       *       *       *

"That is the whole story," said the squirrel, seriously; "and it seemed
to me a very curious one, I confess.""But there's nothing about the others in
it,--the cat and fiddle, and the little dog, you know.""Well, they _weren't_ in it really, at all!"Cow ought to be a good judge of lies, I
should say.""What can be expected," said the raccoon loftily, "from a creature who
eats hay?Be good enough to hand me those nuts, Toto, will you?The
story has positively made me hungry,--a thing that has not happened--"

"Since dinner-time!""Wonderful indeed, <DW53>!But I shall
hand the nuts to Cracker first, for he has told us a very good story,
whether it is true or not."THE apples and nuts went round again and again, and for a few minutes
nothing was heard save the cracking of shells and the gnawing of sharp
white teeth.At length the parrot said, meditatively:--

"That was a very stupid cow, though!"Well, I don't think they are what you would call brilliant, as a rule,"
Toto admitted; "but they are generally good, and that is better.""That is probably why we have no
cows in Central Africa.Our animals being all, without exception, clever
_and_ good, there is really no place for creatures of the sort you
describe.""How about the bogghun, Miss Mary?"asked the raccoon, slyly, with a
wink at Toto.The parrot ruffled up her feathers, and was about to make a sharp reply;
but suddenly remembering the raccoon's brave defence of her an hour
before, she smoothed her plumage again, and replied gently,--

"I confess that I forgot the bogghun, <DW53>.It is indeed a treacherous
and a wicked creature!--a dark blot on the golden roll of African
animals."She paused and sighed, then added, as if to change the
subject, "But, come!If not, I
have a short one in mind, which I will tell you, if you wish."All assented joyfully, and Miss Mary, without more delay, related the
story of


THE THREE REMARKS.There was once a princess, the most beautiful princess that ever was
seen.Her hair was black and soft as the raven's wing [here the Crow
blinked, stood on one leg and plumed himself, evidently highly
flattered by the allusion]; her eyes were like stars dropped in a pool
of clear water, and her speech like the first tinkling cascade of the
baby Nile.She was also wise, graceful, and gentle, so that one would
have thought she must be the happiest princess in the world.No one knew whether it was the fault of her
nurse, or a peculiarity born with her; but the sad fact remained, that
no matter what was said to her, she could only reply in one of three
phrases.The first was,--

"What is the price of butter?"The second, "Has your grandmother sold her mangle yet?"And the third, "With all my heart!"You may well imagine what a great misfortune this was to a young and
lively princess.How could she join in the sports and dances of the
noble youths and maidens of the court?She could not always be silent,
neither could she always say, "With all my heart!"though this was her
favorite phrase, and she used it whenever she possibly could; and it was
not at all pleasant, when some gallant knight asked her whether she
would rather play croquet or Aunt Sally, to be obliged to reply, "What
is the price of butter?"On certain occasions, however, the princess actually found her infirmity
of service to her.She could always put an end suddenly to any
conversation that did not please her, by interposing with her first or
second remark; and they were also a very great assistance to her when,
as happened nearly every day, she received an offer of marriage.Emperors, kings, princes, dukes, earls, marquises, viscounts, baronets,
and many other lofty personages knelt at her feet, and offered her their
hands, hearts, and other possessions of greater or less value.But for
all her suitors the princess had but one answer.Fixing her deep radiant
eyes on them, she would reply with thrilling earnestness, "_Has_ your
grandmother sold her mangle yet?"and this always impressed the suitors
so deeply that they retired weeping to a neighboring monastery, where
they hung up their armor in the chapel, and taking the vows, passed the
remainder of their lives mostly in flogging themselves, wearing hair
shirts, and putting dry toast-crumbs in their beds.Now, when the king found that all his best nobles were turning into
monks, he was greatly displeased, and said to the princess:--

"My daughter, it is high time that all this nonsense came to an end.The
next time a respectable person asks you to marry him, you will say,
'With all my heart!'But this the princess could not endure, for she had never yet seen a man
whom she was willing to marry.Nevertheless, she feared her father's
anger, for she knew that he always kept his word; so that very night she
slipped down the back stairs of the palace, opened the back door, and
ran away out into the wide world.She wandered for many days, over mountain and moor, through fen and
through forest, until she came to a fair city.Here all the bells were
ringing, and the people shouting and flinging caps into the air; for
their old king was dead, and they were just about to crown a new one.The new king was a stranger, who had come to the town only the day
before; but as soon as he heard of the old monarch's death, he told the
people that he was a king himself, and as he happened to be without a
kingdom at that moment, he would be quite willing to rule over them.The
people joyfully assented, for the late king had left no heir; and now
all the preparations had been completed.The crown had been polished up,
and a new tip put on the sceptre, as the old king had quite spoiled it
by poking the fire with it for upwards of forty years.When the people saw the beautiful princess, they welcomed her with many
bows, and insisted on leading her before the new king."Who knows but that they may be related?""They both
came from the same direction, and both are strangers."Accordingly the princess was led to the market-place, where the king was
sitting in royal state.He had a fat, red, shining face, and did not
look like the kings whom she had been in the habit of seeing; but
nevertheless the princess made a graceful courtesy, and then waited to
hear what he would say.The new king seemed rather embarrassed when he saw that it was a
princess who appeared before him; but he smiled graciously, and said, in
a smooth oily voice,--

"I trust your 'Ighness is quite well.And 'ow did yer 'Ighness leave yer
pa and ma?"At these words the princess raised her head and looked fixedly at the
red-faced king; then she replied, with scornful distinctness,--

"What is the price of butter?"At these words an alarming change came over the king's face.The red
faded from it, and left it a livid green; his teeth chattered; his eyes
stared, and rolled in their sockets; while the sceptre dropped from his
trembling hand and fell at the princess's feet.For the truth was, this
was no king at all, but a retired butterman, who had laid by a little
money at his trade, and had thought of setting up a public house; but
chancing to pass through this city at the very time when they were
looking for a king, it struck him that he might just as well fill the
vacant place as any one else.No one had thought of his being an
impostor; but when the princess fixed her clear eyes on him and asked
him that familiar question, which he had been in the habit of hearing
many times a day for a great part of his life, the guilty butterman
thought himself detected, and shook in his guilty shoes.Hastily
descending from his throne, he beckoned he princess into a side-chamber,
and closing the door, besought her in moving terms not to betray him."Here," he said, "is a bag of rubies as big as pigeon's eggs.There are
six thousand of them, and I 'umbly beg your 'Ighness to haccept them as
a slight token hof my hesteem, if your 'Ighness will kindly consent to
spare a respeckable tradesman the disgrace of being hexposed."The princess reflected, and came to the conclusion that, after all, a
butterman might make as good a king as any one else; so she took the
rubies with a gracious little nod, and departed, while all the people
shouted, "Hooray!"and followed her, waving their hats and kerchiefs, to
the gates of the city.With her bag of rubies over her shoulder, the fair princess now pursued
her journey, and fared forward over heath and hill, through brake and
through brier.After several days she came to a deep forest, which she
entered without hesitation, for she knew no fear.She had not gone a
hundred paces under the arching limes, when she was met by a band of
robbers, who stopped her and asked what she did in their forest, and
what she carried in her bag.They were fierce, black-bearded men, armed
to the teeth with daggers, cutlasses, pistols, dirks, hangers,
blunderbusses, and other defensive weapons; but the princess gazed
calmly on them, and said haughtily,--

"Has your grandmother sold her mangle yet?"and here he and the whole band assumed attitudes of supplication.--PAGE
195.]The robbers started back in dismay, crying, "The
countersign!"Then they hastily lowered their weapons, and assuming
attitudes of abject humility, besought the princess graciously to
accompany them to their master's presence.With a lofty gesture she
signified assent, and the cringing, trembling bandits led her on through
the forest till they reached an open glade, into which the sunbeams
glanced right merrily.Here, under a broad oak-tree which stood in the
centre of the glade, reclined a man of gigantic stature and commanding
mien, with a whole armory of weapons displayed upon his person.Hastening to their chief, the robbers conveyed to him, in agitated
whispers, the circumstance of their meeting the princess, and of her
unexpected reply to their questions.Hardly seeming to credit their
statement, the gigantic chieftain sprang to his feet, and advancing
toward the princess with a respectful reverence, begged her to repeat
the remark which had so disturbed his men.With a royal air, and in
clear and ringing tones, the princess repeated,--

"_Has_ your grandmother sold her mangle yet?"and gazed steadfastly at
the robber chief.He turned deadly pale, and staggered against a tree, which alone
prevented him from falling.The enemy is without doubt
close at hand, and all is over.Yet," he added with more firmness, and
with an appealing glance at the princess, "yet there may be one chance
left for us.If this gracious lady will consent to go forward, instead
of returning through the wood, we may yet escape with our lives.and here he and the whole band assumed attitudes of
supplication, "consider, I pray you, whether it would really add to your
happiness to betray to the advancing army a few poor foresters, who earn
their bread by the sweat of their brow.Here," he continued, hastily
drawing something from a hole in the oak-tree, "is a bag containing ten
thousand sapphires, each as large as a pullet's egg.If you will
graciously deign to accept them, and to pursue your journey in the
direction I shall indicate, the Red Chief of the Rustywhanger will be
your slave forever."The princess, who of course knew that there was no army in the
neighborhood, and who moreover did not in the least care which way she
went, assented to the Red Chief's proposition, and taking the bag of
sapphires, bowed her farewell to the grateful robbers, and followed
their leader down a ferny path which led to the farther end of the
forest.When they came to the open country, the robber chieftain took
his leave of the princess, with profound bows and many protestations of
devotion, and returned to his band, who were already preparing to plunge
into the impenetrable thickets of the midforest.The princess, meantime, with her two bags of gems on her shoulders,
fared forward with a light heart, by dale and by down, through moss and
through meadow.By-and-by she came to a fair high palace, built all of
marble and shining jasper, with smooth lawns about it, and sunny gardens
of roses and gillyflowers, from which the air blew so sweet that it was
a pleasure to breathe it.The princess stood still for a moment, to
taste the sweetness of this air, and to look her fill at so fair a spot;
and as she stood there, it chanced that the palace-gates opened, and the
young king rode out with his court, to go a-catching of nighthawks.Now when the king saw a right fair princess standing alone at his
palace-gate, her rich garments dusty and travel-stained, and two heavy
sacks hung upon her shoulders, he was filled with amazement; and leaping
from his steed, like the gallant knight that he was, he besought her to
tell him whence she came and whither she was going, and in what way he
might be of service to her.But the princess looked down at her little dusty shoes, and answered
never a word; for she had seen at the first glance how fair and goodly a
king this was, and she would not ask him the price of butter, nor
whether his grandmother had sold her mangle yet.But she thought in her
heart, "Now, I have never, in all my life, seen a man to whom I would so
willingly say, 'With all my heart!'The king marvelled much at her silence, and presently repeated his
questions, adding, "And what do you carry so carefully in those two
sacks, which seem over-heavy for your delicate shoulders?"Still holding her eyes downcast, the princess took a ruby from one bag,
and a sapphire from the other, and in silence handed them to the king,
for she willed that he should know she was no beggar, even though her
shoes were dusty.Thereat all the nobles were filled with amazement, for
no such gems had ever been seen in that country.But the king looked steadfastly at the princess, and said, "Rubies are
fine, and sapphires are fair; but, maiden, if I could but see those
eyes of yours, I warrant that the gems would look pale and dull beside
them."At that the princess raised her clear dark eyes, and looked at the king
and smiled; and the glance of her eyes pierced straight to his heart, so
that he fell on his knees and cried:

"Ah!sweet princess, now do I know that thou art the love for whom I
have waited so long, and whom I have sought through so many lands.Give
me thy white hand, and tell me, either by word or by sign, that thou
wilt be my queen and my bride!"And the princess, like a right royal maiden as she was, looked him
straight in the eyes, and giving him her little white hand, answered
bravely, "_With all my heart!_"




CHAPTER XII.NOW, if we had looked into the hermit's cave a few days after this, we
should have seen a very pleasant sight.The good old man was sitting up
on his narrow couch, with his lame leg on a stool before him.On another
stool sat our worthy friend Bruin, with a backgammon-board on his knees,
and the two were deep in the mysteries of Russian backgammon."Dear, dear, what luck you do have!""Yes," said the hermit, "this finishes the game and the rubber.But just
remember, my friend, how you beat me yesterday.I was gammoned over and
over again, with never a doublet to save me from ruin."yesterday was one
of my good days.And so to-day you have gammoned me back again.I
suppose that is why the game is called back-gammon, hey?""And how have you been in the habit of playing?""You spoke of playing last winter, you know.Whom did you play with, for
example?""With myself," said the hermit,--"the right hand against the left.I
taught my crow the game once, but it didn't work very well.He could not
lift the dice-box, and could only throw the dice by running against the
box, and upsetting it.This was apt to disarrange the pieces, you see;
and as he would not trust me to throw for him, we gave it up.""And what else did you do in the way
of amusement?""I read, chiefly," replied the old man."You see I have a good many
books, and they are all good ones, which will bear reading many times.""That is _one_ thing about you people that I
cannot understand,--the reading of books.Seems so senseless, you know,
when you can use your eyes for other things.But, tell me," he added,
"have you never thought of trying our way of passing the winter?It is
certainly much the best way, when one is alone.Choose a comfortable
place, like this, for example, curl yourself up in the warmest corner,
and there you are, with nothing to do but to sleep till spring comes
again.""I am afraid I could not do that," said the hermit with a smile."We are
made differently, you see.I cannot sleep more than a few hours at a
time, at any season of the year.""That makes
all the difference, you know.Have you ever _tried_ sucking your paw?"The hermit was forced to admit that he never had.well, you really must try it some day," said Bruin."There is
nothing like it, after all.I will confess to you," he
added in a low tone, and looking cautiously about to make sure that they
were alone, "that I have missed it sadly this winter.In most respects
this has been the happiest season of my life, and I have enjoyed it more
than I can tell you; but still there are times,--when I am tired, you
know, or the weather is dull, or <DW53> is a little trying, as he is
sometimes,--times when I feel as if I would give a great deal for a
quiet corner where I could suck my paw and sleep for a week or two.""Couldn't you manage it, somehow?"asked the hermit, sympathetically."<DW53> thinks the Madam
would not like it.He is very genteel, you know,--very genteel indeed,
<DW53> is; and he says it wouldn't be at all 'the thing' for me to suck
my paw anywhere about the place.I never know just what 'thing' he means
when he says that, but it's a favorite expression of his; and he
certainly knows a great deal about good manners.Besides," he added,
more cheerfully, "there is always plenty of work to do, and that is the
best thing to keep one awake.Baldhead, it is time for your
dinner, sir; and here am I sitting and talking, when I ought to be
warming your broth!"With these words the excellent bear arose, put away the backgammon
board, and proceeded to build up the fire, hang the kettle, and put the
broth on to warm, all as deftly as if he had been a cook all his life.He stirred and tasted, shook his head, tasted again, and then said,--

"You haven't the top of a young pine-tree anywhere about the house, I
suppose?It would give this broth such a nice flavor.""I don't generally keep a
large stock of such things on hand.But I fancy the broth will be very
good without it, to judge from the last I had.""Do you ever put frogs in your
broth?""Whole ones, you know, rolled in a batter,
just like dumplings?""_No!_" said the hermit, quickly and decidedly."I am quite sure I
should not like them, thank you,--though it was very kind of you to make
the suggestion!"he added, seeing that Bruin looked disappointed."You have no idea how nice they are," said the good bear, rather sadly."But you are so strange, you people!I never could induce Toto or Madam
to try them, either.I invented the soup myself,--at least the
frog-dumpling part of it,--and made it one day as a little surprise for
them.But when I told them what the dumplings were, Toto choked and
rolled on the floor, and Madam was quite ill at the very thought, though
she had not begun to eat her soup.So <DW53> and Cracker and I had it all
to ourselves, and uncommonly good it was.It's a pity for people to be
so prejudiced."The good hermit was choking a little himself, for some reason or other,
but he looked very grave when Bruin turned toward him for assent, and
said, "Quite so!"The broth being now ready, the bear proceeded to arrange a tray neatly,
and set it before his patient, who took up his wooden spoon and fell to
with right good-will.The good bear stood watching him with great
satisfaction; and it was really a pity that there was no one there to
watch the bear himself, for as he stood there with a clean cloth over
his arm, his head on one side, and his honest face beaming with pride
and pleasure, he was very well worth looking at.At this moment a sharp cry of terror was heard outside, then a quick
whirr of wings, and the next moment the wood-pigeon darted into the
cave, closely pursued by a large hawk.She was quite
exhausted, and with one more piteous cry she fell fainting at Bruin's
feet.In another instant the hawk would have pounced upon her, but that
instant never came for the winged marauder.Instead, something or
somebody pounced on _him_.A thick white covering enveloped him,
entangling his claws, binding down his wings, well-nigh stifling him.He
felt himself seized in an iron grasp and lifted bodily into the air,
while a deep, stern voice exclaimed,--

"Now, sir!have you anything to say for yourself, before I wring your
neck?"Then the covering was drawn back from his head, and he found himself
face to face with the great bear, whom he knew perfectly well by sight.But he was a bold fellow, too well used to danger to shrink from it,
even in so terrible a form as this; and his fierce yellow eyes met the
stern gaze of his captor without shrinking.repeated the bear, "before I wring your ugly
neck?"replied the hawk, sullenly, "wring away."This answer rather disconcerted our friend Bruin, who, as he sometimes
said sadly to himself, had "lost all taste for killing;" so he only
shook Master Hawk a little, and said,--

"Do you know of any reason why your neck should _not_ be wrung?"Are you
afraid, you great clumsy monster?""I'll soon show you whether I am afraid or not!""If _you_ had had
nothing to eat for a week, you'd have eaten her long before this, I'll
be bound!"Here Bruin began to rub his nose with his disengaged paw, and to look
helplessly about him, as he always did when disturbed in mind.he exclaimed, "you hawk, what do you mean by that?"It _is_ rather short," said Bruin; "but--yes!why, of course, _any one_
can dig, if he wants to.""Ask that old thing," said the hawk, nodding toward the hermit, "whether
_he_ ever dug with his beak; and it's twice as long as mine."replied Bruin, promptly; but then he faltered, for
it suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen either Toto or the
Madam dig with their noses; and it was with some hesitation that he
asked:

"Mr.but--a--have you ever tried digging for roots
in the ground--with your beak--I mean, nose?"The hermit looked up gravely, as he sat with Pigeon Pretty on his knee."No, my friend," he said with great seriousness, "I have never tried
it, and doubt if I could do it.I can dig with my hands, though," he
added, seeing the good bear look more and more puzzled."But you see this bird has no hands, though he
has very ugly claws; so that doesn't help-- Well!"he cried, breaking
off short, and once more addressing the hawk."I don't see anything for
it _but_ to wring your neck, do you?After all, it will keep you from
being hungry again."But here the soft voice of the wood-pigeon interposed.Bruin,
dear," cried the gentle bird."Give him something to eat, and let him
go.If he had eaten nothing for a week, I am sure he was not to blame
for pursuing the first eatable creature he saw.Remember," she added in
a lower tone, which only the bear could hear, "that before this winter,
any of us would have done the same."Bruin scratched his head helplessly; the hawk turned his yellow eyes on
Pigeon Pretty with a strange look, but said nothing.But now the hermit
saw that it was time for him to interfere."Pigeon Pretty," he said, "you are right, as usual.Bruin, my friend,
bring your prisoner here, and let him finish this excellent broth, into
which I have crumbled some bread.I will answer for Master Hawk's good
behavior, for the present at least," he added, "for I know that he comes
of an old and honorable family."In five minutes the hawk was sitting quietly on the
hermit's knee, sipping broth, pursuing the floating bits of bread in the
bowl, and submitting to have his soft black plumage stroked, with the
best grace in the world.On the good man's other knee sat Pigeon Pretty,
now quite recovered from her fright and fatigue, her soft eyes beaming
with pleasure; while Bruin squatted opposite them, looking from one to
the other, and assuring himself over and over again that Pigeon Pretty
was "a most astonishing bird!'pon my word, a _most_ astonishing bird!"His meal ended, the stranger wiped his beak politely on his feathers,
plumed himself, and thanked his hosts for their hospitality, with a
stately courtesy which contrasted strangely with his former sullen and
ferocious bearing.The fierce glare was gone from his eyes, which were,
however, still strangely bright; and with his glossy plumage smooth, and
his head held proudly erect, he really was a noble-looking bird."Long is it, indeed," he said, "since any one has spoken a kind word to
Ger-Falcon.It will not be forgotten, I assure you.We are a wild and
lawless family,--our beak against every one, and every one's claw
against us,--and yet, as you observed, Sir Baldhead, we are an old and
honorable race.for the brave, brave days of old, when my sires
were the honored companions of kings and princes!My grandfather seventy
times removed was served by an emperor, the obsequious monarch carrying
him every day on his own wrist to the hunting.He ate from a golden
dish, and wore a collar of gems about his neck.what would be
the feelings of that noble ancestor if he could see his descendant a
hunted outlaw, persecuted by the sons of those very men who once courted
and caressed him, and supporting a precarious existence by the ignoble
spoils of barn-yards and hen-roosts!"The hawk paused, overcome by these recollections of past glory, and the
good bear said kindly,--

"Dear!And how did this melancholy change come
about, pray?"replied the hawk, "ignoble fashion!The race of
men degenerated, and occupied themselves with less lofty sports than
hawking.My family, left to themselves, knew not what to do.They had
been trained to pursue, to overtake, to slay, through long generations;
they were unfitted for anything else.But when they began to lead this
life on their own account, man, always ungrateful, turned upon them, and
persecuted them for the very deeds which had once been the delight and
pride of his fickle race.So we fell from our high estate, lower and
lower, till the present representative of the Ger-Falcon is the poor
creature you behold before you."The hawk bowed in proud humility, and his hearers all felt, perhaps,
much more sorry for him than he deserved.The wood-pigeon was about to
ask something more about his famous ancestors, when a shadow darkened
the mouth of the cave, and Toto made his appearance, with the crow
perched on his shoulder.he cried in his fresh, cheery voice, "how are you
to-day, sir?And catching sight of the stranger, he stopped short, and looked at the
bear for an explanation.Ger-Falcon, Toto," said Bruin.Toto nodded, and the hawk made him a stately bow; but the two
looked distrustfully at each other, and neither seemed inclined to make
any advances.Bruin continued,--

"Mr.Falcon came here in a--well, not in a friendly way at all, I must
say.But he is in a very different frame of mind, now, and I trust there
will be no further trouble.""Do you ever change your name, sir?"asked Toto, abruptly, addressing
the hawk."I have
no reason to be ashamed of my name.""And yet I am tolerably sure that Mr.Ger-Falcon is no other than Mr.Chicken Hawkon, and that it was he who
tried to carry off my Black Spanish chickens yesterday morning."I was
starving, and the chickens presented themselves to me wholly in the
light of food.May I ask for what purpose you keep chickens, sir?""Why, we eat them when they grow up," said Toto; "but--"

"Ah, precisely!""But we don't steal other people's chickens," said the boy, "we eat our
own.""You eat the tame, confiding
creatures who feed from your hand, and stretch their necks trustfully to
meet their doom.I, on the contrary, when the pangs of hunger force me
to snatch a morsel of food to save me from starvation, snatch it from
strangers, not from my friends."Toto was about to make a hasty reply, but the bear, with a motion of his
paw, checked him, and said gravely to the hawk,--

"Come, come!Falcon, I cannot have any dispute of this kind.There
is some truth in what you say, and I have no doubt that emperors and
other disreputable people have had a large share in forming the bad
habits into which you and all your family have fallen.But those habits
must be changed, sir, if you intend to remain in this forest.You must
not meddle with Toto's chickens; you must not chase quiet and harmless
birds.You must, in short, become a respectable and law-abiding bird,
instead of a robber and a murderer.""But how am I to live, pray?I
can be'respectable,' as you call it, in summer; but in weather like
this--"

"That can be easily managed," said the kind hermit."You can stay with
me, Falcon.I shall soon be able to shift for myself, and I will gladly
undertake to feed you until the snow and frost are gone.You will be a
companion for my crow-- By the way, where is my crow?Surely he came in
with you, Toto?""He did," said Toto, "but he hopped off the moment we entered.Didn't
like the looks of the visitor, I fancy," he added in a low tone.Search was made, and finally the crow was discovered huddled together, a
disconsolate little bunch of black feathers, in the darkest corner of
the cave.cried Toto, who was the first to catch sight of him.Why are you rumpling and humping yourself up in that
absurd fashion?"asked the crow, opening one eye a very little way, and
lifting his head a fraction of an inch from the mass of feathers in
which it was buried."Good Toto, kind Toto, is he gone?I would not be
eaten to-day, Toto, if it could be avoided."If you mean the hawk," said Toto, "he is _not_ gone; and what is more,
he isn't going, for your master has asked him to stay the rest of the
winter.Bruin has bound him
over to keep the peace, and you must come out and make the best of it."The unhappy crow begged and protested, but all in vain.Toto caught him
up, laughing, and carried him to his master, who set him on his knee,
and smoothed his rumpled plumage kindly.The hawk, who was highly
gratified by the hermit's invitation, put on his most gracious manner,
and soon convinced the crow that he meant him no harm."A member of the ancient family of Corvus!""Contemporaries, and probably friends, of the early Falcons.Let us also
be friends, dear sir; and let the names of James Crow and Ger-Falcon go
down together to posterity."But now Bruin and Pigeon Pretty were eager to hear all the home news
from the cottage.They listened with breathless interest to Toto's
account of the attempted robbery, and of <DW53>'s noble "defence of the
castle," as the boy called it.Miss Mary also received her full share of
the credit, nor was the kettle excluded from honorable mention.When all
was told, Toto proceeded to unpack the basket he had brought, which
contained gingerbread, eggs, apples, and a large can of butter-milk
marked "For Bruin."Many were the joyous exclamations called forth by
this present of good cheer; and it seemed as if the old hermit could not
sufficiently express his gratitude to Toto and his good grandmother.cried the boy, half distressed by the oft-repeated thanks."If you only knew how we _like_ it!Besides,"
he added, "I want you to do something for _me_ now, Mr.Baldhead, so
that will turn the tables.A shower is coming up, and it is early yet,
so I need not go home for an hour.So, will you not tell us a story?We
are very fond of stories,--Bruin and Pigeon Pretty and I.""With all my heart, dear
lad!"I have not heard a fairy story
for a long time."said the hermit, after a moment's reflection."When I was a
boy like you, Toto, I lived in Ireland, the very home of the fairy-folk;
so I know more about them than most people, perhaps, and this is an
Irish fairy story that I am going to tell you."And settling himself comfortably on his moss-pillows, the hermit began
the story of--




CHAPTER XIII."'It's Green Men, it's Green Men,
        All in the wood together;
      And, oh!we're feared o' the Green Men
        In all the sweet May weather,'--


"ON'Y I'm _not_ feared o' thim mesilf!"said Eileen, breaking off her
song with a little merry laugh."Wouldn't I be plazed to meet wan o'
thim this day, in the wud!Sure, it 'ud be the lookiest day o' me
loife."She parted the boughs, and entered the deep wood, where she was to
gather <DW19>s for her mother.Holding up her blue apron carefully, the
little girl stepped lightly here and there, picking up the dry brown
sticks, and talking to herself all the while,--to keep herself company,
as she thought."Thin I makes a low curchy," she was saying, "loike that wan Mother made
to the lord's lady yistherday, and the Green Man he gi'es me a nod,
and--

"'What's yer name, me dear?'"'Eileen Macarthy, yer Honor's Riverence!'I mustn't say
'Riverence,' bekase he's not a priest, ava'.'Yer Honor's Grace' wud do
better."'And what wud ye loike for a prisint, Eily?'"And thin I'd say--lit me see!A big green grasshopper, caught be his leg
in a spider's wib.Wait a bit, poor crathur, oi'll lit ye free agin."Full of pity for the poor grasshopper, Eily stooped to lift it carefully
out of the treacherous net into which it had fallen.But what was her
amazement on perceiving that the creature was not a grasshopper, but a
tiny man, clad from head to foot in light green, and with a scarlet cap
on his head.The little fellow was hopelessly entangled in the net, from
which he made desperate efforts to free himself, but the silken strands
were quite strong enough to hold him prisoner.For a moment Eileen stood petrified with amazement, murmuring to
herself, "Howly Saint Bridget!Sure, I niver
thought I'd find wan really in loife!"but the next moment her kindness
of heart triumphed over her fear, and stooping once more she very gently
took the little man up between her thumb and finger, pulled away the
clinging web, and set him respectfully on the top of a large toadstool
which stood conveniently near.The little Green Man shook himself, dusted his jacket with his red cap,
and then looked up at Eileen with twinkling eyes."Ye have saved my life, and ye
shall not be the worse for it, if ye _did_ take me for a grasshopper."Eily was rather abashed at this, but the little man looked very kind; so
she plucked up her courage, and when he asked, "What is yer name, my
dear?"("jist for all the wurrld the way I thought of," she said to
herself) answered bravely, with a low courtesy, "Eileen Macarthy, yer
Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!"and then she added, "They calls me
Eily, most times, at home.""Well, Eily," said the Green Man, "I suppose ye know who I am?""A fairy, plaze yer Honor's Grace!""Sure, I've aften heerd av yer Honor's people, but I niver thought I'd
see wan of yez.It's rale plazed I am, sure enough.Manny's the time
Docthor O'Shaughnessy's tell't me there was no sich thing as yez; but I
niver belaved him, yer Honor!"said the Green Man, heartily, "that's very right.And now, Eily, alanna, I'm going to do ye a
fairy's turn before I go.Ye shall have yer wish of whatever ye like in
the world.Take a minute to think about it, and then make up yer mind."Her dreams had then come true; she was to
have a fairy wish!Eily had all the old fairy-stories at her tongue's end, for her
mother told her one every night as she sat at her spinning.Jack and the
Beanstalk, the Sleeping Beauty, the Seven Swans, the Elves that stole
Barney Maguire, the Brown Witch, and the Widdy Malone's Pig,--she knew
them all, and scores of others besides.Her mother always began the
stories with, "Wanst upon a time, and a very good time it was;" or,
"Long, long ago, whin King O'Toole was young, and the praties grew all
ready biled in the ground;" or, "Wan fine time, whin the fairies danced,
and not a poor man lived in Ireland."In this way, the fairies seemed
always to be thrown far back into a remote past, which had nothing in
common with the real work-a-day world in which Eily lived.But now--oh,
wonder of wonders!--now, here was a real fairy, alive and active, with
as full power of blessing or banning as if the days of King O'Toole had
come again,--and what was more, with good-will to grant to Eileen
Macarthy whatever in the wide world she might wish for!The child stood
quite still, with her hands clasped, thinking harder than she had ever
thought in all her life before; and the Green Man sat on the toadstool
and watched her, with eyes which twinkled with some amusement, but no
malice."Take yer time, my dear," he said, "take yer time!Ye'll not meet a
Green Man every day, so make the best o' your chance!"Suddenly Eily's face lighted up with a sudden inspiration.she
cried, "sure I have it, yer Riverence's Grace--Honor, I shud say!it's the di'monds and pearrls I'll have, iv ye plaze!"repeated the fairy, "what diamonds and pearls?You don't want them _all_, surely?""Och, no, yer Honor!""Only wan of aich to dhrop out o' me
mouth ivery time I shpake, loike the girrl
