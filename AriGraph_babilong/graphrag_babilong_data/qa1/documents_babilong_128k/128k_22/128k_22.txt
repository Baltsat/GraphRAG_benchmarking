Belden made the best of the situation, and pressing me to enter
also, devoted herself to hospitality.Monell, he quite
blossomed out in his endeavors to make himself agreeable; so much so,
that I shortly found myself laughing at his sallies, though my heart was
full of anxiety lest, after all, our efforts should fail of the success
they certainly merited.Belden softened more and more,
joining in the conversation with an ease hardly to be expected from one
in her humble circumstances.Indeed, I soon saw she was no common woman.There was a refinement in her speech and manner, which, combined with
her motherly presence and gentle air, was very pleasing.The last woman
in the world to suspect of any underhanded proceeding, if she had not
shown a peculiar hesitation when Mr.Monell broached the subject of my
entertainment there."I don't know, sir; I would be glad, but," and she turned a very
scrutinizing look upon me, "the fact is, I have not taken lodgers of
late, and I have got out of the way of the whole thing, and am afraid I
cannot make him comfortable.In short, you will have to excuse me.""What, entice a fellow into a room
like this"--and he cast a hearty admiring glance round the apartment
which, for all its simplicity, both its warm coloring and general air of
cosiness amply merited, "and then turn a cold shoulder upon him when he
humbly entreats the honor of staying a single night in the enjoyment
of its attractions?Belden; I know you too well for that.Lazarus himself couldn't come to your door and be turned away; much less
a good-hearted, clever-headed young gentleman like my friend here.""You are very good," she began, an almost weak love of praise showing
itself for a moment in her eyes; "but I have no room prepared.I have
been house-cleaning, and everything is topsy-turvy Mrs.Wright, now,
over the way----"

"My young friend is going to stop here," Mr.Mouell broke in, with frank
positiveness."If I cannot have him at my own house,--and for certain
reasons it is not advisable,--I shall at least have the satisfaction of
knowing he is in the charge of the best housekeeper in R----.""Yes," I put in, but without too great a show of interest; "I should be
sorry, once introduced here, to be obliged to go elsewhere."The troubled eye wavered away from us to the door."I was never called inhospitable," she commenced; "but everything in
such disorder."I was in hopes I might remain now," I replied; "I have some letters
to write, and ask nothing better than for leave to sit here and write
them."At the word letters I saw her hand go to her pocket in a movement which
must have been involuntary, for her countenance did not change, and she
made the quick reply:

"Well, you may.If you can put up with such poor accommodations as I can
offer, it shall not be said I refused you what Mr.Monell is pleased to
call a favor."And, complete in her reception as she had been in her resistance, she
gave us a pleasant smile, and, ignoring my thanks, bustled out with Mr.Monell to the buggy, where she received my bag and what was, doubtless,
more to her taste, the compliments he was now more than ever ready to
bestow upon her."I will see that a room is got ready for you in a very short space of
time," she said, upon re-entering."Meanwhile, make yourself at home
here; and if you wish to write, why I think you will find everything for
the purpose in these drawers."And wheeling up a table to the easy chair
in which I sat, she pointed to the small compartments beneath, with
an air of such manifest desire to have me make use of anything and
everything she had, that I found myself wondering over my position with
a sort of startled embarrassment that was not remote from shame."Thank you; I have materials of my own," said I, and hastened to open my
bag and bring out the writing-case, which I always carried with me."Then I will leave you," said she; and with a quick bend and a short,
hurried look out of the window, she hastily quitted the room.I could hear her steps cross the hall, go up two or three stairs, pause,
go up the rest of the flight, pause again, and then pass on.I was left
on the first floor alone.A WEIRD EXPERIENCE


    "Flat burglary as ever was committed."THE first thing I did was to inspect with greater care the room in which
I sat.It was a pleasant apartment, as I have already said; square, sunny, and
well furnished.On the floor was a crimson carpet, on the walls several
pictures, at the windows, cheerful curtains of white, tastefully
ornamented with ferns and autumn leaves; in one corner an old melodeon,
and in the centre of the room a table draped with a bright cloth, on
which were various little knick-knacks which, without being rich or
expensive, were both pretty and, to a certain extent, ornamental.But
it was not these things, which I had seen repeated in many other country
homes, that especially attracted my attention, or drew me forward in the
slow march which I now undertook around the room.It was the something
underlying all these, the evidences which I found, or sought to find,
not only in the general aspect of the room, but in each trivial object
I encountered, of the character, disposition, and history of the woman
with whom I now had to deal.It was for this reason I studied the
daguerreotypes on the mantel-piece, the books on the shelf, and the
music on the rack; for this and the still further purpose of noting if
any indications were to be found of there being in the house any such
person as Hannah.First then, for the little library, which I was pleased to see occupied
one corner of the room.Composed of a few well-chosen books, poetical,
historical, and narrative, it was of itself sufficient to account
for the evidences of latent culture observable in Mrs.Taking out a well-worn copy of _Byron,_ I opened it.There
were many passages marked, and replacing the book with a mental comment
upon her evident impressibility to the softer emotions, I turned towards
the melodeon fronting me from the opposite wall.It was closed, but on
its neatly-covered top lay one or two hymn-books, a basket of russet
apples, and a piece of half-completed knitting work.I took up the latter, but was forced to lay it down again without a
notion for what it was intended.Proceeding, I next stopped before
a window opening upon the small yard that ran about the house, and
separated it from the one adjoining.The scene without failed to attract
me, but the window itself drew my attention, for, written with a diamond
point on one of the panes, I perceived a row of letters which, as
nearly as I could make out, were meant for some word or words, but which
utterly failed in sense or apparent connection.Passing it by as the
work of some school-girl, I glanced down at the work-basket standing on
a table at my side.It was full of various kinds of work, among which I
spied a pair of stockings, which were much too small, as well as in too
great a state of disrepair, to belong to Mrs.Belden; and drawing them
carefully out, I examined them for any name on them.Do not start when I
say I saw the letter H plainly marked upon them.Thrusting them back,
I drew a deep breath of relief, gazing, as I did so, out of the window,
when those letters again attracted my attention.Idly I began to read them backward, when--But try
for yourself, reader, and judge of my surprise!Elate at the discovery
thus made, I sat down to write my letters.I had barely finished them,
when Mrs.Belden came in with the announcement that supper was ready."As for your room," said she, "I have prepared my own room for your use,
thinking you would like to remain on the first floor."And, throwing
open a door at my side, she displayed a small, but comfortable room,
in which I could dimly see a bed, an immense bureau, and a shadowy
looking-glass in a dark, old-fashioned frame."I live in very primitive fashion," she resumed, leading the way into
the dining-room; "but I mean to be comfortable and make others so.""I should say you amply succeeded," I rejoined, with an appreciative
glance at her well-spread board.She smiled, and I felt I had paved the way to her good graces in a way
that would yet redound to my advantage.its dainties, its pleasant freedom, its
mysterious, pervading atmosphere of unreality, and the constant sense
which every bountiful dish she pressed upon me brought of the shame of
eating this woman's food with such feelings of suspicion in my heart!Shall I ever forget the emotion I experienced when I first perceived
she had something on her mind, which she longed, yet hesitated, to give
utterance to!Or how she started when a cat jumped from the sloping roof
of the kitchen on to the grass-plot at the back of the house; or how my
heart throbbed when I heard, or thought I heard, a board creak overhead!We were in a long and narrow room which seemed, curiously enough, to run
crosswise of the house, opening on one side into the parlor, and on the
other into the small bedroom, which had been allotted to my use."You live in this house alone, without fear?"Belden,
contrary to my desire, put another bit of cold chicken on my plate."Have you no marauders in this town: no tramps, of whom a solitary woman
like you might reasonably be afraid?""No one will hurt me," said she; "and no one ever came here for food or
shelter but got it.""I should think, then, that living as you do, upon a railroad, you would
be constantly overrun with worthless beings whose only trade is to take
all they can get without giving a return."It is the only luxury I have: to feed the
poor.""But the idle, restless ones, who neither will work, nor let others
work----"

"Are still the poor."Mentally remarking, here is the woman to shield an unfortunate who has
somehow become entangled in the meshes of a great crime, I drew back
from the table.As I did so, the thought crossed me that, in case
there was any such person in the house as Hannah, she would take the
opportunity of going up-stairs with something for her to eat; and that
she might not feel hampered by my presence, I stepped out on the veranda
with my cigar.While smoking it, I looked about for Q. I felt that the least token
of his presence in town would be very encouraging at this time.But it
seemed I was not to be afforded even that small satisfaction.If Q was
anywhere near, he was lying very low.Belden (who I know came down-stairs with an
empty plate, for going into the kitchen for a drink, I caught her in
the act of setting it down on the table), I made up my mind to wait a
reasonable length of time for what she had to say; and then, if she did
not speak, make an endeavor on my own part to surprise her secret.But her avowal was nearer and of a different nature from what I
expected, and brought its own train of consequences with it."You are a lawyer, I believe," she began, taking down her knitting work,
with a forced display of industry."Yes," I said; "that is my profession."She remained for a moment silent, creating great havoc in her work I am
sure, from the glance of surprise and vexation she afterwards threw it.Then, in a hesitating voice, remarked:

"Perhaps you may be willing, then, to give me some advice.The truth is,
I am in a very curious predicament; one from which I don't know how to
escape, and yet which demands immediate action.I should like to tell
you about it; may I?""You may; I shall be only too happy to give you any advice in my power."She drew in her breath with a sort of vague relief, though her forehead
did not lose its frown."It can all be said in a few words.I have in my possession a package of
papers which were intrusted to me by two ladies, with the understanding
that I should neither return nor destroy them without the full
cognizance and expressed desire of both parties, given in person or
writing.That they were to remain in my hands till then, and that
nothing or nobody should extort them from me.""That is easily understood," said I; for she stopped."But, now comes word from one of the ladies, the one, too, most
interested in the matter, that, for certain reasons, the immediate
destruction of those papers is necessary to her peace and safety.""And do you want to know what your duty is in this case?"I could not help it: a flood of conjectures rushing in tumult
over me."It is to hold on to the papers like grim death till released from your
guardianship by the combined wish of both parties."Once pledged in that way, you have no choice.It
would be a betrayal of trust to yield to the solicitations of one party
what you have undertaken to return to both.The fact that grief or loss
might follow your retention of these papers does not release you from
your bond.You have nothing to do with that; besides, you are by no
means sure that the representations of the so-called interested party
are true.You might be doing a greater wrong, by destroying in this way,
what is manifestly considered of value to them both, than by preserving
the papers intact, according to compact."Circumstances alter cases; and in short, it
seems to me that the wishes of the one most interested ought to be
regarded, especially as there is an estrangement between these ladies
which may hinder the other's consent from ever being obtained.""No," said I; "two wrongs never make a right; nor are we at liberty to
do an act of justice at the expense of an injustice.The papers must be
preserved, Mrs.Her head sank very despondingly; evidently it had been her wish to
please the interested party."Law is very hard," she said; "very hard.""This is not only law, but plain duty," I remarked."Suppose a case
different; suppose the honor and happiness of the other party depended
upon the preservation of the papers; where would your duty be then?""But----"

"A contract is a contract," said I, "and cannot be tampered with.Having
accepted the trust and given your word, you are obliged to fulfil, to
the letter, all its conditions.It would be a breach of trust for you to
return or destroy the papers without the mutual consent necessary."An expression of great gloom settled slowly over her features."I
suppose you are right," said she, and became silent.Watching her, I thought to myself, "If I were Mr.Gryce, or even Q, I
would never leave this seat till I had probed this matter to the bottom,
learned the names of the parties concerned, and where those precious
papers are hidden, which she declares to be of so much importance."But
being neither, I could only keep her talking upon the subject until
she should let fall some word that might serve as a guide to my further
enlightenment; I therefore turned, with the intention of asking her
some question, when my attention was attracted by the figure of a woman
coming out of the back-door of the neighboring house, who, for general
dilapidation and uncouthness of bearing, was a perfect type of the style
of tramp of whom we had been talking at the supper table.Gnawing a
crust which she threw away as she reached the street, she trudged down
the path, her scanty dress, piteous in its rags and soil, flapping in
the keen spring wind, and revealing ragged shoes red with the mud of the
highway."There is a customer that may interest you," said I.

Mrs.Belden seemed to awake from a trance.Rising slowly, she looked
out, and with a rapidly softening gaze surveyed the forlorn creature
before her.she muttered; "but I cannot do much for her to-night.A
good supper is all I can give her."And, going to the front door, she bade her step round the house to the
kitchen, where, in another moment, I heard the rough creature's voice
rise in one long "Bless you!"that could only have been produced by the
setting before her of the good things with which Mrs.Belden's larder
seemed teeming.After a decent length of time,
employed as I should judge in mastication, I heard her voice rise once
more in a plea for shelter."The barn, ma'am, or the wood-house.Any place where I can lie out of
the wind."And she commenced a long tale of want and disease, so piteous
to hear that I was not at all surprised when Mrs.Belden told me,
upon re-entering, that she had consented, notwithstanding her previous
determination, to allow the woman to lie before the kitchen fire for the
night."She has such an honest eye," said she; "and charity is my only luxury."The interruption of this incident effectually broke up our conversation.Belden went up-stairs, and for some time I was left alone to ponder
over what I had heard, and determine upon my future course of action.I
had just reached the conclusion that she would be fully as liable to
be carried away by her feelings to the destruction of the papers in her
charge, as to be governed by the rules of equity I had laid down to her,
when I heard her stealthily descend the stairs and go out by the front
door.Distrustful of her intentions, I took up my hat and hastily
followed her.She was on her way down the main street, and my first
thought was, that she was bound for some neighbor's house or perhaps for
the hotel itself; but the settled swing into which she soon altered her
restless pace satisfied me that she had some distant goal in prospect;
and before long I found myself passing the hotel with its appurtenances,
even the little schoolhouse, that was the last building at this end of
the village, and stepping out into the country beyond.But still her fluttering figure hasted on, the outlines of her form,
with its close shawl and neat bonnet, growing fainter and fainter in the
now settled darkness of an April night; and still I followed, walking on
the turf at the side of the road lest she should hear my footsteps and
look round.Over this I could hear her
pass, and then every sound ceased.She had paused, and was evidently
listening.It would not do for me to pause too, so gathering myself into
as awkward a shape as possible, I sauntered by her down the road, but
arrived at a certain point, stopped, and began retracing my steps with a
sharp lookout for her advancing figure, till I had arrived once more at
the bridge.Convinced now that she had discovered my motive for being in her house
and, by leading me from it, had undertaken to supply Hannah with an
opportunity for escape, I was about to hasten back to the charge I had
so incautiously left, when a strange sound heard at my left arrested me.It came from the banks of the puny stream which ran under the bridge,
and was like the creaking of an old door on worn-out hinges.Leaping the fence, I made my way as best I could down the sloping field
in the direction from which the sound came.It was quite dark, and my
progress was slow; so much so, that I began to fear I had ventured upon
a wild-goose chase, when an unexpected streak of lightning shot across
the sky, and by its glare I saw before me what seemed, in the momentary
glimpse I had of it, an old barn.From the rush of waters near at hand,
I judged it to be somewhere on the edge of the stream, and consequently
hesitated to advance, when I heard the sound of heavy breathing near me,
followed by a stir as of some one feeling his way over a pile of loose
boards; and presently, while I stood there, a faint blue light flashed
up from the interior of the barn, and I saw, through the tumbled-down
door that faced me, the form of Mrs.Belden standing with a lighted
match in her hand, gazing round on the four walls that encompassed her.Hardly daring to breathe, lest I should alarm her, I watched her while
she turned and peered at the roof above her, which was so old as to be
more than half open to the sky, at the flooring beneath, which was in
a state of equal dilapidation, and finally at a small tin box which she
drew from under her shawl and laid on the ground at her feet.The sight
of that box at once satisfied me as to the nature of her errand.She was
going to hide what she dared not destroy; and, relieved upon this point,
I was about to take a step forward when the match went out in her hand.While she was engaged in lighting another, I considered that perhaps it
would be better for me not to arouse her apprehensions by accosting her
at this time, and thus endanger the success of my main scheme; but
to wait till she was gone, before I endeavored to secure the box.Accordingly I edged my way up to the side of the barn and waited till
she should leave it, knowing that if I attempted to peer in at the
door, I ran great risk of being seen, owing to the frequent streaks of
lightning which now flashed about us on every side.Minute after minute
went by, with its weird alternations of heavy darkness and sudden
glare; and still she did not come.At last, just as I was about to start
impatiently from my hiding-place, she reappeared, and began to withdraw
with faltering steps toward the bridge.When I thought her quite out of
hearing, I stole from my retreat and entered the barn.It was of course
as dark as Erebus, but thanks to being a smoker I was as well provided
with matches as she had been, and having struck one, I held it up; but
the light it gave was very feeble, and as I did not know just where to
look, it went out before I had obtained more than a cursory glimpse of
the spot where I was.I thereupon lit another; but though I confined my
attention to one place, namely, the floor at my feet, it too went out
before I could conjecture by means of any sign seen there where she had
hidden the box.I now for the first time realized the difficulty before
me.She had probably made up her mind, before she left home, in just
what portion of this old barn she would conceal her treasure; but I had
nothing to guide me: I could only waste matches.A
dozen had been lit and extinguished before I was so much as sure the box
was not under a pile of debris that lay in one corner, and I had taken
the last in my hand before I became aware that one of the broken boards
of the floor was pushed a little out of its proper position.and that board was to be raised, the space beneath examined, and the
box, if there, lifted safely out.I concluded not to waste my resources,
so kneeling down in the darkness, I groped for the board, tried it, and
found it to be loose.Wrenching at it with all my strength, I tore it
free and cast it aside; then lighting my match looked into the hole thus
made.Something, I could not tell what, stone or box, met my eye, but
while I reached for it, the match flew out of my hand.Deploring my
carelessness, but determined at all hazards to secure what I had seen,
I dived down deep into the hole, and in another moment had the object of
my curiosity in my hands.Satisfied at this result of my efforts, I turned to depart, my one wish
now being to arrive home before Mrs.She had
several minutes the start of me; I would have to pass her on the road,
and in so doing might be recognized.Regaining the highway, I started at a brisk pace.For some little
distance I kept it up, neither overtaking nor meeting any one.But
suddenly, at a turn in the road, I came unexpectedly upon Mrs.Belden,
standing in the middle of the path, looking back.Somewhat disconcerted,
I hastened swiftly by her, expecting her to make some effort to stop me.Indeed, I doubt now if she even saw
or heard me.Astonished at this treatment, and still more surprised
that she made no attempt to follow me, I looked back, when I saw what
enchained her to the spot, and made her so unmindful of my presence.The
barn behind us was on fire!Instantly I realized it was the work of my hands; I had dropped a
half-extinguished match, and it had fallen upon some inflammable
substance.Aghast at the sight, I paused in my turn, and stood staring.Higher and
higher the red flames mounted, brighter and brighter glowed the clouds
above, the stream beneath; and in the fascination of watching it all,
I forgot Mrs.But a short, agitated gasp in my vicinity soon
recalled her presence to my mind, and drawing nearer, I heard her
exclaim like a person speaking in a dream, "Well, I didn't mean to do
it"; then lower, and with a certain satisfaction in her tone, "But it's
all right, any way; the thing is lost now for good, and Mary will be
satisfied without any one being to blame."I did not linger to hear more; if this was the conclusion she had come
to, she would not wait there long, especially as the sound of distant
shouts and running feet announced that a crowd of village boys was on
its way to the scene of the conflagration.The first thing I did, upon my arrival at the house, was to assure
myself that no evil effects had followed my inconsiderate desertion of
it to the mercies of the tramp she had taken in; the next to retire to
my room, and take a peep at the box.I found it to be a neat tin coffer,
fastened with a lock.Satisfied from its weight that it contained
nothing heavier than the papers of which Mrs.Belden had spoken, I hid
it under the bed and returned to the sitting-room.I had barely taken a
seat and lifted a book when Mrs.cried she, taking off her bonnet and revealing a face much
flushed with exercise, but greatly relieved in expression; "this _is_
a night!It lightens, and there is a fire somewhere down street, and
altogether it is perfectly dreadful out.I hope you have not been
lonesome," she continued, with a keen searching of my face which I
bore in the best way I could."I had an errand to attend to, but didn't
expect to stay so long."I returned some nonchalant reply, and she hastened from the room to
fasten up the house.I waited, but she did not come back; fearful, perhaps, of betraying
herself, she had retired to her own apartment, leaving me to take care
of myself as best I might.I own that I was rather relieved at this.The
fact is, I did not feel equal to any more excitement that night, and was
glad to put off further action until the next day.As soon, then, as
the storm was over, I myself went to bed, and, after several ineffectual
efforts, succeeded in getting asleep.THE MISSING WITNESS


    "I fled and cried out death."The voice was low and searching; it reached me in my dreams, waked me,
and caused me to look up.Morning had begun to break, and by its light I
saw, standing in the open door leading into the dining-room, the forlorn
figure of the tramp who had been admitted into the house the night
before.Angry and perplexed, I was about to bid her be gone, when, to my
great surprise, she pulled out a red handkerchief from her pocket, and I
recognized Q."Read that," said he, hastily advancing and putting a slip of paper into
my hand.And, without another word or look, left the room, closing the
door behind him.Rising in considerable agitation, I took it to the window, and by the
rapidly increasing light, succeeded in making out the rudely scrawled
lines as follows:

"She is here; I have seen her; in the room marked with a cross in the
accompanying plan.Wait till eight o'clock, then go up.I will contrive
some means of getting Mrs.Sketched below this was the following plan of the upper floor:

Hannah, then, was in the small back room over the dining-room, and I had
not been deceived in thinking I had heard steps overhead, the evening
before.Greatly relieved, and yet at the same time much moved at the
near prospect of being brought face to face with one who we had every
reason to believe was acquainted with the dreadful secret involved in
the Leavenworth murder, I lay down once more, and endeavored to catch
another hour's rest.But I soon gave up the effort in despair, and
contented myself with listening to the sounds of awakening life which
now began to make themselves heard in the house and neighborhood.As Q had closed the door after him, I could only faintly hear Mrs.Belden when she came down-stairs.But the short, surprised exclamation
which she uttered upon reaching the kitchen and finding the tramp gone
and the back-door wide open, came plainly enough to my ears, and for a
moment I was not sure but that Q had made a mistake in thus leaving so
unceremoniously.As she came, in the course of her preparations for breakfast, into the
room adjoining mine, I could hear her murmur to herself:

"Poor thing!She has lived so long in the fields and at the roadside,
she finds it unnatural to be cooped up in the house all night."The effort to eat and appear unconcerned,
to chat and make no mistake,--May I never be called upon to go through
such another!But at last it was over, and I was left free to await
in my own room the time for the dreaded though much-to-be-desired
interview.Slowly the minutes passed; eight o'clock struck, when, just
as the last vibration ceased, there came a loud knock at the backdoor,
and a little boy burst into the kitchen, crying at the top of his voice:
"Papa's got a fit!papa's got a fit; do come!"Rising, as was natural, I hastened towards the kitchen, meeting Mrs.Belden's anxious face in the doorway."A poor wood-chopper down the street has fallen in a fit," she said."Will you please watch over the house while I see what I can do for him?I won't be absent any longer than I can help."And almost without waiting for my reply, she caught up a shawl, threw
it over her head, and followed the urchin, who was in a state of great
excitement, out into the street.Instantly the silence of death seemed to fill the house, and a dread the
greatest I had ever experienced settled upon me.To leave the kitchen,
go up those stairs, and confront that girl seemed for the moment beyond
my power; but, once on the stair, I found myself relieved from the
especial dread which had overwhelmed me, and possessed, instead, of a
sort of combative curiosity that led me to throw open the door which
I saw at the top with a certain fierceness new to my nature, and not
altogether suitable, perhaps, to the occasion.I found myself in a large bedroom, evidently the one occupied by Mrs.Barely stopping to note certain evidences of
her having passed a restless night, I passed on to the door leading into
the room marked with a cross in the plan drawn for me by Q. It was a
rough affair, made of pine boards rudely painted.Pausing before it, I
listened.Raising the latch, I endeavored to enter.Pausing again, I bent my ear to the keyhole.Not a
sound came from within; the grave itself could not have been stiller.Awe-struck and irresolute, I looked about me and questioned what I had
best do.Suddenly I remembered that, in the plan Q had given me, I had
seen intimation of another door leading into this same room from the one
on the opposite side of the hall.Going hastily around to it, I tried
it with my hand.Convinced at last that
nothing was left me but force, I spoke for the first time, and, calling
the girl by name, commanded her to open the door.Receiving no response,
I said aloud with an accent of severity:

"Hannah Chester, you are discovered; if you do not open the door, we
shall be obliged to break it down; save us the trouble, then, and open
immediately."Going back a step, I threw my whole weight against the door.It creaked
ominously, but still resisted.Stopping only long enough to be sure no movement had taken place within,
I pressed against it once more, this time with all my strength, when it
flew from its hinges, and I fell forward into a room so stifling, chill,
and dark that I paused for a moment to collect my scattered senses
before venturing to look around me.In another
moment, the pallor and fixity of the pretty Irish face staring upon me
from amidst the tumbled clothes of a bed, drawn up against the wall at
my side, struck me with so deathlike a chill that, had it not been for
that one instant of preparation, I should have been seriously dismayed.As it was, I could not prevent a feeling of sickly apprehension from
seizing me as I turned towards the silent figure stretched so near, and
observed with what marble-like repose it lay beneath the patchwork quilt
drawn across it, asking myself if sleep could be indeed so like death
in its appearance.For that it was a sleeping woman I beheld, I did not
seriously doubt.There were too many evidences of careless life in the
room for any other inference.The clothes, left just as she had stepped
from them in a circle on the floor; the liberal plate of food placed
in waiting for her on the chair by the door, --food amongst which I
recognized, even in this casual glance, the same dish which we had had
for breakfast --all and everything in the room spoke of robust life and
reckless belief in the morrow.And yet so white was the brow turned up to the bare beams of the
unfinished wall above her, so glassy the look of the half-opened eyes,
so motionless the arm lying half under, half over, the edge of the
coverlid that it was impossible not to shrink from contact with a
creature so sunk in unconsciousness.But contact seemed to be necessary;
any cry which I could raise at that moment would be ineffectual enough
to pierce those dull ears.Nerving myself, therefore, I stooped and
lifted the hand which lay with its telltale scar mockingly uppermost,
intending to speak, call, do something, anything, to arouse her.But at
the first touch of her hand on mine an unspeakable horror thrilled me.It was not only icy cold, but stiff.Dropping it in my agitation, I
started back and again surveyed the face.What sleep ever wore such pallid hues, such accusing
fixedness?Bending once more I listened at the lips.Not a breath, nor a
stir.Shocked to the core of my being, I made one final effort.Tearing
down the clothes, I laid my hand upon her heart.BURNED PAPER


    "I could have better spared a better man."I DO not think I called immediately for help.The awful shock of this
discovery, coming as it did at the very moment life and hope were
strongest within me; the sudden downfall which it brought of all the
plans based upon this woman's expected testimony; and, worst of all, the
dread coincidence between this sudden death and the exigency in which
the guilty party, whoever it was, was supposed to be at that hour were
much too appalling for instant action.I could only stand and stare at
the quiet face before me, smiling in its peaceful rest as if death
were pleasanter than we think, and marvel over the providence which
had brought us renewed fear instead of relief, complication instead of
enlightenment, disappointment instead of realization.For eloquent as is
death, even on the faces of those unknown and unloved by us, the causes
and consequences of this one were much too important to allow the mind
to dwell upon the pathos of the scene itself.Hannah, the girl, was lost
in Hannah the witness.But gradually, as I gazed, the look of expectation which I perceived
hovering about the wistful mouth and half-open lids attracted me, and I
bent above her with a more personal interest, asking myself if she were
quite dead, and whether or not immediate medical assistance would be of
any avail.But the more closely I looked, the more certain I became
that she had been dead for some hours; and the dismay occasioned by this
thought, taken with the regrets which I must ever feel, that I had not
adopted the bold course the evening before, and, by forcing my way to
the hiding-place of this poor creature, interrupted, if not prevented
the consummation of her fate, startled me into a realization of my
present situation; and, leaving her side, I went into the next room,
threw up the window, and fastened to the blind the red handkerchief
which I had taken the precaution to bring with me.Instantly a young man, whom I was fain to believe Q, though he bore
not the least resemblance, either in dress or facial expression to
any renderings of that youth which I had yet seen, emerged from the
tinsmith's house, and approached the one I was in.Observing him cast a hurried glance in my direction, I crossed the
floor, and stood awaiting him at the head of the stairs.he whispered, upon entering the house and meeting my glance from
below; "have you seen her?""Yes," I returned bitterly, "I have seen her!""No; I have had no talk with her."Then, as I perceived him growing
alarmed at my voice and manner, I drew him into Mrs.Belden's room and
hastily inquired: "What did you mean this morning when you informed me
you had seen this girl?that she was in a certain room where I might
find her?""You have, then, been to her room?""No; I have only been on the outside of it.Seeing a light, I crawled up
on to the ledge of the slanting roof last night while both you and Mrs.Belden were out, and, looking through the window, saw her moving round
the room."He must have observed my countenance change, for he stopped."Come," I said, "and see for
yourself!"And, leading him to the little room I had just left, I
pointed to the silent form lying within."You told me I should
find Hannah here; but you did not tell me I should find her in this
condition."he cried with a start: "not dead?"It seemed as if he could not realize it."She is in a heavy sleep, has taken a narcotic----"

"It is not sleep," I said, "or if it is, she will never wake.And, taking the hand once more in mine, I let it fall in its stone
weight upon the bed.Calming down, he stood gazing at her
with a very strange expression upon his face.Suddenly he moved and
began quietly turning over the clothes that were lying on the floor."I am looking for the bit of paper from which I saw her take what I
supposed to be a dose of medicine last night.he cried,
lifting a morsel of paper that, lying on the floor under the edge of the
bed, had hitherto escaped his notice.He handed me the paper, on the inner surface of which I could dimly
discern the traces of an impalpable white powder."This is important," I declared, carefully folding the paper together."If there is enough of this powder remaining to show that the contents
of this paper were poisonous, the manner and means of the girl's death
are accounted for, and a case of deliberate suicide made evident.""I am not so sure of that," he retorted."If I am any judge of
countenances, and I rather flatter myself I am, this girl had no more
idea she was taking poison than I had.She looked not only bright but
gay; and when she tipped up the paper, a smile of almost silly triumph
crossed her face.Belden gave her that dose to take, telling her
it was medicine----"

"That is something which yet remains to be learned; also whether the
dose, as you call it, was poisonous or not.It may be she died of heart
disease."He simply shrugged his shoulders, and pointed first at the plate of
breakfast left on the chair, and secondly at the broken-down door."Yes," I said, answering his look, "Mrs.Belden has been in here this
morning, and Mrs.Belden locked the door when she went out; but that
proves nothing beyond her belief in the girl's hearty condition.""A belief which that white face on its tumbled pillow did not seem to
shake?""Perhaps in her haste she may not have looked at the girl, but have set
the dishes down without more than a casual glance in her direction?""I don't want to suspect anything wrong, but it is such a coincidence!"This was touching me on a sore point, and I stepped back."Well,"
said I, "there is no use in our standing here busying ourselves with
conjectures.and I moved hurriedly
towards the door."Have you forgotten this is but
an episode in the one great mystery we are sent here to unravel?If this
girl has come to her death by some foul play, it is our business to find
it out.""I know; but we can at least take full note of the room and everything
in it before throwing the affair into the hands of strangers.Gryce
will expect that much of us, I am sure."I am
only afraid I can never forget it."the lay of the bed-clothes
around it?the lack there is of all signs of struggle or fear?"Yes, yes; don't make me look at it any more."--rapidly pointing out each
object as he spoke.a calico dress, a shawl,--not the
one in which she was believed to have run away, but an old black
one, probably belonging to Mrs.Then this chest,"--opening
it,--"containing a few underclothes marked,--let us see, ah, with the
name of the lady of the house, but smaller than any she ever wore;
made for Hannah, you observe, and marked with her own name to prevent
suspicion.And then these other clothes lying on the floor, all new,
all marked in the same way.Going over to where he stood I stooped down, when a wash-bowl half full
of burned paper met my eye."I saw her bending over something in this corner, and could not think
what it was.Can it be she is a suicide after all?She has evidently
destroyed something here which she didn't wish any one to see.""Not a scrap, not a morsel left to show what it was; how unfortunate!"Belden must solve this riddle," I cried.Belden must solve the whole riddle," he replied; "the secret
of the Leavenworth murder hangs upon it."Then, with a lingering
look towards the mass of burned paper, "Who knows but what that was a
confession?""Whatever it was," said I, "it is now ashes, and we have got to accept
the fact and make the best of it.""Yes," said he with a deep sigh; "that's so; but Mr.Gryce will never
forgive me for it, never.He will say I ought to have known it was a
suspicious circumstance for her to take a dose of medicine at the very
moment detection stood at her back.""But she did not know that; she did not see you.""We don't know what she saw, nor what Mrs.Women are a
mystery; and though I flatter myself that ordinarily I am a match for
the keenest bit of female flesh that ever walked, I must say that in
this case I feel myself thoroughly and shamefully worsted.""Well, well," I said, "the end has not come yet; who knows what a talk
with Mrs.And, by the way, she will be coming
back soon, and I must be ready to meet her.Everything depends upon
finding out, if I can, whether she is aware of this tragedy or not.It
is just possible she knows nothing about it."And, hurrying him from the room, I pulled the door to behind me, and led
the way down-stairs."Now," said I, "there is one thing you must attend to at once.Gryce acquainting him with this unlooked-for
occurrence.""All right, sir," and Q started for the door."I may not have another opportunity to
mention it.Belden received two letters from the postmaster
yesterday; one in a large and one in a small envelope; if you could find
out where they were postmarked----"

Q put his hand in his pocket."I think I will not have to go far to
find out where one of them came from.And
before I knew it, he had returned up-stairs."THEREBY HANGS A TALE.""IT was all a hoax; nobody was ill; I have been imposed upon, meanly
imposed upon!"Belden, flushed and panting, entered the room
where I was, and proceeded to take off her bonnet; but whilst doing so
paused, and suddenly exclaimed: "What is the matter?"Something very serious has occurred," I replied; "you have been gone
but a little while, but in that time a discovery has been made--" I
purposely paused here that the suspense might elicit from her some
betrayal; but, though she turned pale, she manifested less emotion than
I expected, and I went on--"which is likely to produce very important
consequences.""I always said it would be impossible to keep it secret
if I let anybody into the house; she is so restless.But I forget," she
suddenly said, with a frightened look; "you haven't told me what the
discovery was.Perhaps it isn't what I thought; perhaps----"

I did not hesitate to interrupt her.Belden," I said, "I shall not
try to mitigate the blow.A woman who, in the face of the most urgent
call from law and justice, can receive into her house and harbor there a
witness of such importance as Hannah, cannot stand in need of any great
preparation for hearing that her efforts, have been too successful, that
she has accomplished her design of suppressing valuable testimony, that
law and justice are outraged, and that the innocent woman whom this
girl's evidence might have saved stands for ever compromised in the eyes
of the world, if not in those of the officers of the law."Her eyes, which had never left me during this address, flashed wide with
dismay."I have intended no wrong; I have only
tried to save people.What have you got to do
with all this?What is it to you what I do or don't do?Can it be you are come from Mary Leavenworth to see how I
am fulfilling her commands, and----"

"Mrs.Belden," I said, "it is of small importance now as to who I am, or
for what purpose I am here.But that my words may have the more effect,
I will say, that whereas I have not deceived you, either as to my name
or position, it is true that I am the friend of the Misses Leavenworth,
and that anything which is likely to affect them, is of interest to
me.When, therefore, I say that Eleanore Leavenworth is irretrievably
injured by this girl's death----"

"Death?The burst was too natural, the tone too horror-stricken for me to doubt
for another moment as to this woman's ignorance of the true state of
affairs."Yes," I repeated, "the girl you have been hiding so long and so well is
now beyond your control.I shall never lose from my ears the shriek which she uttered, nor the
wild, "I don't believe it!with which she dashed
from the room and rushed up-stairs.Nor that after-scene when, in the presence of the dead, she stood
wringing her hands and protesting, amid sobs of the sincerest grief and
terror, that she knew nothing of it; that she had left the girl in the
best of spirits the night before; that it was true she had locked her
in, but this she always did when any one was in the house; and that if
she died of any sudden attack, it must have been quietly, for she had
heard no stir all night, though she had listened more than once, being
naturally anxious lest the girl should make some disturbance that would
arouse me.I was in a hurry, and thought she was asleep;
so I set the things down where she could get them and came right away,
locking the door as usual.""It is strange she should have died this night of all others."No, sir; she was even brighter than common; more lively.I never
thought of her being sick then or ever.If I had----"

"You never thought of her being sick?""Why,
then, did you take such pains to give her a dose of medicine last
night?"she protested, evidently under the supposition it was I who
had spoken."Did I, Hannah, did I, poor girl?"stroking the hand that
lay in hers with what appeared to be genuine sorrow and regret.Where she did she get it if you didn't give
it to her?"This time she seemed to be aware that some one besides myself was
talking to her, for, hurriedly rising, she looked at the man with a
wondering stare, before replying."I don't know who you are, sir; but I can tell you this, the girl had no
medicine,--took no dose; she wasn't sick last night that I know of.""Saw her!--the world is crazy, or I am--saw her swallow a powder!How
could you see her do that or anything else?Hasn't she been shut up in
this room for twenty-four hours?""Yes; but with a window like that in the roof, it isn't so very
difficult to see into the room, madam.""Oh," she cried, shrinking, "I have a spy in the house, have I?But I
deserve it; I kept her imprisoned in four close walls, and never came
to look at her once all night.I don't complain; but what was it you say
you saw her take?You think she has poisoned herself, and that I had a
hand in it!""No," I hastened to remark, "he does not think you had a hand in it.He
says he saw the girl herself swallow something which he believes to have
been the occasion of her death, and only asks you now where she obtained
it."I never gave her anything; didn't know she had
anything."Somehow, I believed her, and so felt unwilling to prolong the present
interview, especially as each moment delayed the action which I felt it
incumbent upon us to take.So, motioning Q to depart upon his errand, I
took Mrs.Belden by the hand and endeavored to lead her from the
room.But she resisted, sitting down by the side of the bed with the
expression, "I will not leave her again; do not ask it; here is my
place, and here I will stay," while Q, obdurate for the first time,
stood staring severely upon us both, and would not move, though I urged
him again to make haste, saying that the morning was slipping away, and
that the telegram to Mr."Till that woman leaves the room, I don't; and unless you promise to
take my place in watching her, I don't quit the house."Astonished, I left her side and crossed to him."You carry your suspicions too far," I whispered, "and I think you are
too rude.We have seen nothing, I am sure, to warrant us in any such
action; besides, she can do no harm here; though, as for watching her, I
promise to do that much if it will relieve your mind.""I don't want her watched here; take her below."Are you not assuming a trifle the master?"If I am, it is because I have something in my
possession which excuses my conduct."Agitated now in my turn, I held out my hand."Not while that woman remains in the room."Seeing him implacable, I returned to Mrs."I must entreat you to come with me," said I."This is not a common
death; we shall be obliged to have the coroner here and others.You had
better leave the room and go below.""I don't mind the coroner; he is a neighbor of mine; his coming won't
prevent my watching over the poor girl until he arrives."Belden," I said, "your position as the only one conscious of the
presence of this girl in your house makes it wiser for you not to invite
suspicion by lingering any longer than is necessary in the room where
her dead body lies.""As if my neglect of her now were the best surety of my good intentions
towards her in time past!""It will not be neglect for you to go below with me at my earnest
request.You can do no good here by staying; will, in fact, be doing
harm.Mary journeyed to the office.So listen to me or I shall be obliged to leave you in charge of
this man and go myself to inform the authorities."This last argument seemed to affect her, for with one look of shuddering
abhorrence at Q she rose, saying, "You have me in your power," and then,
without another word, threw her handkerchief over the girl's face and
left the room.In two minutes more I had the letter of which Q had
spoken in my hands."It is the only one I could find, sir.It was in the pocket of the dress
Mrs.The other must be lying around somewhere,
but I haven't had time to find it.Scarcely noticing at the time with what deep significance he spoke, I
opened the letter.It was the smaller of the two I had seen her draw
under her shawl the day before at the post-office, and read as follows:


    "DEAR, DEAR FRIEND:

    "I am in awful trouble.I cannot
    explain, I can only make one prayer.Destroy what you have,
    to-day, instantly, without question or hesitation.The consent
    of any one else has nothing to do with it.I am
    lost if you refuse.Do then what I ask, and save

    "ONE WHO LOVES YOU."Belden; there was no signature or date,
only the postmark New York; but I knew the handwriting.came in the dry tones which Q seemed to think fit to
adopt on this occasion."And a damning bit of evidence against the one
who wrote it, and the woman who received it!""A terrible piece of evidence, indeed," said I, "if I did not happen to
know that this letter refers to the destruction of something radically
different from what you suspect."Quite; but we will talk of this hereafter.It is time you sent your
telegram, and went for the coroner."And with this we parted; he to perform his role and I
mine.Belden walking the floor below, bewailing her situation,
and uttering wild sentences as to what the neighbors would say of her;
what the minister would think; what Clara, whoever that was, would do,
and how she wished she had died before ever she had meddled with the
affair.Succeeding in calming her after a while, I induced her to sit down and
listen to what I had to say."You will only injure yourself by this
display of feeling," I remarked, "besides unfitting yourself for what
you will presently be called upon to go through."And, laying myself out
to comfort the unhappy woman, I first explained the necessities of the
case, and next inquired if she had no friend upon whom she could call in
this emergency.To my great surprise she replied no; that while she had kind neighbors
and good friends, there was no one upon whom she could call in a case
like this, either for assistance or sympathy, and that, unless I would
take pity on her, she would have to meet it alone--"As I have met
everything," she said, "from Mr.Belden's death to the loss of most of
my little savings in a town fire last year."I was touched by this,--that she who, in spite of her weakness and
inconsistencies of character, possessed at least the one virtue of
sympathy with her kind, should feel any lack of friends.Unhesitatingly,
I offered to do what I could for her, providing she would treat me with
the perfect frankness which the case demanded.To my great relief, she
expressed not only her willingness, but her strong desire, to tell all
she knew."I have had enough secrecy for my whole life," she said.And indeed I do believe she was so thoroughly frightened, that if a
police-officer had come into the house and asked her to reveal secrets
compromising the good name of her own son, she would have done so
without cavil or question."I feel as if I wanted to take my stand out
on the common, and, in the face of the whole world, declare what I have
done for Mary Leavenworth.But first," she whispered, "tell me, for
God's sake, how those girls are situated.I have not dared to ask or
write.The papers say a good deal about Eleanore, but nothing about
Mary; and yet Mary writes of her own peril only, and of the danger she
would be in if certain facts were known.I don't want
to injure them, only to take care of myself."Belden," I said, "Eleanore Leavenworth has got into her
present difficulty by not telling all that was required of her.Mary
Leavenworth--but I cannot speak of her till I know what you have to
divulge.Her position, as well as that of her cousin, is too anomalous
for either you or me to discuss.What we want to learn from you is, how
you became connected with this affair, and what it was that Hannah knew
which caused her to leave New York and take refuge here."Belden, clasping and unclasping her hands, met my gaze with one
full of the most apprehensive doubt."You will never believe me," she
cried; "but I don't know what Hannah knew.I am in utter ignorance of
what she saw or heard on that fatal night; she never told, and I never
asked.She merely said that Miss Leavenworth wished me to secrete her
for a short time; and I, because I loved Mary Leavenworth and admired
her beyond any one I ever saw, weakly consented, and----"

"Do you mean to say," I interrupted, "that after you knew of the murder,
you, at the mere expression of Miss Leavenworth's wishes, continued to
keep this girl concealed without asking her any questions or demanding
any explanations?""Yes, sir; you will never believe me, but it is so.I thought that,
since Mary had sent her here, she must have her reasons; and--and--I
cannot explain it now; it all looks so differently; but I did do as I
have said."You must have had strong reason for
obeying Mary Leavenworth so blindly.""Oh, sir," she gasped, "I thought I understood it all; that Mary, the
bright young creature, who had stooped from her lofty position to make
use of me and to love me, was in some way linked to the criminal, and
that it would be better for me to remain in ignorance, do as I was
bid, and trust all would come right.I did not reason about it; I only
followed my impulse.I couldn't do otherwise; it isn't my nature.When I
am requested to do anything for a person I love, I cannot refuse.""And you love Mary Leavenworth; a woman whom you yourself seem to
consider capable of a great crime?""Oh, I didn't say that; I don't know as I thought that.She might be in
some way connected with it, without being the actual perpetrator.She
could never be that; she is too dainty."Belden," I said, "what do you know of Mary Leavenworth which makes
even that supposition possible?"The white face of the woman before me flushed."I scarcely know what to
reply," she cried."It is a long story, and----"

"Never mind the long story," I interrupted."Let me hear the one vital
reason.""Well," said she, "it is this; that Mary was in an emergency from which
nothing but her uncle's death could release her."But here we were interrupted by the sound of steps on the porch, and,
looking out, I saw Q entering the house alone.Belden where
she was, I stepped into the hall."Well," said I, "what is the matter?"No, gone away; off in a buggy to look after a man that was found some
ten miles from here, lying in a ditch beside a yoke of oxen."Then, as
he saw my look of relief, for I was glad of this temporary delay, said,
with an expressive wink: "It would take a fellow a long time to go to
him--if he wasn't in a hurry--hours, I think.""Very; no horse I could get could travel it faster than a walk.""Well," said I, "so much the better for us.Belden has a long story
to tell, and----"

"Doesn't wish to be interrupted."Yes, sir; if he has to hobble on two sticks.""At what time do you look for him?""_You_ will look for him as early as three o'clock.I shall be among the
mountains, ruefully eying my broken-down team."And leisurely donning
his hat he strolled away down the street like one who has the whole day
on his hands and does not know what to do with it.Belden's story, she at once
composed herself to the task, with the following result.BELDEN'S NARRATIVE


    "Cursed, destructive Avarice,
     Thou everlasting foe to Love and Honor.""Mischief never thrives
     Without the help of Woman."IT will be a year next July since I first saw Mary Leavenworth.I
was living at that time a most monotonous existence.Loving what was
beautiful, hating what was sordid, drawn by nature towards all that
was romantic and uncommon, but doomed by my straitened position and the
loneliness of my widowhood to spend my days in the weary round of plain
sewing, I had begun to think that the shadow of a humdrum old age
was settling down upon me, when one morning, in the full tide of my
dissatisfaction, Mary Leavenworth stepped across the threshold of my
door and, with one smile, changed the whole tenor of my life.This may seem exaggeration to you, especially when I say that her errand
was simply one of business, she having heard I was handy with my needle;
but if you could have seen her as she appeared that day, marked the look
with which she approached me, and the smile with which she left, you
would pardon the folly of a romantic old woman, who beheld a fairy queen
in this lovely young lady.The fact is, I was dazzled by her beauty and
her charms.And when, a few days after, she came again, and crouching
down on the stool at my feet, said she was so tired of the gossip and
tumult down at the hotel, that it was a relief to run away and hide with
some one who would let her act like the child she was, I experienced
for the moment, I believe, the truest happiness of my life.Meeting her
advances with all the warmth her manner invited, I found her ere long
listening eagerly while I told her, almost without my own volition, the
story of my past life, in the form of an amusing allegory.The next day saw her in the same place; and the next; always with the
eager, laughing eyes, and the fluttering, uneasy hands, that grasped
everything they touched, and broke everything they grasped.But the fourth day she was not there, nor the fifth, nor the sixth, and
I was beginning to feel the old shadow settling back upon me, when one
night, just as the dusk of twilight was merging into evening gloom, she
came stealing in at the front door, and, creeping up to my side, put her
hands over my eyes with such a low, ringing laugh, that I started."You don't know what to make of me!"she cried, throwing aside her
cloak, and revealing herself in the full splendor of evening attire."I
don't know what to make of myself.Though it seems folly, I felt that
I must run away and tell some one that a certain pair of eyes have been
looking into mine, and that for the first time in my life I feel
myself a woman as well as a queen."And with a glance in which coyness
struggled with pride, she gathered up her cloak around her, and
laughingly cried:

"Have you had a visit from a flying sprite?Has one little ray of
moonlight found its way into your prison for a wee moment, with Mary's
laugh and Mary's snowy silk and flashing diamonds?and she patted
my cheek, and smiled so bewilderingly, that even now, with all the
dull horror of these after-events crowding upon me, I cannot but feel
something like tears spring to my eyes at the thought of it."And so the Prince has come for you?"I whispered, alluding to a story I
had told her the last time she had visited me; a story in which a girl,
who had waited all her life in rags and degradation for the lordly
knight who was to raise her from a hovel to a throne, died just as her
one lover, an honest peasant-lad whom she had discarded in her pride,
arrived at her door with the fortune he had spent all his days in
amassing for her sake.But at this she flushed, and drew back towards the door."I don't know;
I am afraid not.I--I don't think anything about that.Princes are not
so easily won," she murmured.But she only shook her fairy head, and replied: "No, no; that would be
spoiling the romance, indeed.I have come upon you like a sprite, and
like a sprite I will go."And, flashing like the moonbeam she was, she
glided out into the night, and floated away down the street.When she next came, I observed a feverish excitement in her manner,
which assured me, even plainer than the coy sweetness displayed in
our last interview, that her heart had been touched by her lover's
attentions.Indeed, she hinted as much before she left, saying in a
melancholy tone, when I had ended my story in the usual happy way, with
kisses and marriage, "I shall never marry!"finishing the exclamation
with a long-drawn sigh, that somehow emboldened me to say, perhaps
because I knew she had no mother:

"And why?What reason can there be for such rosy lips saying their
possessor will never marry?"She gave me one quick look, and then dropped her eyes.I feared I had
offended her, and was feeling very humble, when she suddenly replied, in
an even but low tone, "I said I should never marry, because the one man
who pleases me can never be my husband."All the hidden romance in my nature started at once into life."There is nothing to tell," said she; "only I have been so weak as
to"--she would not say, fall in love, she was a proud woman--"admire a
man whom my uncle will never allow me to marry."And she rose as if to go; but I drew her back."Whom your uncle will not
allow you to marry!""No; uncle loves money, but not to such an extent as that.He is the owner of a beautiful place in his own
country----"

"Own country?""No," she returned; "he is an Englishman."I did not see why she need say that in just the way she did, but,
supposing she was aggravated by some secret memory, went on to inquire:
"Then what difficulty can there be?Isn't he--" I was going to say
steady, but refrained."He is an Englishman," she emphasized in the same bitter tone as
before."In saying that, I say it all.Uncle will never let me marry an
Englishman."Such a puerile reason as this had never
entered my mind."He has an absolute mania on the subject," resumed she."I might as well
ask him to allow me to drown myself as to marry an Englishman."A woman of truer judgment than myself would have said: "Then, if that is
so, why not discard from your breast all thought of him?Why dance with
him, and talk to him, and let your admiration develop into love?"But
I was all romance then, and, angry at a prejudice I could neither
understand nor appreciate, I said:

"But that is mere tyranny!And why,
if he does, should you feel yourself obliged to gratify him in a whim so
unreasonable?""Yes," I returned; "tell me everything.""Well, then, if you want to know the worst of me, as you already know
the best, I hate to incur my uncle's displeasure, because--because--I
have always been brought up to regard myself as his heiress, and I
know that if I were to marry contrary to his wishes, he would instantly
change his mind, and leave me penniless.""But," I cried, my romance a little dampened by this admission, "you
tell me Mr.Clavering has enough to live upon, so you would not want;
and if you love--"

Her violet eyes fairly flashed in her amazement."You don't understand," she said; "Mr.Clavering is not poor; but uncle
is rich.I shall be a queen--" There she paused, trembling, and falling
on my breast."Oh, it sounds mercenary, I know, but it is the fault of
my bringing up.And yet"--her whole face softening with the light of
another emotion, "I cannot say to Henry Clavering, 'Go!my prospects are
dearer to me than you!'said I, determined to get at the truth of the
matter if possible.If you knew me, you
would say it was."And, turning, she took her stand before a picture
that hung on the wall of my sitting-room.It was one of a pair of good photographs I possessed."Yes," I remarked, "that is why I prize it."She did not seem to hear me; she was absorbed in gazing at the exquisite
face before her."That is a winning face," I heard her say.I wonder if she would ever hesitate between love and money.I
do not believe she would," her own countenance growing gloomy and sad
as she said so; "she would think only of the happiness she would confer;
she is not hard like me.I think she had forgotten my presence, for at the mention of her
cousin's name she turned quickly round with a half suspicious look,
saying lightly:

"My dear old Mamma Hubbard looks horrified.She did not know she had
such a very unromantic little wretch for a listener, when she was
telling all those wonderful stories of Love slaying dragons, and living
in caves, and walking over burning ploughshares as if they were tufts of
spring grass?""No," I said, taking her with an irresistible impulse of admiring
affection into my arms; "but if I had, it would have made no difference.I should still have talked about love, and of all it can do to make this
weary workaday world sweet and delightful."Then you do not think me such a wretch?"I thought her the winsomest being in the world, and
frankly told her so.Instantly she brightened into her very gayest self.Not that I thought then, much less do I think now, she partially
cared for my good opinion; but her nature demanded admiration, and
unconsciously blossomed under it, as a flower under the sunshine."And you will still let me come and tell you how bad I am,--that is, if
I go on being bad, as I doubtless shall to the end of the chapter?"Not if I should do a dreadful thing?Not if I should run away with my
lover some fine night, and leave uncle to discover how his affectionate
partiality had been requited?"It was lightly said, and lightly meant, for she did not even wait for my
reply.But its seed sank deep into our two hearts for all that.And for
the next few days I spent my time in planning how I should manage, if
it should ever fall to my lot to conduct to a successful issue so
enthralling a piece of business as an elopement.You may imagine, then,
how delighted I was, when one evening Hannah, this unhappy girl who
is now lying dead under my roof, and who was occupying the position of
lady's maid to Miss Mary Leavenworth at that time, came to my door with
a note from her mistress, running thus:


    "Have the loveliest story of the season ready for me tomorrow; and
    let the prince be as handsome as--as some one you have heard of,
    and the princess as foolish as your little yielding pet,

    "MARY."Which short note could only mean that she was engaged.But the next day
did not bring me my Mary, nor the next, nor the next; and beyond hearing
that Mr.Leavenworth had returned from his trip I received neither word
nor token.Two more days dragged by, when, just as twilight set in, she
came.It had been a week since I had seen her, but it might have been
a year from the change I observed in her countenance and expression.I
could scarcely greet her with any show of pleasure, she was so unlike
her former self."You
expected revelations, whispered hopes, and all manner of sweet
confidences; and you see, instead, a cold, bitter woman, who for
the first time in your presence feels inclined to be reserved and
uncommunicative.""That is because you have had more to trouble than encourage you in your
love," I returned, though not without a certain shrinking, caused more
by her manner than words.She did not reply to this, but rose and paced the floor, coldly at
first, but afterwards with a certain degree of excitement that proved
to be the prelude to a change in her manner; for, suddenly pausing, she
turned to me and said: "Mr."Yes, my uncle commanded me to dismiss him, and I obeyed."The work dropped from my hands, in my heartfelt disappointment."Yes; he had not been in the house five minutes before Eleanore told
him."I was foolish enough
to give her the cue in my first moment of joy and weakness.I did
not think of the consequences; but I might have known."I do not call it conscientiousness to tell another's secrets," I
returned."That is because you are not Eleanore."Not having a reply for this, I said, "And so your uncle did not regard
your engagement with favor?"Did I not tell you he would never allow me to marry an
Englishman?Let the hard, cruel man have his
way?"She was walking off to look again at that picture which had attracted
her attention the time before, but at this word gave me one little
sidelong look that was inexpressibly suggestive."I obeyed him when he commanded, if that is what you mean."Mary travelled to the garden.Clavering after having given him your word of honor
to be his wife?""Why not, when I found I could not keep my word.""Then you have decided not to marry him?"She did not reply at once, but lifted her face mechanically to the
picture."My uncle would tell you that I had decided to be governed wholly by
his wishes!"she responded at last with what I felt was self-scornful
bitterness.and instantly blushed, startled that I had called her by her
first name."Is it not my manifest
duty to be governed by my uncle's wishes?Has he not brought me up from
childhood?made me all I am, even to the
love of riches which he has instilled into my soul with every gift he
has thrown into my lap, every word he has dropped into my ear, since I
was old enough to know what riches meant?Is it for me now to turn my
back upon fostering care so wise, beneficent, and free, just because
a man whom I have known some two weeks chances to offer me in exchange
what he pleases to call his love?""But," I feebly essayed, convinced perhaps by the tone of sarcasm in
which this was uttered that she was not far from my way of thinking
after all, "if in two weeks you have learned to love this man more than
everything else, even the riches which make your uncle's favor a thing
of such moment--"

"Well," said she, "what then?""Why, then I would say, secure your happiness with the man of your
choice, if you have to marry him in secret, trusting to your influence
over your uncle to win the forgiveness he never can persistently deny."You should have seen the arch expression which stole across her face
at that."Would it not be better," she asked, creeping to my arms, and
laying her head on my shoulder, "would it not be better for me to make
sure of that uncle's favor first, before undertaking the hazardous
experiment of running away with a too ardent lover?"Struck by her manner, I lifted her face and looked at it."Oh, my darling," said I, "you have not, then dismissed Mr."I have sent him away," she whispered demurely."Oh, you dear old Mamma Hubbard; what a matchmaker you are, to be sure!You appear as much interested as if you were the lover yourself.""He will wait for me," said she.The next day I submitted to her the plan I had formed for her
clandestine intercourse with Mr.It was for them both to
assume names, she taking mine, as one less liable to provoke conjecture
than a strange name, and he that of LeRoy Robbins.The plan pleased
her, and with the slight modification of a secret sign being used on the
envelope, to distinguish her letters from mine, was at once adopted.And so it was I took the fatal step that has involved me in all this
trouble.With the gift of my name to this young girl to use as she
would and sign what she would, I seemed to part with what was left me of
judgment and discretion.Henceforth, I was only her scheming, planning,
devoted slave; now copying the letters which she brought me, and
enclosing them to the false name we had agreed upon, and now busying
myself in devising ways to forward to her those which I received from
him, without risk of discovery.Hannah was the medium we employed, as
Mary felt it would not be wise for her to come too often to my house.To this girl's charge, then, I gave such notes as I could not forward in
any other way, secure in the reticence of her nature, as well as in her
inability to read, that these letters addressed to Mrs.Amy Belden would
arrive at their proper destination without mishap.At all events, no difficulty that I ever heard of arose out
of the use of this girl as a go-between.Clavering, who had left an invalid mother
in England, was suddenly summoned home.He prepared to go, but, flushed
with love, distracted by doubts, smitten with the fear that, once
withdrawn from the neighborhood of a woman so universally courted as
Mary, he would stand small chance of retaining his position in her
regard, he wrote to her, telling his fears and asking her to marry him
before he went."Make me your husband, and I will follow your wishes in all things,"
he wrote."The certainty that you are mine will make parting possible;
without it, I cannot go; no, not if my mother should die without the
comfort of saying good-bye to her only child."By some chance she was in my house when I brought this letter from the
post-office, and I shall never forget how she started when she read it.But, from looking as if she had received an insult, she speedily settled
down into a calm consideration of the subject, writing and delivering
into my charge for copying a few lines in which she promised to accede
to his request, if he would agree to leave the public declaration of the
marriage to her discretion, and consent to bid her farewell at the door
of the church or wherever the ceremony of marriage should take place,
never to come into her presence again till such declaration had been
made.Of course this brought in a couple of days the sure response:
"Anything, so you will be mine."And Amy Belden's wits and powers of planning were all summoned into
requisition for the second time, to devise how this matter could be
arranged without subjecting the parties to the chance of detection.In the first place, it was essential
that the marriage should come off within three days, Mr.Clavering
having, upon the receipt of her letter, secured his passage upon a
steamer that sailed on the following Saturday; and, next, both he and
Miss Leavenworth were too conspicuous in their personal appearance to
make it at all possible for them to be secretly married anywhere within
gossiping distance of this place.And yet it was desirable that the
scene of the ceremony should not be too far away, or the time occupied
in effecting the journey to and from the place would necessitate an
absence from the hotel on the part of Miss Leavenworth long enough to
arouse the suspicions of Eleanore; something which Mary felt it wiser
to avoid.Her uncle, I have forgotten to say, was not here--having gone
away again shortly after the apparent dismissal of Mr.F----, then, was the only town I could think of which combined the two
advantages of distance and accessibility.Although upon the railroad, it
was an insignificant place, and had, what was better yet, a very obscure
man for its clergyman, living, which was best of all, not ten rods from
the depot.Making inquiries, I found that it
could be done, and, all alive to the romance of the occasion, proceeded
to plan the details.And now I am coming to what might have caused the overthrow of the
whole scheme: I allude to the detection on the part of Eleanore of the
correspondence between Mary and Mr.Hannah,
who, in her frequent visits to my house, had grown very fond of my
society, had come in to sit with me for a while one evening.She had not
been in the house, however, more than ten minutes, before there came a
knock at the front door; and going to it I saw Mary, as I supposed, from
the long cloak she wore, standing before me.Thinking she had come with
a letter for Mr.Clavering, I grasped her arm and drew her into the
hall, saying, "Have you got it?I must post it to-night, or he will not
receive it in time."There I paused, for, the panting creature I had by the arm turning upon
me, I saw myself confronted by a stranger."You have made a mistake," she cried."I am Eleanore Leavenworth, and I
have come for my girl Hannah.I could only raise my hand in apprehension, and point to the girl
sitting in the corner of the room before her.Miss Leavenworth
immediately turned back."Hannah, I want you," said she, and would have left the house without
another word, but I caught her by the arm."Oh, miss--" I began, but she gave me such a look, I dropped her arm.And, with a glance to see if Hannah were following her,
she went out.For an hour I sat crouched on the stair just where she had left me.Then
I went to bed, but I did not sleep a wink that night.You can imagine,
then, my wonder when, with the first glow of the early morning light,
Mary, looking more beautiful than ever, came running up the steps and
into the room where I was, with the letter for Mr.I cried in my joy and relief, "didn't she understand me, then?"The gay look on Mary's face turned to one of reckless scorn."If you
mean Eleanore, yes.I couldn't keep it secret after the
mistake you made last evening; so I did the next best thing, told her
the truth.""Not that you were about to be married?""And you did not find her as angry as you expected?""I will not say that; she was angry enough.And yet," continued Mary,
with a burst of self-scornful penitence, "I will not call Eleanore's
lofty indignation anger.She was grieved, Mamma Hubbard, grieved."And
with a laugh which I believe was rather the result of her own relief
than of any wish to reflect on her cousin, she threw her head on one
side and eyed me with a look which seemed to say, "Do I plague you so
very much, you dear old Mamma Hubbard?"She did plague me, and I could not conceal it."And will she not tell
her uncle?"The naive expression on Mary's face quickly changed.I felt a heavy hand, hot with fever, lifted from my heart.The plan agreed upon between us for the carrying out of our intentions
was this.At the time appointed, Mary was to excuse herself to her
cousin upon the plea that she had promised to take me to see a friend
in the next town.She was then to enter a buggy previously ordered, and
drive here, where I was to join her.We were then to proceed immediately
to the minister's house in F----, where we had reason to believe we
should find everything prepared for us.But in this plan, simple as it
was, one thing was forgotten, and that was the character of Eleanore's
love for her cousin.That her suspicions would be aroused we did
not doubt; but that she would actually follow Mary up and demand an
explanation of her conduct, was what neither she, who knew her so well,
nor I, who knew her so little, ever imagined possible.Mary, who had followed out the
programme to the point of leaving a little note of excuse on Eleanore's
dressing-table, had come to my house, and was just taking off her long
cloak to show me her dress, when there came a commanding knock at
the front door.Hastily pulling her cloak about her I ran to open it,
intending, you may be sure, to dismiss my visitor with short ceremony,
when I heard a voice behind me say, "Good heavens, it is Eleanore!"and,
glancing back, saw Mary looking through the window-blind upon the porch
without.why, open the door and let her in; I am not afraid of Eleanore."I immediately did so, and Eleanore Leavenworth, very pale, but with
a resolute countenance, walked into the house and into this room,
confronting Mary in very nearly the same spot where you are now sitting."I have come," said she, lifting a face whose expression of mingled
sweetness and power I could not but admire, even in that moment of
apprehension, "to ask you without any excuse for my request, if you will
allow me to accompany you upon your drive this morning?"Mary, who had drawn herself up to meet some word of accusation or
appeal, turned carelessly away to the glass."I am very sorry," she
said, "but the buggy holds only two, and I shall be obliged to refuse.""But I do not wish your company, Eleanore.We are off on a pleasure
trip, and desire to have our fun by ourselves.""And you will not allow me to accompany you?""I cannot prevent your going in another carriage."Eleanore's face grew yet more earnest in its expression."Mary," said
she, "we have been brought up together.I am your sister in affection
if not in blood, and I cannot see you start upon this adventure with no
other companion than this woman.Then tell me, shall I go with you, as a
sister, or on the road behind you as the enforced guardian of your honor
against your will?""Now is it discreet or honorable in you to do this?"Mary's haughty lip took an ominous curve."The same hand that raised you
has raised me," she cried bitterly."This is no time to speak of that," returned Eleanore.All the antagonism of her nature was
aroused.She looked absolutely Juno-like in her wrath and reckless
menace."Eleanore," she cried, "I am going to F---- to marry Mr._Now_ do you wish to accompany me?"Leaping forward, she grasped her cousin's
arm and shook it."To witness the marriage, if it be a true one; to step between you
and shame if any element of falsehood should come in to affect its
legality."Mary's hand fell from her cousin's arm."I do not understand you,"
said she."I thought you never gave countenance to what you considered
wrong.""Nor do I. Any one who knows me will understand that I do not give my
approval to this marriage just because I attend its ceremonial in the
capacity of an unwilling witness.""Because I value your honor above my own peace.Because I love our
common benefactor, and know that he would never pardon me if I let his
darling be married, however contrary her union might be to his wishes,
without lending the support of my presence to make the transaction at
least a respectable one.""But in so doing you will be involved in a world of deception--which you
hate."Clavering does not return with me, Eleanore."Mary's face crimsoned, and she turned slowly away."What every other girl does under such circumstances, I suppose.The
development of more reasonable feelings in an obdurate parent's heart."Eleanore sighed, and a short silence ensued, broken by Eleanore's
suddenly falling upon her knees, and clasping her cousin's hand."Oh,
Mary," she sobbed, her haughtiness all disappearing in a gush of wild
entreaty, "consider what you are doing!Think, before it is too late, of
the consequences which must follow such an act as this.Marriage founded
upon deception can never lead to happiness.Love would have led you either to have dismissed Mr.Clavering at once,
or to have openly accepted the fate which a union with him would bring.Only passion stoops to subterfuge like this.And you," she continued,
rising and turning toward me in a sort of forlorn hope very touching
to see, "can you see this young motherless girl, driven by caprice, and
acknowledging no moral restraint, enter upon the dark and crooked path
she is planning for herself, without uttering one word of warning and
appeal?Tell me, mother of children dead and buried, what excuse you
will have for your own part in this day's work, when she, with her
face marred by the sorrows which must follow this deception, comes to
you----"

"The same excuse, probably," Mary's voice broke in, chill and strained,
"which you will have when uncle inquires how you came to allow such an
act of disobedience to be perpetrated in his absence: that she could not
help herself, that Mary would gang her ain gait, and every one around
must accommodate themselves to it."It was like a draught of icy air suddenly poured into a room heated up
to fever point.Eleanore stiffened immediately, and drawing back, pale
and composed, turned upon her cousin with the remark:

"Then nothing can move you?"The curling of Mary's lips was her only reply.Raymond, I do not wish to weary you with my feelings, but the first
great distrust I ever felt of my wisdom in pushing this matter so far
came with that curl of Mary's lip.More plainly than Eleanore's words it
showed me the temper with which she was entering upon this undertaking;
and, struck with momentary dismay, I advanced to speak when Mary stopped
me."There, now, Mamma Hubbard, don't you go and acknowledge that you
are frightened, for I won't hear it.I have promised to marry Henry
Clavering to-day, and I am going to keep my word--if I don't love him,"
she added with bitter emphasis.Then, smiling upon me in a way which
caused me to forget everything save the fact that she was going to her
bridal, she handed me her veil to fasten.As I was doing this, with very
trembling fingers, she said, looking straight at Eleanore:

"You have shown yourself more interested in my fate than I had any
reason to expect.Will you continue to display this concern all the way
to F----, or may I hope for a few moments of peace in which to dream
upon the step which, according to you, is about to hurl upon me such
dreadful consequences?""If I go with you to F----," Eleanore returned, "it is as a witness, no
more."Very well, then," Mary said, dimpling with sudden gayety; "I suppose
I shall have to accept the situation.Mamma Hubbard, I am so sorry to
disappoint you, but the buggy _won't_ hold three.If you are good you
shall be the first to congratulate me when I come home to-night."And,
almost before I knew it, the two had taken their seats in the buggy that
was waiting at the door."Good-by," cried Mary, waving her hand from the
back; "wish me much joy--of my ride."I tried to do so, but the words wouldn't come.I could only wave my hand
in response, and rush sobbing into the house.Of that day, and its long hours of alternate remorse and anxiety, I
cannot trust myself to speak.Let me come at once to the time when,
seated alone in my lamp-lighted room, I waited and watched for the token
of their return which Mary had promised me.It came in the shape of Mary
herself, who, wrapped in her long cloak, and with her beautiful face
aglow with blushes, came stealing into the house just as I was beginning
to despair.A strain of wild music from the hotel porch, where they were having a
dance, entered with her, producing such a weird effect upon my fancy
that I was not at all surprised when, in flinging off her cloak, she
displayed garments of bridal white and a head crowned with snowy roses.I cried, bursting into tears; "you are then----"

"Mrs."Without a bridal," I murmured, taking her passionately into my embrace.Nestling close to me, she gave
herself up for one wild moment to a genuine burst of tears, saying
between her sobs all manner of tender things; telling me how she loved
me, and how I was the only one in all the world to whom she dared come
on this, her wedding night, for comfort or congratulation, and of how
frightened she felt now it was all over, as if with her name she had
parted with something of inestimable value."And does not the thought of having made some one the proudest of men
solace you?"I asked, more than dismayed at this failure of mine to make
these lovers happy."I don't know," she sobbed."What satisfaction can it be for him to
feel himself tied for life to a girl who, sooner than lose a prospective
fortune, subjected him to such a parting?""Tell me about it," said I.

But she was not in the mood at that moment.The excitement of the day
had been too much for her.A thousand fears seemed to beset her mind.Crouching down on the stool at my feet, she sat with her hands folded
and a glare on her face that lent an aspect of strange unreality to her
brilliant attire.The thought haunts me
every moment; how can I keep it secret!""Why, is there any danger of its being known?""It all went off well, but----"

"Where is the danger, then?""I cannot say; but some deeds are like ghosts.They will not be laid;
they reappear; they gibber; they make themselves known whether we will
or not.I was mad, reckless, what you
will.But ever since the night has come, I have felt it crushing upon me
like a pall that smothers life and youth and love out of my heart.While
the sunlight remained I could endure it; but now--oh, Auntie, I have
done something that will keep me in constant fear.I have allied myself
to a living apprehension."For two hours I have played at being gay.Dressed in my bridal white,
and crowned with roses, I have greeted my friends as if they were
wedding-guests, and made believe to myself that all the compliments
bestowed upon me--and they are only too numerous--were just so many
congratulations upon my marriage.But it was no use; Eleanore knew it
was no use.She has gone to her room to pray, while I--I have come here
for the first time, perhaps for the last, to fall at some one's feet and
cry,--' God have mercy upon me!'""Oh, Mary, have I only
succeeded, then, in making you miserable?"She did not answer; she was engaged in picking up the crown of roses
which had fallen from her hair to the floor."If I had not been taught to love money so!""If,
like Eleanore, I could look upon the splendor which has been ours from
childhood as a mere accessory of life, easy to be dropped at the call of
duty or affection!If prestige, adulation, and elegant belongings were
not so much to me; or love, friendship, and domestic happiness more!If only I could walk a step without dragging the chain of a thousand
luxurious longings after me.Imperious as she often is in
her beautiful womanhood, haughty as she can be when the delicate quick
of her personality is touched too rudely, I have known her to sit by the
hour in a low, chilly, ill-lighted and ill-smelling garret, cradling a
dirty child on her knee, and feeding with her own hand an impatient old
woman whom no one else would consent to touch.they talk about
repentance and a change of heart!If some one or something would only
change mine!no hope of my ever being
anything else than what I am: a selfish, wilful, mercenary girl."Nor was this mood a mere transitory one.That same night she made a
discovery which increased her apprehension almost to terror.This was
nothing less than the fact that Eleanore had been keeping a diary of
the last few weeks."Oh," she cried in relating this to me the next day,
"what security shall I ever feel as long as this diary of hers remains
to confront me every time I go into her room?And she will not consent
to destroy it, though I have done my best to show her that it is a
betrayal of the trust I reposed in her.She says it is all she has to
show in the way of defence, if uncle should ever accuse her of treachery
to him and his happiness.She promises to keep it locked up; but what
good will that do!A thousand accidents might happen, any of them
sufficient to throw it into uncle's hands.I shall never feel safe for a
moment while it exists."I endeavored to calm her by saying that if Eleanore was without malice,
such fears were groundless.But she would not be comforted, and seeing
her so wrought up, I suggested that Eleanore should be asked to trust it
into my keeping till such time as she should feel the necessity of using
it."O yes," she cried; "and I will
put my certificate with it, and so get rid of all my care at once."And before the afternoon was over, she had seen Eleanore and made her
request.It was acceded to with this proviso, that I was neither to destroy nor
give up all or any of the papers except upon their united demand.A
small tin box was accordingly procured, into which were put all the
proofs of Mary's marriage then existing, viz.Clavering's letters, and such leaves from Eleanore's diary as referred
to this matter.It was then handed over to me with the stipulation
I have already mentioned, and I stowed it away in a certain closet
upstairs, where it has lain undisturbed till last night.Belden paused, and, blushing painfully, raised her eyes to
mine with a look in which anxiety and entreaty were curiously blended."I don't know what you will say," she began, "but, led away by my
fears, I took that box out of its hiding-place last evening and,
notwithstanding your advice, carried it from the house, and it is
now----"

"In my possession," I quietly finished.I don't think I ever saw her look more astounded, not even when I told
her of Hannah's death."I left it last
night in the old barn that was burned down.I merely meant to hide it
for the present, and could think of no better place in my hurry; for the
barn is said to be haunted--a man hung himself there once--and no one
ever goes there.she cried, "unless----"

"Unless I found and brought it away before the barn was destroyed," I
suggested."Yes," said I. Then, as I felt my own countenance redden, hastened to
add: "We have been playing strange and unaccustomed parts, you and I.
Some time, when all these dreadful events shall be a mere dream of the
past, we will ask each other's pardon.The
box is safe, and I am anxious to hear the rest of your story."This seemed to compose her, and after a minute she continued:

Mary seemed more like herself after this.Leavenworth's return and their subsequent preparations for departure,
I saw but little more of her, what I did see was enough to make me
fear that, with the locking up of the proofs of her marriage, she was
indulging the idea that the marriage itself had become void.But I may
have wronged her in this.The story of those few weeks is almost finished.On the eve of the day
before she left, Mary came to my house to bid me good-by.She had a
present in her hand the value of which I will not state, as I did not
take it, though she coaxed me with all her prettiest wiles.But she said
something that night that I have never been able to forget.I had been speaking of my hope that before two months had elapsed she
would find herself in a position to send for Mr.Clavering, and that
when that day came I should wish to be advised of it; when she suddenly
interrupted me by saying:

"Uncle will never be won upon, as you call it, while he lives.If I was
convinced of it before, I am sure of it now.Nothing but his death will
ever make it possible for me to send for Mr.Then, seeing
me look aghast at the long period of separation which this seemed to
betoken, blushed a little and whispered: "The prospect looks somewhat
dubious, doesn't it?"But," said I, "your uncle is only little past the prime of life and
appears to be in robust health; it will be years of waiting, Mary.""I don't know," she muttered, "I think not.Uncle is not as strong as he
looks and--" She did not say any more, horrified perhaps at the turn the
conversation was taking.But there was an expression on her countenance
that set me thinking at the time, and has kept me thinking ever since.Not that any actual dread of such an occurrence as has since happened
came to oppress my solitude during the long months which now intervened.I was as yet too much under the spell of her charm to allow anything
calculated to throw a shadow over her image to remain long in my
thoughts.But when, some time in the fall, a letter came to me
personally from Mr.Clavering, filled with a vivid appeal to tell
him something of the woman who, in spite of her vows, doomed him to a
suspense so cruel, and when, on the evening of the same day, a friend
of mine who had just returned from New York spoke of meeting Mary
Leavenworth at some gathering, surrounded by manifest admirers, I began
to realize the alarming features of the affair, and, sitting down, I
wrote her a letter.Not in the strain in which I had been accustomed to
talk to her,--I had not her pleading eyes and trembling, caressing hands
ever before me to beguile my judgment from its proper exercise,--but
honestly and earnestly, telling her how Mr.Clavering felt, and what a
risk she ran in keeping so ardent a lover from his rights.Robbins out of my calculations for the present, and
advise you to do the same.As for the gentleman himself, I have told him
that when I could receive him I would be careful to notify him."But do not let him be discouraged," she added in a postscript."When he
does receive his happiness, it will be a satisfying one."Ah, it is that _when_ which is likely to ruin all!But, intent only upon fulfilling her will, I sat down and wrote a letter
to Mr.Clavering, in which I stated what she had said, and begged him
to have patience, adding that I would surely let him know if any change
took place in Mary or her circumstances.And, having despatched it to
his address in London, awaited the development of events.In two weeks I heard of the sudden
death of Mr.Stebbins, the minister who had married them; and while
yet laboring under the agitation produced by this shock, was further
startled by seeing in a New York paper the name of Mr.Clavering among
the list of arrivals at the Hoffman House; showing that my letter to
him had failed in its intended effect, and that the patience Mary had
calculated upon so blindly was verging to its end.I was consequently
far from being surprised when, in a couple of weeks or so afterwards,
a letter came from him to my address, which, owing to the careless
omission of the private mark upon the envelope, I opened, and read
enough to learn that, driven to desperation by the constant failures
which he had experienced in all his endeavors to gain access to her in
public or private, a failure which he was not backward in ascribing
to her indisposition to see him, he had made up his mind to risk
everything, even her displeasure; and, by making an appeal to her uncle,
end the suspense under which he was laboring, definitely and at once."I
want you," he wrote; "dowered or dowerless, it makes little difference
to me.If you will not come of yourself, then I must follow the example
of the brave knights, my ancestors; storm the castle that holds you, and
carry you off by force of arms."Neither can I say I was much surprised, knowing Mary as I did, when, in
a few days from this, she forwarded to me for copying, this reply: "If
Mr.Robbins ever expects to be happy with Amy Belden, let him reconsider
the determination of which he speaks.Not only would he by such an
action succeed in destroying the happiness of her he professes to love,
but run the greater risk of effectually annulling the affection which
makes the tie between them endurable."It was the cry of warning
which a spirited, self-contained creature gives when brought to bay.It
made even me recoil, though I had known from the first that her pretty
wilfulness was but the tossing foam floating above the soundless depths
of cold resolve and most deliberate purpose.What its real effect was upon him and her fate I can only conjecture.All I know is that in two weeks thereafter Mr.Leavenworth was found
murdered in his room, and Hannah Chester, coming direct to my door from
the scene of violence, begged me to take her in and secrete her from
public inquiry, as I loved and desired to serve Mary Leavenworth.UNEXPECTED TESTIMONY


    _Pol._ What do you read, my lord?BELDEN paused, lost in the sombre shadow which these words were
calculated to evoke, and a short silence fell upon the room.It was
broken by my asking for some account of the occurrence she had just
mentioned, it being considered a mystery how Hannah could have found
entrance into her house without the knowledge of the neighbors."Well," said she, "it was a chilly night, and I had gone to bed early
(I was sleeping then in the room off this) when, at about a quarter to
one--the last train goes through R---- at 12.50--there came a low knock
on the window-pane at the head of my bed.Thinking that some of the
neighbors were sick, I hurriedly rose on my elbow and asked who
was there.The answer came in low, muffled tones, 'Hannah, Miss
Leavenworth's girl!Startled at
hearing the well-known voice, and fearing I knew not what, I caught up
a lamp and hurried round to the door.But no sooner had she done so than
my strength failed me, and I had to sit down, for I saw she looked very
pale and strange, was without baggage, and altogether had the appearance
of some wandering spirit.what brings you here in this condition and at this time
of night?''Miss Leavenworth has sent me,' she replied, in the low,
monotonous tone of one repeating a lesson by rote.'She told me to come
here; said you would keep me.I am not to go out of the house, and no
one is to know I am here.'I asked, trembling with a thousand
undefined fears; 'what has occurred?''I dare not say,' she whispered;
'I am forbid; I am just to stay here, and keep quiet.''But,' I began,
helping her to take off her shawl,--the dingy blanket advertised for
in the papers--'you must tell me.She surely did not forbid you to tell
_me?_' 'Yes she did; every one,' the girl replied, growing white in her
persistence, 'and I never break my word; fire couldn't draw it out
of me.'She looked so determined, so utterly unlike herself, as I
remembered her in the meek, unobtrusive days of our old acquaintance,
that I could do nothing but stare at her.'You will keep me,' she said;
'you will not turn me away?''No,' I said, 'I will not turn you away.'Thanking me, she quietly followed me
up-stairs.I put her into the room in which you found her, because it
was the most secret one in the house; and there she has remained ever
since, satisfied and contented, as far as I could see, till this very
same horrible day.""Did you have no explanation with her
afterwards?Did she never give you any information in regard to the
transactions which led to her flight?"Neither then nor when,
upon the next day, I confronted her with the papers in my hand, and the
awful question upon my lips as to whether her flight had been occasioned
by the murder which had taken place in Mr.Leavenworth's household, did
she do more than acknowledge she had run away on this account.Some one
or something had sealed her lips, and, as she said, 'Fire and torture
should never make her speak.'"Another short pause followed this; then, with my mind still hovering
about the one point of intensest interest to me, I said:

"This story, then, this account which you have just given me of Mary
Leavenworth's secret marriage and the great strait it put her
into--a strait from which nothing but her uncle's death could relieve
her--together with this acknowledgment of Hannah's that she had left
home and taken refuge here on the insistence of Mary Leavenworth, is the
groundwork you have for the suspicions you have mentioned?""Yes, sir; that and the proof of her interest in the matter which is
given by the letter I received from her yesterday, and which you say you
have now in your possession."Belden went on in a broken voice, "that it is wrong, in a
serious case like this, to draw hasty conclusions; but, oh, sir, how can
I help it, knowing what I do?"I did not answer; I was revolving in my mind the old question: was it
possible, in face of all these later developments, still to believe Mary
Leavenworth's own hand guiltless of her uncle's blood?"It is dreadful to come to such conclusions," proceeded Mrs.Belden,
"and nothing but her own words written in her own hand would ever have
driven me to them, but----"

"Pardon me," I interrupted; "but you said in the beginning of this
interview that you did not believe Mary herself had any direct hand in
her uncle's murder.Whatever I may think of her influence in inducing
it, I never could imagine her as having anything to do with its actual
performance.whatever was done on that dreadful night,
Mary Leavenworth never put hand to pistol or ball, or even stood by
while they were used; that you may be sure of.Only the man who loved
her, longed for her, and felt the impossibility of obtaining her by any
other means, could have found nerve for an act so horrible.""Then you think----"

"Mr.I do: and oh, sir, when you consider that he
is her husband, is it not dreadful enough?""It is, indeed," said I, rising to conceal how much I was affected by
this conclusion of hers.Something in my tone or appearance seemed to startle her."I hope and
trust I have not been indiscreet," she cried, eying me with something
like an incipient distrust."With this dead girl lying in my house, I
ought to be very careful, I know, but----"

"You have said nothing," was my earnest assurance as I edged towards the
door in my anxiety to escape, if but for a moment, from an atmosphere
that was stifling me."No one can blame you for anything you have
either said or done to-day.But"--and here I paused and walked hurriedly
back,--"I wish to ask one question more.Have you any reason, beyond
that of natural repugnance to believing a young and beautiful woman
guilty of a great crime, for saying what you have of Henry Clavering, a
gentleman who has hitherto been mentioned by you with respect?""No," she whispered, with a touch of her old agitation.I felt the reason insufficient, and turned away with something of the
same sense of suffocation with which I had heard that the missing key
had been found in Eleanore Leavenworth's possession."You must excuse
me," I said; "I want to be a moment by myself, in order to ponder over
the facts which I have just heard; I will soon return "; and without
further ceremony, hurried from the room.By some indefinable impulse, I went immediately up-stairs, and took my
stand at the western window of the large room directly over Mrs.The blinds were closed; the room was shrouded in funereal gloom, but
its sombreness and horror were for the moment unfelt; I was engaged in
a fearful debate with myself.Was Mary Leavenworth the principal, or
merely the accessory, in this crime?Gryce, the convictions of Eleanore, the circumstantial evidence even of
such facts as had come to our knowledge, preclude the possibility
that Mrs.That all the detectives
interested in the affair would regard the question as settled, I did not
doubt; but need it be?Was it utterly impossible to find evidence yet
that Henry Clavering was, after all, the assassin of Mr.Filled with the thought, I looked across the room to the closet where
lay the body of the girl who, according to all probability, had known
the truth of the matter, and a great longing seized me.Oh, why could
not the dead be made to speak?Why should she lie there so silent, so
pulseless, so inert, when a word from her were enough to decide the
awful question?Was there no power to compel those pallid lips to move?Carried away by the fervor of the moment, I made my way to her side.With what a mockery the closed lips and lids confronted
my demanding gaze!A stone could not have been more unresponsive.With a feeling that was almost like anger, I stood there, when--what
was it I saw protruding from beneath her shoulders where they crushed
against the bed?Dizzy with the sudden surprise, overcome with the wild hopes this
discovery awakened, I stooped in great agitation and drew the letter
out.Breaking it hastily open, I took
a glance at its contents.it was the work of the girl
herself!--its very appearance was enough to make that evident!Feeling
as if a miracle had happened, I hastened with it into the other room,
and set myself to decipher the awkward scrawl.This is what I saw, rudely printed in lead pencil on the inside of a
sheet of common writing-paper:

"I am a wicked girl.I have knone things all the time which I had ought
to have told but I didn't dare to he said he would kill me if I did I
mene the tall splendud looking gentulman with the black mustash who I
met coming out of Mister Levenworth's room with a key in his hand the
night Mr.He was so scared he gave me money and
made me go away and come here and keep every thing secret but I can't do
so no longer.I seem to see Miss Elenor all the time crying and asking
me if I want her sent to prisun.And this is
the truth and my last words and I pray every body's forgivness and hope
nobody will blame me and that they wont bother Miss Elenor any more but
go and look after the handsome gentulman with the black mushtash."THE PROBLEM SOLVED



XXXIV.GRYCE RESUMES CONTROL


    "It out-herods Herod."--Richard III

A HALF-HOUR had passed.The train upon which I had every reason to
expect Mr.Gryce had arrived, and I stood in the doorway awaiting with
indescribable agitation the slow and labored approach of the motley
group of men and women whom I had observed leave the depot at the
departure of the cars.Was the telegram of a
nature peremptory enough to make his presence here, sick as he was, an
absolute certainty?The written confession of Hannah throbbing against
my heart, a heart all elation now, as but a short half-hour before it
had been all doubt and struggle, seemed to rustle distrust, and the
prospect of a long afternoon spent in impatience was rising before me,
when a portion of the advancing crowd turned off into a side street,
and I saw the form of Mr.Gryce hobbling, not on two sticks, but very
painfully on one, coming slowly down the street.His face, as he approached, was a study."Well, well, well," he exclaimed, as we met at the gate; "this is a
pretty how-dye-do, I must say.and everything turned
topsy-turvy!Humph, and what do you think of Mary Leavenworth now?"It would therefore seem natural, in the conversation which followed his
introduction into the house and installment in Mrs.Belden's parlor,
that I should begin my narration by showing him Hannah's confession; but
it was not so.Whether it was that I felt anxious to have him go through
the same alternations of hope and fear it had been my lot to experience
since I came to R----; or whether, in the depravity of human nature,
there lingered within me sufficient resentment for the persistent
disregard he had always paid to my suspicions of Henry Clavering to make
it a matter of moment to me to spring this knowledge upon him just at
the instant his own convictions seemed to have reached the point of
absolute certainty, I cannot say.Enough that it was not till I had
given him a full account of every other matter connected with my stay in
this house; not till I saw his eye beaming, and his lip quivering with
the excitement incident upon the perusal of the letter from Mary, found
in Mrs.Belden's pocket; not, indeed, until I became assured from such
expressions as "Tremendous!Nothing
like it since the Lafarge affair!"that in another moment he would be
uttering some theory or belief that once heard would forever stand like
a barrier between us, did I allow myself to hand him the letter I had
taken from under the dead body of Hannah.I shall never forget his expression as he received it; "Good heavens!"I found it lying in her bed when
I went up, a half-hour ago, to take a second look at her."Opening it, he glanced over it with an incredulous air that speedily,
however, turned to one of the utmost astonishment, as he hastily perused
it, and then stood turning it over and over in his hand, examining it."A remarkable piece of evidence," I observed, not without a certain
feeling of triumph; "quite changes the aspect of affairs!"he sharply retorted; then, whilst I stood staring at him in
amazement, his manner was so different from what I expected, looked up
and said: "You tell me that you found this in her bed."Under the body of the girl herself," I returned."I saw one corner of
it protruding from beneath her shoulders, and drew it out.""Was it folded or open, when you first
looked at it?""Folded; fastened up in this envelope," showing it to him.He took it, looked at it for a moment, and went on with his questions."This envelope has a very crumpled appearance, as well as the letter
itself."Yes, not only so, but doubled up as you see."Folded, sealed, and then doubled up
as if her body had rolled across it while alive?"No look as if the thing had been insinuated there
since her death?"I should rather say that to every appearance she held it in
her hand when she lay down, but turning over, dropped it and then laid
upon it."Gryce's eyes, which had been very bright, ominously clouded;
evidently he had been disappointed in my answers, paying the letter
down, he stood musing, but suddenly lifted it again, scrutinized the
edges of the paper on which it was written, and, darting me a quick
look, vanished with it into the shade of the window curtain.His manner
was so peculiar, I involuntarily rose to follow; but he waved me back,
saying:

"Amuse yourself with that box on the table, which you had such an ado
over; see if it contains all we have a right to expect to find in it.I
want to be by myself for a moment."Subduing my astonishment, I proceeded to comply with his request, but
scarcely had I lifted the lid of the box before me when he came hurrying
back, flung the letter down on the table with an air of the greatest
excitement, and cried:

"Did I say there had never been anything like it since the Lafarge
affair?I tell you there has never been anything like it in any affair.It is the rummest case on record!Raymond," and his eyes, in his
excitement, actually met mine for the first time in my experience of
him, "prepare yourself for a disappointment.This pretended confession
of Hannah's is a fraud!""Yes; fraud, forgery, what you will; the girl never wrote it."Amazed, outraged almost, I bounded from my chair.Bending forward, he put the letter into my hand."Look at it," said he;
"examine it closely.Now tell me what is the first thing you notice in
regard to it?""Why, the first thing that strikes me, is that the words are printed,
instead of written; something which might be expected from this girl,
according to all accounts.""That they are printed on the inside of a sheet of ordinary paper----"

"Ordinary paper?""That is, a sheet of commercial note of the ordinary quality.""Why, yes; I should say so."Oh, I see, they run up close to the top of the page;
evidently the scissors have been used here.""In short, it is a large sheet, trimmed down to the size of commercial
note?""Don't you perceive what has been lost by means of this trimming down?""No, unless you mean the manufacturer's stamp in the corner.""But I don't see why the loss of that
should be deemed a matter of any importance."Not when you consider that by it we seem to be deprived of
all opportunity of tracing this sheet back to the quire of paper from
which it was taken?"then you are more of an amateur than I thought you.Don't you
see that, as Hannah could have had no motive for concealing where the
paper came from on which she wrote her dying words, this sheet must have
been prepared by some one else?""No," said I; "I cannot say that I see all that."Why should Hannah, a girl about to
commit suicide, care whether any clue was furnished, in her confession,
to the actual desk, drawer, or quire of paper from which the sheet was
taken, on which she wrote it?""Yet especial pains have been taken to destroy that clue.""But----"

"Then there is another thing.Raymond,
and tell me what you gather from it.""Why," said I, after complying, "that the girl, worn out with constant
apprehension, has made up her mind to do away with herself, and that
Henry Clavering----"

"Henry Clavering?"The interrogation was put with so much meaning, I looked up."Ah, I didn't know that Mr.Clavering's name was mentioned there; excuse
me.""His name is not mentioned, but a description is given so strikingly in
accordance----"

Here Mr."Does it not seem a little surprising to
you that a girl like Hannah should have stopped to describe a man she
knew by name?"Belden's story, don't you?""Consider her accurate in her relation of what took place here a year
ago?""Must believe, then, that Hannah, the go-between, was acquainted with
Mr.If her intention was, as she here
professes, to save Eleanore Leavenworth from the false imputation which
had fallen upon her, she would naturally take the most direct method
of doing it.This description of a man whose identity she could have at
once put beyond a doubt by the mention of his name is the work, not of
a poor, ignorant girl, but of some person who, in attempting to play the
_role_ of one, has signally failed.Belden,
according to you, maintains that Hannah told her, upon entering the
house, that Mary Leavenworth sent her here.But in this document, she
declares it to have been the work of Black Mustache.""I know; but could they not have both been parties to the transaction?""Yes," said he; "yet it is always a suspicious circumstance, when there
is a discrepancy between the written and spoken declaration of a person.But why do we stand here fooling, when a few words from this Mrs.Belden, you talk so much about, will probably settle the whole matter!""I have had thousands
from her to-day, and find the matter no nearer settled than in the
beginning.""_You_ have had," said he, "but I have not."One thing," said I, "before I go.What if Hannah had found the
sheet of paper, trimmed just as it is, and used it without any thought
of the suspicions it would occasion!"said he, "that is just what we are going to find out."Belden was in a flutter of impatience when I entered the
sitting-room.and what did I
imagine this detective would do for us?It was dreadful waiting there
alone for something, she knew not what.I calmed her as well as I could, telling her the detective had not yet
informed me what he could do, having some questions to ask her first.Gryce, who in the short interim of my absence had altered his mood
from the severe to the beneficent, received Mrs.Belden with just that
show of respectful courtesy likely to impress a woman as dependent as
she upon the good opinion of others.and this is the lady in whose house this very disagreeable event
has occurred," he exclaimed, partly rising in his enthusiasm to greet
her."May I request you to sit," he asked; "if a stranger may be allowed
to take the liberty of inviting a lady to sit in her own house.""It does not seem like my own house any longer," said she, but in a sad,
rather than an aggressive tone; so much had his genial way imposed upon
her."Little better than a prisoner here, go and come, keep silence or
speak, just as I am bidden; and all because an unhappy creature, whom
I took in for the most unselfish of motives, has chanced to die in my
house!"This sudden death
ought to be easily explained.You say you had no poison in the house?""And that no one has ever been here to see her?""So that she could not have procured any such thing if she had wished?""Unless," he added suavely, "she had it with her when she came here?"She brought no baggage; and as for her
pocket, I know everything there was in it, for I looked.""Some money in bills, more than you would have expected such a girl to
have, some loose pennies, and a common handkerchief.""Well, then, it is proved the girl didn't die of poison, there being
none in the house."He said this in so convinced a tone she was deceived."That is just what I have been telling Mr.Raymond," giving me a
triumphant look."Must have been heart disease," he went on, "You say she was well
yesterday?""I did not say that; she was, sir, very.""What, ma'am, this girl?"I
should think her anxiety about those she had left behind her in the city
would have been enough to keep her from being very cheerful."Belden; "but it wasn't so.On the
contrary, she never seemed to worry about them at all."not about Miss Eleanore, who, according to the papers, stands
in so cruel a position before the world?But perhaps she didn't know
anything about that--Miss Leavenworth's position, I mean?""Yes, she did, for I told her.I was so astonished I could not keep
it to myself.You see, I had always considered Eleanore as one above
reproach, and it so shocked me to see her name mentioned in the
newspaper in such a connection, that I went to Hannah and read the
article aloud, and watched her face to see how she took it."She looked as if she didn't understand; asked me why I
read such things to her, and told me she didn't want to hear any more;
that I had promised not to trouble her about this murder, and that if I
continued to do so she wouldn't listen."She put her hand over her ears and frowned in such a
sullen way I left the room.""She has, however, mentioned the subject since?"not asked what they were going to do with her mistress?""She has shown, however, that something was preying on her mind--fear,
remorse, or anxiety?""No, sir; on the contrary, she has oftener appeared like one secretly
elated."Gryce, with another sidelong look at me, "that was
very strange and unnatural.I used to try to explain it by thinking her sensibilities
had been blunted, or that she was too ignorant to comprehend the
seriousness of what had happened; but as I learned to know her better,
I gradually changed my mind.There was too much method in her gayety for
that.I could not help seeing she had some future before her for which
she was preparing herself.As, for instance, she asked me one day if I
thought she could learn to play on the piano.And I finally came to the
conclusion she had been promised money if she kept the secret intrusted
to her, and was so pleased with the prospect that she forgot the
dreadful past, and all connected with it.At all events, that was the
only explanation I could find for her general industry and desire to
improve herself, or for the complacent smiles I detected now and then
stealing over her face when she didn't know I was looking."Not such a smile as crept over the countenance of Mr.Gryce at that
moment, I warrant.Belden, "which made her death such a
shock to me.I couldn't believe that so cheerful and healthy a creature
could die like that, all in one night, without anybody knowing anything
about it.But----"

"Wait one moment," Mr."You speak of her endeavors
to improve herself."Her desire to learn things she didn't know; as, for instance, to write
and read writing.She could only clumsily print when she came here."Gryce would take a piece out of my arm, he griped it so.Do you mean to say that since she has been with you
she has learned to write?""Yes, sir; I used to set her copies and----"

"Where are these copies?"Gryce, subduing his voice to its
most professional tone.I'd like
to see some of them.I always made it a point to destroy them as soon as
they had answered their purpose.I didn't like to have such things lying
around."Do," said he; "and I will go with you.I want to take a look at things
upstairs, any way."And, heedless of his rheumatic feet, he rose and
prepared to accompany her."This is getting very intense," I whispered, as he passed me.The smile he gave me in reply would have made the fortune of a Thespian
Mephistopheles.Of the ten minutes of suspense which I endured in their absence, I say
nothing.At the end of that time they returned with their hands full of
paper boxes, which they flung down on the table."The writing-paper of the household," observed Mr.Gryce; "every scrap
and half-sheet which could be found.But, before you examine it, look at
this."And he held out a sheet of bluish foolscap, on which were written
some dozen imitations of that time-worn copy, "BE GOOD AND YOU WILL
BE HAPPY"; with an occasional "_Beauty soon fades,"_ and "_Evil
communications corrupt good manners."_

"What do you think of that?"The only specimens of her writing to be found.Not much like some scrawls we have seen, eh?"Belden says this girl has known how to write as good as this for
more than a week.Took great pride in it, and was continually talking
about how smart she was."Leaning over, he whispered in my ear, "This
thing you have in your hand must have been scrawled some time ago, if
she did it."Then aloud: "But let us look at the paper she used to write
on."Dashing open the covers of the boxes on the table, he took out the loose
sheets lying inside, and scattered them out before me.One glance showed
they were all of an utterly different quality from that used in the
confession."This is all the paper in the house," said he.Belden, who stood in
a sort of maze before us."Wasn't there one stray sheet lying around
somewhere, foolscap or something like that, which she might have got
hold of and used without your knowing it?""No, sir; I don't think so.I had only these kinds; besides, Hannah had
a whole pile of paper like this in her room, and wouldn't have been apt
to go hunting round after any stray sheets.""But you don't know what a girl like that might do.Look at this one,"
said I, showing her the blank side of the confession."Couldn't a sheet
like this have come from somewhere about the house?Examine it well; the
matter is important.""I have, and I say, no, I never had a sheet of paper like that in my
house."Gryce advanced and took the confession from my hand.As he did so,
he whispered: "What do you think now?Many chances that Hannah got up
this precious document?"I shook my head, convinced at last; but in another moment turned to him
and whispered back: "But, if Hannah didn't write it, who did?And how
came it to be found where it was?""That," said he, "is just what is left for us to learn."And, beginning
again, he put question after question concerning the girl's life in the
house, receiving answers which only tended to show that she could not
have brought the confession with her, much less received it from a
secret messenger.Belden's word, the mystery
seemed impenetrable, and I was beginning to despair of success, when Mr.Gryce, with an askance look at me, leaned towards Mrs.Belden and said:

"You received a letter from Miss Mary Leavenworth yesterday, I hear.""Now I want to ask you a question.Was the letter, as you see it, the
only contents of the envelope in which it came?Wasn't there one for
Hannah enclosed with it?"There was nothing in my letter for her; but she had a letter
herself yesterday.we both exclaimed; "and in the mail?""Yes; but it was not directed to her.It was"--casting me a look full of
despair, "directed to me.It was only by a certain mark in the corner of
the envelope that I knew----"

"Good heaven!"Why didn't you
speak of it before?What do you mean by allowing us to flounder about
here in the dark, when a glimpse at this letter might have set us right
at once?""I didn't think anything about it till this minute.I didn't know it was
of importance.I----"

But I couldn't restrain myself."No," said she; "I gave it to the girl yesterday; I haven't seen it
since."and I hastened
towards the door."You won't find it," said Mr.There
is nothing but a pile of burned paper in the corner.By the way, what
could that have been?"She hadn't anything to burn unless it was the
letter.""We will see about that," I muttered, hurrying upstairs and bringing
down the wash-bowl with its contents."If the letter was the one I saw
in your hand at the post-office, it was in a yellow envelope.""Yellow envelopes burn differently from white paper.I ought to be able
to tell the tinder made by a yellow envelope when I see it.Ah, the
letter has been destroyed; here is a piece of the envelope," and I drew
out of the heap of charred scraps a small bit less burnt than the rest,
and held it up."Then there is no use looking here for what the letter contained," said
Mr.Gryce, putting the wash-bowl aside."We will have to ask you, Mrs.It was directed to me, to be sure; but Hannah told
me, when she first requested me to teach her how to write, that she
expected such a letter, so I didn't open it when it came, but gave it to
her just as it was.""You, however, stayed by to see her read it?""No, sir; I was in too much of a flurry.Raymond had just come and I
had no time to think of her.My own letter, too, was troubling me.""But you surely asked her some questions about it before the day was
out?""Yes, sir, when I went up with her tea things; but she had nothing
to say.Hannah could be as reticent as any one I ever knew, when she
pleased.She didn't even admit it was from her mistress."then you thought it was from Miss Leavenworth?""Why, yes, sir; what else was I to think, seeing that mark in the
corner?Though, to be sure, it might have been put there by Mr."You say she was cheerful yesterday; was she so after receiving this
letter?""Yes, sir; as far as I could see.I wasn't with her long; the necessity
I felt of doing something with the box in my charge--but perhaps Mr."It was an exhausting evening, and quite put Hannah out of my head,
but----"

"Wait!"Gryce, and beckoning me into a corner, he whispered,
"Now comes in that experience of Q's.While you are gone from the house,
and before Mrs.Belden sees Hannah again, he has a glimpse of the girl
bending over something in the corner of her room which may very fairly
be the wash-bowl we found there.After which, he sees her swallow, in
the most lively way, a dose of something from a bit of paper."Very well, then," he cried, going back to Mrs."But----"

"But when I went upstairs to bed, I thought of the girl, and going to
her door opened it.The light was extinguished, and she seemed asleep,
so I closed it again and came out.""In something of the same position in which she was found this morning?""And that is all you can tell us, either of her letter or her mysterious
death?"Belden," said he, "you know Mr.Clavering's handwriting when _you_
see it?""Now, which of the two was upon the envelope of the letter you gave
Hannah?"It was a disguised handwriting and might have been that
of either; but I think----"

"Well?""That it was more like hers than his, though it wasn't like hers
either."Gryce enclosed the confession in his hand in the
envelope in which it had been found."You remember how large the letter
was which you gave her?""Oh, it was large, very large; one of the largest sort.""O yes; thick enough for two letters.""Large enough and thick enough to contain this?"laying the confession,
folded and enveloped as it was, before her."Yes, sir," giving it a look of startled amazement, "large enough and
thick enough to contain that."Gryce's eyes, bright as diamonds, flashed around the room, and
finally settled upon a fly traversing my coat-sleeve."Do you need to
ask now," he whispered, in a low voice, "where, and from whom, this
so-called confession comes?"He allowed himself one moment of silent triumph, then rising, began
folding the papers on the table and putting them in his pocket.He took me by the arm and led me across the hall into toe sitting-room."I am going back to New York, I am going to pursue this matter.I am
going to find out from whom came the poison which killed this girl, and
by whose hand this vile forgery of a confession was written.""But," said I, rather thrown off my balance by all this, "Q and the
coroner will be here presently, won't you wait to see them?""No; clues such as are given here must be followed while the trail is
hot; I can't afford to wait.""If I am not mistaken, they have already come," I remarked, as a
tramping of feet without announced that some one stood at the door."That is so," he assented, hastening to let them in.Judging from common experience, we had every reason to fear that an
immediate stop would be put to all proceedings on our part, as soon as
the coroner was introduced upon the scene.But happily for us and the
interest at stake, Dr.Fink, of R ----, proved to be a very sensible
man.He had only to hear a true story of the affair to recognize at
once its importance and the necessity of the most cautious action in
the matter.Further, by a sort of sympathy with Mr.Gryce, all the more
remarkable that he had never seen him before, he expressed himself
as willing to enter into our plans, offering not only to allow us the
temporary use of such papers as we desired, but even undertaking to
conduct the necessary formalities of calling a jury and instituting
an inquest in such a way as to give us time for the investigations we
proposed to make.Gryce was enabled to take the 6:30
train for New York, and I to follow on the 10 p.m.,--the calling of a
jury, ordering of an autopsy, and final adjournment of the inquiry till
the following Tuesday, having all taken place in the interim.FINE WORK


    "No hinge nor loop
     To hang a doubt on!""But yet the pity of it, Iago!Oh, Iago, the pity of it, Iago."Gryce before leaving R---- prepared me for
his next move."The clue to this murder is supplied by the paper on which the
confession is written.Find from whose desk or portfolio this especial
sheet was taken, and you find the double murderer," he had said.Consequently, I was not surprised when, upon visiting his house, early
the next morning, I beheld him seated before a table on which lay
a lady's writing-desk and a pile of paper, till told the desk was
Eleanore's."What," said I, "are you not
satisfied yet of her innocence?""O yes; but one must be thorough.No conclusion is valuable which is not
preceded by a full and complete investigation.Why," he cried, casting
his eyes complacently towards the fire-tongs, "I have even been
rummaging through Mr.Clavering's effects, though the confession bears
the proof upon its face that it could not have been written by him.It
is not enough to look for evidence where you expect to find it.You must
sometimes search for it where you don't.Now," said he, drawing the desk
before him, "I don't anticipate finding anything here of a criminating
character; but it is among the possibilities that I may; and that is
enough for a detective.""Did you see Miss Leavenworth this morning?"I asked, as he proceeded
to fulfil his intention by emptying the contents of the desk upon the
table."Yes; I was unable to procure what I desired without it.And she behaved
very handsomely, gave me the desk with her own hands, and never raised
an objection.To be sure, she had little idea what I was looking for;
thought, perhaps, I wanted to make sure it did not contain the letter
about which so much has been said.But it would have made but little
difference if she had known the truth.This desk contains nothing _we_
want.""Was she well; and had she heard of Hannah's sudden death?"I asked, in
my irrepressible anxiety."Yes, and feels it, as you might expect her to.But let us see what we
have here," said he, pushing aside the desk, and drawing towards him the
stack of paper I have already referred to."I found this pile, just as
you see it, in a drawer of the library table at Miss Mary Leavenworth's
house in Fifth Avenue.If I am not mistaken, it will supply us with the
clue we want.""But----"

"But this paper is square, while that of the confession is of the size
and shape of commercial note?I know; but you remember the sheet used in
the confession was trimmed down.Taking the confession from his pocket and the sheet from the pile before
him, he carefully compared them, then held them out for my inspection.A
glance showed them to be alike in color."Hold them up to the light," said he.I did so; the appearance presented by both was precisely alike.And, laying them both down on the
table, he placed the edges of the two sheets together.The lines on the
one accommodated themselves to the lines on the other; and that question
was decided."I was convinced of it," said he."From the
moment I pulled open that drawer and saw this mass of paper, I knew the
end was come.""But," I objected, in my old spirit of combativeness, "isn't there any
room for doubt?Every family on the
block might easily have specimens of it in their library.""It is letter size, and that has gone out.Leavenworth used it for his manuscript, or I doubt if it would have been
found in his library.But, if you are still incredulous, let us see what
can be done," and jumping up, he carried the confession to the window,
looked at it this way and that, and, finally discovering what he wanted,
came back and, laying it before me, pointed out one of the lines of
ruling which was markedly heavier than the rest, and another which was
so faint as to be almost undistinguishable."Defects like these often
run through a number of consecutive sheets," said he."If we could find
the identical half-quire from which this was taken, I might show you
proof that would dispel every doubt," and taking up the one that lay on
top, he rapidly counted the sheets."It might have
been taken from this one," said he; but, upon looking closely at the
ruling, he found it to be uniformly distinct.The remainder of the paper, some dozen or so half-quires, looked
undisturbed.Gryce tapped his fingers on the table and a frown
crossed his face."Such a pretty thing, if it could have been done!"Suddenly he took up the next half-quire."Count the
sheets," said he, thrusting it towards me, and himself lifting another."Go on with the rest," he cried.I counted the sheets in the next; twelve.He counted those in the one
following, and paused.He counted again, and quietly put them aside."I made a mistake," said
he.Taking another half-quire, he went
through with the same operation;--in vain.With a sigh of impatience he
flung it down on the table and looked up.he cried, "what is
the matter?""There are but eleven sheets in this package," I said, placing it in his
hand.The excitement he immediately evinced was contagious.Oppressed as I
was, I could not resist his eagerness.the light on the inside, the heavy one on the
outside, and both in positions precisely corresponding to those on
this sheet of Hannah's."The veriest doubter must succumb before this," returned I.

With something like a considerate regard for my emotion, he turned away."I am obliged to congratulate myself, notwithstanding the gravity of the
discovery that has been made," said he."It is so neat, so very neat,
and so conclusive.I declare I am myself astonished at the perfection
of the thing.he suddenly cried, in a tone
of the greatest admiration.I declare it is almost a pity to entrap a woman who has done
as well as this--taken a sheet from the very bottom of the pile, trimmed
it into another shape, and then, remembering the girl couldn't write,
put what she had to say into coarse, awkward printing, Hannah-like.or would have been, if any other man than myself had
had this thing in charge."And, all animated and glowing with his
enthusiasm, he eyed the chandelier above him as if it were the
embodiment of his own sagacity.Sunk in despair, I let him go on."Watched, circumscribed
as she was, could she have done any better?I hardly think so; the fact
of Hannah's having learned to write after she left here was fatal.No,
she could not have provided against that contingency."Gryce," I here interposed, unable to endure this any longer; "did
you have an interview with Miss Mary Leavenworth this morning?""No," said he; "it was not in the line of my present purpose to do so.I
doubt, indeed, if she knew I was in her house.A servant maid who has a
grievance is a very valuable assistant to a detective.With Molly at my
side, I didn't need to pay my respects to the mistress."Gryce," I asked, after another moment of silent self-congratulation
on his part, and of desperate self-control on mine, "what do you propose
to do now?You have followed your clue to the end and are satisfied.Such knowledge as this is the precursor of action."we will see," he returned, going to his private desk and
bringing out the box of papers which we had no opportunity of looking at
while in R----.John travelled to the office."First let us examine these documents, and see if they
do not contain some hint which may be of service to us."And taking out
the dozen or so loose sheets which had been torn from Eleanore's Diary,
he began turning them over.While he was doing this, I took occasion to examine the contents of
the box.Belden had led me to
expect,--a certificate of marriage between Mary and Mr.Clavering and
a half-dozen or more letters.While glancing over the former, a short
exclamation from Mr.He thrust into my hand the leaves of Eleanore's Diary."Most of it is a repetition of what you have already heard from Mrs.Belden, though given from a different standpoint; but there is one
passage in it which, if I am not mistaken, opens up the way to an
explanation of this murder such as we have not had yet.Begin at the
beginning; you won't find it dull."Eleanore's feelings and thoughts during that anxious time, dull!Mustering up my self-possession, I spread out the leaves in their order
and commenced:

"R----, July 6,-"

"Two days after they got there, you perceive," Mr.--A gentleman was introduced to us to-day upon the _piazza_ whom
I cannot forbear mentioning; first, because he is the most perfect
specimen of manly beauty I ever beheld, and secondly, because Mary, who
is usually so voluble where gentlemen are concerned, had nothing to say
when, in the privacy of our own apartment, I questioned her as to the
effect his appearance and conversation had made upon her.The fact
that he is an Englishman may have something to do with this; Uncle's
antipathy to every one of that nation being as well known to her as to
me.Her experience with
Charlie Somerville has made me suspicious.What if the story of last
summer were to be repeated here, with an Englishman for the hero!But
I will not allow myself to contemplate such a possibility.Uncle will
return in a few days, and then all communication with one who, however
prepossessing, is of a family and race with whom it is impossible for
us to unite ourselves, must of necessity cease.I doubt if I should have
thought twice of all this if Mr.Clavering had not betrayed, upon his
introduction to Mary, such intense and unrestrained admiration.Mary not only submits to the
attentions of Mr.To-day she sat
two hours at the piano singing over to him her favorite songs, and
to-night--But I will not put down every trivial circumstance that comes
under my observation; it is unworthy of me.And yet, how can I shut my
eyes when the happiness of so many I love is at stake!Clavering is not absolutely in love with Mary, he is on
the verge of it.He is a very fine-looking man, and too honorable to be
trifled with in this reckless fashion.She was absolutely
wonderful to-night in scarlet and silver.I think her smile the sweetest
I ever beheld, and in this I am sure Mr.Clavering passionately agrees
with me; he never looked away from her to-night.But it is not so easy
to read _her_ heart.To be sure, she appears anything but indifferent
to his fine appearance, strong sense, and devoted affection.But did she
not deceive us into believing she loved Charlie Somerville?In her case,
blush and smile go for little, I fear.Would it not be wiser under the
circumstances to say, I hope?Mary came into my room this evening, and
absolutely startled me by falling at my side and burying her face in my
lap.'Oh, Eleanore, Eleanore!'she murmured, quivering with what seemed
to me very happy sobs.But when I strove to lift her head to my breast,
she slid from my arms, and drawing herself up into her old attitude of
reserved pride, raised her hand as if to impose silence, and haughtily
left the room.There is but one interpretation to put upon this.Clavering has expressed his sentiments, and she is filled with that
reckless delight which in its first flush makes one insensible to the
existence of barriers which have hitherto been deemed impassable.Little did I think when I wrote the above that Uncle was
already in the house.He arrived unexpectedly on the last train, and
came into my room just as I was putting away my diary.Looking a little
care-worn, he took me in his arms and then asked for Mary.I dropped my
head, and could not help stammering as I replied that she was in her own
room.Instantly his love took alarm, and leaving me, he hastened to
her apartment, where I afterwards learned he came upon her sitting
abstractedly before her dressing-table with Mr.Clavering's family ring
on her finger.An unhappy scene, I fear,
for Mary is ill this morning, and Uncle exceedingly melancholy and
stern.Uncle not only refuses to consider
for a moment the question of Mary's alliance with Mr.Clavering, but
even goes so far as to demand his instant and unconditional dismissal.The knowledge of this came to me in the most distressing way.Recognizing the state of affairs, but secretly rebelling against a
prejudice which seemed destined to separate two persons otherwise fitted
for each other, I sought Uncle's presence this morning after breakfast,
and attempted to plead their cause.But he almost instantly stopped me
with the remark, 'You are the last one, Eleanore, who should seek to
promote this marriage.'Trembling with apprehension, I asked him
why.'For the reason that by so doing you work entirely for your own
interest.'More and more troubled, I begged him to explain himself.'I
mean,' said he, 'that if Mary disobeys me by marrying this Englishman,
I shall disinherit her, and substitute your name for hers in my will as
well as in my affection.'"For a moment everything swam before my eyes.'You will never make me so
wretched!''I will make you my heiress, if Mary persists
in her present determination,' he declared, and without further word
sternly left the room.What could I do but fall on my knees and pray!Of all in this miserable house, I am the most wretched.But I shall not be called upon to do it; Mary will give up Mr.Isn't it
becoming plain enough what was Mary's motive for this murder?But go on;
let us hear what followed."The next entry is dated July 19, and
runs thus:

"I was right.After a long struggle with Uncle's invincible will, Mary
has consented to dismiss Mr.I was in the room when she
made known her decision, and I shall never forget our Uncle's look of
gratified pride as he clasped her in his arms and called her his own
True Heart.He has evidently been very much exercised over this matter,
and I cannot but feel greatly relieved that affairs have terminated
so satisfactorily.What is there in her manner that vaguely
disappoints me?I only know that I felt a powerful
shrinking overwhelm me when she turned her face to me and asked if I
were satisfied now.But I conquered my feelings and held out my hand.The shadow of our late trial is upon
me yet; I cannot shake it off.Clavering's despairing
face wherever I go.How is it that Mary preserves her cheerfulness?If
she does not love him, I should think the respect which she must feel
for his disappointment would keep her from levity at least.Nothing I could say sufficed to keep him.Mary has only nominally separated from
Mr.Clavering; she still cherishes the idea of one day uniting herself
to him in marriage.The fact was revealed to me in a strange way not
necessary to mention here; and has since been confirmed by Mary herself.'I admire the man,' she declares, 'and have no intention of giving him
up.'Her only answer was a bitter
smile and a short,--'I leave that for you to do.'Worn completely out, but before my blood cools let
me write.I have just returned from seeing her give her
hand to Henry Clavering.Strange that I can write it without quivering
when my whole soul is one flush of indignation and revolt.Having left my room for a few minutes this morning,
I returned to find on my dressing-table a note from Mary in which she
informed me that she was going to take Mrs.Belden for a drive and would
not be back for some hours.Convinced, as I had every reason to be, that
she was on her way to meet Mr.Clavering, I only stopped to put on my
hat--"

There the Diary ceased."She was probably interrupted by Mary at this point," explained Mr."But we have come upon the one thing we wanted to know.Leavenworth threatened to supplant Mary with Eleanore if she persisted
in marrying contrary to his wishes.She did so marry, and to avoid the
consequences of her act she----"

"Say no more," I returned, convinced at last."But the writer of these words is saved," I went on, trying to grasp
the one comfort left me."No one who reads this Diary will ever dare to
insinuate she is capable of committing a crime.""Assuredly not; the Diary settles that matter effectually."I tried to be man enough to think of that and nothing else.To rejoice
in her deliverance, and let every other consideration go; but in this I
did not succeed."But Mary, her cousin, almost her sister, is lost," I
muttered.Gryce thrust his hands into his pockets and, for the first time,
showed some evidence of secret disturbance."Yes, I am afraid she is;
I really am afraid she is."Then after a pause, during which I felt a
certain thrill of vague hope: "Such an entrancing creature too!It is a
pity, it positively is a pity!I declare, now that the thing is worked
up, I begin to feel almost sorry we have succeeded so well.If there was the least loophole out of it," he muttered.The thing is clear as A, B, C."Suddenly he rose, and began
pacing the floor very thoughtfully, casting his glances here, there, and
everywhere, except at me, though I believe now, as then, my face was all
he saw."Would it be a very great grief to you, Mr.Raymond, if Miss Mary
Leavenworth should be arrested on this charge of murder?"he asked,
pausing before a sort of tank in which two or three disconsolate-looking
fishes were slowly swimming about."Yes," said I, "it would; a very great grief.""Yet it must be done," said he, though with a strange lack of his usual
decision."As an honest official, trusted to bring the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth to the notice of the proper authorities, I have got to do
it."Again that strange thrill of hope at my heart induced by his peculiar
manner.I am not so rich or so famous that I can afford to forget all that a
success like this may bring me.No, lovely as she is, I have got to push
it through."But even as he said this, he became still more thoughtful,
gazing down into the murky depths of the wretched tank before him with
such an intentness I half expected the fascinated fishes to rise from
the water and return his gaze.After a little while he turned, his indecision utterly gone.I shall then have my report ready for
the Superintendent.I should like to show it to you first, so don't fail
me."There was something so repressed in his expression, I could not prevent
myself from venturing one question."Yes," he returned, but in a peculiar tone, and with a peculiar gesture."And you are going to make the arrest you speak of?"GATHERED THREADS


    "This is the short and the long of it."PROMPTLY at the hour named, I made my appearance at Mr.I
found him awaiting me on the threshold."I have met you," said he gravely, "for the purpose of requesting you
not to speak during the coming interview.I am to do the talking; you
the listening.Neither are you to be surprised at anything I may do or
say.I am in a facetious mood"--he did not look so--"and may take it
into my head to address you by another name than your own.If I do,
don't mind it.Above all, don't talk: remember that."And without
waiting to meet my look of doubtful astonishment, he led me softly
up-stairs.The room in which I had been accustomed to meet him was at the top of
the first flight, but he took me past that into what appeared to be the
garret story, where, after many cautionary signs, he ushered me into
a room of singularly strange and unpromising appearance.In the first
place, it was darkly gloomy, being lighted simply by a very dim and
dirty skylight.Next, it was hideously empty; a pine table and two
hard-backed chairs, set face to face at each end of it, being the only
articles in the room.Lastly, it was surrounded by several closed doors
with blurred and ghostly ventilators over their tops which, being round,
looked like the blank eyes of a row of staring mummies.Altogether it
was a lugubrious spot, and in the present state of my mind made me
feel as if something unearthly and threatening lay crouched in the very
atmosphere.Nor, sitting there cold and desolate, could I imagine that
the sunshine glowed without, or that life, beauty, and pleasure paraded
the streets below.Gryce's expression, as he took a seat and beckoned me to do the
same, may have had something to do with this strange sensation, it was
so mysteriously and sombrely expectant."You'll not mind the room," said he, in so muffled a tone I scarcely
heard him."It's an awful lonesome spot, I know; but folks with such
matters before them mustn't be too particular as to the places in which
they hold their consultations, if they don't want all the world to know
as much as they do.Smith," and he gave me an admonitory shake of his
finger, while his voice took a more distinct tone, "I have done the
business; the reward is mine; the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth is found,
and in two hours will be in custody.Do you want to know who it
is?"leaning forward with every appearance of eagerness in tone and
expression.any
great change taken place in his conclusions?All this preparation could
not be for the purpose of acquainting me with what I already knew, yet--

He cut short my conjectures with a low, expressive chuckle."It was a
long chase, I tell you," raising his voice still more; "a tight go; a
woman in the business too; but all the women in the world can't pull
the wool over the eyes of Ebenezer Gryce when he is on a trail; and the
assassin of Mr.Leavenworth and"--here his voice became actually shrill
in his excitement--"and of Hannah Chester is found.he went on, though I had neither spoken nor made any move; "you
didn't know Hannah Chester was murdered.Well, she wasn't in one sense
of the word, but in another she was, and by the same hand that killed
the old gentleman.This scrap of paper
was found on the floor of her room; it had a few particles of white
powder sticking to it; those particles were tested last night and found
to be poison.But you say the girl took it herself, that she was a
suicide.You are right, she did take it herself, and it was a suicide;
but who terrified her into this act of self-destruction?Why, the one
who had the most reason to fear her testimony, of course.Well, sir, this girl left a confession behind her, throwing the
onus of the whole crime on a certain party believed to be innocent; this
confession was a forged one, known from three facts; first, that the
paper upon which it was written was unobtainable by the girl in the
place where she was; secondly, that the words used therein were printed
in coarse, awkward characters, whereas Hannah, thanks to the teaching of
the woman under whose care she has been since the murder, had learned to
write very well; thirdly, that the story told in the confession does not
agree with the one related by the girl herself.Now the fact of a forged
confession throwing the guilt upon an innocent party having been found
in the keeping of this ignorant girl, killed by a dose of poison, taken
with the fact here stated, that on the morning of the day on which she
killed herself the girl received from some one manifestly acquainted
with the customs of the Leavenworth family a letter large enough and
thick enough to contain the confession folded, as it was when found,
makes it almost certain to my mind that the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth
sent this powder and this so-called confession to the girl, meaning
her to use them precisely as she did: for the purpose of throwing off
suspicion from the right track and of destroying herself at the same
time; for, as you know, dead men tell no tales."He paused and looked at the dingy skylight above us.Why did the
air seem to grow heavier and heavier?Why did I shudder in vague
apprehension?I knew all this before; why did it strike me, then, as
something new?Ah, that is the secret; that is the bit of
knowledge which is to bring me fame and fortune.But, secret or not,
I don't mind telling you"; lowering his voice and rapidly raising it
again."The fact is, _I_ can't keep it to myself; it burns like a new
dollar in my pocket.Smith, my boy, the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth--but
stay, who does the world say it is?Whom do the papers point at and
shake their heads over?a young, beautiful, bewitching woman!The papers are right; it is a woman; young, beautiful, and
bewitching too.There is more
than one woman in this affair.Since Hannah's death I have heard it
openly advanced that she was the guilty party in the crime: bah!Others
cry it is the niece who was so unequally dealt with by her uncle in his
will: bah!But folks are not without some justification for this
latter assertion.Eleanore Leavenworth did know more of this matter than
appeared.Worse than that, Eleanore Leavenworth stands in a position of
positive peril to-day.If you don't think so, let me show you what the
detectives have against her."First, there is the fact that a handkerchief, with her name on it, was
found stained with pistol grease upon the scene of murder; a place which
she explicitly denies having entered for twenty-four hours previous to
the discovery of the dead body."Secondly, the fact that she not only evinced terror when confronted
with this bit of circumstantial evidence, but manifested a decided
disposition, both at this time and others, to mislead inquiry, shirking
a direct answer to some questions and refusing all answer to others."Thirdly, that an attempt was made by her to destroy a certain letter
evidently relating to this crime."Fourthly, that the key to the library door was seen in her possession."All this, taken with the fact that the fragments of the letter which
this same lady attempted to destroy within an hour after the inquest
were afterwards put together, and were found to contain a bitter
denunciation of one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, by a gentleman we will
call _X_ in other words, an unknown quantity--makes out a dark case
against _you,_ especially as after investigations revealed the fact that
a secret underlay the history of the Leavenworth family.That, unknown
to the world at large, and Mr.Leavenworth in particular, a marriage
ceremony had been performed a year before in a little town called F----
between a Miss Leavenworth and this same _X._ That, in other words, the
unknown gentleman who, in the letter partly destroyed by Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, complained to Mr.Leavenworth of the treatment received
by him from one of his nieces, was in fact the secret husband of that
niece.And that, moreover, this same gentleman, under an assumed name,
called on the night of the murder at the house of Mr.Leavenworth and
asked for Miss Eleanore."Now you see, with all this against her, Eleanore Leavenworth is lost
if it cannot be proved, first that the articles testifying against her,
viz.: the handkerchief, letter, and key, passed after the murder through
other hands, before reaching hers; and secondly, that some one else had
even a stronger reason than she for desiring Mr.Leavenworth's death at
this time."Smith, my boy, both of these hypotheses have been established by me.By dint of moleing into old secrets, and following unpromising clues, I
have finally come to the conclusion that not Eleanore Leavenworth, dark
as are the appearances against her, but another woman, beautiful as
she, and fully as interesting, is the true criminal.In short, that her
cousin, the exquisite Mary, is the murderer of Mr.Leavenworth, and by
inference of Hannah Chester also."He brought this out with such force, and with such a look of triumph
and appearance of having led up to it, that I was for the moment
dumbfounded, and started as if I had not known what he was going to say.The stir I made seemed to awake an echo.Something like a suppressed
cry was in the air about me.All the room appeared to breathe horror and
dismay.Yet when, in the excitement of this fancy, I half turned round
to look, I found nothing but the blank eyes of those dull ventilators
staring upon me.Every one
else is engaged in watching the movements of Eleanore Leavenworth; I
only know where to put my hand upon the real culprit.Ebenezer Gryce deceived after a month of hard work!You are as
bad as Miss Leavenworth herself, who has so little faith in my sagacity
that she offered me, of all men, an enormous reward if I would find for
her the assassin of her uncle!But that is neither here nor there;
you have your doubts, and you are waiting for me to solve them.Know first that on the morning of the inquest I made
one or two discoveries not to be found in the records, viz.: that the
handkerchief picked up, as I have said, in Mr.Leavenworth's library,
had notwithstanding its stains of pistol grease, a decided perfume
lingering about it.Going to the dressing-table of the two ladies, I
sought for that perfume, and found it in Mary's room, not Eleanore's.This led me to examine the pockets of the dresses respectively worn by
them the evening before.In that of Eleanore I found a handkerchief,
presumably the one she had carried at that time.But in Mary's there was
none, nor did I see any lying about her room as if tossed down on
her retiring.The conclusion I drew from this was, that she, and
not Eleanore, had carried the handkerchief into her uncle's room, a
conclusion emphasized by the fact privately communicated to me by one of
the servants, that Mary was in Eleanore's room when the basket of clean
clothes was brought up with this handkerchief lying on top."But knowing the liability we are to mistake in such matters as these,
I made another search in the library, and came across a very curious
thing.Lying on the table was a penknife, and scattered on the floor
beneath, in close proximity to the chair, were two or three minute
portions of wood freshly chipped off from the leg of the table; all of
which looked as if some one of a nervous disposition had been sitting
there, whose hand in a moment of self-forgetfulness had caught up the
knife and unconsciously whittled the table.A little thing, you say;
but when the question is, which of two ladies, one of a calm and
self-possessed nature, the other restless in her ways and excitable in
her disposition, was in a certain spot at a certain time, it is these
little things that become almost deadly in their significance.No one
who has been with these two women an hour can hesitate as to whose
delicate hand made that cut in Mr.I distinctly overheard Eleanore accuse her cousin
of this deed.Now such a woman as Eleanore Leavenworth has proved
herself to be never would accuse a relative of crime without the
strongest and most substantial reasons.First, she must have been sure
her cousin stood in a position of such emergency that nothing but
the death of her uncle could release her from it; secondly, that her
cousin's character was of such a nature she would not hesitate to
relieve herself from a desperate emergency by the most desperate of
means; and lastly, been in possession of some circumstantial evidence
against her cousin, seriously corroborative of her suspicions.Smith,
all this was true of Eleanore Leavenworth.As to the character of her
cousin, she has had ample proof of her ambition, love of money, caprice
and deceit, it having been Mary Leavenworth, and not Eleanore, as was
first supposed, who had contracted the secret marriage already spoken
of.Of the critical position in which she stood, let the threat once
made by Mr.Leavenworth to substitute her cousin's name for hers in
his will in case she had married this _x_ be remembered, as well as the
tenacity with which Mary clung to her hopes of future fortune; while for
the corroborative testimony of her guilt which Eleanore is supposed
to have had, remember that previous to the key having been found in
Eleanore's possession, she had spent some time in her cousin's room; and
that it was at Mary's fireplace the half-burned fragments of that letter
were found,--and you have the outline of a report which in an hour's
time from this will lead to the arrest of Mary Leavenworth as the
assassin of her uncle and benefactor."A silence ensued which, like the darkness of Egypt, could be felt;
then a great and terrible cry rang through the room, and a man's form,
rushing from I knew not where, shot by me and fell at Mr.Gryce's feet
shrieking out:

"It is a lie!Mary Leavenworth is innocent as a babe unborn.CULMINATION


    "Saint seducing gold.""When our actions do not,
     Our fears do make us traitors."I NEVER saw such a look of mortal triumph on the face of a man as that
which crossed the countenance of the detective."Well," said he, "this is unexpected, but not wholly unwelcome.I am
truly glad to learn that Miss Leavenworth is innocent; but I must hear
some few more particulars before I shall be satisfied.Leavenworth, how comes it that things look so black against everybody
but yourself?"But in the hot, feverish eyes which sought him from the writhing form at
his feet, there was mad anxiety and pain, but little explanation.Seeing
him making unavailing efforts to speak, I drew near."Lean on me," said I, lifting him to his feet.His face, relieved forever from its mask of repression, turned towards
me with the look of a despairing spirit."Save
her--Mary--they are sending a report--stop it!""If there is a man here who believes in
God and prizes woman's honor, let him stop the issue of that report."And Henry Clavering, dignified as ever, but in a state of extreme
agitation, stepped into our midst through an open door at our right.But at the sight of his face, the man in our arms quivered, shrieked,
and gave one bound that would have overturned Mr.Clavering, herculean
of frame as he was, had not Mr.he cried; and holding back the secretary with one hand--where
was his rheumatism now!--he put the other in his pocket and drew thence
a document which he held up before Mr."It has not gone
yet," said he; "be easy.And you," he went on, turning towards Trueman
Harwell, "be quiet, or----"

His sentence was cut short by the man springing from his grasp."Let me have my revenge on him who, in face of all I
have done for Mary Leavenworth, dares to call her his wife!Let me--"
But at this point he paused, his quivering frame stiffening into stone,
and his clutching hands, outstretched for his rival's throat, falling
heavily back.Clavering's shoulder:
"it is she!she--" a low, shuddering sigh of longing and despair finished the
sentence: the door opened, and Mary Leavenworth stood before us!It was a moment to make young hairs turn gray.To see her face, so pale,
so haggard, so wild in its fixed horror, turned towards Henry Clavering,
to the utter ignoring of the real actor in this most horrible scene!Trueman Harwell could not stand it.cold, cold; not one glance for me,
though I have just drawn the halter from her neck and fastened it about
my own!"And, breaking from the clasp of the man who in his jealous rage would
now have withheld him, he fell on his knees before Mary, clutching her
dress with frenzied hands."You _shall_ look at me," he cried; "you
_shall_ listen to me!I will not lose body and soul for nothing.Mary,
they said you were in peril!I could not endure that thought, so I
uttered the truth,--yes, though I knew what the consequence would
be,--and all I want now is for you to say you believe me, when I swear
that I only meant to secure to you the fortune you so much desired; that
I never dreamed it would come to this; that it was because I loved you,
and hoped to win your love in return that I----"

But she did not seem to see him, did not seem to hear him.Her eyes were
fixed upon Henry Clavering with an awful inquiry in their depths, and
none but he could move her."Ice that you are, you
would not turn your head if I should call to you from the depths of
hell!"Pushing her hands down upon his
shoulders as though she would sweep some impediment from her path, she
endeavored to advance.she cried, indicating
her husband with one quivering hand."What has he done that he should be
brought here to confront me at this awful time?"'"I told her to come here to meet her uncle's murderer," whispered Mr.But before I could reply to her, before Mr.Clavering himself could
murmur a word, the guilty wretch before her had started to his feet.It is because these gentlemen,
chivalrous and honorable as they consider themselves, think that you,
the beauty and the Sybarite, committed with your own white hand the
deed of blood which has brought you freedom and fortune.Yes, yes, this
man"--turning and pointing at me--"friend as he has made himself out to
be, kindly and honorable as you have doubtless believed him, but who in
every look he has bestowed upon you, every word he has uttered in your
hearing during all these four horrible weeks, has been weaving a cord
for your neck--thinks you the assassin of your uncle, unknowing that a
man stood at your side ready to sweep half the world from your path if
that same white hand rose in bidding.now she could see him: now she could hear him!"Yes," clutching her robe again as she hastily recoiled; "didn't you
know it?When in that dreadful hour of your rejection by your uncle, you
cried aloud for some one to help you, didn't you know----"

"Don't!"she shrieked, bursting from him with a look of unspeakable
horror.she gasped, "is the mad cry of a stricken
woman for aid and sympathy the call for a murderer?"And turning away
in horror, she moaned: "Who that ever looks at me now will forget that
a man--such a man!--dared to think that, because I was in mortal
perplexity, I would accept the murder of my best friend as a relief from
it!""Oh, what a chastisement for folly!""What a punishment for the love of money which has always been
my curse!"Henry Clavering could no longer restrain himself, leaping to her side,
he bent over her.Are you guiltless of
any deeper wrong?Is there no link of complicity between you two?Have
you nothing on your soul but an inordinate desire to preserve your place
in your uncle's will, even at the risk of breaking my heart and wronging
your noble cousin?placing
his hand on her head, he pressed it slowly back and gazed into her eyes;
then, without a word, took her to his breast and looked calmly around
him.It was the uplifting of a stifling pall.No one in the room, unless it
was the wretched criminal shivering before us, but felt a sudden influx
of hope.Even Mary's own countenance caught a glow.she whispered,
withdrawing from his arms to look better into his face, "and is this the
man I have trifled with, injured, and tortured, till the very name of
Mary Leavenworth might well make him shudder?Is this he whom I married
in a fit of caprice, only to forsake and deny?Henry, do you declare
me innocent in face of all you have seen and heard; in face of that
moaning, chattering wretch before us, and my own quaking flesh and
evident terror; with the remembrance on your heart and in your mind of
the letter I wrote you the morning after the murder, in which I prayed
you to keep away from me, as I was in such deadly danger the least hint
given to the world that I had a secret to conceal would destroy me?Do
you, can you, will you, declare me innocent before God and the world?"A light such as had never visited her face before passed slowly over it."Then God forgive me the wrong I have done this noble heart, for I can
never forgive myself!"Before I
accept any further tokens of your generous confidence, let me show you
what I am.You shall know the worst of the woman you have taken to your
heart.Raymond," she cried, turning towards me for the first time,
"in those days when, with such an earnest desire for my welfare (you see
I do not believe this man's insinuations), you sought to induce me to
speak out and tell all I knew concerning this dreadful deed, I did not
do it because of my selfish fears.I knew the case looked dark against
me.Eleanore herself--and it was the keenest
pang I had to endure--believed me guilty.She knew
first, from the directed envelope she had found lying underneath my
uncle's dead body on the library table, that he had been engaged at the
moment of death in summoning his lawyer to make that change in his will
which would transfer my claims to her; secondly, that notwithstanding
my denial of the same, I had been down to his room the night before, for
she had heard my door open and my dress rustle as I passed out.But that
was not all; the key that every one felt to be a positive proof of guilt
wherever found, had been picked up by her from the floor of my room; the
letter written by Mr.Clavering to my uncle was found in my fire; and
the handkerchief which she had seen me take from the basket of clean
clothes, was produced at the inquest stained with pistol grease.I could not stir without encountering some new toil.I knew I was
innocent; but if I failed to satisfy my cousin of this, how could I
hope to convince the general public, if once called upon to do so.Worse
still, if Eleanore, with every apparent motive for desiring long life
to our uncle, was held in such suspicion because of a few circumstantial
evidences against her, what would I not have to fear if these evidences
were turned against me, the heiress!The tone and manner of the juryman
at the inquest that asked who would be most benefited by my uncle's will
showed but too plainly.When, therefore, Eleanore, true to her heart's
generous instincts, closed her lips and refused to speak when speech
would have been my ruin, I let her do it, justifying myself with the
thought that she had deemed me capable of crime, and so must bear the
consequences.Nor, when I saw how dreadful these were likely to
prove, did I relent.Fear of the ignominy, suspense, and danger which
confession would entail sealed my lips.That
was when, in the last conversation we had, I saw that, notwithstanding
appearances, you believed in Eleanore's innocence, and the thought
crossed me you might be induced to believe in mine if I threw myself
upon your mercy.Clavering came; and as in a flash I
seemed to realize what my future life would be, stained by suspicion,
and, instead of yielding to my impulse, went so far in the other
direction as to threaten Mr.Clavering with a denial of our marriage if
he approached me again till all danger was over."Yes, he will tell you that was my welcome to him when, with heart
and brain racked by long suspense, he came to my door for one word of
assurance that the peril I was in was not of my own making.That was the
greeting I gave him after a year of silence every moment of which was
torture to him.But he forgives me; I see it in his eyes; I hear it in
his accents; and you--oh, if in the long years to come you can forget
what I have made Eleanore suffer by my selfish fears; if with the shadow
of her wrong before you, you can by the grace of some sweet hope think
a little less hardly of me, do.As for this man--torture could not be
worse to me than this standing with him in the same room--let him
come forward and declare if I by look or word have given him reason to
believe I understood his passion, much less returned it.""Don't you see it was your indifference which
drove me mad?To stand before you, to agonize after you, to follow you
with thoughts in every move you made; to know my soul was welded to
yours with bands of steel no fire could melt, no force destroy, no
strain dissever; to sleep under the same roof, sit at the same table,
and yet meet not so much as one look to show me you understood!It was
that which made my life a hell.If I had to leap into a pit of flame, you should know what I was, and
what my passion for you was.Shrink as you will from my presence, cower as you may to the weak man
you call husband, you can never forget the love of Trueman Harwell;
never forget that love, love, love, was the force which led me down into
your uncle's room that night, and lent me will to pull the trigger which
poured all the wealth you hold this day into your lap.Yes," he went on,
towering in his preternatural despair till even the noble form of Henry
Clavering looked dwarfed beside him, "every dollar that chinks from
your purse shall talk of me.Every gew-gaw which flashes on that haughty
head, too haughty to bend to me, shall shriek my name into your ears.Fashion, pomp, luxury,--you will have them all; but till gold loses its
glitter and ease its attraction you will never forget the hand that gave
them to you!"With a look whose evil triumph I cannot describe, he put his hand into
the arm of the waiting detective, and in another moment would have been
led from the room; when Mary, crushing down the swell of emotions that
was seething in her breast, lifted her head and said:

"No, Trueman Harwell; I cannot give you even that thought for your
comfort.Wealth so laden would bring nothing but torture.I cannot
accept the torture, so must release the wealth.From this day, Mary
Clavering owns nothing but what comes to her from the husband she has so
long and so basely wronged."And raising her hands to her ears, she tore
out the diamonds which hung there, and flung them at the feet of the
unfortunate man.With a yell such as I never thought
to listen to from the lips of a man, he flung up his arms, while all the
lurid light of madness glared on his face."And I have given my soul to
hell for a shadow!""Well, that is the best day's work I ever did!Raymond, upon the success of the most daring game ever played in a
detective's office."I looked at the triumphant countenance of Mr.I cried; "did you plan all this?""Could I stand here, seeing how things
have turned out, if I had not?You
are a gentleman, but we can well shake hands over this.I have never
known such a satisfactory conclusion to a bad piece of business in all
my professional career."We did shake hands, long and fervently, and then I asked him to explain
himself."Well," said he, "there has always been one thing that plagued me, even
in the very moment of my strongest suspicion against this woman, and
that was, the pistol-cleaning business.I could not reconcile it with
what I knew of womankind.I could not make it seem the act of a woman.Did you ever know a woman who cleaned a pistol?They can fire them,
and do; but after firing them, they do not clean them.Now it is a
principle which every detective recognizes, that if of a hundred leading
circumstances connected with a crime, ninety-nine of these are acts
pointing to the suspected party with unerring certainty, but the
hundredth equally important act one which that person could not have
performed, the whole fabric of suspicion is destroyed.Recognizing this
principle, then, as I have said, I hesitated when it came to the point
of arrest.The chain was complete; the links were fastened; but one link
was of a different size and material from the rest; and in this argued a
break in the chain.Harwell, two persons whom I had no reason to suspect,
but who were the only persons beside herself who could have committed
this crime, being the only persons of intellect who were in the house
or believed to be, at the time of the murder, I notified them separately
that the assassin of Mr.Leavenworth was not only found, but was
about to be arrested in my house, and that if they wished to hear
the confession which would be sure to follow, they might have the
opportunity of doing so by coming here at such an hour.They were both
too much interested, though for very different reasons, to refuse; and
I succeeded in inducing them to conceal themselves in the two rooms from
which you saw them issue, knowing that if either of them had committed
this deed, he had done it for the love of Mary Leavenworth, and
consequently could not hear her charged with crime, and threatened
with arrest, without betraying himself.I did not hope much from the
experiment; least of all did I anticipate that Mr.Harwell would prove
to be the guilty man--but live and learn, Mr.A FULL CONFESSION


    "Between the acting of a dreadful thing,
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;
    The genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council; and the state of a man,
    Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection."I AM not a bad man; I am only an intense one.Ambition, love, jealousy,
hatred, revenge--transitory emotions with some, are terrific passions
with me.To be sure, they are quiet and concealed ones, coiled serpents
that make no stir till aroused; but then, deadly in their spring and
relentless in their action.Those who have known me best have not known
this.Often and often have I heard
her say: "If Trueman only had more sensibility!If Trueman were not so
indifferent to everything!In short, if Trueman had more power in him!"They thought me meek;
called me Dough-face.For three years they called me this, then I turned
upon them.Choosing out their ringleader, I felled him to the ground,
laid him on his back, and stamped upon him.He was handsome before
my foot came down; afterwards--Well, it is enough he never called me
Dough-face again.In the store I entered soon after, I met with even
less appreciation.Regular at my work and exact in my performance of it,
they thought me a good machine and nothing more.What heart, soul, and
feeling could a man have who never sported, never smoked, and never
laughed?I could reckon up figures correctly, but one scarcely needed
heart or soul for that.I could even write day by day and month by month
without showing a flaw in my copy; but that only argued I was no more
than they intimated, a regular automaton.I let them think so, with the
certainty before me that they would one day change their minds as others
had done.The fact was, I loved nobody well enough, not even myself,
to care for any man's opinion.Life was well-nigh a blank to me; a dead
level plain that had to be traversed whether I would or not.And such
it might have continued to this day if I had never met Mary Leavenworth.But when, some nine months since, I left my desk in the counting-house
for a seat in Mr.Leavenworth's library, a blazing torch fell into
my soul whose flame has never gone out, and never will, till the doom
before me is accomplished.When, on that first evening, I followed my new
employer into the parlor, and saw this woman standing up before me
in her half-alluring, half-appalling charm, I knew, as by a lightning
flash, what my future would be if I remained in that house.She was
in one of her haughty moods, and bestowed upon me little more than a
passing glance.But her indifference made slight impression upon me
then.It was enough that I was allowed to stand in her presence and look
unrebuked upon her loveliness.To be sure, it was like gazing into the
flower-wreathed crater of an awakening volcano.Fear and fascination
were in each moment I lingered there; but fear and fascination made the
moment what it was, and I could not have withdrawn if I would.Unspeakable pain as well as pleasure was in the
emotion with which I regarded her.Yet for all that I did not cease to
study her hour by hour and day by day; her smiles, her movement, her way
of turning her head or lifting her eyelids.I
wished to knit her beauty so firmly into the warp and woof of my being
that nothing could ever serve to tear it away.For I saw then as plainly
as now that, coquette though she was, she would never stoop to me.No;
I might lie down at her feet and let her trample over me; she would not
even turn to see what it was she had stepped upon.I might spend days,
months, years, learning the alphabet of her wishes; she would not thank
me for my pains or even raise the lashes from her cheek to look at me as
I passed.I was nothing to her, could not be anything unless--and this
thought came slowly--I could in some way become her master.Leavenworth's dictation and pleased him.My
methodical ways were just to his taste.As for the other member of the
family, Miss Eleanore Leavenworth--she treated me just as one of her
proud but sympathetic nature might be expected to do.Not familiarly,
but kindly; not as a friend, but as a member of the household whom she
met every day at table, and who, as she or any one else could see, was
none too happy or hopeful.I had learned two things; first, that Mary
Leavenworth loved her position as prospective heiress to a large fortune
above every other earthly consideration; and secondly, that she was in
the possession of a secret which endangered that position.What this
was, I had for some time no means of knowing.But when later I became
convinced it was one of love, I grew hopeful, strange as it may seem.Leavenworth's disposition almost as
perfectly as that of his niece, and knew that in a matter of this kind
he would be uncompromising; and that in the clashing of these two wills
something might occur which would give me a hold upon her.The only
thing that troubled me was the fact that I did not know the name of the
man in whom she was interested.One
day--a month ago now--I sat down to open Mr.ran thus:

"HOFFMAN HOUSE,

"March 1, 1876."HORATIO LEAVENWORTH:

"DEAR SIR,--You have a niece whom you love and trust, one, too, who
seems worthy of all the love and trust that you or any other man can
give her; so beautiful, so charming, so tender is she in face, form,
manner, and conversation.But, dear sir, every rose has its thorn, and
your rose is no exception to this rule.Lovely as she is, charming as
she is, tender as she is, she is not only capable of trampling on the
rights of one who trusted her, but of bruising the heart and breaking
the spirit of him to whom she owes all duty, honor, and observance."If you don't believe this, ask her to her cruel, bewitching face, who
and what is her humble servant, and yours.If a bombshell had exploded at my feet, or the evil one himself appeared
at my call, I would not have been more astounded.Not only was the name
signed to these remarkable words unknown to me, but the epistle itself
was that of one who felt himself to be her master: a position which, as
you know, I was myself aspiring to occupy.For a few minutes, then, I
stood a prey to feelings of the bitterest wrath and despair; then I grew
calm, realizing that with this letter in my possession I was virtually
the arbitrator of her destiny.Some men would have sought her there and
then and, by threatening to place it in her uncle's hand, won from her
a look of entreaty, if no more; but I--well, my plans went deeper than
that.I knew she would have to be in extremity before I could hope to
win her.She must feel herself slipping over the edge of the precipice
before she would clutch at the first thing offering succor.I decided
to allow the letter to pass into my employer's hands.How could I manage to give it to him in this condition without
exciting his suspicion?I knew of but one way; to let him see me open it
for what he would consider the first time.So, waiting till he came into
the room, I approached him with the letter, tearing off the end of the
envelope as I came.Opening it, I gave a cursory glance at its contents
and tossed it down on the table before him."That appears to be of a private character," said I, "though there is no
sign to that effect on the envelope."At the first word he started, looked
at me, seemed satisfied from my expression that I had not read far
enough to realize its nature, and, whirling slowly around in his chair,
devoured the remainder in silence.I waited a moment, then withdrew to
my own desk.One minute, two minutes passed in silence; he was evidently
rereading the letter; then he hurriedly rose and left the room.As he
passed me I caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror.The expression I
saw there did not tend to lessen the hope that was rising in my breast.By following him almost immediately up-stairs I ascertained that he
went directly to Mary's room, and when in a few hours later the family
collected around the dinner table, I perceived, almost without looking
up, that a great and insurmountable barrier had been raised between him
and his favorite niece.Two days passed; days that were for me one long and unrelieved suspense.Would it all end as it had
begun, without the appearance of the mysterious Clavering on the scene?Meanwhile my monotonous work went on, grinding my heart beneath its
relentless wheel.I wrote and wrote and wrote, till it seemed as if my
life blood went from me with every drop of ink I used.Always alert
and listening, I dared not lift my head or turn my eyes at any unusual
sound, lest I should seem to be watching.The third night I had a dream;
I have already told Mr.Raymond what it was, and hence will not repeat
it here.One correction, however, I wish to make in regard to it.In my
statement to him I declared that the face of the man whom I saw lift his
hand against my employer was that of Mr.The face seen by me in my dream was my own.It was that fact
which made it so horrible to me.In the crouching figure stealing warily
down-stairs, I saw as in a glass the vision of my own form.Otherwise my
account of the matter was true.a
forewarning of the way in which I was to win this coveted creature for
my own?Was the death of her uncle the bridge by which the impassable
gulf between us might be spanned?I began to think it might be; to
consider the possibilities which could make this the only path to
my elysium; even went so far as to picture her lovely face bending
gratefully towards me through the glare of a sudden release from some
emergency in which she stood.One thing was sure; if that was the way I
must go, I had at least been taught how to tread it; and all through the
dizzy, blurred day that followed, I saw, as I sat at my work, repeated
visions of that stealthy, purposeful figure stealing down the stairs
and entering with uplifted pistol into the unconscious presence of my
employer.I even found myself a dozen times that day turning my eyes
upon the door through which it was to come, wondering how long it would
be before my actual form would pause there.That the moment was at hand
I did not imagine.Even when I left him that night after drinking with
him the glass of sherry mentioned at the inquest, I had no idea the hour
of action was so near.But when, not three minutes after going upstairs,
I caught the sound of a lady's dress rustling through the hall, and
listening, heard Mary Leavenworth pass my door on her way to the
library, I realized that the fatal hour was come; that something
was going to be said or done in that room which would make this deed
necessary.Casting about in my mind
for the means of doing so, I remembered that the ventilator running
up through the house opened first into the passage-way connecting Mr.Leavenworth's bedroom and library, and, secondly, into the closet of
the large spare room adjoining mine.Hastily unlocking the door of
the communication between the rooms, I took my position in the closet.Instantly the sound of voices reached my ears; all was open below, and
standing there, I was as much an auditor of what went on between Mary
and her uncle as if I were in the library itself.Enough to assure me my suspicions were correct; that it was a moment of
vital interest to her; that Mr.Leavenworth, in pursuance of a threat
evidently made some time since, was in the act of taking steps to change
his will, and that she had come to make an appeal to be forgiven her
fault and restored to his favor.What that fault was, I did not learn.I only heard her
declare that her action had been the result of impulse, rather than
love; that she regretted it, and desired nothing more than to be free
from all obligations to one she would fain forget, and be again to her
uncle what she was before she ever saw this man.I thought, fool that I
was, it was a mere engagement she was alluding to, and took the insanest
hope from these words; and when, in a moment later I heard her uncle
reply, in his sternest tone, that she had irreparably forfeited her
claims to his regard and favor, I did not need her short and bitter cry
of shame and disappointment, or that low moan for some one to help her,
for me to sound his death-knell in my heart.Creeping back to my own
room, I waited till I heard her reascend, then I stole forth.Calm as
I had ever been in my life, I went down the stairs just as I had seen
myself do in my dream, and knocking lightly at the library door, went
in.Leavenworth was sitting in his usual place writing."Excuse me," said I as he looked up, "I have lost my memorandum-book,
and think it possible I may have dropped it in the passage-way when I
went for the wine."He bowed, and I hurried past him into the closet.Once there, I proceeded rapidly into the room beyond, procured the
pistol, returned, and almost before I realized what I was doing, had
taken up my position behind him, aimed, and fired.Without a groan his head fell forward on his hands, and Mary
Leavenworth was the virtual possessor of the thousands she coveted.My first thought was to procure the letter he was writing.Approaching
the table, I tore it out from under his hands, looked at it, saw that
it was, as I expected, a summons to his lawyer, and thrust it into my
pocket, together with the letter from Mr.Clavering, which I perceived
lying spattered with blood on the table before me.Not till this was
done did I think of myself, or remember the echo which that low, sharp
report must have made in the house.Dropping the pistol at the side of
the murdered man, I stood ready to shriek to any one who entered that
Mr.But I was saved from committing such
a folly.The report had not been heard, or if so, had evidently failed
to create an alarm.No one came, and I was left to contemplate my
work undisturbed and decide upon the best course to be taken to avoid
detection.A moment's study of the wound made in his head by the
bullet convinced me of the impossibility of passing the affair off as
a suicide, or even the work of a burglar.To any one versed in such
matters it was manifestly a murder, and a most deliberate one.My one
hope, then, lay in making it as mysterious as it was deliberate, by
destroying all due to the motive and manner of the deed.Picking up the
pistol, I carried it into the other room with the intention of
cleaning it, but finding nothing there to do it with, came back for the
handkerchief I had seen lying on the floor at Mr.It
was Miss Eleanore's, but I did not know it till I had used it to clean
the barrel; then the sight of her initials in one corner so shocked me
I forgot to clean the cylinder, and only thought of how I could do
away with this evidence of her handkerchief having been employed for a
purpose so suspicious.Not daring to carry it from the room, I sought
for means to destroy it; but finding none, compromised the matter by
thrusting it deep down behind the cushion of one of the chairs, in the
hope of being able to recover and burn it the next day.This done, I
reloaded the pistol, locked it up, and prepared to leave the room.But here the horror which usually follows such deeds struck me like a
thunderbolt and made me for the first time uncertain in my action.I
locked the door on going out, something I should never have done.Not
till I reached the top of the stairs did I realize my folly; and then it
was too late, for there before me, candle in hand, and surprise written
on every feature of her face, stood Hannah, one of the servants, looking
at me."Lor, sir, where have you been?"she cried, but strange to say, in a
low tone."You look as if you had seen a ghost."And her eyes turned
suspiciously to the key which I held in my hand.I felt as if some one had clutched me round the throat.Thrusting the
key into my pocket, I took a step towards her."I will tell you what I
have seen if you will come down-stairs," I whispered; "the ladies will
be disturbed if we talk here," and smoothing my brow as best I could,
I put out my hand and drew her towards me.What my motive was I hardly
knew; the action was probably instinctive; but when I saw the look which
came into her face as I touched her, and the alacrity with which she
prepared to follow me, I took courage, remembering the one or two
previous tokens I had had of this girl's unreasonable susceptibility to
my influence; a susceptibility which I now felt could be utilized and
made to serve my purpose.Taking her down to the parlor floor, I drew her into the depths of
the great drawing-room, and there told her in the least alarming
way possible what had happened to Mr.She was of course
intensely agitated, but she did not scream;--the novelty of her position
evidently bewildering her--and, greatly relieved, I went on to say that
I did not know who committed the deed, but that folks would declare it
was I if they knew I had been seen by her on the stairs with the library
key in my hand."But I won't tell," she whispered, trembling violently
in her fright and eagerness.I will say I
didn't see anybody."But I soon convinced her that she could never keep
her secret if the police once began to question her, and, following
up my argument with a little cajolery, succeeded after a long while in
winning her consent to leave the house till the storm should be blown
over.But that given, it was some little time before I could make her
comprehend that she must depart at once and without going back after her
things.Not till I brightened up her wits by a promise to marry her some
day if she only obeyed me now, did she begin to look the thing in
the face and show any evidence of the real mother wit she evidently
possessed.Belden would take me in," said she, "if I could only
get to R----.She takes everybody in who asks, her; and she would
keep me, too, if I told her Miss Mary sent me.But I can't get there
to-night."I immediately set to work to convince her that she could.The midnight
train did not leave the city for a half-hour yet, and the distance to
the depot could be easily walked by her in fifteen minutes.And she was afraid she couldn't find
her way!She still hesitated, but
at length consented to go, and with some further understanding of the
method I was to employ in communicating with her, we went down-stairs.There we found a hat and shawl of the cook's which I put on her, and in
another moment we were in the carriage yard."Remember, you are to say
nothing of what has occurred, no matter what happens," I whispered in
parting injunction as she turned to leave me."Remember, you are to come
and marry me some day," she murmured in reply, throwing her arms about
my neck.The movement was sudden, and it was probably at this time she
dropped the candle she had unconsciously held clenched in her hand till
now.I promised her, and she glided out of the gate.Of the dreadful agitation that followed the disappearance of this girl
I can give no better idea than by saying I not only committed the
additional error of locking up the house on my re-entrance, but omitted
to dispose of the key then in my pocket by flinging it into the street
or dropping it in the hall as I went up.The fact is, I was so absorbed
by the thought of the danger I stood in from this girl, I forgot
everything else.Hannah's pale face, Hannah's look of terror, as she
turned from my side and flitted down the street, were continually before
me.I could not escape them; the form of the dead man lying below was
less vivid.It was as though I were tied in fancy to this woman of the
white face fluttering down the midnight streets.That she would fail in
something--come back or be brought back--that I should find her standing
white and horror-stricken on the front steps when I went down in the
morning, was like a nightmare to me.I began to think no other result
possible; that she never would or could win her way unchallenged to that
little cottage in a distant village; that I had but sent a trailing flag
of danger out into the world with this wretched girl;--danger that would
come back to me with the first burst of morning light!But even those thoughts faded after a while before the realization
of the peril I was in as long as the key and papers remained in my
possession.I dared not leave my room again,
or open my window.Indeed I was
afraid to move about in my room.Yes, my
morbid terror had reached that point--I was fearful of one whose ears I
myself had forever closed, imagined him in his bed beneath and wakeful
to the least sound.But the necessity of doing something with these evidences of guilt
finally overcame this morbid anxiety, and drawing the two letters from
my pocket--I had not yet undressed--I chose out the most dangerous of
the two, that written by Mr.Leavenworth himself, and, chewing it till
it was mere pulp, threw it into a corner; but the other had blood on it,
and nothing, not even the hope of safety, could induce me to put it
to my lips.I was forced to lie with it clenched in my hand, and the
flitting image of Hannah before my eyes, till the slow morning broke.I
have heard it said that a year in heaven seems like a day; I can easily
believe it.I know that an hour in hell seems an eternity!Whether it was that the sunshine glancing
on the wall made me think of Mary and all I was ready to do for her
sake, or whether it was the mere return of my natural stoicism in the
presence of actual necessity, I cannot say.I only know that I arose
calm and master of myself.The problem of the letter and key had solved
itself also.Instead of that I would
put them in plain sight, trusting to that very fact for their being
overlooked.Making the letter up into lighters, I carried them into the
spare room and placed them in a vase.Then, taking the key in my hand,
went down-stairs, intending to insert it in the lock of the library door
as I went by.But Miss Eleanore descending almost immediately behind me
made this impossible.I succeeded, however, in thrusting it, without
her knowledge, among the filagree work of the gas-fixture in the
second hall, and thus relieved, went down into the breakfast room as
self-possessed a man as ever crossed its threshold.Mary was there,
looking exceedingly pale and disheartened, and as I met her eye, which
for a wonder turned upon me as I entered, I could almost have laughed,
thinking of the deliverance that had come to her, and of the time when I
should proclaim myself to be the man who had accomplished it.Of the alarm that speedily followed, and my action at that time and
afterwards, I need not speak in detail.I behaved just as I would have
done if I had had no hand in the murder.I even forbore to touch the key
or go to the spare room, or make any movement which I was not willing
all the world should see.For as things stood, there was not a shadow
of evidence against me in the house; neither was I, a hard-working,
uncomplaining secretary, whose passion for one of his employer's nieces
was not even mistrusted by the lady herself, a person to be suspected
of the crime which threw him out of a fair situation.So I performed
all the duties of my position, summoning the police, and going for Mr.Veeley, just as I would have done if those hours between me leaving
Mr.Leavenworth for the first time and going down to breakfast in the
morning had been blotted from my consciousness.And this was the principle upon which I based my action at the inquest.Leaving that half-hour and its occurrences out of the question, I
resolved to answer such questions as might be put me as truthfully as
I could; the great fault with men situated as I was usually being that
they lied too much, thus committing themselves on unessential matters.But alas, in thus planning for my own safety, I forgot one thing,
and that was the dangerous position in which I should thus place Mary
Leavenworth as the one benefited by the crime.Not till the inference
was drawn by a juror, from the amount of wine found in Mr.Leavenworth's
glass in the morning, that he had come to his death shortly after my
leaving him, did I realize what an opening I had made for suspicion in
her direction by admitting that I had heard a rustle on the stair a few
minutes after going up.That all present believed it to have been made
by Eleanore, did not reassure me.She was so completely disconnected
with the crime I could not imagine suspicion holding to her for an
instant.But Mary--If a curtain had been let down before me, pictured
with the future as it has since developed, I could not have seen more
plainly what her position would be, if attention were once directed
towards her.So, in the vain endeavor to cover up my blunder, I began
to lie.Forced to admit that a shadow of disagreement had been lately
visible between Mr.Leavenworth and one of his nieces, I threw the
burden of it upon Eleanore, as the one best able to bear it.The
consequences were more serious than I anticipated.Direction had been
given to suspicion which every additional evidence that now came up
seemed by some strange fatality to strengthen.Leavenworth's own pistol had been used in the assassination,
and that too by a person then in the house, but I myself was brought
to acknowledge that Eleanore had learned from me, only a little while
before, how to load, aim, and fire this very pistol--a coincidence
mischievous enough to have been of the devil's own making.Seeing all this, my fear of what the ladies would admit when questioned
became very great.Let them in their innocence acknowledge that, upon my
ascent, Mary had gone to her uncle's room for the purpose of persuading
him not to carry into effect the action he contemplated, and what
consequences might not ensue!But events of which I had at that time no knowledge had occurred to
influence them.Eleanore, with some show of reason, as it seems, not
only suspected her cousin of the crime, but had informed her of the
fact, and Mary, overcome with terror at finding there was more or
less circumstantial evidence supporting the suspicion, decided to deny
whatever told against herself, trusting to Eleanore's generosity not to
be contradicted.Though, by the course
she took, Eleanore was forced to deepen the prejudice already rife
against herself, she not only forbore to contradict her cousin, but when
a true answer would have injured her, actually refused to return any,
a lie being something she could not utter, even to save one especially
endeared to her.This conduct of hers had one effect upon me.It aroused my admiration
and made me feel that here was a woman worth helping if assistance could
be given without danger to myself.Yet I doubt if my sympathy would have
led me into doing anything, if I had not perceived, by the stress laid
upon certain well-known matters, that actual danger hovered about us
all while the letter and key remained in the house.Even before the
handkerchief was produced, I had made up my mind to attempt their
destruction; but when that was brought up and shown, I became so alarmed
I immediately rose and, making my way under some pretence or other to
the floors above, snatched the key from the gas-fixture, the
lighters from the vase, and hastening with them down the hall to Mary
Leavenworth's room, went in under the expectation of finding a fire
there in which to destroy them.But, to my heavy disappointment, there
were only a few smoldering ashes in the grate, and, thwarted in my
design, I stood hesitating what to do, when I heard some one coming
up-stairs.Alive to the consequences of being found in that room at that
time, I cast the lighters into the grate and started for the door.But
in the quick move I made, the key flew from my hand and slid under a
chair.Aghast at the mischance, I paused, but the sound of approaching
steps increasing, I lost all control over myself and fled from the room.I had barely reached my own door when
Eleanore Leavenworth, followed by two servants, appeared at the top of
the staircase and proceeded towards the room I had just left.The sight
reassured me; she would see the key, and take some means of disposing
of it; and indeed I always supposed her to have done so, for no further
word of key or letter ever came to my ears.This may explain why the
questionable position in which Eleanore soon found herself awakened in
me no greater anxiety.I thought the suspicions of the police rested
upon nothing more tangible than the peculiarity of her manner at the
inquest and the discovery of her handkerchief on the scene of the
tragedy.I did not know they possessed what might be called absolute
proof of her connection with the crime.But if I had, I doubt if my
course would have been any different.Mary's peril was the one thing
capable of influencing me, and she did not appear to be in peril.On the
contrary, every one, by common consent, seemed to ignore all appearance
of guilt on her part.Gryce, whom I soon learned to fear, had
given one sign of suspicion, or Mr.Raymond, whom I speedily recognized
as my most persistent though unconscious foe, had betrayed the least
distrust of her, I should have taken warning.But they did not, and,
lulled into a false security by their manner, I let the days go by
without suffering any fears on her account.But not without many
anxieties for myself.Hannah's existence precluded all sense of personal
security.Knowing the determination of the police to find her, I trod
the verge of an awful suspense continually.Meantime the wretched certainty was forcing itself upon me that I had
lost, instead of gained, a hold on Mary Leavenworth.Not only did she
evince the utmost horror of the deed which had made her mistress of
her uncle's wealth, but, owing, as I believed, to the influence of Mr.Raymond, soon gave evidence that she was losing, to a certain extent,
the characteristics of mind and heart which had made me hopeful of
winning her by this deed of blood.Under the terrible restraint forced upon me, I walked my weary
round in a state of mind bordering on frenzy.Many and many a time have
I stopped in my work, wiped my pen and laid it down with the idea that
I could not repress myself another moment, but I have always taken it
up again and gone on with my task.Raymond has sometimes shown his
wonder at my sitting in my dead employer's chair.By keeping the murder constantly before my mind, I
was enabled to restrain myself from any inconsiderate action.At last there came a time when my agony could be no longer suppressed.Raymond, I saw a strange
gentleman standing in the reception room, looking at Mary Leavenworth
in a way that would have made my blood boil, even if I had not heard him
whisper these words: "But you are my wife, and know it, whatever you may
say or do!"It was the lightning-stroke of my life.After what I had done to make
her mine, to hear another claim her as already his own, was stunning,
maddening!I had either to yell in
my fury or deal the man beneath some tremendous blow in my hatred.I did
not dare to shriek, so I struck the blow.Raymond, and hearing that it was, as I expected, Clavering, I flung
caution, reason, common sense, all to the winds, and in a moment of fury
denounced him as the murderer of Mr.The next instant I would have given worlds to recall my words.What had
I done but drawn attention to myself in thus accusing a man against whom
nothing could of course be proved!So, after a night of thought, I did the next best thing: gave a
superstitious reason for my action, and so restored myself to my former
position without eradicating from the mind of Mr.Raymond that vague
doubt of the man which my own safety demanded.But I had no intention of
going any further, nor should I have done so if I had not observed that
for some reason Mr.But
that once seen, revenge took possession of me, and I asked myself if the
burden of this crime could be thrown on this man.Still I do not believe
that any active results would have followed this self-questioning if I
had not overheard a whispered conversation between two of the servants,
in which I learned that Mr.Clavering had been seen to enter the
house on the night of the murder, but was not seen to leave it.With such a fact for a starting-point, what might I not
hope to accomplish?While she remained
alive I saw nothing but ruin before me.I made up my mind to destroy
her and satisfy my hatred of Mr.By what
means could I reach her without deserting my post, or make away with
her without exciting fresh suspicion?The problem seemed insolvable;
but Trueman Harwell had not played the part of a machine so long without
result.Before I had studied the question a day, light broke upon it,
and I saw that the only way to accomplish my plans was to inveigle her
into destroying herself.No sooner had this thought matured than I hastened to act upon it.Knowing the tremendous risk I ran, I took every precaution.Locking
myself up in my room, I wrote her a letter in printed characters--she
having distinctly told me she could not read writing--in which I played
upon her ignorance, foolish fondness, and Irish superstition, by telling
her I dreamed of her every night and wondered if she did of me; was
afraid she didn't, so enclosed her a little charm, which, if she would
use according to directions, would give her the most beautiful visions.These directions were for her first to destroy my letter by burning it,
next to take in her hand the packet I was careful to enclose, swallow
the powder accompanying it, and go to bed.The powder was a deadly dose
of poison and the packet was, as you know, a forged confession falsely
criminating Henry Clavering.Enclosing all these in an envelope in
the corner of which I had marked a cross, I directed it, according to
agreement, to Mrs.Then followed the greatest period of suspense I had yet endured.Though
I had purposely refrained from putting my name to the letter, I felt
that the chances of detection were very great.Let her depart in the
least particular from the course I had marked out for her, and fatal
results must ensue.If she opened the enclosed packet, mistrusted the
powder, took Mrs.Belden into her confidence, or even failed to burn my
letter, all would be lost.I could not be sure of her or know the result
of my scheme except through the newspapers.Do you think I kept watch
of the countenances about me?devoured the telegraphic news, or started
when the bell rang?And when, a few days since, I read that short
paragraph in the paper which assured me that my efforts had at least
produced the death of the woman I feared, do you think I experienced any
sense of relief?In six hours had come the summons from Mr.Gryce,
and--let these prison walls, this confession itself, tell the rest.I am
no longer capable of speech or action.THE OUTCOME OF A GREAT CRIME


    "Leave her to Heaven
    And to those thorns that
    In her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her."--Hamlet

    "For she is wise, if I can judge of her;
    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true;
    And true she is, as she has proved herself;
    And therefore like herself, wise, fair, and true,
    Shall she be placed in my constant soul."I cried, as I made my way into her presence, "are you
prepared for very good news?News that will brighten these pale cheeks
and give the light back to these eyes, and make life hopeful and sweet
to you once more?Tell me," I urged, stooping over her where she sat,
for she looked ready to faint."I don't know," she faltered; "I fear your idea of good news and mine
may differ.No news can be good but----"

"What?"I asked, taking her hands in mine with a smile that ought to
have reassured her, it was one of such profound happiness."Tell me; do
not be afraid."Her dreadful burden had lain upon her so long it had become
a part of her being.How could she realize it was founded on a mistake;
that she had no cause to fear the past, present, or future?But when the truth was made known to her; when, with all the fervor and
gentle tact of which I was capable, I showed her that her suspicions had
been groundless, and that Trueman Harwell, and not Mary, was accountable
for the evidences of crime which had led her into attributing to her
cousin the guilt of her uncle's death, her first words were a prayer to
be taken to the one she had so wronged.I cannot breathe or think till I have begged pardon of her on my
knees.Seeing the state she was in, I deemed it wise to humor her.So,
procuring a carriage, I drove with her to her cousin's home."Mary will spurn me; she will not even look at me; and she will be
right!"she cried, as we rolled away up the avenue."An outrage like
this can never be forgiven.But God knows I thought myself justified in
my suspicions.If you knew--"

"I do know," I interposed."Mary acknowledges that the circumstantial
evidence against her was so overwhelming, she was almost staggered
herself, asking if she could be guiltless with such proofs against her.But----"

"Wait, oh, wait; did Mary say that?"I did not answer; I wanted her to see for herself the extent of that
change.But when, in a few minutes later, the carriage stopped and I
hurried with her into the house which had been the scene of so much
misery, I was hardly prepared for the difference in her own countenance
which the hall light revealed.Her eyes were bright, her cheeks were
brilliant, her brow lifted and free from shadow; so quickly does the ice
of despair melt in the sunshine of hope.Thomas, who had opened the door, was sombrely glad to see his mistress
again."Miss Leavenworth is in the drawing-room," said he.I nodded, then seeing that Eleanore could scarcely move for agitation,
asked her whether she would go in at once, or wait till she was more
composed."I will go in at once; I cannot wait."And slipping from my grasp, she
crossed the hall and laid her hand upon the drawing-room curtain, when
it was suddenly lifted from within and Mary stepped out.I did not need to glance their
way to know that Eleanore had fallen at her cousin's feet, and that
her cousin had affrightedly lifted her.I did not need to hear: "My sin
against you is too great; you cannot forgive me!"followed by the low:
"My shame is great enough to lead me to forgive anything!"to know that
the lifelong shadow between these two had dissolved like a cloud, and
that, for the future, bright days of mutual confidence and sympathy were
in store.Yet when, a half-hour or so later, I heard the door of the reception
room, into which I had retired, softly open, and looking up, saw Mary
standing on the threshold, with the light of true humility on her face,
I own that I was surprised at the softening which had taken place in
her haughty beauty."Blessed is the shame that purifies," I inwardly
murmured, and advancing, held out my hand with a respect and sympathy I
never thought to feel for her again.Blushing deeply, she came and stood by
my side."I have much to be grateful for; how
much I never realized till to-night; but I cannot speak of it now.What
I wish is for you to come in and help me persuade Eleanore to accept
this fortune from my hands.It is hers, you know; was willed to her, or
would have been if--"

"Wait," said I, in the trepidation which this appeal to me on such a
subject somehow awakened.Is it your
determined purpose to transfer your fortune into your cousin's hands?"Her look was enough without the low, "Ah, how can you ask me?"Clavering was sitting by the side of Eleanore when we entered the
drawing-room.He immediately rose, and drawing me to one side, earnestly
said:

"Before the courtesies of the hour pass between us, Mr.Raymond, allow
me to tender you my apology.You have in your possession a document
which ought never to have been forced upon you.Founded upon a mistake,
the act was an insult which I bitterly regret.If, in consideration of
my mental misery at that time, you can pardon it, I shall feel forever
indebted to you; if not----"

"Mr.The occurrences of that day belong to
a past which I, for one, have made up my mind to forget as soon as
possible.The future promises too richly for us to dwell on bygone
miseries."And with a look of mutual understanding and friendship we hastened to
rejoin the ladies.Of the conversation that followed, it is only necessary to state the
result.Eleanore, remaining firm in her refusal to accept property so
stained by guilt, it was finally agreed upon that it should be devoted
to the erection and sustainment of some charitable institution of
magnitude sufficient to be a recognized benefit to the city and its
unfortunate poor.This settled, our thoughts returned to our friends,
especially to Mr."He has grieved like a father over us."And, in her spirit of penitence, she would have undertaken the unhappy
task of telling him the truth.But Eleanore, with her accustomed generosity, would not hear of this."No, Mary," said she; "you have suffered enough.And leaving them there, with the light of growing hope and confidence on
their faces, we went out again into the night, and so into a dream from
which I have never waked, though the shine of her dear eyes have been
now the load-star of my life for many happy, happy months.The character
     of Hamlet was one of Betterton's masterpieces.Downes tells us that
     he was taught by Davenant how the part was acted by Taylor of the
     Blackfriars, who was instructed by Shakespeare himself.]Hence homeward, and met with
Mr.Spong and took him to the Sampson in Paul's churchyard, and there
staid till late, and it rained hard, so we were fain to get home wet, and
so to bed.At church in the morning, and dined at home alone with
my wife very comfortably, and so again to church with her, and had a very
good and pungent sermon of Mr.Mills, discoursing the necessity of
restitution.Home, and I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to look
something askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them, and
is not solicitous for their acquaintance, which I am not troubled at at
all.By and by comes in my father (he intends to go into the country
to-morrow), and he and I among other discourse at last called Pall up to
us, and there in great anger told her before my father that I would keep
her no longer, and my father he said he would have nothing to do with her.At last, after we had brought down her high spirit, I got my father to
yield that she should go into the country with my mother and him, and stay
there awhile to see how she will demean herself.That being done, my
father and I to my uncle Wight's, and there supped, and he took his leave
of them, and so I walked with [him] as far as Paul's and there parted, and
I home, my mind at some rest upon this making an end with Pall, who do
trouble me exceedingly.This morning before I went out I made even with my maid Jane, who
has this day been my maid three years, and is this day to go into the
country to her mother.The poor girl cried, and I could hardly forbear
weeping to think of her going, for though she be grown lazy and spoilt by
Pall's coming, yet I shall never have one to please us better in all
things, and so harmless, while I live.So I paid her her wages and gave
her 2s.over, and bade her adieu, with my mind full of trouble at her
going.Hence to my father, where he and I and Thomas together setting
things even, and casting up my father's accounts, and upon the whole I
find that all he hath in money of his own due to him in the world is but
L45, and he owes about the same sum: so that I cannot but think in what a
condition he had left my mother if he should have died before my uncle
Robert.Hence to Tom Trice for the probate of the will and had it done to
my mind, which did give my father and me good content.From thence to my
Lady at the Wardrobe and thence to the Theatre, and saw the "Antipodes,"
wherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.Bostock whom I met there (a clerk formerly of Mr.Phelps) to the Devil
tavern, and there drank and so away.I to my uncle Fenner's, where my
father was with him at an alehouse, and so we three went by ourselves and
sat talking a great while about a broker's daughter that he do propose for
a wife for Tom, with a great portion, but I fear it will not take, but he
will do what he can.So we broke up, and going through the street we met
with a mother and son, friends of my father's man, Ned's, who are angry at
my father's putting him away, which troubled me and my father, but all
will be well as to that.We have news this morning of my uncle Thomas and
his son Thomas being gone into the country without giving notice thereof
to anybody, which puts us to a stand, but I fear them not.At night at
home I found a letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now very well again of
his feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was
twice let blood.This letter dated the 22nd July last, which puts me out
of doubt of his being ill.In my coming home I called in at the Crane
tavern at the Stocks by appointment, and there met and took leave of Mr.Fanshaw, who goes to-morrow and Captain Isham toward their voyage to
Portugal.Here we drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr.Fanshaw
till he could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord
Hinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in
their way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady's
bedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu's disposing of
the L5000 for my Lord's departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will
not do it to my Lord's honour, and less to his profit, which I am to
enquire a little after.Hence to the office, and there sat till noon, and
then my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.Pepys, the Executor, to
dinner, where some ladies and my father and mother, where very merry, but
methinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests, though there was a
poor venison pasty.Hence my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Joviall Crew," where the King, Duke and Duchess, and Madame Palmer,
were; and my wife, to her great content, had a full sight of them all the
while.Hence to my father's, and there staid to
talk a while and so by foot home by moonshine.In my way and at home, my
wife making a sad story to me of her brother Balty's a condition, and
would have me to do something for him, which I shall endeavour to do, but
am afeard to meddle therein for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands
of him again, when I once concern myself for him.I went to bed, my wife
all the while telling me his case with tears, which troubled me.At home all the morning setting papers in order.At noon to the
Exchange, and there met with Dr.Williams by appointment, and with him
went up and down to look for an attorney, a friend of his, to advise with
about our bond of my aunt Pepys of L200, and he tells me absolutely that
we shall not be forced to pay interest for the money yet.I spent the whole afternoon drinking with him and so home.This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief that
stole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.At the office all the morning, and at noon my father, mother, and
my aunt Bell (the first time that ever she was at my house) come to dine
with me, and were very merry.After dinner the two women went to visit my
aunt Wight, &c., and my father about other business, and I abroad to my
bookseller, and there staid till four o'clock, at which time by
appointment I went to meet my father at my uncle Fenner's.So thither I
went and with him to an alehouse, and there came Mr.Evans, the taylor,
whose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom, and then my
father, and there we sat a good while and talked about the business; in
fine he told us that he hath not to except against us or our motion, but
that the estate that God hath blessed him with is too great to give where
there is nothing in present possession but a trade and house; and so we
friendly ended.There parted, my father and I together, and walked a
little way, and then at Holborn he and I took leave of one another, he
being to go to Brampton (to settle things against my mother comes)
tomorrow morning.At noon my wife and I met at the Wardrobe, and there dined with the
children, and after dinner up to my Lady's bedside, and talked and laughed
a good while.Then my wife end I to Drury Lane to the French comedy,
which was so ill done, and the scenes and company and every thing else so
nasty and out of order and poor, that I was sick all the while in my mind
to be there.Here my wife met with a son of my Lord Somersett, whom she
knew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great countenance, to avoyd
further acquaintance.That done, there being nothing pleasant but the
foolery of the farce, we went home.At home and the office all the morning, and at noon comes Luellin
to me, and he and I to the tavern and after that to Bartholomew fair, and
there upon his motion to a pitiful alehouse, where we had a dirty slut or
two come up that were whores, but my very heart went against them, so that
I took no pleasure but a great deal of trouble in being there and getting
from thence for fear of being seen.From hence he and I walked towards
Ludgate and parted.I back again to the fair all alone, and there met
with my Ladies Jemimah and Paulina, with Mr.Pickering and Madamoiselle,
at seeing the monkeys dance, which was much to see, when they could be
brought to do so, but it troubled me to sit among such nasty company.After that with them into Christ's Hospitall, and there Mr.Pickering
bought them some fairings, and I did give every one of them a bauble,
which was the little globes of glass with things hanging in them, which
pleased the ladies very well.After that home with them in their coach,
and there was called up to my Lady, and she would have me stay to talk
with her, which I did I think a full hour.And the poor lady did with so
much innocency tell me how Mrs.Crispe had told her that she did intend,
by means of a lady that lies at her house, to get the King to be godfather
to the young lady that she is in childbed now of; but to see in what a
manner my Lady told it me, protesting that she sweat in the very telling
of it, was the greatest pleasure to me in the world to see the simplicity
and harmlessness of a lady.Then down to supper with the ladies, and so
home, Mr.Moore (as he and I cannot easily part) leading me as far as
Fenchurch Street to the Mitre, where we drank a glass of wine and so
parted, and I home and to bed.My maid Jane newly gone, and Pall left now to do all
the work till another maid comes, which shall not be till she goes away
into the country with my mother.My Lord
Sandwich in the Straits and newly recovered of a great sickness at
Alicante.My father gone to settle at Brampton, and myself under much
business and trouble for to settle things in the estate to our content.But what is worst, I find myself lately too much given to seeing of plays,
and expense, and pleasure, which makes me forget my business, which I must
labour to amend.No money comes in, so that I have been forced to borrow
a great deal for my own expenses, and to furnish my father, to leave
things in order.I have some trouble about my brother Tom, who is now
left to keep my father's trade, in which I have great fears that he will
miscarry for want of brains and care.At Court things are in very ill
condition, there being so much emulacion, poverty, and the vices of
drinking, swearing, and loose amours, that I know not what will be the end
of it, but confusion.And the Clergy so high, that all people that I meet
with do protest against their practice.In short, I see no content or
satisfaction any where, in any one sort of people.The Benevolence

proves so little, and an occasion of so much discontent every where; that
it had better it had never been set up.We are
at our Office quiet, only for lack of money all things go to rack.Our
very bills offered to be sold upon the Exchange at 10 per cent.We
are upon getting Sir R. Ford's house added to our Office.But I see so
many difficulties will follow in pleasing of one another in the dividing
of it, and in becoming bound personally to pay the rent of L200 per annum,
that I do believe it will yet scarce come to pass.The season very sickly
every where of strange and fatal fevers.ETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:

     Sat before Mrs.Ginger 'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came
into the room 'e tried all 'e could to attract 'is attention by rolling
'is 'ead from side to side."Why, 'as Ginger gone to bed?""He's all right," ses Bill; "just a bit of a 'eadache."Peter stood staring at the bed, and then 'e pulled the clothes off and
saw pore Ginger all tied up, and making awful eyes at 'im to undo him."I 'ad to do it, Peter," ses Bill."I wanted some more money to escape
with, and 'e wouldn't lend it to me.I 'aven't got as much as I want
now.You just came in in the nick of time.Another minute and you'd ha'
missed me."Ah, I wish I could lend you some, Bill," ses Peter Russet, turning pale,
"but I've 'ad my pocket picked; that's wot I came back for, to get some
from Ginger.""You see 'ow it is, Bill," ses Peter, edging back toward the door; "three
men laid 'old of me and took every farthing I'd got.""Well, I can't rob you, then," ses Bill, catching 'old of 'im."Whoever's money this is," he ses, pulling a handful out o' Peter's
pocket, "it can't be yours.Now, if you make another sound I'll knock
your 'ead off afore I tie you up.""Don't tie me up, Bill," ses Peter, struggling."I can't trust you," ses Bill, dragging 'im over to the washstand and
taking up the other towel; "turn round."Peter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill 'ad done 'im
'e put 'im in alongside o' Ginger and covered 'em up, arter first tying
both the gags round with some string to prevent 'em slipping."Mind, I've only borrowed it," he ses, standing by the side o' the bed;
"but I must say, mates, I'm disappointed in both of you.If either of
you 'ad 'ad the misfortune wot I've 'ad, I'd have sold the clothes off my
back to 'elp you.And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither."He stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their
'eads and went downstairs.Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and
then they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to
talk with their eyes.Then Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e
might as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.The worst of it was
they couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter
Russet leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up
agin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.He banged
Peter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till
they'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair
and lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.And all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.He
sat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,
wondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.Ginger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into
the room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed
in a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.He thought it was Bill
carrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs
afore he stopped to take breath.He stood there trembling for about ten
minutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on
tiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made
that bed do everything but speak.ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready
to dash downstairs agin.There was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill
was dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.All 'e did know was
that 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.He shut the door gently and
went downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding
one, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead
agin the banisters, went to sleep.[Illustration: "Picked out the softest stair 'e could find."]It was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.He was
stiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped
softly upstairs and opened the door.Peter and Ginger was waiting for
'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their
'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with
bandages.He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped
into the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes."Wot d'ye mean by making sights of
yourselves like that?'Ave you took leave of your senses?"Ginger and Peter shook their 'eads and rolled their eyes, and then Sam
see wot was the matter with 'em.Fust thing 'e did was to pull out 'is
knife and cut Ginger's gag off, and the fust thing Ginger did was to call
'im every name 'e could lay his tongue to."You wait a moment," he screams, 'arf crying with rage."You wait till I
get my 'ands loose and I'll pull you to pieces.The idea o' leaving us
like this all night, you old crocodile.He cut off Peter Russet's gag, and Peter Russet
called 'im 'arf a score o' names without taking breath."And when Ginger's finished I'll 'ave a go at you," he ses."Oh, you wait till I get my 'ands on
you."Sam didn't answer 'em; he shut up 'is knife with a click and then 'e sat
at the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.It wasn't the
fust time they'd been rude to 'im, but as a rule he'd 'ad to put up with
it.He sat and listened while Ginger swore 'imself faint."That'll do," he ses, at last; "another word and I shall put the
bedclothes over your 'ead.Afore I do anything more I want to know wot
it's all about."Peter told 'im, arter fust calling 'im some more names, because Ginger
was past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was
at them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave
prevented it.He sat there talking as though 'e enjoyed the sound of 'is
own voice, and he told Peter and Ginger all their faults and said wot
sorrow it caused their friends.Twice he 'ad to throw the bedclothes
over their 'eads because o' the noise they was making.[Illustration: "Old Sam said 'ow surprised he was at them for letting
Bill do it."]"_Are you going--to undo--us?_"  ses Ginger, at last."No, Ginger," ses old Sam; "in justice to myself I couldn't do it.Arter
wot you've said--and arter wot I've said--my life wouldn't be safe.Besides which, you'd want to go shares in my money."He took up 'is chest and marched downstairs with it, and about 'arf an
hour arterward the landlady's 'usband came up and set 'em free.As soon
as they'd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for
Sam, but they didn't find 'im for nearly a year, and as for Bill, they
never set eyes on 'im again.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bill's Lapse, by W.W."It is exactly
like a warm afternoon in April," he said, "and here are some of the
spring flowers.""There now, sit by and eat," she said, with humor; and in perfectly
restored tranquillity they ate and drank, with no thought of critics or
of rivals.They were alone, and content to be so.It was deliciously sweet and restful there in that sunny hollow on the
breast of the mountain.The wind swept through the worn branches of the
dwarfed spruce with immemorial wistfulness; but these young souls heard
it only as a far-off song.Side by side on the soft Alpine clover they
rested and talked, looking away at the shining peaks, and down over the
dark-green billows of fir beneath them.Half the forest was under their
eyes at the moment, and the man said: "Is it not magnificent!It makes me
proud of my country.Just think, all this glorious spread of hill and
valley is under your father's direction.I may say under _your_
direction, for I notice he does just about what you tell him to do.""If I were a man I'd rather be
Supervisor of this forest than Congressman.""Nash says you _are_ the Supervisor.I wonder if
your father realizes how efficient you are?Does he ever sorrow over your
not being a boy?""You're a good deal like a son to him, I imagine.You can do about all
that a boy can do, anyhow--more than I could ever do.Does he realize how
much you have to do with the management of his forest?I really believe you _could_ carry on the work as well as
he.""You seem to think I'm a district forester in
disguise.""I have eyes, Miss Supervisor, and also ears--which leads me to ask: Why
don't you clean out that saloon gang?Landon is sure there's crooked work
going on at that mill--certainly that open bar is a disgraceful and
corrupting thing.""We've tried to cut out that saloon, but it can't be
done.You see, it's on a patented claim--the claim was bogus, of course,
and we've made complaint, but the matter is hung up, and that gives 'em a
chance to go on.""Well, let's not talk of that.It's too delicious an hour for any
question of business.I wish I could write
what I feel this moment.Why don't we camp here and watch the sun go down
and the moon rise?From our lofty vantage-ground the coming of dawn would
be an epic.""We mustn't think of that," she protested.The wind in
the pines, the sunshine, the conies crying from their rocks, the
butterflies on the clover--my heart aches with the beauty of it.Even that staggering walk in the rain had its
splendid quality.I couldn't see the poetry in it then; but I do now.These few days have made us comrades, haven't they--comrades of the
trail?They are like steel, and yet they are feminine.""I'm ashamed of my hands--they are so big and
rough and dingy.""They're brown, of course, and calloused--a little--but they are not big,
and they are beautifully modeled.""I am
wondering how you would look in conventional dress.""I'd look like a gawk in one of those
low-necked outfits.I'd never dare--and those tight skirts would sure
<DW36> me."You'd have to modify your stride a little; but
you'd negotiate it.You're the kind of American girl that can
go anywhere and do anything.My sisters would mortgage their share of the
golden streets for your abounding health--and so would I.""You are all right now," she smiled."You don't look or talk as you
did."He lifted a spread hand as if to clutch and hold
something."I feel it soaking into me like some magical oil.No more
moping and whining for me.I've proved that hardship is good for me.""Don't crow till you're out of the woods.It's a long ride down the hill,
and going down is harder on the tenderfoot than going up."All I need is another trip like this with
you and I shall be a master trailer."All this was very sweet to her, and though she knew they should be going,
she lingered.Childishly reckless of the sinking sun, she played with the
wild flowers at her side and listened to his voice in complete content.The hour was too beautiful to be shortened, although she
saw no reason why others equally delightful might not come to them both.He was more of the lover than he had ever been before, that she knew, and
in the light of his eyes all that was not girlish and charming melted
away.She forgot her heavy shoes, her rough hands and sun-tanned face,
and listened with wondering joy and pride to his words, which were of a
fineness such as she had never heard spoken--only books contained such
unusual and exquisite phrases.A cloud passing across the sun flung down a shadow of portentous chill
and darkness.She started to her feet with startled recollection of the
place and the hour."We _must_ be going--at once!"I
have perfect confidence in your woodcraft.Why not spend another night on
the trail?He tempted her strongly, so frank and boyish and lovable were his glances
and his words.But she was vaguely afraid of herself, and though the long
ride at the moment seemed hard and dull, the thought of her mother
waiting decided her action."Suppose I refuse--suppose I
decide to stay here?"Upon her, as he talked, a sweet hesitation fell, a dream which held more
of happiness than she had ever known."It is a long, hard ride," she
thought, "and another night on the trail will not matter."And so the
moments passed on velvet feet, and still she lingered, reluctant to break
the spell.Suddenly, into their idyllic drowse of content, so sweet, so youthful,
and so pure of heart, broke the sound of a horse's hurrying, clashing,
steel-shod feet, and looking up Berrie saw a mounted man coming down the
mountainside with furious, reckless haste.And into her face came
a look of alarm."He's mad--he's
dangerous!Leave him to me," she added, in a low, tense voice.XI

THE DEATH-GRAPPLE


There was something so sinister in the rider's disregard of stone and
tree and pace, something so menacing in the forward thrust of his body,
that Berrie was able to divine his wrath, and was smitten into
irresolution--all her hardy, boyish self-reliance swallowed up in the
weakness of the woman.She forgot the pistol at her belt, and awaited the
assault with rigid pose.As Belden neared them Norcross also perceived that the rider's face was
distorted with passion, and that his glance was not directed upon Berrie,
but upon himself, and he braced himself for the attack.Leaving his saddle with one flying leap, which the cowboy practises at
play, Belden hurled himself upon his rival with the fury of a panther.The slender youth went down before the big rancher as though struck by a
catapult; and the force of his fall against the stony earth stunned him
so that he lay beneath his enemy as helpless as a child.[Illustration: THE SLENDER YOUTH WENT DOWN BEFORE THE BIG RANCHER
AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A CATAPULT]

Belden snarled between his teeth: "I told you I'd kill you, and I will."With a
cry of pain, of anger, she flung herself on the maddened man's back.Her
hands encircled his neck like a collar of bronze.Hardened by incessant
use of the cinch and the rope, her fingers sank into the sinews of his
great throat, shutting off both blood and breath."Let go, or I'll choke
the life out of you!He raised a hand to beat her off, but she was too strong, too desperate
to be driven away.She was as blind to pain as a mother eagle, and bent
above him so closely that he could not bring the full weight of his fist
to bear.With one determined hand still clutching his throat, she ran the
fingers of her other hand into his hair and twisted his head upward with
a power which he could not resist.And so, looking into his upturned,
ferocious eyes, she repeated with remorseless fury: "_Let go_, I say!"His swollen face grew rigid, his mouth gaped, his tongue protruded, and
at last, releasing his hold on his victim, he rose, flinging Berrie off
with a final desperate effort.Up to this moment the girl had felt no fear of herself; but now she
resorted to other weapons.Snatching her pistol from its holster, she
leveled it at his forehead.she said; and something in her voice
froze him into calm.He was not a fiend; he was not a deliberate
assassin; he was only a jealous, despairing, insane lover, and as he
looked into the face he knew so well, and realized that nothing but hate
and deadly resolution lit the eyes he had so often kissed, his heart gave
way, and, dropping his head, he said: "Kill me if you want to.There was something unreal, appalling in this sudden reversion to
weakness, and Berrie could not credit his remorse."Give me your gun,"
she said.He surrendered it to her and she threw it aside; then turned to Wayland,
who was lying white and still with face upturned to the sky.With a moan
of anguish she bent above him and called upon his name.He did not stir,
and when she lifted his head to her lap his hair, streaming with blood,
stained her dress.She kissed him and called again to him, then turned
with accusing frenzy to Belden: "You've killed him!The agony, the fury of hate in her voice reached the heart of the
conquered man.He raised his head and stared at her with mingled fear and
remorse.And so across that limp body these two souls, so lately lovers,
looked into each other's eyes as though nothing but words of hate and
loathing had ever passed between them.The girl saw in him only a savage,
vengeful, bloodthirsty beast; the man confronted in her an accusing
angel."I didn't mean to kill him," he muttered.You crushed his life out with your big
hands--and now I'm going to kill you for it!"Some far-off ancestral deep of passion
called for blood revenge.She lifted the weapon with steady hand and
pointed it at his heart.His head drooped, his glance
wavered."I'd sooner die than
live--now."His words, his tone, brought back to her a vision of the man he had
seemed when she first met and admired him.Her hand fell, the woman in
her reasserted itself.A wave of weakness, of indecision, of passionate
grief overwhelmed her.His glance wandered to his horse, serenely cropping
the grass in utter disregard of this tumultuous human drama; but the
wind, less insensate than the brute, swept through the grove of dwarfed,
distorted pines with a desolate, sympathetic moan which filled the man's
heart with a new and exalted sorrow.But Berrie was now too deep in her own desolation to care what he said or
did.She kissed the cold lips of the still youth, murmuring passionately:
"I don't care to live without you--I shall go with you!"Belden's hand was on her wrist before she could raise her weapon."Don't,
for God's sake, don't do that!Again she bent to the quiet face on which the sunlight fell with mocking
splendor.It seemed all a dream till she felt once more the stain of his
blood upon her hands.Only just now he
was exulting over the warmth and beauty of the day--and now--

How beautiful he was.The conies crying from their
runways suddenly took on poignant pathos.They appeared to be grieving
with her; but the eagles spoke of revenge.A sharp cry, a note of joy sprang from her lips.I saw
his eyelids quiver--quick!The man leaped to his feet, and, running down to the pool, filled his
sombrero with icy water.He was as eager now to save his rival as he had
been mad to destroy him.But she would not
permit him to touch the body.Again, while splashing the water upon his face, the girl called upon her
love to return.The wounded man did, indeed, open his eyes, but his look was a blank,
uncomprehending stare, which plunged her back into despair.She now perceived the source of
the blood upon her arm.It came from a wound in the boy's head which had
been dashed upon a stone.The sight of this wound brought back the blaze of accusing anger to her
eyes.Then by sudden
shift she bent to the sweet face in her arms and kissed it passionately.He opened his eyes once more, quietly, and looked up into her face with a
faint, drowsy smile.He could not yet locate himself in space and time,
but he knew her and was comforted.He wondered why he should be looking
up into a sunny sky.He heard the wind and the sound of a horse cropping
grass, and the voice of the girl penetratingly sweet as that of a young
mother calling her baby back to life, and slowly his benumbed brain began
to resolve the mystery.Belden, forgotten, ignored as completely as the conies, sat with choking
throat and smarting eyes.For him the world was only dust and ashes--a
ruin which his own barbaric spirit had brought upon itself.Slowly the youth's eyes took on expression."Yes, dearest," she assured him.Then to Belden, "He knows where he is!"He turned slightly and observed the other man looking down at her with
dark and tragic glance."Hello, Belden," he said, feebly.Then noting Berrie's look, he added: "I remember."Why didn't you finish the
job?"I don't care for anybody
now you are coming back to me."Wayland wonderingly regarded the face of the girl."And you--are you
hurt?"She turned to Belden with
quick, authoritative command."Unsaddle the horses and set up the tent.We won't be able to leave here to-night."He rose with instant obedience, glad of a chance to serve her, and soon
had the tent pegged to its place and the bedding unrolled.Together they
lifted the wounded youth and laid him upon his blankets beneath the low
canvas roof which seemed heavenly helpful to Berea."Now you are safe, no matter whether it
rains or not.""It seems I'm to have my way after all.I hope I shall be able
to see the sun rise.I've sort of lost my interest in the sunset.""Now, Cliff," she said, as soon as the camp was in order and a fire
started, "I reckon you'd better ride on.I haven't any further use for
you.""Don't say that, Berrie," he pleaded."I can't leave you here alone with
a sick man.She looked at him for a long time before she replied."I shall never be
able to look at you again without hating you," she said."I shall always
remember you as you looked when you were killing that boy.So you'd
better ride on and keep a-riding.I'm going to forget all this just as
soon as I can, and it don't help me any to have you around.I never want
to see you or hear your name again.""You don't mean that, Berrie!""Yes, I do," she asserted, bitterly.All I ask of you is to say nothing about what has happened
here.If Wayland should get worse it might
go hard with you."But I'd like to do something for you before I go.I'll pile up some
wood--"

"No.And without another word of farewell she
turned away and re-entered the tent.Mounting his horse with painful slowness, as though suddenly grown old,
the reprieved assassin rode away up the mountain, his head low, his eyes
upon the ground.XII

BERRIE'S VIGIL


The situation in which Berea now found herself would have disheartened
most women of mature age, but she remained not only composed, she was
filled with an irrational delight.The nurse that is in every woman was
aroused in her, and she looked forward with joy to a night of vigil,
confident that Wayland was not seriously injured and that he would soon
be able to ride.She had no fear of the forest or of the night.Nature
held no menace now that her tent was set and her fire alight.Wayland, without really knowing anything about it, suspected that he owed
his life to her intervention, and this belief deepened the feeling of
admiration which he had hitherto felt toward her.He listened to her at
work around the fire with a deepening sense of his indebtedness to her,
and when she looked in to ask if she could do anything for him, his
throat filled with an emotion which rendered his answer difficult.As his mind cleared he became very curious to know precisely what had
taken place, but he did not feel free to ask her.Daniel journeyed to the garden."She will tell me if
she wishes me to know."That she had vanquished Belden and sent him on
his way was evident, although he had not been able to hear what she had
said to him at the last.What lay between the enemy's furious onslaught
and the aid he lent in making the camp could only be surmised."I wonder
if she used her pistol?""Something like death
must have stared him in the face.""Strange how everything seems to throw me ever deeper into her debt," he
thought, a little later.But he did not quite dare put into words the
resentment which mingled with his gratitude.He hated to be put so
constantly into the position of the one protected, defended.He had put himself among people and conditions where
she was the stronger.Having ventured out of his world into hers he must
take the consequences.That she loved him with the complete passion of her powerful and simple
nature he knew, for her voice had reached through the daze of his
semi-unconsciousness with thrilling power.The touch of her lips to his,
the close clasp of her strong arms were of ever greater convincing
quality.And yet he wished the revelation had come in some other way.It was a
disconcerting reversal of the ordinary relations between hero and
heroine, and he saw no way of re-establishing the normal attitude of the
male.Entirely unaware of what was passing in the mind of her patient, Berrie
went about her duties with a cheerfulness which astonished the sufferer
in the tent.She seemed about to hum a song as she set the skillet on the
fire, but a moment later she called out, in a tone of irritation: "Here
comes Nash!""I'm glad of that," answered Wayland, although he perceived something of
her displeasure.Nash, on his way to join the Supervisor, raised a friendly greeting as he
saw the girl, and drew rein."I expected to meet you farther down the
hill," he said."Tony 'phoned that you had started."Camped down the trail a mile or so.I thought I'd better push through
to-night.He fell and struck his head
on a rock, and I had to go into camp here.""I don't think you'd better take the time.It's a long, hard ride from
here to the station.It will be deep night before you can make it--"

"Don't you think the Supervisor would want me to camp here to-night and
do what I could for you?If Norcross is badly injured you will need me."She liked Nash, and she knew he was right, and yet she was reluctant to
give up the pleasure of her lone vigil."He's not in any danger, and
we'll be able to ride on in the morning."Nash, thinking of her as Clifford Belden's promised wife, had no
suspicion of her feeling toward Norcross.Therefore he gently urged that
to go on was quite out of order."I _can't_ think of leaving you here
alone--certainly not till I see Norcross and find out how badly he is
hurt.""I reckon you're right," she said."I'll go see if he is
awake."He followed her to the door of the tent, apprehending something new and
inexplicable in her attitude.In the music of her voice as she spoke to
the sick man was the love-note of the mate."You may come in," she called
back, and Nash, stooping, entered the small tent."Hello, old man, what you been doing with yourself?"No, the hill flew up and bumped _me_."I had no share in it--I
didn't go for to do it.""Whether you did or not, you seem to have made a good job of it."Nash examined the wounded man carefully, and his skill and strength in
handling Norcross pleased Berrie, though she was jealous of the warm
friendship which seemed to exist between the men.She had always liked Nash, but she resented him now, especially as he
insisted on taking charge of the case; but she gave way finally, and went
back to her pots and pans with pensive countenance.A little later, when Nash came out to make report, she was not very
gracious in her manner."He's pretty badly hurt," he said."There's an
ugly gash in his scalp, and the shock has produced a good deal of pain
and confusion in his head; but he's going to be all right in a day or
two.For a man seeking rest and recuperation he certainly has had a tough
run of weather."Though a serious-minded, honorable forester, determined to keep sternly
in mind that he was in the presence of the daughter of his chief, and
that she was engaged to marry another, Nash was, after all, a man, and
the witchery of the hour, the charm of the girl's graceful figure,
asserted their power over him.His eyes grew tender, and his voice
eloquent in spite of himself.His words he could guard, but it was hard
to keep from his speech the song of the lover.The thought that he was to
camp in her company, to help her about the fire, to see her from moment
to moment, with full liberty to speak to her, to meet her glance, pleased
him.It was the most romantic and moving episode in his life, and though
of a rather dry and analytic temperament he had a sense of poesy.The night, black, oppressive, and silent, brought a closer bond of mutual
help and understanding between them.He built a fire of dry branches
close to the tent door, and there sat, side by side with the girl, in the
glow of embers, so close to the injured youth that they could talk
together, and as he spoke freely, yet modestly, of his experiences Berrie
found him more deeply interesting than she had hitherto believed him to
be.True, he saw things less poetically than Wayland, but he was finely
observant, and a man of studious and refined habits.She grew friendlier, and asked him about his work, and especially about
his ambitions and plans for the future.They discussed the forest and its
enemies, and he wondered at her freedom in speaking of the Mill and
saloon.He said: "Of course you know that Alec Belden is a partner in
that business, and I'm told--of course I don't know this--that Clifford
Belden is also interested."She offered no defense of young Belden, and this unconcern puzzled him.He had expected indignant protest, but she merely replied: "I don't care
who owns it.It's
just another way of robbing those poor tie-jacks.""Clifford should get out of it."His relationship to you--"

"He is not related to me.""Of course I do, but you're mistaken.We're not related that way any
longer."This silenced him for a few moments, then he said: "I'm rather glad of
that.He isn't anything like the man you thought he was--I couldn't say
these things before--but he is as greedy as Alec, only not so open about
it."All this comment, which moved the forester so deeply to utter, seemed not
to interest Berea.She sat staring at the fire with the calm brow of an
Indian.Clifford Belden had passed out of her life as completely as he
had vanished out of the landscape.She felt an immense relief at being
rid of him, and resented his being brought back even as a subject of
conversation.Wayland, listening, fancied he understood her desire, and said nothing
that might arouse Nash's curiosity.Nash, on his part, knowing that she had broken with Belden, began to
understand the tenderness, the anxious care of her face and voice, as she
bent above young Norcross.As the night deepened and the cold air stung,
he asked: "Have you plenty of blankets for a bed?""Oh yes," she answered, "but I don't intend to sleep.""I will make my bed right here at the mouth of the
tent close to the fire," she said, "and you can call me if you need me.""Why not put your bed in the tent?"I am all right outside," she protested."Put your bed inside, Miss Berrie.We can't let conventions count above
timber-line.I shall rest better if I know you are properly sheltered."And so it happened that for the third time she shared the same roof with
her lover; but the nurse was uppermost in her now.At eleven thousand
feet above the sea--with a cold drizzle of fine rain in the air--one does
not consider the course of gossip as carefully as in a village, and
Berrie slept unbrokenly till daylight.Nash was the first to arise in the dusk of dawn, and Berrie, awakened by
the crackle of his fire, soon joined him.There is no sweeter sound than
the voice of the flame at such a time, in such a place.It endows the
bleak mountainside with comfort, makes the ledge a hearthstone.It holds
the promise of savory meats and fragrant liquor, and robs the frosty air
of its terrors.Wayland, hearing their voices, called out, with feeble humor: "Will some
one please turn on the steam in my room?""Not precisely like a pugilist--well, yes, I believe I do--like the
fellow who got second money."inquired Nash, thrusting his head inside the door."Reduced to the size of a golf-ball as near as I can judge of it.I doubt
if I can wear a hat; but I'm feeling fine.Do you feel like riding down
the hill?"I'm hungry, and as soon as I am fed I'm ready to start."Berrie joined the surveyor at the fire."If you'll round up our horses, Mr.Nash, I'll rustle breakfast and we'll
get going," she said.Nash, enthralled, lingered while she twisted her hair into place, then
went out to bring in the ponies.Wayland came out a little uncertainly, but looking very well."I think I
shall discourage my friends from coming to this region for their health,"
he said, ruefully."If I were a novelist now all this would be grist for
my mill."Beneath his joking he was profoundly chagrined.He had hoped by this time
to be as sinewy, as alert as Nash, instead of which here he sat,
shivering over the fire like a sick girl, his head swollen, his blood
sluggish; but this discouragement only increased Berea's tenderness--a
tenderness which melted all his reserve."I'm not worth all your care," he said to her, with poignant glance.The sun rose clear and warm, and the fire, the coffee, put new courage
into him as well as into the others, and while the morning was yet early
and the forest chill and damp with rain, the surveyor brought up the
horses and started packing the outfit.In this Berrie again took part, doing her half of the work quite as
dextrously as Nash himself.Indeed, the forester was noticeably confused
and not quite up to his usual level of adroit ease.At last both packs were on, and as they stood together for a moment, Nash
said: "This has been a great experience--one I shall remember as long as
I live."She stirred uneasily under his frank admiration."I'm mightily obliged to
you," she replied, as heartily as she could command."Don't thank me, I'm indebted to you.There is so little in my life of
such companionship as you and Norcross give me.""You'll find it lonesome over at the station, I'm afraid," said she."But
Moore intends to put a crew of tie-cutters in over there--that will help
some.""I'm not partial to the society of tie-jacks.""If you ride hard you may find that Moore girl in camp.There was a sparkle of mischief in her glance."I'm not interested in the Moore girl," he retorted."I've seen her at the post-office once or twice; _she_ is not my kind."I'm all right now that Wayland can
ride.""I believe I'll ride back with you as far as
the camp."There was dismissal in her voice, and yet she recognized as never before
the fine qualities that were his."Please don't say anything of this to
others, and tell my father not to worry about us.He helped Norcross mount his horse, and as he put the lead rope into
Berrie's hand, he said: with much feeling: "Good luck to you.I shall
remember this night all the rest of my life.""I hate to be going to the rear," called Wayland, whose bare, bandaged
head made him look like a wounded young officer."But I guess it's better
for me to lay off for a week or two and recover my tone."And so they parted, the surveyor riding his determined way up the naked
mountainside toward the clouds, while Berrie and her ward plunged at once
into the dark and dripping forest below."If you can stand the grief,"
she said, "we'll go clear through."Wayland had his misgivings, but did not say so.She would do her part, that was certain.Several
times she was forced to dismount and blaze out a new path in order to
avoid some bog; but she sternly refused his aid."You must not get off,"
she warned; "stay where you are.They were again in that green, gloomy, and silent zone of the range,
where giant spruces grow, and springs, oozing from the rocks, trickle
over the trail.It was very beautiful, but menacing, by reason of its
apparently endless thickets cut by stony ridges.It was here she met the
two young men, Downing and Travis, bringing forward the surveying outfit,
but she paused only to say: "Push along steadily.After leaving the men, and with a knowledge that the remaining leagues of
the trail were solitary, Norcross grew fearful."The fall of a horse, an
accident to that brave girl, and we would be helpless," he thought."I
wish Nash had returned with us."Once his blood chilled with horror as he
watched his guide striking out across the marge of a grassy lake.This
meadow, as he divined, was really a carpet of sod floating above a
bottomless pool of muck, for it shook beneath her horse's feet."Come on, it's all right," she called back, cheerily."We'll soon pick up
the other trail."He wondered how she knew, for to him each hill was precisely like
another, each thicket a maze.She tried each dangerous slough first, and
thus was able to advise him which way was safest.His head throbbed with
pain and his knees were weary, but he rode on, manifesting such cheer as
he could, resolving not to complain at any cost; but his self-respect
ebbed steadily, leaving him in bitter, silent dejection.At last they came into open ground on a high ridge, and were gladdened by
the valley outspread below them, for it was still radiant with color,
though not as brilliant as before the rain.It had been dimmed, but not
darkened.And yet it seemed that a month had passed since their ecstatic
ride upward through the golden forest, and Wayland said as much while
they stood for a moment surveying the majestic park with its wall of
guardian peaks.But Berrie replied: "It seems only a few hours to me."From this point the traveling was good, and they descended rapidly,
zigzagging from side to side of a long, sweeping ridge.By noon they were
once more down amid the aspens, basking in a world of sad gold leaves and
delicious September sunshine.At one o'clock, on the bank of a clear stream, the girl halted."I reckon
we'd better camp awhile.He gratefully acquiesced in this stop, for his knees were trembling with
the strain of the stirrups; but he would not permit her to ease him down
from his saddle.Turning a wan glance upon her, he bitterly asked: "Must
I always play the weakling before you?Ride on
and leave me to rot here in the grass."You must not talk like that," she gently admonished him.I should never have ventured into this man's country.""I'm glad you did," she answered, as if she were comforting a child."For
if you hadn't I should never have known you.""That would have been no loss--to you," he bitterly responded.Sandra journeyed to the garden.She unsaddled one pack-animal and spread some blankets on the grass."Lie
down and rest while I boil some coffee," she commanded; and he obeyed,
too tired to make pretension toward assisting.Lying so, feeling the magic of the sun, hearing the music of the water,
and watching the girl, he regained a serener mood, and when she came back
with his food he thanked her for it with a glance before which her eyes
fell."I don't see why you are so kind to me, I really believe you _like_
to do things for me."Her head drooped to hide her face, and he went on:
"Why do you care for me?"I don't know," she murmured.Then she added, with a flash of bravery:
"But I do."You turn from a splendid fellow like Landon to
a'skate' like me.Landon worships you--you know that--don't you?""I know--he--" she ended, vaguely distressed.He's a man of high character
and education."She made no answer to this, and he went on: "Dear girl,
I'm not worth your care--truly I'm not.I resented your engagement to
Belden, for he was a brute; but Landon is different.I've never done anything in the
world--I never shall.It will be better for you if I go--to-morrow."She took his hand and pressed it to her cheek, then, putting her arm
about his neck, drew him to her bosom and kissed him passionately."You
break my heart when you talk like that," she protested, with tears."You
mustn't say such gloomy things--I won't let you give up.You shall come
right home with me, and I will nurse you till you are well.If we had only stayed in camp at the lake daddy would have joined
us that night, and if I had not loitered on the mountain yesterday Cliff
would not have overtaken us."I will not have it go that way," he said."I've brought you only care
and unhappiness thus far.I'm an alien--my ways are not your ways.""I hate my ways, and I like yours."As they argued she felt no shame, and he voiced no resentment.She pleaded as a man
might have done, ready to prove her love, eager to restore his
self-respect, while he remained both bitter and sadly contemptuous.A cow-hand riding up the trail greeted Berrie respectfully, but a cynical
smile broke out on his lips as he passed on.She had no further concern of the valley's comment.Her
life's happiness hung on the drooping eyelashes of this wounded boy, and
to win him back to cheerful acceptance of life was her only concern."I've never had any motives," he confessed."I've always done what
pleased me at the moment--or because it was easier to do as others were
doing.Truth is, I never had any surplus
vitality, and my father never demanded anything of me.A few days ago I was interested in forestry.What's the use of my trying to live?"Part of all this despairing cry arose from weariness, and part from a
luxurious desire to be comforted, for it was sweet to feel her sympathy.He even took a morbid pleasure in the distress of her eyes and lips while
her rich voice murmured in soothing protest.She, on her part, was frightened for him, and as she thought of the long
ride still before them she wrung her hands.Instantly smitten into shame, into manlier mood, he said: "Don't worry
about me, please don't."If we can reach Miller's ranch--"

"I can ride to _your_ ranch," he declared, and rose with such new-found
resolution that she stared at him in wonder.I've relieved my
heart of its load.Wonder what that
cowboy thought of me?"His sudden reversal to cheer was a little alarming to her, but at length
she perceived that he had in truth mastered his depression, and bringing
up the horses she saddled them, and helped him to mount."If you get
tired or feel worse, tell me, and we'll go into camp," she urged as they
were about to start."You keep going till I give the sign," he replied; and his voice was so
firm and clear that her own sunny smile came back."I don't know what to
make of you," she said.XIII

THE GOSSIPS AWAKE


It was dark when they reached the village, but Wayland declared his
ability to go on, although his wounded head was throbbing with fever and
he was clinging to the pommel of his saddle; so Berrie rode on.McFarlane, hearing the horses on the bridge, was at the door and
received her daughter with wondering question, while the stable-hands,
quick to detect an injured man, hurried to lift Norcross down from his
saddle."He fell and struck his head on a stone," Berea hastily explained."Take
the horses, boys, mother and I will look out for Mr.The men obeyed her and fell back, but they were consumed with curiosity,
and their glances irritated the girl."Slip the packs at once," she
insisted.With instant sympathy her mother came to her aid in supporting the
wounded, weary youth indoors, and as he stretched out on the couch in the
sitting-room, he remarked, with a faint, ironic smile: "This beats any
bed of balsam boughs.""He's over on the Ptarmigan.I've a powerful lot to tell you, mother; but
not now; we must look after Wayland.He's nearly done up, and so am I."McFarlane winced a little at her daughter's use of Norcross's first
name, but she said nothing further at the moment, although she watched
Berrie closely while she took off Wayland's shoes and stockings and
rubbed his icy feet."Get him something hot as quick as you can!"Gradually the tremor passed out of his limbs and a delicious sense of
warmth, of safety, stole over him, and he closed his eyes in the comfort
of her presence and care."Rigorous business this life of the pioneer,"
he said, with mocking inflection."I think I prefer a place in the lumber
trust."Then, with a rush of tender remorse: "Why didn't
you tell me to stop?I didn't realize that you were so tired."I didn't know how tired I was till I got here.Gee," he said, boyishly,
"that door-knob at the back of my head is red-hot!You're good to me," he
added, humbly.She hated to have him resume that tone of self-depreciation, and,
kneeling to him, she kissed his cheek, and laid her head beside his."Nobody could be braver; but you should
have told me you were exhausted.You fooled me with your cheerful
answers."He accepted her loving praise, her clasping arms, as a part of the rescue
from the darkness and pain of the long ride, careless of what it might
bring to him in the future.He ate his toast and drank his coffee, and
permitted the women to lead him to his room, and then being alone he
crept into his bed and fell instantly asleep.Berrie and her mother went back to the sitting-room, and Mrs.McFarlane
closed the door behind them."Now tell me all about it," she said, in the
tone of one not to be denied.The story went along very smoothly till the girl came to the second night
in camp beside the lake; there her voice faltered, and the reflective
look in the mother's eyes deepened as she learned that her daughter had
shared her tent with the young man."It was the only thing to do,
mother," Berrie bravely said."It was cold and wet outside, and you know
he isn't very strong, and his teeth were chattering, he was so chilled.I
know it sounds strange down here; but up there in the woods in the storm
what I did seemed right and natural.You know what I mean, don't you?"I don't blame you--only--if others should hear of
it--"

"But they won't.No one knows of our being alone there except Tony and
father.""I don't think so--not yet.""I wish you hadn't gone on this trip.If the Beldens find out you were alone with Mr.Norcross they'll make
much of it.It will give them a chance at your father.""I don't like to tell
you, mother, but he didn't fall, Cliff jumped him and tried to kill
him.""I don't know how he found out we were on the
trail.I suppose the old lady 'phoned him.Anyhow, while we were camped
for noon yesterday"--her face flamed again at thought of that tender,
beautiful moment when they were resting on the grass--"while we were at
our lunch he came tearing down the hill on that big bay horse of his and
took a flying jump at Wayland.As Wayland went down he struck his head on
a stone.I thought he was dead, and I was paralyzed for a second.Then I
flew at Cliff and just about choked the life out of him.I'd have ended
him right there if he hadn't let go."McFarlane, looking upon her daughter in amazement, saw on her face
the shadow of the deadly rage which had burned in her heart as she
clenched young Belden's throat."And when he realized what
he'd done--_he_ thought Wayland was dead--he began to weaken.Then I took
my gun and was all for putting an end to him right there, when I saw
Wayland's eyelids move.After that I didn't care what became of Cliff.I
told him to ride on and keep a-ridin', and I reckon he's clear out of the
state by this time.If he ever shows up I'll put him where he'll have all
night to be sorry in."Of course Wayland couldn't ride, he was so dizzy
and kind o' confused, and so I went into camp right there at timber-line.Along about sunset Nash came riding up from this side, and insisted on
staying to help me--so I let him.""Nash is not the kind that
tattles."And this morning I saddled and came down.""Yes, daddy was waiting for him, so I sent him along.""It's all sad business," groaned Mrs.McFarlane, "and I can see you're
keeping something back.How did Cliff happen to know just where you were?For the first time Berrie showed signs of weakness and distress."Why,
you see, Alec Belden and Mr.Moore were over there to look at some
timber, and old Marm Belden and that Moore girl went along.I suppose
they sent word to Cliff, and I presume that Moore girl put him on our
trail.Leastwise that's the way I figure it out.That's the worst of the
whole business."Belden's
tongue is hung in the middle and loose at both ends--and that Moore girl
is spiteful mean."She could not keep the contempt out of her voice."She
saw us start off, and she is sure to follow it up and find out what
happened on the way home; even if they don't see Cliff they'll _talk_.""Oh, I _wish_ you hadn't gone!""It can't be helped now, and it hasn't done me any real harm.It's all in
the day's work, anyhow.I've always gone with daddy before, and this trip
isn't going to spoil me.The boys all know me, and they will treat me
fair."Norcross is an outsider--a city man.They will all think
evil of him on that account.""I know; that's what troubles me.No one will know how fine and
considerate he was.Mother, I've never known any one like him.He's taught me to see things I never saw before.Everything
interests him--the birds, the clouds, the voices in the fire.I never was
so happy in my life as I was during those first two days, and that night
in camp before he began to worry--it was just wonderful."Words failed
her, but her shining face and the forward straining pose of her body
enlightened the mother."I don't care what people say of me if only they
will be just to him.They've _got_ to treat him right," she added,
firmly."Did he speak to you--are you engaged?""Not really engaged, mother; but he told me how much he
liked me--and--it's all right, mother, I _know_ it is.I'm not fine
enough for him, but I'm going to try to change my ways so he won't be
ashamed of me.""He surely is a fine young fellow, and can
be trusted to do the right thing.Well, we might as well go to bed.We
can't settle anything till your father gets home," she said.Wayland rose next morning free from dizziness and almost free from pain,
and when he came out of his room his expression was cheerful."I feel as
if I'd slept a week, and I'm hungry.I don't know why I should be, but I
am."McFarlane met him with something very intimate, something almost
maternal in her look; but her words were as few and as restrained as
ever.He divined that she had been talking with Berrie, and that a fairly
clear understanding of the situation had been reached.That this
understanding involved him closely he was aware; but nothing in his
manner acknowledged it.She did not ask any questions, believing that sooner or later the whole
story must come out.Belden knew that
Berrie had started back on Thursday with young Norcross made it easy for
the villagers to discover that she had not reached the ranch till
Saturday."What could Joe have been thinking of to allow them to go?"Nash's presence in the camp must be made known; but then there
is Clifford's assault upon Mr.Norcross, can that be kept secret, too?"And so while the young people chatted, the troubled mother waited in
fear, knowing that in a day or two the countryside would be aflame with
accusation.In a landscape like this, as she well knew, nothing moves unobserved.The
native--man or woman--is able to perceive and name objects scarcely
discernible to the eye of the alien.A minute speck is discovered on the
hillside."Hello, there's Jim Sanders on his roan," says one, or "Here
comes Kit Jenkins with her flea-bit gray.I wonder who's on the bay
alongside of her," remarks another, and each of these observations is
taken quite as a matter of course.With a wide and empty field of vision,
and with trained, unspoiled optic nerves, the plainsman is marvelously
penetrating of glance.McFarlane was perfectly certain that
not one but several of her neighbors had seen and recognized Berrie and
young Norcross as they came down the hill.In a day or two every man
would know just where they camped, and what had taken place in camp.Belden would not rest till she had ferreted out every crook and turn of
that trail, and her speech was quite as coarse as that of any of her male
associates.Easy-going with regard to many things, these citizens were abnormally
alive to all matters relating to courtship, and popular as she believed
Berrie to be, Mrs.McFarlane could not hope that her daughter would be
spared--especially by the Beldens, who would naturally feel that Clifford
had been cheated."Well, nothing can be done till Joe
returns," she repeated.A long day's rest, a second night's sleep, set Wayland on his feet."Barring the hickory-nut on the back of my
head," he explained, "I'm feeling fine, almost ready for another
expedition.Berrie, though equally gay, was not so sure of his ability to return to
work."I reckon you'd better go easy till daddy gets back; but if you
feel like it we'll ride up to the post-office this afternoon.""I want to start right in to learn to throw that hitch, and I'm going to
practise with an ax till I can strike twice in the same place.This trip
was an eye-opener.Great man I'd be in a windfall--wouldn't I?"He was persuaded to remain very quiet for another day, and part of it was
spent in conversation with Mrs.McFarlane--whom he liked very much--and
an hour or more in writing a long letter wherein he announced to his
father his intention of going into the Forest Service."I've got to build
up a constitution," he said, "and I don't know of a better place to do it
in.Besides, I'm beginning to be interested in the scheme.I'm living in his house at the present time, and I'm feeling
contented and happy, so don't worry about me."He was indeed quite comfortable, save when he realized that Mrs.McFarlane was taking altogether too much for granted in their
relationship.It was delightful to be so watched over, so waited upon, so
instructed.he continued to ask
himself--and still that wall of reserve troubled and saddened Berrie.They expected McFarlane that night, and waited supper for him, but he did
not come, and so they ate without him, and afterward Wayland helped
Berrie do up the dishes while the mother bent above her sewing by the
kitchen lamp.There was something very sweet and gentle about Mrs.McFarlane, and the
exile took almost as much pleasure in talking with her as with her
daughter.He led her to tell of her early experiences in the valley, and
of the strange types of men and women with whom she had crossed the
range."Some of them are here yet," she said."In fact the most violent of all
the opponents to the Service are these old adventurers.I don't think
they deserve to be called pioneers.They never did any work in clearing
the land or in building homes.Some of them, who own big herds of cattle,
still live in dug-outs.McFarlane for going into the
Service--called him a traitor.Old Jake Proudfoot was especially
furious--"

"You should see where old Jake lives," interrupted Berrie."He sleeps on
the floor in one corner of his cabin, and never changes his shirt."Daddy declares if they were to scrape Jake
they'd find at least five layers of shirts.His wife left him fifteen
years ago, couldn't stand his habits, and he's got worse ever since."Of course," her mother explained, "those who oppose the Supervisor
aren't all like Jake; but it makes me angry to have the papers all
quoting Jake as 'one of the leading ranchers of the valley.'"She could not bring herself to take up the most vital subject of all--the
question of her daughter's future."I'll wait till father gets home," she
decided.On the fourth morning the 'phone rang, and the squawking voice of Mrs."I wanted to know if Berrie and her feller got
home all right?""Last I see of Cliff he was hot on their
trail--looked like he expected to take a hand in that expedition."I don't hear very well--where are you?""I'm at the Scott ranch--we're coming round 'the horn' to-day."Say, Cliff was mad as a hornet when he
started.I'd like to know what happened--"

Mrs.The old woman's nasty chuckle was
intolerable; but in silencing the 'phone Mrs.McFarlane was perfectly
aware that she was not silencing the gossip; on the contrary, she was
certain that the Beldens would leave a trail of poisonous comment from
the Ptarmigan to Bear Tooth.Berrie wanted to know who was speaking, and Mrs.Belden wanted to know if you got through all right.""She said something else, something to heat you up," persisted the girl,
who perceived her mother's agitation."What did she say--something about
me--and Cliff?"The mother did not answer, for Wayland entered the room at the moment;
but Berrie knew that traducers were already busy with her affairs."I
don't care anything about old lady Belden," she said, later; "but I hate
to have that Moore girl telling lies about me."As for Wayland, the nights in the camp by the lake, and, indeed, all the
experiences of his trip in the high places were becoming each moment more
remote, more unreal.Camp life at timber-line did not seem to him subject
to ordinary conventional laws of human conduct, and the fact that he and
Berrie had shared the same tent under the stress of cold and snow, now
seemed so far away as to be only a complication in a splendid mountain
drama.Surely no blame could attach to the frank and generous girl, even
though the jealous assault of Cliff Belden should throw the valley into a
fever of chatter."Furthermore, I don't believe he will be in haste to
speak of his share in the play," he added.It was almost noon of the fourth day when the Supervisor called up to say
that he was at the office, and would reach the ranch at six o'clock."I wish you would come home at once," his wife argued; and something in
her voice convinced him that he was more needed at home, than in the
town.Hold the fort an hour and I'll be there."McFarlane met him at the hitching-bar, and it required but a glance
for him to read in her face a troubled state of mind."This has been a disastrous trip for Berrie," she said, after one of the
hands had relieved the Supervisor of his horse.Belden is filling the valley with the
story of Berrie's stay in camp with Mr.The horses had to
be followed, and that youngster couldn't do it--and, besides, I expected
to get back that night.Nobody but an old snoop like Seth Belden would
think evil of our girl.And, besides, Norcross is a man to be trusted.""Of course he is, but the Beldens are ready to think evil of any one
connected with us.And Cliff's assault on Wayland--"

He looked up quickly."Yes, he overtook them on the trail, and would have killed Norcross if
Berrie hadn't interfered."Nash didn't say anything about any assault."Berrie told him that Norcross fell from his horse.""I saw Cliff leave camp, but I didn't think
anything of it.Belden filled him with distrust of Berrie.He was already
jealous, and when he came up with them and found them lunching together,
he lost his head and rushed at Wayland like a wild beast.Of course he
couldn't stand against a big man like Cliff, and his head struck on a
stone; and if Berrie hadn't throttled the brute he would have murdered
the poor boy right there before her eyes."I didn't think he'd do
that."These domestic matters at once threw
his work as forester into the region of vague and unimportant
abstractions.He began to understand the danger into which Berea had
fallen, and step by step he took up the trails which had brought them all
to this pass.He fixed another penetrating look upon her face, and his voice was vibrant
with anxiety as he said: "You don't think there's anything--wrong?""No, nothing wrong; but she's profoundly in love with him.I never have
seen her so wrapped up in any one.It scares
me to see it, for I've studied him closely and I can't believe he feels
the same toward her.I don't know
what to do or say.I fear she is in for a period of great unhappiness."She was at the beginning of tears, and he sought to comfort her."Don't
worry, honey, she's got too much horse sense to do anything foolish.I suppose it's his being so different from the other boys
that catches her.We've always been good chums--let me talk with her.The return of the crew from the corral cut short this conference, and
when McFarlane went in Berrie greeted him with such frank and joyous
expression that all his fears vanished.I didn't want to take any chances on getting mired.It's still raining up there," he answered, then turned to Wayland:
"Here's your mail, Norcross, a whole hatful of it--and one telegram in
the bunch.Wayland took the bundle of letters and retired to his room, glad to
escape the persistent stare of the cow-hands.The despatch was from his
father, and was curt and specific as a command: "Shall be in Denver on
the 23d, meet me at the Palmer House.Come
prepared to join me on the trip."With the letters unopened in his lap he sat in silent thought, profoundly
troubled by the instant decision which this message demanded of him.At
first glance nothing was simpler than to pack up and go.He was only a
tourist in the valley with no intention of staying; but there was Berea!To go meant a violent end of their pleasant romance.To think of flight
saddened him, and yet his better judgment was clearly on the side of
going."Much as I like her, much as I admire her, I cannot marry her.The
simplest way is to frankly tell her so and go.It seems cowardly, but in
the end she will be happier."His letters carried him back into his own world.One was from Will
Halliday, who was going with Professor Holsman on an exploring trip up
the Nile.Holsman has promised to take you on."Another classmate wrote to know if he did not want to go into a land deal
on the Gulf of Mexico.A girl asked: "Are you to be in New York this
winter?I've decided to go into this Suffrage Movement."And so,
one by one, the threads which bound him to Eastern city life re-spun
their filaments.After all, this Colorado outing, even though it should
last two years, would only be a vacation--his real life was in the cities
of the East.Charming as Berea was, potent as she seemed, she was after
all a fixed part of the mountain land, and not to be taken from it.At
the moment marriage with her appeared absurd.A knock at his door and the Supervisor's voice gave him a keen shock."Come in," he called, springing to his feet with a thrill of dread, of
alarm.McFarlane entered slowly and shut the door behind him.His manner was
serious, and his voice gravely gentle as he said: "I hope that telegram
does not call you away?""It is from my father, asking me to meet him in Denver," answered
Norcross, with faltering breath.The older man took a seat with quiet dignity."Seems like a mighty fine
chance, don't it?When do you plan
for to pull out?"Wayland was not deceived by the Supervisor's casual tone; there was
something ominously calm in his manner, something which expressed an
almost dangerous interest in the subject."I haven't decided to go at all.I'm still dazed by the suddenness of it.I didn't know my father was planning this trip."Well, before you decide to go I'd like to have a little talk with
you.My daughter has told me part of what happened to you on the trail.I
want to know _all_ of it.You're young, but you've been out in the world,
and you know what people can say about you and my girl."His voice became
level and menacing, as he added: "And I don't intend to have her put in
wrong on account of you."No one will dare to criticize her for what she could
not prevent.""You don't know the Beldens.My girl's character will be on trial in
every house in the county to-morrow.The Belden side of it will appear in
the city papers.Berrie will be made an
issue by my enemies.exclaimed Norcross, in sudden realization of the gravity of
the case."Moore's gang will seize upon it and work it hard," McFarlane went on,
with calm insistence."They want to bring the district forester down on
me.This is a fine chance to badger me.They will make a great deal of my
putting you on the roll.Our little camping trip is likely to prove a
serious matter to us all.""Surely you don't consider me at fault?"Worried as he was, the father was just."No, you're not to blame--no one
is to blame.It all dates back to the horses quitting camp; but you've
got to stand pat now--for Berrie's sake."Tell me
what to do, and I will do it."McFarlane was staggered, but he answered: "You can at least stay on the
ground and help fight.I'll stay, and I'll make any statement you see fit.I'll
do anything that will protect Berrie."McFarlane again looked him squarely in the eyes."Is there a--an
agreement between you?""Nothing formal--that is--I mean I admire her, and I told her--" He
stopped, feeling himself on the verge of the irrevocable."She's a
splendid girl," he went on."I like her exceedingly, but I've known her
only a few weeks.""Girls are flighty critters," he said, sadly."I
don't know why she's taken to you so terrible strong; but she has.She
don't seem to care what people say so long as they do not blame you; but
if you should pull out you might just as well cut her heart to pieces--"
His voice broke, and it was a long time before he could finish."You're
not at fault, I know that, but if you _can_ stay on a little while and
make it an ounce or two easier for her and for her mother, I wish you'd
do it."In the grip of McFarlane's hand was something
warm and tender."I'm terribly obliged," he said; "but we mustn't let her suspect
for a minute that we've been discussing her.She hates being pitied or
helped.""She shall not experience a moment's uneasiness that I can prevent,"
replied the youth; and at the moment he meant it.She read in her father's face a
subtle change of line which she related to something Wayland had said."Did he tell you what was in the telegram?"Yes, he said it was from his father.""He's on his way to California and wants Wayland to go with him; but
Wayland says he's not going."A pang shot through Berrie's heart."He mustn't go--he isn't able to go,"
she exclaimed, and her pain, her fear, came out in her sharpened,
constricted tone."I won't let him go--till he's well.""He'll have to go, honey, if his father
needs him."She rose, and, going to his door, decisively
knocked.she demanded, rather than asked, before her
mother could protest.Wayland opened the door, and she entered, leaving her parents facing each
other in mute helplessness.McFarlane turned toward her husband with a face of despair."She's
ours no longer, Joe.You cut loose from your parents and came to me in just the same
way.Our daughter's a grown woman, and must have her own life.All we can
do is to defend her against the coyotes who are busy with her name.""But what of _him_, Joe; he don't care for her as she does for him--can't
you see that?""He'll do the right thing, mother; he told me he would.He knows how much
depends on his staying here now, and he intends to do it.""But in the end, Joe, after this scandal is lived down, can he--will
he--marry her?And if he marries her can they live together and be happy?He can't content himself here, and she
can't fit in where he belongs.Wouldn't it
be better for her to suffer for a little while now than to make a mistake
that may last a lifetime?""Mebbe it would, mother, but the decision is not ours.She's too strong
for us to control.She's of age, and if she comes to a full understanding
of the situation, she can decide the question a whole lot better than
either of us.""In some ways she's bigger and stronger than
both of us.Sometimes I wish she were not so self-reliant.""Well, that's the way life is, sometimes, and I reckon there's nothin'
left for you an' me but to draw closer together and try to fill up the
empty place she's going to leave between us."XIV

THE SUMMONS


When Wayland caught the startled look on Berrie's face he knew that she
had learned from her father the contents of his telegram, and that she
would require an explanation.At least, I must go down to Denver to see my father."And will you tell him about our trip?"she pursued, with unflinching
directness.He gave her a chair, and took a seat himself before replying."Yes, I
shall tell him all about it, and about you and your father and mother.He
shall know how kind you've all been to me."He said this bravely, and at the moment he meant it; but as his father's
big, impassive face and cold, keen eyes came back to him his courage
sank, and in spite of his firm resolution some part of his secret anxiety
communicated itself to the girl, who asked many questions, with intent to
find out more particularly what kind of man the elder Norcross was.Wayland's replies did not entirely reassure her.He admitted that his
father was harsh and domineering in character, and that he was ambitious
to have his son take up and carry forward his work."He was willing
enough to have me go to college till he found I was specializing on wrong
lines.Then I had to fight in order to keep my place.He's glad I'm out
here, for he thinks I'm regaining my strength.But just as soon as I'm
well enough he expects me to go to Chicago and take charge of the Western
office.Of course, I don't want to do that.I'd rather work out some
problem in chemistry that interests me; but I may have to give in, for a
time at least.""Will your mother and sisters be with your father?"You couldn't get any one of them west of the Hudson River
with a log-chain.My sisters were both born in Michigan, but they want to
forget it--they pretend they have forgotten it."I suppose they think we're all 'Injuns' out here?""Oh no, not so bad as that; but they wouldn't comprehend anything about
you except your muscle.They'd worship your
splendid health, just as I do.It's pitiful the way they both try to put
on weight.They're always testing some new food, some new tonic--they'll
do anything except exercise regularly and go to bed at ten o'clock."All that he said of his family deepened her dismay.Their interests were
so alien to her own."I'm afraid to have you go even for a day," she admitted, with simple
honesty, which moved him deeply."I don't know what I should do if you
went away.Her face was pitiful, and he put his arm about her neck as if she were a
child.You must go on with your life just as if I'd
never been.Think of your father's job--of the forest and the ranch."I never want to go
into the high country again, and I don't want you to go, either."That is only a mood," he said, confidently.He could not divine, and she could not tell him, how poignantly she had
sensed the menace of the cold and darkness during his illness.For the
first time in her life she had realized to the full the unrelenting
enmity of the clouds, the wind, the night; and during that interminable
ride toward home, when she saw him bending lower and lower over his
saddle-bow, her allegiance to the trail, her devotion to the stirrup was
broken.His weariness and pain had changed the universe for her.Never
again would she look upon the range with the eyes of the care-free girl.The other, the civilized, the domestic, side of her was now dominant.A
new desire, a bigger aspiration, had taken possession of her.Little by little he realized this change in her, and was touched with the
wonder of it.He had never had any great self-love either as man or
scholar, and the thought of this fine, self-sufficient womanly soul
centering all its interests on him was humbling.Each moment his
responsibility deepened, and he heard her voice but dimly as she went
on."Of course we are not rich; but we are not poor, and my mother's family
is one of the oldest in Kentucky."She uttered this with a touch of her
mother's quiet dignity."So far as my father is concerned, family don't count, and neither does
money.But he confidently expects me to take up his business in Chicago,
and I suppose it is my duty to do so.If he finds me looking fit he may
order me into the ranks at once.""I'll go there--I'll do anything you want me to do," she urged."You can
tell your father that I'll help you in the office.I'm ready
to use a typewriter--anything."He was silent in the face of her naive expression of self-sacrificing
love, and after a moment she added, hesitatingly: "I wish I could meet
your father.Perhaps he'd come up here if you asked him to do so?"I don't
want to go to town.I just believe I'll wire him that I'm laid up here
and can't come."Then a shade of new trouble came over his face.How
would the stern, methodical old business man regard this slovenly ranch
and its primitive ways?"You're afraid to have him come," she said, with the same disconcerting
penetration which had marked every moment of her interview thus far."You're afraid he wouldn't like me?"With almost equal frankness he replied: "No.I think he'd like _you_, but
this town and the people up here would gall him.Then he's got a vicious slant against all this conservation
business--calls it tommy-rot.He and your father might lock horns first
crack out of the box.A knock at the door interrupted him, and Mrs.McFarlane's voice, filled
with new excitement, called out: "Berrie, the District office is on the
wire."Berrie opened the door and confronted her mother, who said: "Mr.Evingham
'phones that the afternoon papers contain an account of a fight at Coal
City between Settle and one of Alec Belden's men, and that the District
Forester is coming down to investigate it.""Let him come," answered Berrie, defiantly.McFarlane, with the receiver to his ear, was saying: "Don't know a thing
about it, Mr.Settle was at the station when I left.I didn't
know he was going down to Coal City.My daughter
was never engaged to Alec Belden.Alec Belden is the older of the
brothers, and is married.If you come down
I'll explain fully."He hung up the receiver and slowly turned toward his wife and daughter."This sure is our day of trouble," he said, with dejected countenance."Why, it seems that after I left yesterday Settle rode down the valley
with Belden's outfit, and they all got to drinking, ending in a row, and
Tony beat one of Belden's men almost to death.The sheriff has gone over
to get Tony, and the Beldens declare they're going to railroad him.That
means we'll all be brought into it.Belden has seized the moment to
prefer charges against me for keeping Settle in the service and for
putting a non-resident on the roll as guard.The whelp will dig up
everything he can to queer me with the office.All that kept him from
doing it before was Cliff's interest in you.""He can't make any of his charges stick," declared Berrie.Norcross will both be called as witnesses, for it seems that
Tony was defending your name.The papers call it 'a fight for a girl.'They can't make me do that, can they?"It is a shame to have you mixed up in
such a trial.""I shall not run away and leave you and the Supervisor to bear all the
burden of this fight."He anticipated in imagination--as they all did--some of the consequences
of this trial.The entire story of the camping trip would be dragged in,
distorted into a scandal, and flashed over the country as a disgraceful
episode.The country would ring with laughter and coarse jest.Berrie's
testimony would be a feast for court-room loafers."There's only one thing to do," said McFarlane, after a few moments of
thought.McFarlane must get out of here before
you are subpoenaed.""And leave you to fight it out alone?""I shall do
nothing of the kind."That won't do," retorted McFarlane, quickly.I will not have you dragged
into this muck-hole.We've got to think quick and act quick.There won't
be any delay about their side of the game.I don't think they'll do
anything to-day; but you've got to fade out of the valley.You all get
ready and I'll have one of the boys hook up the surrey as if for a little
drive, and you can pull out over the old stage-road to Flume and catch
the narrow-gage morning train for Denver.You've been wanting for some
time to go down the line."We won't leave you to inherit all this trouble.The more I consider this thing, the more worrisome it gets.If he does I'll have him arrested for trying to kill Wayland,"
retorted Berrie.You are all going to cross the
range.You can start out as if for a little turn round the valley, and
just naturally keep going.It can't do any harm, and it may save a nasty
time in court.""One would think we were a lot of criminals," remarked Wayland."That's the way you'll be treated," retorted McFarlane."Belden has
retained old Whitby, the foulest old brute in the business, and he'll
bring you all into it if he can.""But running away from it will not prevent talk," argued his wife."Not entirely; but talk and testimony are two different things.Suppose
they call daughter to the stand?Do you want her cross-examined as to
what basis there was for this gossip?They know something of Cliff's
being let out, and that will inflame them.He may be at the mill this
minute.""I guess you're right," said Norcross, sadly."Our delightful excursion
into the forest has led us into a predicament from which there is only
one way of escape, and that is flight."Back of all this talk, this argument, there remained still unanswered the
most vital, most important question: "Shall I speak of marriage at this
time?Would it be a source of comfort to them as well as a joy to her?"At the moment he was ready to speak, for he felt himself to be the direct
cause of all their embarrassment.But closer thought made it clear that a
hasty ceremony would only be considered a cloak to cover something
illicit."I'll leave it to the future," he decided.McFarlane was again called to the telephone.Landon, with characteristic
brevity, conveyed to him the fact that Mrs.Belden was at home and busily
'phoning scandalous stories about the country."If you don't stop her
she's going to poison every ear in the valley," ended the ranger."You'd think they'd all know my daughter well enough not to believe
anything Mrs.Belden says," responded McFarlane, bitterly."All the boys are ready to do what Tony did.But nobody can stop this old
fool's mouth but you.Cliff has disappeared, and that adds to the
excitement.""Thank the boys for me," said McFarlane, "and tell them not to fight.As McFarlane went out to order the horses hooked up, Wayland followed him
as far as the bars."I'm conscience-smitten over this thing, Supervisor,
for I am aware that I am the cause of all your trouble.""Don't let that worry you," responded the older man."The most appalling thing to me is the fact that not even your daughter's
popularity can neutralize the gossip of a woman like Mrs.John went back to the bedroom.My
being an outsider counts against Berrie, and I'm ready to do
anything--anything," he repeated, earnestly.McFarlane, and I'm ready to marry her at once if you think best.She's a
noble girl, and I cannot bear to be the cause of her calumniation."There was mist in the Supervisor's eyes as he turned them on the young
man."I'm right glad to hear you say that, my boy."He reached out his
hand, and Wayland took it."I knew you'd say the word when the time came.I didn't know how strongly she felt toward you till to-day.I knew she
liked you, of course, for she said so, but I didn't know that she had
plum set her heart on you.I didn't expect her to marry a city man;
but--I like you and--well, she's the doctor!Don't you be afraid of her not meeting all comers."He went on after a
pause, "She's never seen much of city life, but she'll hold her own
anywhere, you can gamble on that.""She has wonderful adaptability, I know," answered Wayland, slowly."But
I don't like to take her away from here--from you.""If you hadn't come she would have married Cliff--and what kind of a life
would she have led with him?""I knew Cliff was
rough, but I couldn't convince her that he was cheap.I live only for her
happiness, my boy, and, though I know you will take her away from me, I
believe you can make her happy, and so--I give her over to you.As to
time and place, arrange that--with--her mother."He turned and walked
away, unable to utter another word.Wayland's throat was aching also, and he went back into the house with a
sense of responsibility which exalted him into sturdier manhood.Berea met him in a pretty gown, a dress he had never seen her wear, a
costume which transformed her into something entirely feminine.She seemed to have put away the self-reliant manner of the trail, and in
its stead presented the lambent gaze, the tremulous lips of the bride.As
he looked at her thus transfigured his heart cast out its hesitancy and
he entered upon his new adventure without further question or regret.XV

A MATTER OF MILLINERY


It was three o'clock of a fine, clear, golden afternoon as they said
good-by to McFarlane and started eastward, as if for a little drive.Berrie held the reins in spite of Wayland's protestations."These
bronchos are only about half busted," she said.Therefore he submitted, well knowing that
she was entirely competent and fully informed.McFarlane, while looking back at her husband, sadly exclaimed: "I
feel like a coward running away like this.""Forget it, mother," commanded her daughter, cheerily."Just imagine
we're off for a short vacation.So long as we _must_ go, let's go whooping.Her voice was gay, her eyes shining, and Wayland saw her as she had been
that first day in the coach--the care-free, laughing girl.The trouble
they were fleeing from was less real to her than the happiness toward
which she rode.Her hand on the reins, her foot on the brake, brought back her
confidence; but Wayland did not feel so sure of his part in the
adventure.She seemed so unalterably a part of this life, so fitted to
this landscape, that the thought of transplanting her to the East brought
uneasiness and question.Could such a creature of the open air be content
with the walls of a city?For several miles the road ran over the level floor of the valley, and
she urged the team to full speed."I don't want to meet anybody if I can
help it.Once we reach the old stage route the chances of being scouted
are few.Nobody uses that road since the broad-gauge reached Cragg's."McFarlane could not rid herself of the resentment with which she
suffered this enforced departure; but she had small opportunity to
protest, for the wagon bumped and clattered over the stony stretches with
a motion which confused as well as silenced her.It was all so
humiliating, so unlike the position which she had imagined herself to
have attained in the eyes of her neighbors.Furthermore, she was going
away without a trunk, with only one small bag for herself and
Berrie--running away like a criminal from an intangible foe.However, she
was somewhat comforted by the gaiety of the young people before her.They
were indeed jocund as jaybirds.With the resiliency of youth they had
accepted the situation, and were making the best of it."Here comes somebody," called Berrie, pulling her ponies to a walk.She was chuckling as if it were all a
good joke.I'm
going to pass him on the jump."Wayland, who was riding with his hat in his hand because he could not
make it cover his bump, held it up as if to keep the wind from his face,
and so defeated the round-eyed, owl-like stare of the inquisitive
rancher, who brought his team to a full stop in order to peer after them,
muttering in a stupor of resentment and surprise."He'll worry himself sick over us," predicted Berrie."He'll wonder where
we're going and what was under that blanket till the end of summer.He is
as curious as a fool hen."A few minutes more and they were at the fork in the way, and, leaving the
trail to Cragg's, the girl pulled into the grass-grown, less-traveled
trail to the south, which entered the timber at this point and began to
climb with steady grade.Letting the reins fall slack, she turned to her
mother with reassuring words.We won't meet
anybody on this road except possibly a mover's outfit.We're in the
forest again," she added.For two hours they crawled slowly upward, with a roaring stream on one
side and the pine-covered <DW72>s on the other.Jays and camp-birds called
from the trees.Water-robins fluttered from rock to rock in the foaming
flood.Squirrels and minute chipmunks raced across the fallen tree-trunks
or clattered from great boulders, and in the peace and order and beauty
of the forest they all recovered a serener outlook on the noisome tumult
they were leaving behind them.Invisible as well as inaudible, the
serpent of slander lost its terror.Once, as they paused to rest the horses, Wayland said: "It is hard to
realize that down in that ethereal valley people like old Jake and Mrs.McFarlane to admit that it might all turn out a blessing
in disguise.McFarlane may resign and move to Denver, as I've long
wanted him to do.""I wish he would," exclaimed Berrie, fervently."It's time you had a
rest.Daddy will hate to quit under fire, but he'd better do it."Peak by peak the Bear Tooth Range rose behind them, while before them the
smooth, grassy <DW72>s of the pass told that they were nearing
timber-line.The air was chill, the sun was hidden by old Solidor, and
the stream had diminished to a silent rill winding among sear grass and
yellowed willows.The
southern boundary of the forest was in sight.At last the topmost looming crags of the Continental Divide cut the
sky-line, and then in the smooth hollow between two rounded grassy
summits Berrie halted, and they all silently contemplated the two worlds.To the west and north lay an endless spread of mountains, wave on wave,
snow-lined, savage, sullen in the dying light; while to the east and
southeast the foot-hills faded into the plain, whose dim cities,
insubstantial as flecks in a veil of violet mist, were hardly
distinguishable without the aid of glasses.To the girl there was something splendid, something heroical in that
majestic, menacing landscape to the west.In one of its folds she had
begun her life.In another she had grown to womanhood and self-confident
power.The rough men, the coarse, ungainly women of that land seemed less
hateful now that she was leaving them, perhaps forever, and a confused
memory of the many splendid dawns and purple sunsets she had loved filled
her thought.Wayland, divining some part of what was moving in her mind, cheerily
remarked, "Yes, it's a splendid place for a summer vacation, but a stern
place in winter-time, and for a lifelong residence it is not inspiring."McFarlane agreed with him in this estimate."It _is_ terribly
lonesome in there at times.I'm ready for the
comforts of civilization."Berrie turned in her seat, and was about to take up the reins when
Wayland asserted himself.She looked at him with questioning, smiling glance.It's
all the way down-hill--and steep?""If I can't I'll ask your aid.I'm old enough to remember the family
carriage.I've even driven a four-in-hand."She surrendered her seat doubtfully, and smiled to see him take up the
reins as if he were starting a four-horse coach.He proved adequate and
careful, and she was proud of him as, with foot on the brake and the
bronchos well in hand, he swung down the long looping road to the
railway.She was pleased, too, by his care of the weary animals, easing
them down the steepest <DW72>s and sending them along on the comparatively
level spots.Their descent was rapid, but it was long after dark before they reached
Flume, which lay up the valley to the right.It was a poor little
decaying mining-town set against the hillside, and had but one hotel, a
sun-warped and sagging pine building just above the station."Not much like the Profile House," said Wayland, as he drew up to the
porch."There isn't any," Berrie assured him."Well, now," he went on, "I am in command of this expedition.When it comes to hotels, railways, and the like o'
that, I'm head ranger."McFarlane, tired, hungry, and a little dismayed, accepted his
control gladly; but Berrie could not at once slip aside her
responsibility."Tell the hostler--"

"Not a word!"commanded Norcross; and the girl with a smile submitted to
his guidance, and thereafter his efficiency, his self-possession, his
tact delighted her.He persuaded the sullen landlady to get them supper.He secured the best rooms in the house, and arranged for the care of the
team, and when they were all seated around the dim, fly-specked oil-lamp
at the end of the crumby dining-room table he discovered such a gay and
confident mien that the women looked at each other in surprise.In drawing off her buckskin
driving-gloves she had put away the cowgirl, and was silent, a little sad
even, in the midst of her enjoyment of his dictatorship.And when he
said, "If my father reaches Denver in time I want you to meet him," she
looked the dismay she felt."I'll do it--but I'm scared of him."I'll see him first and draw his fire."We can't
meet your father as we are."I'll go with you if you'll let me.I'm a great little
shopper.I have infallible taste, so my sisters say.If it's a case of
buying new hats, for instance, I'm the final authority with them."This
amused Berrie, but her mother took it seriously."Of course, I'm anxious to have my daughter make the best possible
impression."We get in, I find, about noon.We'll go
straight to the biggest shop in town.If we work with speed we'll be able
to lunch with my father.He'll be at the Palmer House at one."Berrie said nothing, either in acceptance or rejection of his plan.Her
mind was concerned with new conceptions, new relationships, and when in
the hall he took her face between his hands and said, "Cheer up!All is
not lost," she put her arms about his neck and laid her cheek against his
breast to hide her tears.What he said was not very cogent, and not in the least literary, but it
was reassuring and lover-like, and when he turned her over to her mother
she was composed, though unwontedly grave.She woke to a new life next morning--a life of compliance, of following,
of dependence upon the judgment of another.She stood in silence while
her lover paid the bills, bought the tickets, and telegraphed their
coming to his father.She acquiesced when he prevented her mother from
telephoning to the ranch.She complied when he countermanded her order to
have the team sent back at once.His judgment ruled, and she enjoyed her
sudden freedom from responsibility.It was novel, and it was very sweet
to think that she was being cared for as she had cared for and shielded
him in the world of the trail.In the little railway-coach, which held a score of passengers, she found
herself among some Eastern travelers who had taken the trip up the Valley
of the Flume in the full belief that they were piercing the heart of the
Rocky Mountains!It amused Wayland almost as much as it amused Berrie
when one man said to his wife:

"Well, I'm glad we've seen the Rockies."After an hour's ride Wayland tactfully withdrew, leaving mother and
daughter to discuss clothes undisturbed by his presence."We must look our best, honey," said Mrs."We will go right to
Mme.Crosby at Battle's, and she'll fit us out.I wish we had more time;
but we haven't, so we must do the best we can.""I want Wayland to choose my hat and traveling-suit," replied Berrie.But you've got to have a lot of other things besides."And
they bent to the joyous work of making out a list of goods to be
purchased as soon as they reached Chicago.Wayland came back with a Denver paper in his hand and a look of disgust
on his face."It's all in here--at least, the outlines of it."Berrie took the journal, and there read the details of Settle's assault
upon the foreman."The fight arose from a remark concerning the Forest
Supervisor's daughter.Ranger Settle resented the gossip, and fell upon
the other man, beating him with the butt of his revolver.Friends of the
foreman claim that the ranger is a drunken bully, and should have been
discharged long ago.The Supervisor for some mysterious reason retains
this man, although he is an incompetent.It is also claimed that
McFarlane put a man on the roll without examination."The Supervisor was
the protagonist of the play, which was plainly political.The attack upon
him was bitter and unjust, and Mrs.McFarlane again declared her
intention of returning to help him in his fight.However, Wayland again
proved to her that her presence would only embarrass the Supervisor."You
would not aid him in the slightest degree.Nash and Landon are with him,
and will refute all these charges."This newspaper story took the light out of their day and the smile from
Berrie's lips, and the women entered the city silent and distressed in
spite of the efforts of their young guide.The nearer the girl came to
the ordeal of facing the elder Norcross, the more she feared the outcome;
but Wayland kept his air of easy confidence, and drove them directly to
the shopping center, believing that under the influence of hats and
gloves they would regain their customary cheer.They had a delightful hour trying on
millinery and coats and gloves.McFarlane,
gladly accepted her commission, and, while suspecting the tender
relationship between the girl and the man, she was tactful enough to
conceal her suspicion."The gentleman is right; you carry simple things
best," she remarked to Berrie, thus showing her own good judgment."Smartly tailored gray or blue suits are your style."Silent, blushing, tousled by the hands of her decorators, Berrie
permitted hats to be perched on her head and jackets buttoned and
unbuttoned about her shoulders till she felt like a worn clothes-horse.Wayland beamed with delight, but she was far less satisfied than he; and
when at last selection was made, she still had her doubts, not of the
clothes, but of her ability to wear them.They seemed so alien to her, so
restrictive and enslaving."You're an easy fitter," said the saleswoman."But"--here she lowered her
voice--"you need a new corset.Thereupon Berrie meekly permitted herself to be led away to a
torture-room.Wayland waited patiently, and when she reappeared all
traces of Bear Tooth Forest had vanished.In a neat tailored suit and a
very "chic" hat, with shoes, gloves, and stockings to match, she was so
transformed, so charmingly girlish in her self-conscious glory, that he
was tempted to embrace her in the presence of the saleswoman.He merely said: "I see the governor's finish!"I don't know myself," responded Berrie."The only thing that feels
natural is my hand.They cinched me so tight I can't eat a thing, and my
shoes hurt."She laughed as she said this, for her use of the vernacular
was conscious.Look at my face--red as a saddle!"This is the time of year when tan is
fashionable.Just smile at him, give
him your grip, and he'll melt.""I know how you feel, but you'll get used to the conventional
boiler-plate and all the rest of it.We all groan and growl when we come
back to it each autumn; but it's a part of being civilized, and we
submit."Notwithstanding his confident advice, Wayland led the two silent and
inwardly dismayed women into the showy cafe of the hotel with some degree
of personal apprehension concerning the approaching interview with his
father.Of course, he did not permit this to appear in the slightest
degree.On the contrary, he gaily ordered a choice lunch, and did his
best to keep his companions from sinking into deeper depression.It pleased him to observe the admiring glances which were turned upon
Berrie, whose hat became her mightily, and, leaning over, he said in a
low voice to Mrs.McFarlane: "Who is the lovely young lady opposite?This rejoiced the mother almost as much as it pleased the daughter, and
she answered, "She looks like one of the Radburns of Lexington, but I
think she's from Louisville."This little play being over, he said, "Now, while our order is coming
I'll run out to the desk and see if the governor has come in or not."XVI

THE PRIVATE CAR


After he went away Berrie turned to her mother with a look in which humor
and awe were blent."Am I dreaming, mother, or am I actually sitting here
in the city?Then, without waiting for an
answer, she fervently added: "Isn't he fine!I
hope his father won't despise me."With justifiable pride in her child, the mother replied: "He can't help
liking you, honey.You look exactly like your grandmother at this moment."I'll try; but I feel like a woodchuck out of his hole."McFarlane continued: "I'm glad we were forced out of the valley.You
might have been shut in there all your life as I have been with your
father.""You don't blame father, do you?"And yet he always was rather easy-going, and you know how
untidy the ranch is.He's always been kindness and sympathy itself; but
his lack of order is a cross.Perhaps now he will resign, rent the ranch,
and move over here.I should like to live in the city for a while, and
I'd like to travel a little.""Wouldn't it be fine if you could!You could live at this hotel if you
wanted to.You need a rest from the ranch and
dish-washing."Wayland returned with an increase of tension in his face.I've sent word saying, 'I am lunching in the cafe with
ladies.'He's a
good deal rougher on the outside than he is at heart.Of course, he's a
bluff old business man, and not at all pretty, and he'll transfix you
with a kind of estimating glare as if you were a tree; but he's actually
very easy to manage if you know how to handle him.Now, I'm not going to
try to explain everything to him at the beginning.I'm going to introduce
him to you in a casual kind of way and give him time to take to you both.He forms his likes and dislikes very quickly."His tone was so positive that her eyes misted with
happiness.I hope you aren't too nervous to
eat.This is the kind of camp fare I
can recommend."Berrie's healthy appetite rose above her apprehension, and she ate with
the keen enjoyment of a child, and her mother said, "It surely is a treat
to get a chance at somebody else's cooking.""Don't you slander your home fare," warned Wayland."It's as good as
this, only different."He sat where he could watch the door, and despite his jocund pose his
eyes expressed growing impatience and some anxiety.They were all well
into their dessert before he called out: "Here he is!"McFarlane could not see the new-comer from where she sat, but Berrie
rose in great excitement as a heavy-set, full-faced man with short, gray
mustache and high, smooth brow entered the room.He did not smile as he
greeted his son, and his penetrating glance questioned even before he
spoke.He seemed to silently ask: "Well, what's all this?How do you
happen to be here?Father, this is Miss
Berea McFarlane, of Bear Tooth Springs."McFarlane politely, coldly; but
he betrayed surprise as Berea took his fingers in her grip.At his son's
solicitation he accepted a seat opposite Berea, but refused dessert.McFarlane and her daughter quite saved my life
over in the valley.Their ranch is the best health resort in Colorado.""Your complexion indicates that," his father responded, dryly."You look
something the way a man of your age ought to look.I needn't ask how
you're feeling.""You needn't, but you may.I'm feeling like a new fiddle--barring a
bruise at the back of my head, which makes a 'hard hat' a burden.I may
as well tell you first off that Mrs.McFarlane is the wife of the Forest
Supervisor at Bear Tooth, and Miss Berea is the able assistant of her
father.Norcross, Senior, examined Berrie precisely as if his eyes were a couple
of X-ray tubes, and as she flushed under his slow scrutiny he said: "I
was not expecting to find the Forest Service in such hands.""I hope you didn't mash his fingers, Berrie."I hope I didn't hurt
you--sometimes I forget.""Miss McFarlane was brought up on a ranch.She can
rope and tie a steer, saddle her own horse, pack an outfit, and all the
rest of it."McFarlane, eager to put Berrie's better part forward, explained:
"She's our only child, Mr.Norcross, and as such has been a constant
companion to her father.She's been to school,
and she can cook and sew as well.""Neither of you correspond exactly to my
notions of a forester's wife and daughter."McFarlane comes from an old Kentucky family, father.Her
grandfather helped to found a college down there."Wayland's anxious desire to create a favorable impression of the women
did not escape the lumberman, but his face remained quite expressionless
as he replied:

"If the life of a cow-hand would give you the vigor this young lady
appears to possess, I'm not sure but you'd better stick to it."Wayland and the two women exchanged glances of relief.But he said: "There's a long
story to tell before we decide on my career.How
is mother, and how are the girls?"Once, in the midst of a lame pursuit of other topics, the elder Norcross
again fixed his eyes on Berea, saying: "I wish my girls had your weight
and color."He paused a moment, then resumed with weary infliction: "Mrs.Norcross has always been delicate, and all her children--even her
son--take after her.I've maintained a private and very expensive
hospital for nearly thirty years."This regretful note in his father's voice gave Wayland confidence."Come, let's adjourn to the parlor and talk things over at our ease."They all followed him, and after showing the mother and daughter to their
seats near a window he drew his father into a corner, and in rapid
undertone related the story of his first meeting with Berrie, of his
trouble with young Belden, of his camping trip, minutely describing the
encounter on the mountainside, and ended by saying, with manly
directness: "I would be up there in the mountains in a box if Berrie had
not intervened.She's a noble girl, father, and is foolish enough to like
me, and I'm going to marry her and try to make her happy."The old lumberman, who had listened intently all through this impassioned
story, displayed no sign of surprise at its closing declaration; but his
eyes explored his son's soul with calm abstraction."Send her over to
me," he said, at last.I want to talk with
her--alone."Wayland went back to the women with an air of victory."He wants to see
you, Berrie.She might have resented the father's lack of gallantry; but she did not.On the contrary, she rose and walked resolutely over to where he sat,
quite ready to defend herself.He did not rise to meet her, but she did
not count that against him, for there was nothing essentially rude in his
manner."Sit down," he said, not unkindly."I want to have _you_ tell me about my
son.Now let's have your side of
the story."She took a seat and faced him with eyes as steady as his own.Now, it seems to me that seven weeks is very
short acquaintance for a decision like that.His voice was slightly cynical as he went on."But you were tolerably
sure about that other fellow--that rancher with the fancy name--weren't
you?"She flushed at this, but waited for him to go on."Don't you think
it possible that your fancy for Wayland is also temporary?""I never felt toward any one the way I
do toward Wayland.Her tone, her expression of eyes stopped this line of inquiry."Now, my dear young lady, I am a business man as well as a
father, and the marriage of my son is a weighty matter.I am hoping to have him take up and carry on my business.To
be quite candid, I didn't expect him to select his wife from a Colorado
ranch.I considered him out of the danger-zone.I have always understood
that women were scarce in the mountains.I'm
not one of those fools who are always trying to marry their sons and
daughters into the ranks of the idle rich.I don't care a hang about
social position, and I've got money enough for my son and my son's wife.But he's all the boy I have, and I don't want him to make a mistake.""Neither do I," she answered, simply, her eyes suffused with tears."If I
thought he would be sorry--"

He interrupted again."Oh, you can't tell that now.I don't say he's making a mistake in selecting you.You may be just
the woman he needs.He tells me you have taken an active part in the management of
the ranch and the forest."I've always worked with my father--yes, sir.""I don't know much about any other kind."Well, how about city life--housekeeping and all that?""So long as I am with Wayland I sha'n't mind what I do or where I live.""At the same time you figure he's going to have a large income, I
suppose?He's told you of his rich father, hasn't he?"Berrie's tone was a shade resentful of his insinuation."He has never
said much about his family one way or another.He only said you wanted
him to go into business in Chicago, and that he wanted to do something
else.Of course, I could see by his ways and the clothes he wore that
he'd been brought up in what we'd call luxury, but we never inquired into
his affairs."But money don't count for as much with us in
the valley as it does in the East.Wayland seemed so kind of sick and
lonesome, and I felt sorry for him the first time I saw him.And then his way of talking, of looking at things was so
new and beautiful to me I couldn't help caring for him.I had never met
any one like him.I thought he was a 'lunger'--"

"A what?""A consumptive; that is, I did at first.It seemed
terrible that any one so fine should be condemned like that--and so--I
did all I could to help him, to make him happy.I thought he hadn't long
to live.Everything he said and did was wonderful to me, like poetry and
music.And then when he began to grow stronger and I saw that he was
going to get well, and Cliff went on the rampage and showed the yellow
streak, and I gave him back his ring--I didn't know even then how much
Wayland meant to me.But on our trip over the Range I understood.He made Cliff seem like a savage, and I wanted
him to know it.I want to make him happy,
and if he wishes me to be his wife I'll go anywhere he says--only I think
he should stay out here till he gets entirely well."The old man's eyes softened during her plea, and at its close a slight
smile moved the corners of his mouth."You've thought it all out, I see.But if he takes you and
stays in Colorado he can't expect me to share the profits of my business
with him, can he?"However, I'm persuaded he's in good hands."She took his hand, not knowing just what to reply.He examined her
fingers with intent gaze."I didn't know any woman could have such a grip."He thoughtfully took
her biceps in his left hand.Then, in ironical
protest, he added: "Good God, no!I can't have you come into my family.You'd make caricatures of my wife and daughters.Are all the girls out in
the valley like you?"Most of them pride themselves on _not_ being
horsewomen.Mighty few of 'em ever ride a horse.I'm a kind of a tomboy
to them."I suppose they'd all
like to live in the city and wear low-necked gowns and high-heeled shoes.No, I can't consent to your marriage with my son.I can see already signs of your
deterioration.Except for your color and that grip you already look like
upper Broadway.The next thing will be a slit skirt and a diamond
garter."She flushed redly, conscious of her new corset, her silk stockings, and
her pinching shoes."It's all on the outside," she declared."Under this
toggery I'm the same old trailer.It don't take long to get rid of these
things.I'm just playing a part to-day--for you."You've said good-by to the
cinch, I can see that.You're on the road to opera boxes and limousines.What would you advise Wayland to do if you knew I was
hard against his marrying you?Come, now, I can see you're a
clear-sighted individual."Yes; I'm going to ask my father to buy a ranch near here, where mother
can have more of the comforts of life, and where we can all live together
till Wayland is able to stand city life again.Then, if you want him to
go East, I will go with him."They had moved slowly back toward the others, and as Wayland came to meet
them Norcross said, with dry humor: "I admire your lady of the cinch
hand.She seems to be a person of singular good nature and most uncommon
shrewd--"

Wayland, interrupting, caught at his father's hand and wrung it
frenziedly."I'm glad--"

"Here!A look of pain covered the father's face."That's the fist
she put in the press."They all laughed at his joke, and then he gravely resumed."I say I
admire her, but it's a shame to ask such a girl to marry an invalid like
you.Furthermore, I won't have her taken East.She'd bleach out and lose
that grip in a year.I won't have her contaminated by the city."He mused
deeply while looking at his son."Would life on a wheat-ranch accessible
to this hotel by motor-car be endurable to you?"Mind you, I don't advise her to do it!"he added,
interrupting his son's outcry."I think she's taking all the chances.""I'm old-fashioned in my notions of marriage,
Mrs.I grew up when women were helpmates, such as, I judge,
you've been.Of course, it's all guesswork to me at the moment; but I
have an impression that my son has fallen into an unusual run of luck.As
I understand it, you're all out for a pleasure trip.Now, my private car
is over in the yards, and I suggest you all come along with me to
California--"

"Governor, you're a wonder!""That'll give us time to get better acquainted, and if we all like one
another just as well when we get back--well, we'll buy the best farm in
the North Platte and--"

"It's a cinch we get that ranch," interrupted Wayland, with a triumphant
glance at Berea."A private car, like a

    the other turns his quartz into gold?When it's (s)ticking there.He published only this work, soon
after which he died.After his death, some remarks on Shakspeare, from
his pen, were published in a small 12mo."A second edition of this
elegant little work was published in 1808, by Parson, Oxford; or
Rivington, St.Paul's; in which, the advertisement to the reader informs
us, that "the respectable author intended to have gone through eight or
ten of the principal characters of Shakspeare, but suspended his design,
in order to finish his Observations on Modern Gardening, first published
in the year 1770; immediately after which time, _he was engaged in such
an active scene of public life_, as left him but little leisure to
attend to the Belles Lettres; and in the year 1772 he died."[57]

His remarks on some of the characters of Shakspeare (whom, in his
_Observations_, he calls _the great master of nature_) breathe in many
of his pages, that fire, which he could have caught only from those of
the great poet.Such was his eagerness to complete his _Observations_,
that he for a short while "suspended his design" of examining other
characters of the poet, when the bright effusions of his genius "fled up
to the stars from whence they came."This elegant little work is merely
a fragment, nay, even an unfinished fragment.It must, then, cause deep
regret, that death should so prematurely have deprived us of that rich
treasure of animated thoughts, which, no doubt, would have sprung from
his further tracing the poet's deep and piercing knowledge of the human
heart.Whateley, what he himself applies to
the poet:--"He had a genius to express all that his penetration could
discover."The Journal Encyclopedique, Juilliet, 1771, when speaking of
the French translation of Whateley's Observations, says, "On ne peut
gueres se faire une idee de ces jardins, si l'on n'a ete a Londres.Accoutumes a la symetrie des notres, nous n'imaginons pas qu'on puisse
etablir une forme irreguliere, comme une regle principale: cependant
ceux qui sentent combien la noble simplicite de la nature est superieure
a tous les rafinemens symetriques de l'art, donneront peuetetre la
preference aux jardins Anglois.C'est l'effet que doit produire la
lecture de cet ouvrage, qui quoique destine aux amateurs et aux
compositeurs des jardins, offre aux gens de gout, aux artistes et
sur-tout aux peintres, des observations fines et singulieres sur
plusieurs effets de perspective et sur les arts en general; aux
philosophes, des reflections justes sur les affections de notre ame; aux
poetes, des descriptions exactes, quoique vives, des plus beaux jardins
d'Angleterre dans tous les genres, qui decelent dans l'Auteur un oeil
infiment exerce, une grande connoissance des beaux arts, une belle
imagination et un esprit accoutume a penser."The "bloom of an orchard, the festivity of a hay field, and the carols
of harvest home," could not have met with a more cheerful and benevolent
pen than Mr.Whateley's; a love of country pervades many of his pages;
nor could any one have traced the placid scenery, or rich magnificence
of nature, with a happier pen than when he records the walk to the
cottage at Claremont, the grandeur and majesty of the scene at
_Blenheim_, or _Stowe_, _Persfield_, _Wotton_ in the vale of
Aylesbury--the rugged, savage, and craggy points of _Middleton Dale_, "a
chasm rent in the mountain by some convulsion of nature, beyond the
memory of man, or perhaps before the island was peopled," with its many
rills, springs, rivulets, and water-falls--the vast cliffs of rocks at
_Matlock_, _Bath_, that "scene of romantic magnificence; from such
scenes, probably, was conceived the wild imagination, in ancient
mythology, of the giants piling _Pelion_ upon _Ossa_; the loftiness of
the rocks, and the character of the _Derwent_, a torrent in which force
and fury prevail; the cascades in it are innumerable; before the water
is recovered from one fall, it is hurried down another; and its
agitation being thus increased by repeated shocks, it pushes on with
restless violence to the next, where it dashes against fragments of
rocks, or foams among heaps of stones which the stream has driven
together"--the dusky gloom at the iron forge, "close to the cascade of
the Weir, (between _Ross_ and _Monmouth_) where the agitation of the
current is increased by large fragments of rocks, which have been swept
down by floods from the banks, or shivered by tempests from the brow;
and the sullen sound, at stated intervals, from the strokes of the great
hammers in the forge, deadens the roar of the water-fall"--the solitude,
the loveliness, and the stillness of _Dovedale_, "the whole of which has
the air of enchantment; grotesque as chance can cast, wild as nature can
produce"--the monkish tomb-stones, and the monuments of benefactors long
since forgotten, which appear above the green sward, at _Tintern Abbey_,
with its maimed effigies, and sculpture worn with age and weather--his
view to the approach to Lord _Cadogan's_, near _Reading_--his feeling
and enchanting description of the _Leasowes_--"the wonderful efforts
which art has made at _Painshill_ to rival nature;" where the massy
richness of its hanging wood "gives an air of grandeur to the
whole"--the _Tinian_, and other lawns, and noble and magnificent views
in that vast sylvan scene _Hagley_, where, in a spot which once
delighted Mr.Pope, is inscribed an urn to his memory, "which, when
shewn by a gleam of moonlight through the trees, fixes that
thoughtfulness and composure to which the mind is insensibly led by the
rest of this elegant scene."His section "Of the Seasons," where he descants on the _spirit_ of the
morning, the _excess_ of noon, or the _temperance_ of evening," must
strike every one by its felicity of style; and the reader may judge of
the rich pages which this book contains, even from what he says of
water:--"It accommodates itself to every situation; is the most
interesting object in a landscape, and the happiest circumstance in a
retired recess; captivates the eye at a distance, invites approach, and
is delightful when near; it refreshes an open exposure; it animates a
shade; cheers the dreariness of a waste, and enriches the most crowded
view; in form, in style, and in extent, may be made equal to the
greatest compositions, or adapted to the least; it may spread in a calm
expanse to soothe the tranquillity of a peaceful scene; or hurrying
along a devious course, add splendour to a gay, and extravagance to a
romantic, situation.So various are the characters which water can
assume, that there is scarcely an idea in which it may not concur, or an
impression which it cannot enforce; a deep stagnated pool, dank and dark
with shades which it dimly reflects, befits the seat of melancholy; even
a river, if it be sunk between two dismal banks, and dull both in motion
and colour, is like a hollow eye which deadens the countenance; and over
a sluggard, silent stream, creeping heavily along all together, hangs a
gloom, which no art can dissipate, nor even the sunshine disperse.A
gently murmuring rill, clear and shallow, just gurgling, just dimpling,
imposing silence, suits with solitude, and leads to meditation; a
brisker current, which wantons in little eddies over a bright sandy
bottom, or babbles among pebbles, spreads cheerfulness all around; a
greater rapidity, and more agitation, to a certain degree are animating;
but in excess, instead of wakening, they alarm the senses; the roar and
the rage of a torrent, its force, its violence, its impetuosity, tend to
inspire terror; that terror, which, whether as cause or effect, is so
nearly allied to sublimity."[58]


DANIEL MALTHUS, ESQ.purchased, in 1759, the Rookery, near Dorking,
noted for its beauties of hill, dale, wood, and water; he sold it in
1768.He translated Gerardin, _De la Composition des Paysages_, 12mo.1783, to which he prefixed a preface, being, chiefly, remarks on what
the gardens of the Greeks and Romans were; a view of Rosseau's tomb is
prefixed.Malthus justly observes, that this Essay "is full of the
most insinuating eloquence, that it is wrote by the friend of Rousseau,
and from scenes which realize some of its most beautiful descriptions."He further observes, that "trifling as this enquiry will appear in
itself, it may add something towards the benevolent purpose of M.
d'Ernonville, which is to make men sensible of the exhaustless charms of
nature, to lead them back to their simple and original tastes, to
promote the variety and resources of a country life, and to unite its
usefulness with its embellishment."[59]

time," published a Treatise on the Management of the Peach and Nectarine
Trees: to which is added, the Method of Raising and Forcing Vines; 8vo.WILLIAM MARSHALL, ESQ.who, in his "Planting and Rural Ornament," has
very properly transcribed the whole of that masterly production of Mr.Walpole's pen, his _History of the Modern Taste in Gardening_.He
observes, that "a pen guided by so masterly a hand, must ever be
productive of information and entertainment, when employed upon a
subject so truly interesting.Desirous of conveying to our readers all
the information which we can compress, with propriety, within the limits
of our plan, we wished to have given the _substance_ of this valuable
paper; but finding it already in the language of simplicity, and being
aware of the mischiefs which generally ensue in _meddling_ with the
productions of genius, we had only one alternative: either wholly to
transcribe, or wholly to reject."Marshall, alluding to the above
work of his, says, "Wheatley, Mason, and Nature, with some Experience,
and much Observation, are the principal sources from which this part of
our work was drawn; it was planned, and in part written, among the
magnificent scenes of nature, in Monmouthshire, Herefordshire, and
Gloucestershire, where the rich and the romantic are happily blended, in
a manner unparalleled in any other part of the island."In this same
work is preserved, Mr.Gray's letter on the scenery of _Grasmere Water_.His descriptions of many trees and shrubs are extremely interesting; and
he has rendered them more so by his frequent quotations from Mr.The Rural Economy of the Southern
Counties; 2 vols.--of the Midland Counties, 2 vols.--of Gloucestershire,
2 vols.--of Norfolk, 2 vols.--of Yorkshire, 2 vols.--Agriculture of the
Southern Counties, 2 vols.--Minutes of Agriculture--and a Review of the
Landscape, a didactic poem--and of an Essay on the Picturesque.of Gardening, after relating varied information respecting
him, says, that he "finally retired to a considerable property he
possessed in his native county, in the Vale of Cleveland, in 1808, where
he died, at an advanced age, in 1819.He was a man of little education,
but of a strong and steady mind: and pursued, in the most consistent
manner, from the year 1780 to his death, the plan he originally laid
down; that of collecting and condensing the agricultural practices of
the different counties of England, with a view to a general work on
Landed Property, which he published; another on Agriculture, which he
did not live to complete, and a _Rural Institute_, in which he was
supplanted by the Board of Agriculture."His observations on the
_Larch_, in vol.i. of his "Planting and Rural Ornament," and the zeal
with which he recommends the planting of it on the infertile heathy
flats of Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, on the bleak and barren heights
of Yorkshire, Westmoreland, Cornwall, and Devon, and on the Welch and
Salopean hills; and the powerful language with which he enforces its
valuable qualities, merit the attention of every man of property.WILLIAM SPEECHLY.He wrote Hints on Domestic Rural Economy; 8vo.On the
Culture of the Vine and Pine Apple, with Hints on the Formation of
Vineyards in England.On the Culture of the Pine Apple, and the
Management of the Hot-House; 8vo.He made a tour in Holland, chiefly to
observe the Dutch mode of cultivating the Pine, and the Grape.calls him "the Moses of modern British vine
dressers;" and in the Gardener's Magazine for January, 1828, has given
an interesting and honourable character of him.He died at Great Milton,
in 1819, aged eighty-six.[60] Marshall, in his Planting and Rural
Ornament, has given us Mr.Speechley's sensible letter on the Duke of
Portland's Plantations.Johnson says "he perhaps surpassed every
practical gardener of his age."PHILIP LE BROCQ, chaplain to the Duke of Gloucester, wrote,

1, A Description of Certain Methods of Planting, Training, and Managing
all Kinds of Fruit Trees, Vines, &c. London, 8vo.2, Sketch of a Plan for making the New Forest, a Real Forest.WALTER NICHOL, whom Mr.Loudon, in his Encyclopaedia, calls an author of
merit, and informs us that Mr.Nichol, "in the year 1810, undertook an
extensive journey through England, for the purpose of visiting the
principal seats and plantations, with a view, on his return, to compose
the _Planter's Calendar_.This work had scarcely commenced, when he was
seized with an illness which carried him off suddenly, in March, 1811."His works appear to be the following:--

The Gardener's Kalendar; or, Monthly Directory of every Branch of
Horticulture; 8vo.The Planter's Kalendar; or, the Nurseryman's and Forester's Guide; 8vo.The Villa Garden Directory; or, Monthly Index of Work to be done in
Gardens, Shrubberies, &c.; 12mo.Scotch Forcing Gardener; 8vo.Johnson says "his works are of the first authority, and rank as the
equals of those of Abercrombie, being the result of long practice during
an enlightened era of our art."JAMES MADDOCK, of the Society of Friends, and commercial florist, at
Walworth, where, about the middle of last century, he established the
florist garden there, now belonging to Milliken and Curtis.He published the Florist's Directory, and Complete Treatise
on the Culture of Flowers; 8vo.THOMAS S. D. BUCKNALL, Esq.published the Orchardist; extracted from the
Society's Trans.for the Encouragement of Arts, &c.; _with additions_.I had omitted the following, for which I am indebted to Mr.Johnson's
History of English Gardening:--

RICHARD RICHARDSON.Of either of the above enumerated Authors on Gardening, I have not been
able to discover any Portrait.[Illustration]

   Of the following we _have_ Portraits:--

LEONARD MASCALL'S portrait appears at the bottom of the curious title
page to his "Government of Cattle," 4to.He published,
in 1572, "The New Art of Planting and Grafting;" 4to.WILLIAM BULLEYN practised physic at Durham.He had
the misfortune to lose great part of his library by shipwreck.He was
thrown into prison for debt, where he wrote a great part of his medical
treatises.Bishop Tanner says he was a man of acute judgment, and true
piety.He was universally esteemed as a polished scholar, and as a man
of probity, benevolence, and piety.Pulteney:--"Of Dr.Bulleyn there is a profile with a long beard, before
his "Government of Health," and a whole length of him, in wood, prefixed
to the "Bulwarke of Defence;" which book is a collection of most of his
works.Stukely, who, in 1722, was at
the expence of having a small head of him engraved.He proves that we
had excellent apples, pears, plums, cherries and hops, of our own
growth, (before the importation of these articles into England), by
London and Kentish gardeners.His zeal for the promotion of the useful
arts of gardening, the general culture of the land, and the commercial
interests of the kingdom, deserved the highest praise; and for the
information he has left of these affairs, in his own time, posterity owe
him acknowledgments."In a note to his Life, in the Biog.folio, 1748, is a curious account of many fruits, &c. then in our
gardens.Richardson's portraits to Granger
gives us the above profile.Johnson, at page 51 of his History of
English Gardening, pointedly says, "Dr.Bulleyn deserves the veneration
of every lover of gardening, for his strenuous advocating its cause, at
a time when it had become a fashion to depreciate the products of our
English gardens."And at page 57, pays him a further just tribute.THOMAS HYLL, who, in 1574, published, in 4to., "The Profitable Arte of
Gardeninge."His interesting chapter on
Bees is annexed to these editions."[61] There appears another edition in
small 12mo.imprinted at London, in Flete-strete, neare to St.Dunstone's Church, by Thomas Marshe, 1658.There are other editions, as
1570 and 1574, 4to.; and 1563 and 1594, 16mo.Bromley thus
mentions a portrait of him:--"Thomas Hill, wooden cut, prefixed to his
Physiognomie; 12mo.A friend to Hyll, in a complimentary
letter, prefixed to the above book, thus, in part, addresses the
reader:--

   _With painfull pen the writer hath exprest in English plane,
   The needfull ayd, and mightie force, that doth in hearbes remaine,
   The time to set, the time to plant, the time to raise again,
   This man by treble diligence hath brought to light with paine._

The portraits of the Lord Chancellor BACON are well known; but in Mr.Montagu's late edition of his works, a new or juvenile portrait is
added, namely, a most expressive, intelligent, and beautiful miniature
of him at his age of eighteen, by Hilyard, of whom Dr.Donne said,

         ----_a hand or eye
   By Hilyard drawn, is worth a history
   By a worse painter._

This fine edition of his works is illustrated by five portraits, taken
at different periods of his lordship's life; by engravings of his
residence, and monument, fac-similes, and other embellishments.In
Mallett's edition are two portraits, one by Vertue, finely
engraved.[62]

GERARDE'S portrait (a fine one) is prefixed to his own edition of his
Herbal.No painter, or engraver's
name, except the initials, W. R. intertwined, which I suppose are those
of W. Rogers, the engraver.There is another good head of Gerarde, a
small oval one, in the title page to Johnson's edition.A portrait, in
oil, of Gerarde, was sold by Mr.Pulteney
reviews both these Herbals.Gerarde is highly extolled by Dr.Bulleyn,
and indeed attained deserved eminence in his day.Pulteney relates
that "the thousand novelties which were brought into England by our
circumnavigators, Raleigh and Cavendish, in 1580 and 1588, excited a
degree of attention, which at this day cannot, without the aid of
considerable recollection, be easily conceived.Raleigh himself appears
to have possessed a larger share of taste for the curious productions of
nature, than was common to the seafaring adventurers of that period.And
posterity will rank these voyagers among the greatest benefactors to
this kingdom, in having been the means, if tradition may be credited, of
introducing the most useful root that Providence has held forth for the
service of man.A voyage round the globe, howsoever familiarized in
ours, was, in that age, a most interesting and fruitful occasion of
enquiry.The return of Raleigh, and the fame of his manifold discoveries
and collections, brought over from the continent the celebrated Clusius,
then in the fifty-fifth year of his age.He, who added more to the stock
of botany, in his day, than all his contemporaries united, visited
England for the third time, to partake, at this critical juncture, in
the general gratification.At this eventful period, Gerarde was in the
vigour of life, and, without doubt, felt the influence, and reaped
the advantage of all the circumstances I have enumerated."One
of the editions of Gerarde thus appears in a bookseller's
catalogue:--"Gerarde's Herball; or Generall Historie of Plants, very
much enlarged by Johnson, folio, _beautiful impression of the
frontispiece by Payne, fine copy, old Russia, gilt back, L3.[63]


WALTER BLYTHE'S whole-length portrait (exhibiting a pensive and
penetrating aspect), is prefixed to his "English Improver Improved;" and
which work Professor Martyn terms "an original and incomparable work for
the time."Beale calls him "honest Captain Blithe."GERVASE MARKHAM'S portrait is prefixed to his "Perfect Horseman;" 8vo.It is re-engraved for Richardson's portraits to Granger.Markham
appears to have been a good soldier, as well as a good scholar.1623, "The Country House-Wife's Garden."He wrote
Herod and Antipater, a tragedy.Langbaine speaks very much in his
praise, and seemingly not without reason.Dibden, in his "Library
Companion," says, "on many accounts does Markham seem entitled to more
notice and commendation."He translated Leibault's Maison Rustique, in
1616, in 4to.or small folio, and augmented it with many additions from
Oliver de Serres, and others.Weston, in his Catalogue, says he
re-printed the editions in 1614 and 1631, of Barnaby Gooche's Husbandry.He published many books on husbandry, on fowling, on angling, on
military discipline, on horsemanship.Many of their titles are
enumerated in Langbaine, and in Weston, and they appear all to be more
fully stated in Watts's Bibl.Much information, as to Markham, may
be seen in vol.of the Censura Literaria; and in Sir E. Brydges's
edition of Phillips's Theatrum Poetarum Anglicanorum, appears, perhaps,
the best list of his works, with a brief memoir.[64]


PARKINSON'S excellent portrait, by Marshall, appears in the title page
to his _Theatrum Botanicum_, in 1640.Some one _may_ now possess the
original.In his _Paradisus_, 1635, there is a very scurvy engraving of
his healthy, and hearty-looking old countenance.In this miserable cut,
which is on wood, the graver, Christopher Switzer, does not seem to have
had a strife "_with nature to outdo the life_."Marshall's head is
re-engraved for Richardson's Illustrations to Granger.Parkinson rose to
such a degree of reputation, as to be appointed Apothecary to King
James.He was appointed herbalist to Charles I. Dr.Pulteney speaks
highly of both the above works, particularly of the _Theatrum_.All the
memorials we have of the private history of this most industrious and
zealous herbalist, are very scanty.He died about 1645, aged about 78.The curious contents of his _Paradisus_ are diffusively narrated in
Johnson's English Gardening.When perusing the pages of either of the
above, one may exclaim,

                           ----"not a tree,
   A plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contains
   A folio volume.We may read, and read,
   And read again; and still find something new,
   Something to please, and something to instruct,
   E'en in the humble weed."[Illustration]

The above is scarcely better than Switzer's.There appears no faithful
portrait of Parkinson, but Marshall's, who _had the felicity_ to draw
other portraits besides his.Hollar's striking portraits of the TRADESCANTS, are well known.On their
tomb, at Lambeth, the following lines form part of the inscription:--

   These famous Antiquarians, that had been
   Both Gardeners to the rose and lily Queen,
   Transplanted now themselves, sleep here; and when
   Angels shall with their trumpets waken men,
   And fire shall purge the world, these hence shall rise,
   And change this Garden for a Paradise.In the Ashmolean Museum, is a portrait of the SON, _in his garden_, with
a spade in his hand.Nichols's "Illustrations to Granger,"
consisting of seventy-five portraits, appear those of the Tradescants,
father and son.Smith also engraved John Tradescant, with his son, and
their monument, 1793.Weston, in his Catalogue, fully describes the
_Museum Tradescantium_.Pulteney observes, that "in a work devoted
to the commemoration of Botanists, their name stands too high not to
demand an honourable notice; since they contributed, at an early period,
by their garden and museum, to raise a curiosity that was eminently
useful to the progress and improvement of natural history in general.The reader may see a curious account of the remains of this garden,
drawn up in the year 1749, by the late Sir W. Watson, and printed in
vol.His widow erected a
curious monument, in memory of the family, in Lambeth church-yard, of
which a large account, and engravings from a drawing of it in the
Pepysian Library, at Cambridge, are given by the late learned Dr.SIR HENRY WOTTON, Provost of Eaton.His portrait is given in Isaac
Walton's Lives of Wotton, and others.It, of course, accompanies
Zouch's, and the other well-known editions of Isaac Walton's Lives.In
Evans's Illustrations to Granger, is Sir H. Wotton, from the picture in
the Bodleian Library, engraved by _Stow_.In Sir Henry's Reflections on
Ancient and Modern Learning, is his chapter "On Ancient and Modern
Agriculture and Gardening."Cowley wrote an elegy on him, which thus
commences:--

   What shall we say since silent now is he,
   Who when he spoke, all things would silent be;
   Who had so many languages in store,
   That only Fame can speak of him with more.Isaac Walton published the "_Reliquiae Wottonianae_, or, Lives, Letters,
Poems, &c. by Sir Henry Wotton," 12mo.1654, with portraits of Wotton,
Charles I., Earl of Essex, and Buckingham.Sir E. Brydges printed at his
private press, at Lee Priory, Sir Henry's Characters of the Earl of
Essex and Buckingham.In the _Reliquiae_, among many curious and
interesting articles, is preserved Sir Henry's delicately complimentary
letter to Milton on receiving from him _Comus_.Sir Henry, when a
resident at Venice, (where he was sent on three several embassies by
James) purchased for that munificent encourager of painting, the Duke of
Buckingham, several valuable pictures, which were added to the Duke's
magnificent collection.Isaac Walton's Life of Wotton thus
concludes:--"Dying worthy of his name and family, worthy of the love of
so many princes, and persons of eminent wisdom and learning, worthy of
the trust committed unto him for the service of his prince and country."And, in his Angler, he thus sweetly paints the warm attachment he had
for Wotton:--"a man with whom I have often fished and conversed, whose
learning, wit, and cheerfulness, made his company to be esteemed one of
the delights of mankind.Peace and patience, and a calm content, did
cohabit in the cheerful heart of Sir Henry Wotton."Dallaway, in his Anecdotes of the Arts, mentions
the following portrait of Sir Thomas:--"At Devonshire-house is a family
groupe, by Dobson, of Sir Thomas Browne.He is smiling with the utmost
complacency upon his children, who surround him."His portrait is also
prefixed to his works.Dict., folio, 1748, says, "his
picture, in the College of Physicians, shews him to have been remarkably
handsome, and to have possessed, in a singular degree, the blessings of
a grave, yet cheerful and inviting, countenance."The same work farther
gives him a most amiable character.Ray, in his Ornithology, does
not omit paying a just compliment to his assistant and friend, "the
deservedly famous Sir Thomas Browne."Evelyn, in 1671, mentions Sir
Thomas Browne's garden at Norwich, as containing a paradise of
varieties, and the gardens of all the inhabitants as full of excellent
flowers.Switzer says, "The noble elegance of his style has since
induced many to read his works, (of which, that of _Cyrus's gardens_ is
some of the brightest,) though they have had little inclination to the
practice of gardening itself.There remains nothing that I have heard of
his putting gardening actually into practice himself; but some of his
last works being observations on several scarce plants mentioned in
Scripture; and of Garlands and Coronary garden plants and flowers, 'tis
reasonable to suppose he did; and the love he had so early and late
discovered toward it, was completed in the delightful practice thereof."He further says, " his elaborate and ingenious pen has not a little
added to the nobleness of our subject."[65] His works were published in
1 vol.folio, 1686, with his portrait, engraved by White.His portrait
appears also to his "Certain Miscellany Tracts," 8vo.A list of his
numerous works may be seen in the Biogr.Dictionaires, or in Watts's
Bibl.It is so masterly written, that it is impossible to give even an
abstract.Kippis has, however, in part, transcribed it.He was
chosen Honorary Fellow of the College of Physicians, as a man _virtute
et literas ornatissimus_.In 1671, he received the honour of Knighthood
from Charles II., a prince, (says Dr.Johnson) "who, with many frailties
and vices, had yet skill to discover excellence, and virtue to reward it
with such honorary distinctions, at least, as cost him nothing, yet,
conferred by a king so judicious and so much beloved, had the power of
giving merit new lustre and greater popularity."Thus he lived in high
reputation, till, in his seventy-sixth year, an illness, which tortured
him a week, put an end to his life, at Norwich, on his birth-day,
October 19, 1682."Some of his last words (we are told by _Whitefoot_)
were expressions of submission to the will of God, and fearlessness of
death."Johnson observes, "It is not on the praises of others, but
on his own writings, that he is to depend for the esteem of posterity;
of which he will not be easily deprived, while learning shall have any
reverence among men: for there is no science in which he does not
discover some skill; and scarce any kind of knowledge, profane or
sacred, abstruse or elegant, which he does not appear to have cultivated
with success.His exuberance of knowledge, and plenitude of ideas,
sometimes obstruct the tendency of his reasoning, and the clearness of
his decisions.On whatever subject he employed his mind, there started
up immediately so many images before him, that he lost one by grasping
another.His memory supplied him with so many illustrations, parallel or
dependent notions, that he was always starting into collateral
considerations.But the spirit and vigour of his pursuit always gives
delight; and the reader follows him, without reluctance, through his
mazes, of themselves flowery and pleasing, and ending at the point
originally in view.There remains yet an objection against the writings
of _Browne_, more formidable than the animadversions of criticism.There
are passages from which some have taken occasion to rank him among
deists, and others among atheists.It would be difficult to guess how
any such conclusion should be formed, had not experience shewn that
there are two sorts of men willing to enlarge the catalogue of infidels.When _Browne_ has been numbered among the contemners of religion by the
fury of its friends, or the artifices of its enemies, it is no difficult
task to replace him among the most zealous professors of christianity.He may perhaps, in the ardour of his imagination, have hazarded an
expression, which a mind intent upon faults may interpret into heresy,
if considered apart from the rest of his discourse; but a phrase is not
to be opposed to volumes.There is scarcely a writer to be found, whose
profession was not divinity, that has so frequently testified his belief
of the sacred writings, has appealed to them with such unlimited
submission, or mentioned them with such unvaried reverence."His portrait by Nanteuil, and that by Kneller, holding
his _Sylva_ in his hand, are well engraved in Mr.The
following remark is from the Quarterly Review, in its review of the same
work, in 1818:--"At four years old he was taught to read by the parish
school-master, whose school was over the church porch; and 'at six his
picture was drawn by one Chanteral, no ill painter.'If this portrait,
as is not unlikely, be preserved in the family, it should have been
engraved for the present work; it would have been very interesting to
compare the countenance of such a person, in childhood, in the flower of
years, when his head was engraved by Nanteuil, and in ripe old age, when
he sat to Sir G.Evelyn, and his family, and he gives a
list of his works.He says "his picture was thrice drawn in oil; first,
in 1641, by one Vanderborcht, brought out of Germany at the same time
with Hollar, the graver, by the Earl of Arundel; a second time in 1648,
by Walker; and the third time by Sir G. Kneller, for his friend Mr.Pepys, of the Admiralty, of which that at the Royal Society is a copy.There is a print of him by Nanteuil, who likewise drew him more than
once in black and white, with Indian ink; and a picture, in crayon, by
Luterel."Evelyn lived in the busy
