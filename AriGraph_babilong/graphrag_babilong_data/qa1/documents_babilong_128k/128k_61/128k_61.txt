He began firmly but his voice shook ere he
had finished."Colonel Carvel," said he, "I expect that the day has come when you
go your way and I go mine.It will be better if--we do not meet again,
sir."And so he turned from the man whose friendship had stayed him for the
score of years he had battled with his enemies, from that house which
had been for so long his only home.For the last time Jackson came
forward to help him with his coat.The Judge did not see him, nor did he
see the tearful face of a young girl leaning over the banisters above.Whipple, blinded by a moisture strange to
his eyes, clung to the iron railing as he felt his way down the steps.Before he reached the bottom a stronger arm had seize his own, and was
helping him.The Judge brushed his eyes with his sleeve, and turned a defiant face
upon Captain Elijah Brent--then his voice broke.His anger was
suddenly gone, and his thought had flown back to the Colonel's thousand
charities."Lige," he said, "Lige, it has come."In answer the Captain pressed the Judge's hand, nodding vigorously to
hide his rising emotion.cried the Captain, "I wish I knew.""Lige," said the Judge, gravely, "you're too good a man to be for
Soothing Syrup.""You're too smart to be fooled, Lige," he said, with a note near to
pleading."The time has come when you Bell people and the Douglas people
have got to decide.Never in my life did I know it to do good to dodge
a question.We've got to be white or black, Lige.Nobody's got much
use for the grays.And don't let yourself be fooled with Constitutional
Union Meetings, and compromises.The time is almost here, Lige, when it
will take a rascal to steer a middle course."Captain Lige listened, and he shifted from one foot to the other, and
rubbed his hands, which were red.Some odd trick of the mind had put
into his head two people--Eliphalet Hopper and Jacob Cluyme."Lige, you've got to decide.Can you look
on while our own states defy us, and not lift a hand?Can you sit still
while the Governor and all the secessionists in this state are plotting
to take Missouri, too, out of the Union?The militia is riddled with
rebels, and the rest are forming companies of minute men.""And you Black Republicans," the Captain cried "have organized your
Dutch Wideawakes, and are arming them to resist Americans born.""They are Americans by our Constitution, sir, which the South pretends
to revere," cried the Judge."And they are showing themselves better
Americans than many who have been on the soil for generations.""My sympathies are with the South," said the Captain, doggedly, "and my
love is for the South."Both men raised their eyes to the house of him
whose loving hospitality had been a light in the lives of both.When at
last the Captain spoke, his voice was rent with feeling."Judge," he began, "when I was a poor young man on the old 'Vicksburg',
second officer under old Stetson, Colonel Carvel used to take me up to
his house on Fourth Street to dinner.And he gave me the clothes on
my back, so that I might not be ashamed before the fashion which came
there.One day the sheriff sold the
Vicksburg.That left me high and dry in the mud.And he says to me, 'Lige, you're
captain now, the youngest captain on the river.You
can pay me principal and interest when you get ready.'"Judge Whipple, I never had any other home than right in, this house.I
never had any other pleasure than bringing Jinny presents, and tryin' to
show 'em gratitude.He took me into his house and cared for me at a time
when I wanted to go to the devil along with the stevedores when I was
a wanderer he kept me out of the streets, and out of temptation.Judge,
I'd a heap rather go down and jump off the stern of my boat than step in
here and tell him I'd fight for the North."The Judge steadied himself on his hickory stick and walked off without
a word.For a while Captain Lige stood staring after him.Then he slowly
climbed the steps and disappeared.MUTTERINGS

Early in the next year, 1861,--that red year in the Calendar of our
history,--several gentlemen met secretly in the dingy counting-room of
a prominent citizen to consider how the state of Missouri might be saved
to the Union.One of these gentlemen was Judge Whipple, another, Mr.Brinsmade; and another a masterly and fearless lawyer who afterward
became a general, and who shall be mentioned in these pages as the
Leader.By his dash and boldness and statesmanlike grasp of a black
situation St.Louis was snatched from the very bosom of secession.Alas, that chronicles may not stretch so as to embrace all great men of
a time.There is Captain Nathaniel Lyon,--name with the fateful ring.Nathaniel Lyon, with the wild red hair and blue eye, born and bred a
soldier, ordered to St.Louis, and become subordinate to a wavering
officer of ordnance.Lyon was one who brooked no trifling.He had the
face of a man who knows his mind and intention; the quick speech and
action which go with this.Red tape made by the reel to bind him, he
broke.Courts-martial had no terrors for him.He proved the ablest of
lieutenants to the strong civilian who was the Leader.If God had willed that the South should win, there
would have been no occasion.Even as Judge Whipple had said, the time was come for all men to decide.Out of the way, all hopes of compromises that benumbed Washington.No
Constitutional Unionists, no Douglas Democrats, no Republicans now.The speech-making was not done with yet.Partisanship must be overcome, and patriotism instilled in its place.One day Stephen Brice saw the Leader go into Judge Whipple's room,
and presently he was sent for.After that he was heard of in various
out-of-the-way neighborhoods, exhorting all men to forget their quarrels
and uphold the flag.The Leader himself knew not night from day in his toil,--in organizing,
conciliating, compelling when necessary.And, after that solemn inauguration, between him and
Washington.It was an open secret that the Governor of Missouri held out
his arms to Jefferson Davis, just elected President of the new Southern
Confederacy.It soon became plain to the feeblest brain what the Leader
and his friends had perceived long before, that the Governor intended
to use the militia (purged of Yankee sympathizers) to save the state for
the South.The Government Arsenal, with its stores of arms and ammunition, was
the prize.This building and its grounds lay to the south of the
City, overlooking the river.It was in command of a doubting major
of ordnance; the corps of officers of Jefferson Barracks hard by was
mottled with secession.In all the South, Pickens and Sumter alone stood
stanch to the flag.A general, wearing the uniform of the army of the
United States, surrendered the whole state of Texas.Louis Arsenal was next in succession, and the little band of
regulars at the Barracks was powerless to save it.What could the Leader
and Captain Lyon do without troops?That was the question that rang
in Stephen's head, and in the heads of many others.For, if President
Lincoln sent troops to St.And the President had other uses for the handful in the army.There came a rain-sodden night when a mysterious message arrived at
the little house in Olive Street.Brice's eyes as they followed her son out of the door.At Twelfth
Street two men were lounging on the corners, each of whom glanced at
him listessly as he passed.He went up a dark and narrow stair into a
lighted hall with shrouded windows.Men with sober faces were forming
line on the sawdust of the floors.The Leader was there giving military
orders in a low voice.That marked the beginning of the aggressive Union
movement.Stephen, standing apart at the entrance, remarked that many of the men
were Germans.Indeed, he spied his friend Tiefel there, and presently
Richter came from the ranks to greet him."My friend," he said, "you are made second lieutenant of our company,
the Black Jaegers.""But I have never drilled in my life," said Stephen.The Leader, smiling a little, put a vigorous stop to his protestations,
and told him to buy a tactics.The next man Stephen saw was big Tom
Catherwood, who blushed to the line of his hair as he returned Stephen's
grip."Well," said Tom, embarrassed, "a fellow has got to do what he think's
right.""I reckon they'll disown me, Stephen, when they find it out."Richter walked home as far as Stephen's house.He was to take the Fifth
Street car for South St.And they talked of Tom's courage, and of
the broad and secret military organization the Leader had planned that
night.Could he afford to risk his life in the war that was coming, and leave
his mother dependent upon charity?It was shortly after this that Stephen paid his last visit for many a
long day upon Miss Puss Russell.It was a Sunday afternoon, and Puss was
entertaining, as usual, a whole parlor-full of young men, whose leanings
and sympathies Stephen divined while taking off his coat in the hall.Then he heard Miss Russell cry:

"I believe that they are drilling those nasty Dutch hirelings in
secret.""I am sure they are," said George Catherwood."One of the halls is on
Twelfth Street, and they have sentries posted out so that you can't get
near them.And he told him that if
he ever got evidence of it, he'd show him the door.""Do you really think that Tom is with the Yankees?""Tom's a fool," said George, with emphasis, "but he isn't a coward.He'd just as soon tell Pa to-morrow that he was drilling if the Yankee
leaders wished it known.""Virginia will never speak to him again," said Eugenie, in an awed
voice.said Puss, "Tom never had a chance with Jinny.Did you ever know any one to change so,
since this military business has begun?I hear
that they are thinking of making him captain of a company of dragoons.""And that is the company I intend to join.""Well," began Puss, with her usual recklessness, "it's a good thing for
Clarence that all this is happening.I know somebody else--"

Poor Stephen in the hall knew not whether to stay or fly.Emily Russell came down the stairs at that instant
and spoke to him.As the two entered the parlor, there was a hush
pregnant with many things unsaid.Puss's face was scarlet, but her hand
was cold as she held it out to him.For the first time in that house
he felt like an intruder.Jack Brinsmade bowed with great ceremony,
and took his departure.There was scarcely a distant cordiality in
the greeting of the other young men.And Puss, whose tongue was loosed
again, talked rapidly of entertainments to which Stephen either had not
been invited, or from which he had stayed away.The rest of the company
were almost moodily silent.Profoundly depressed, Stephen sat straight in the velvet chair, awaiting
a seasonable time to bring his visit to a close.This was to be the last, then, of his intercourse with a warmhearted
and lovable people.This was to be the end of his friendship with this
impetuous and generous girl who had done so much to brighten his life
since he had come to St: Louis.Henceforth this house would be shut to
him, and all others save Mr.Presently, in one of the intervals of Miss Russell's feverish talk,
he rose to go.Dusk was gathering, and a deep and ominous silence
penetrated like the shadows into the tall room.Impulsively, almost tearfully, Puss put her hand in his.Then she
pressed it unexpectedly, so that he had to gulp down a lump that was in
his throat.Just then a loud cry was heard from without, the men jumped
from their chairs, and something heavy dropped on the carpet.Some ran to the window, others to the door.Directly across the street
was the house of Mr.One of the third
story windows was open, and out of it was pouring a mass of gray wood
smoke.George Catherwood was the first to speak."I hope it will burn down," he cried.Stephen picked up the object on the floor, which had dropped from his
pocket, and handed it to him.THE GUNS OF SUMTER

Winter had vanished.Toward a little island
set in the blue waters of Charleston harbor anxious eyes were strained.God alone may count the wives and mothers who listened in the still
hours of the night for the guns of Sumter.One sultry night in April
Stephen's mother awoke with fear in her heart, for she had heard them.that is the roar now, faint but sullen.That is the red flash
far across the black Southern sky.For in our beds are the terrors and
cruelties of life revealed to us.There is a demon to be faced, and
nought alone.The lightning revealed her as she bent over him.On the wings of memory be flew back to his childhood in the great Boston
house with the rounded front, and he saw the nursery with its high
windows looking out across the Common.Often in the dark had she come to
him thus, her gentle hand passing over aim to feel if he were covered.She said: "Stephen, I am afraid that the war has come."Even he did not guess the agony in her heart.We have nothing left but the little I
earn.And if I were--" He did not finish the sentence, for he felt her
trembling.But she said again, with that courage which seems woman's
alone:

"Remember Wilton Brice.It was the hour he had dreaded, stolen suddenly upon him out of the
night.How many times had he rehearsed this scene to himself!He,
Stephen Brice, who had preached and slaved and drilled for the Union,
a renegade to be shunned by friend and foe alike!He had talked for his
country, but he would not risk his life for it.He saw them passing him silently on the street.Shamefully
he remembered the time, five months agone, when he had worn the very
uniform of his Revolutionary ancestor.And high above the tier of his
accusers he saw one face, and the look of it stung to the very quick of
his soul.Before the storm he had fallen asleep in sheer weariness of the
struggle, that face shining through the black veil of the darkness.If
he were to march away in the blue of his country (alas, not of hers!)she would respect him for risking life for conviction.If he stayed at
home, she would not understand.And
yet he knew that Virginia Carvel and the women like her were ready to
follow with bare feet the march of the soldiers of the South.The rain was come now, in a flood.Stephen's mother could not see in the
blackness the bitterness on his face.Above the roar of the waters she
listened for his voice."I will not go, mother," he said."If at length every man is needed,
that will be different.""It is for you to decide, my son," she answered."There are many ways in
which you can serve your country here.But remember that you may have to
face hard things.""I have had to do that before, mother," he replied calmly."I cannot
leave you dependent upon charity."She went back into her room to pray, for she knew that he had laid his
ambition at her feet.It was not until a week later that the dreaded news came.All through
the Friday shells had rained on the little fort while Charleston looked
on.Through a wide land was that numbness which
precedes action.Force of habit sent men to their places of business,
to sit idle.South
Carolina had shot to bits the flag she had once revered.On the Monday came the call of President Lincoln for volunteers.The outraged reply of her governor
went back,--never would she furnish troops to invade her sister states.Little did Governor Jackson foresee that Missouri was to stand fifth of
all the Union in the number of men she was to give.To her was credited
in the end even more men than stanch Massachusetts.The noise of preparation was in the city--in the land.On the Monday
morning, when Stephen went wearily to the office, he was met by Richter
at the top of the stairs, who seized his shoulders and looked into his
face.The light of the zealot was on Richter's own."We shall drill every night now, my friend, until further orders.Until we go to the front, Stephen, to put down
rebellion."Stephen sank into a chair, and bowed his head.What would
he think,--this man who had fought and suffered and renounced his native
land for his convictions?Who in this nobler allegiance was ready to die
for them?How was he to confess to Richter, of all men?"Carl," he said at length, "I--I cannot go."But Richter, suddenly divining, laid his hands
impulsively on Stephen's shoulders."Ach, I see," he said.It shall be
for your mother while you are away."Then, in spite of
his feelings, he stared at the German with a new appreciation of his
character.implored Richter, "I would give a fortune, if
I had it.Ah, my friend, that would please me so.And I do not need the
money now.Spring was in the air; the first faint smell of verdure wafted across
the river on the wind.Stephen turned to the open window, tears of
intense agony in his eyes.In that instant he saw the regiment marching,
and the flag flying at its head."It is my duty to stay here, Carl," he said brokenly.Richter took an appealing step toward him and stopped.He realized that
with this young New Englander a decision once made was unalterable.In
all his knowledge of Stephen he never remembered him to change.With the
demonstrative sympathy of his race, he yearned to comfort him, and knew
not how.Two hundred years of Puritanism had reared barriers not to be
broken down.At the end of the office the stern figure of the Judge appeared.Stephen followed him into the littered room behind the ground glass
door, scarce knowing what to expect,--and scarce caring, as on that
first day he had gone in there.Whipple himself closed the door, and
then the transom.Stephen felt those keen eyes searching him from their
hiding-place.Brice," he said at last, "the President has called for seventy-five
thousand volunteers to crush this rebellion.They will go, and be
swallowed up, and more will go to fill their places.Brice, people
will tell you that the war will be over in ninety days.But I tell you,
sir, that it will not be over in seven times ninety days."He brought
down his fist heavily upon the table."This, sir, will be a war to the
death.One side or the other will fight until their blood is all let,
and until their homes are all ruins."He darted at Stephen one look from
under those fierce eyebrows."No, sir," he answered, steadily, "not
now."Then he began what seemed a never-ending search
among the papers on his desk.At length he drew out a letter, put on his
spectacles and read it, and finally put it down again.Whipple, "you are doing a courageous thing.But if
we elect to follow our conscience in this world, we must not expect to
escape persecution, sir.Two weeks ago," he continued slowly, "two weeks
ago I had a letter from Mr.cried Stephen

The Judge smiled a little.Lincoln never forgets any one," said
he."He wishes me to extend to you his thanks for your services to the
Republican party, and sends you his kindest regards."This was the first and only time that Mr.Whipple spoke to him of his
labors.Stephen has often laughed at this since, and said that he
would not have heard of them at all had not the Judge's sense of duty
compelled him to convey the message.And it was with a lighter heart
than he had felt for many a day that he went out of the door.Some weeks later, five regiments were mustered into the service of the
United States.And in response to his
appeals, despite the presence of officers of higher rank, the President
had given Captain Nathaniel Lyon supreme command in Missouri.Stephen stood among the angry, jeering crowd that lined the streets as
the regiments marched past.Their step was not as steady, nor their files as straight
as Company A. There was Richter, his head high, his blue eyes defiant.And there was little Tiefel marching in that place of second lieutenant
that Stephen himself should have filled.Here was another company,
and at the end of the first four, big Tom Catherwood.His father
had disowned him the day before, His two brothers, George and little
Spencer, were in a house not far away--a house from which a strange flag
drooped.Clouds were lowering over the city, and big drops falling, as Stephen
threaded his way homeward, the damp anal gloom of the weather in his
very soul.He went past the house where the strange flag hung against
its staff In that big city it flaunted all unchallenged.The house
was thrown wide open that day, and in its window lounged young men of
honored families.And while they joked of German boorishness and Yankee
cowardice they held rifles across their knees to avenge any insult to
the strange banner that they had set up.In the hall, through the open
doorway, the mouth of a shotted field gun could be seen.The guardians
were the Minute Men, organized to maintain the honor and dignity of the
state of Missouri.Across the street from the house was gathered a knot of curious people,
and among these Stephen paused.Two young men were standing on the
steps, and one was Clarence Colfax.His hands were in his pockets, and
a careless, scornful smile was on his face when he glanced down into the
street.Anger swept over him in a hot flame,
as at the slave auction years agone.That was the unquenchable fire of
the war.The blood throbbed in his temples as his feet obeyed,--and yet
he stopped.What right had he to pull down that flag, to die on the pavement before
that house?CAMP JACKSON

What enthusiasm on that gusty Monday morning, the Sixth of May, 1861!Twelfth Street to the north of the Market House is full three hundred
feet across, and the militia of the Sovereign State of Missouri is
gathering there.Thence by order of her Governor they are to march to
Camp Jackson for a week of drill and instruction.Half a mile nearer the river, on the house of the Minute Men, the
strange flag leaps wildly in the wind this day.On Twelfth Street the sun is shining, drums are beating, and bands
are playing, and bright aides dashing hither and thither on spirited
chargers.One by one the companies are marching up, and taking place in
line; the city companies in natty gray fatigue, the country companies
often in their Sunday clothes.But they walk with heads erect and chests
out, and the ladies wave their gay parasols and cheer them.Louis Grays, Company A; there come the Washington
Guards and Washington Blues, and Laclede Guards and Missouri Guards and
Davis Guards.Yes, this is Secession Day, this Monday.And the colors
are the Stars and Stripes and the Arms of Missouri crossed.A clatter and a
cloud of dust by the market place, an ecstasy of cheers running in waves
the length of the crowd.Here they come
at last, four and four, the horses prancing and dancing and pointing
quivering ears at the tossing sea of hats and parasols and ribbons.Maude Catherwood squeezes Virginia's arm.There, riding in front, erect
and firm in the saddle, is Captain Clarence Colfax.Virginia is red and
white, and red again,--true colors of the Confederacy.Oh, that was his true
calling, a soldier's life.In that moment she saw him at the head of
armies, from the South, driving the Yankee hordes northward and still
northward until the roar of the lakes warns them of annihilation.Down to a trot they slow, Clarence's black thorough-bred arching his
long neck, proud as his master of the squadron which follows, four and
four.The square young man of bone and sinew in the first four, whose
horse is built like a Crusader's, is George Catherwood.And Eugenie
gives a cry and points to the rear where Maurice is riding.Can the Yankee regiments with their
slouchy Dutchmen hope to capture it!If there are any Yankees in Twelfth
Street that day, they are silent.And there are
some, even in the ranks of this Militia--who will fight for the Union.There is another wait, the companies standing at ease.Some of the
dragoons dismount, but not the handsome young captain, who rides
straight to the bright group which has caught his eye, Colonel Carvel
wrings his gauntleted hand."Clarence, we are proud of you, sir," he says.And Virginia, repeats his words, her eyes sparkling, her fingers
caressing the silken curve of Jefferson's neck."Clarence, you will drive Captain Lyon and his Hessians into the river.""Hush, Jinny," he answered, "we are merely going into camp to learn to
drill, that we may be ready to defend the state when the time comes.""You will have your cousin court-martialed, my dear," said the Colonel.But he must needs press Virginia's hand
first, and allow admiring Maude and Eugenie to press his.Then he goes
off at a slow canter to join his dragoons, waving his glove at them, and
turning to give the sharp order, "Attention"!Once more she has swept from her heart
every vestige of doubt.Chosen
unanimously captain of the Squadron but a few days since, Clarence had
taken command like a veteran.George Catherwood and Maurice had told the
story.And now at last the city is to shake off the dust of the North.The bands are started, the general and
staff begin to move, and the column swings into the Olive Street road,
followed by a concourse of citizens awheel and afoot, the horse cars
crowded.Virginia and Maude and the Colonel in the Carvel carriage, and
behind Ned, on the box, is their luncheon in a hamper Standing up, the
girls can just see the nodding plumes of the dragoons far to the front.Olive Street, now paved with hot granite and disfigured by trolley
wires, was a country road then.Green trees took the place of crowded
rows of houses and stores, and little "bob-tail" yellow cars were drawn
by plodding mules to an inclosure in a timbered valley, surrounded by
a board fence, known as Lindell Grove.It was then a resort, a picnic
ground, what is now covered by close residences which have long shown
the wear of time.Into Lindell Grove flocked the crowd, the rich and the poor, the
proprietor and the salesmen, to watch the soldiers pitch their tents
under the spreading trees.The gallant dragoons were off to the west,
across a little stream which trickled through the grounds.By the side
of it Virginia and Maude, enchanted, beheld Captain Colfax shouting
his orders while his troopers dragged the canvas from the wagons, and
staggered under it to the line.The
Captain lost his temper, his troopers, perspiring over Gordian knots in
the ropes, uttered strange soldier oaths, while the mad wind which blew
that day played a hundred pranks.To the discomfiture of the young ladies, Colonel Carvel pulled his
goatee and guffawed."How mean, Pa," she said indignantly."How car, you expect them to do it
right the first day, and in this wind?""He is pulled
over on his head."And the gentlemen and ladies who were standing by
laughed, too."You will see that they can fight," she said."They can beat the Yankees
and Dutch."This speech made the Colonel glance around him: Then he smiled,--in
response to other smiles."My dear," he said, "you must remember that this is a peaceable camp of
instruction of the state militia.There fly the Stars and Stripes from
the general's tent.Do you see that they are above the state flag?Jinny stamped her foot

"Oh, I hate dissimulation," she cried, "Why can't we, say outright that
we are going to run that detestable Captain Lyon and his Yankees and
Hessians out of the Arsenal."She had forgotten that one of
her brothers was with the Yankees and Hessians."Why aren't women made generals and governors?""If we were," answered Virginia, "something might be accomplished.""Isn't Clarence enough of a fire-eater to suit you?"But the tents were pitched, and at that moment the young Captain was
seen to hand over his horse to an orderly, and to come toward them.He
was followed by George Catherwood."Come, Jinny," cried her cousin, "let us go over to the main camp.""And walk on Davis Avenue," said Virginia, flushing with pride."Yes, and a Lee Avenue, and a Beauregard Avenue," said George, taking
his sister's arm."We shall walk in them all," said Virginia.The rustling trees and the young grass
of early May, and the two hundred and forty tents in lines of military
precision.Up and down the grassy streets flowed the promenade, proud
fathers and mothers, and sweethearts and sisters and wives in gala
dress.Wear your bright gowns now, you devoted women.The day is coming
when you will make them over and over again, or tear them to lint, to
stanch the blood of these young men who wear their new gray so well.Every afternoon Virginia drove with her father and her aunt to Camp
Jackson.All the fashion and beauty of the city were there.The bands
played, the black coachmen flecked the backs of their shining horses,
and walking in the avenues or seated under the trees were natty young
gentlemen in white trousers and brass-buttoned jackets.All was not
soldier fare at the regimental messes.Cakes and jellies and even ices
and more substantial dainties were laid beneath those tents.Dress
parade was one long sigh of delight: Better not to have been born than
to have been a young man in St.Louis, early in Camp Jackson week, and
not be a militiaman.One young man whom we know, however, had little of pomp and vanity
about him,--none other than the young manager (some whispered "silent
partner") of Carvel & Company.Eliphalet had had political
ambition, or political leanings, during the half-year which had just
passed, he had not shown them.Cluyme (no mean business man himself)
had pronounced Eliphalet a conservative young gentleman who attended
to his own affairs and let the mad country take care of itself.Seeing a regiment of
Missouri Volunteers slouching down Fifth street in citizens' clothes he
had been remarked to smile cynically.But he kept his opinions so close
that he was supposed not to have any.On Thursday of Camp Jackson week, an event occurred in Mr.Carvel's
store which excited a buzz of comment.Barbo, the book-keeper, that he should not be there after four o'clock.To be sure, times were more than dull.The Colonel that morning had read
over some two dozen letters from Texas and the Southwest, telling of the
impossibility of meeting certain obligations in the present state of the
country.The Colonel had gone home to dinner with his brow furrowed.Hopper's equanimity was spoken of at the widow's
table.Hopper took an Olive Street car, tucking himself
into the far corner where he would not be disturbed by any ladies who
might enter.In the course of an hour or so, he alighted at the western
gate of the camp on the Olive Street road.Refreshing himself with a
little tobacco, he let himself be carried leisurely by the crowd between
the rows of tents.A philosophy of his own (which many men before and
since have adopted) permitted him to stare with a superior good nature
at the open love-making around him.He imagined his own figure,--which
was already growing a little stout,--in a light gray jacket and duck
trousers, and laughed.Eliphalet was not burdened with illusions of that
kind.These heroes might have their hero-worship.As he was sauntering toward a deserted seat at the foot of a tree, it so
chanced that he was overtaken by Mr.Only
that morning, this gentleman, in glancing through the real estate column
of his newspaper, had fallen upon a deed of sale which made him wink.He
reminded his wife that Mr.Hopper had not been to supper of late.Cluyme held out his hand with more than common cordiality.Hopper took it, the fingers did not close any too tightly over his own.But it may be well to remark that Mr.Hopper himself did not do any
squeezing.He took off his hat grudgingly to Miss Belle."I hope you will take pot luck with us soon again, Mr."We only have plain and simple things, but they are
wholesome, sir.Dainties are poor things to work on.I told that to his
Royal Highness when he was here last fall.He was speaking to me on the
merits of roast beef--"

"It's a fine day," said Mr.Letting his gaze wander over the camp,
he added casually, "I see that they have got a few mortars and howitzers
since yesterday.I suppose that is the stuff we heard so much about,
which came on the 'Swon' marked'marble.'They say Jeff Davis sent the
stuff to 'em from the Government arsenal the Secesh captured at Baton
Rouge.They're pretty near ready to move on our arsenal now."He was not greatly interested in
this matter which had stirred the city to the quick.Cluyme spoken as one who was deeply moved.Just then, as if to spare the
pains of a reply, a "Jenny Lind" passed them.Miss Belle recognized the
carriage immediately as belonging to an elderly lady who was well known
in St.Every day she drove out, dressed in black bombazine, and
heavily veiled.As the mother-in-law of the stalwart
Union leader of the city, Miss Belle's comment about her appearance in
Camp Jackson was not out of place.she exclaimed, "I'd like to know what she's doing here!"Hopper's answer revealed a keenness which, in the course of a few
days, engendered in Mr.Cluyme as lusty a respect as he was capable of."I don't know," said Eliphalet; "but I cal'late she's got stouter.""That Union principles must be healthy," said he, and laughed.Miss Cluyme was prevented from following up this enigma.The appearance
of two people on Davis Avenue drove the veiled lady from her mind.Eliphalet, too, had seen them.One was the tall young Captain of
Dragoons, in cavalry boots, and the other a young lady with dark brown
hair, in a lawn dress."They think they are alone in the
garden of Eden.But since he's
a captain, and has got a uniform, she's come round pretty quick.I'm
thankful I never had any silly notions about uniforms."She glanced at Eliphalet, to find that his eyes were fixed on the
approaching couple."Clarence is handsome, but worthless," she continued in her sprightly
way."I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him.Do you think
she's so very pretty, Mr."Neither do I," Miss Belle assented.And upon that, greatly to
the astonishment of Eliphalet, she left him and ran towards them.she cried; "Jinny, I have something so interesting to tell
you!"The look she bestowed upon Miss Cluyme was
not one of welcome, but Belle was not sensitive.Putting her arm through
Virginia's, she sauntered off with the pair toward the parade grounds,
Clarence maintaining now a distance of three feet, and not caring to
hide his annoyance.Eliphalet's eyes smouldered, following the three until they were lost
in the crowd.That expression of Virginia's had reminded him of a
time, years gone, when she had come into the store on her return from
Kentucky, and had ordered him to tell her father of her arrival.And Eliphalet was not the sort to get over smarts.She has wealth, and manners,
and looks.Too bad he holds such views
on secession.I have always thought, sir, that you were singularly
fortunate in your connection with him."There was a point of light now in each of Mr.Cluyme continued:

"What a pity, I say, that he should run the risk of crippling himself by
his opinions."And southwestern notes are not worth the paper they are written on--"

But Mr.Cluyme has misjudged his man.If he had come to Eliphalet for
information of Colonel Carvel's affairs, or of any one else's affairs,
he was not likely to get it.It is not meet to repeat here the long
business conversation which followed.Cluyme,
who was in dry goods himself, was as ignorant when he left Eliphalet
as when he met him.But he had a greater respect than ever for the
shrewdness of the business manager of Carvel & Company..........................

That same Thursday, when the first families of the city were whispering
jubilantly in each other's ears of the safe arrival of the artillery and
stands of arms at Camp Jackson, something of significance was happening
within the green inclosure of the walls of the United States arsenal,
far to the southward.The days had become alike in sadness to Stephen.Richter gone, and the
Judge often away in mysterious conference, he was left for hours at
a spell the sole tenant of the office.Fortunately there was work of
Richter's and of Mr.Whipple's left undone that kept him busy.This
Thursday morning, however, he found the Judge getting into that best
black coat which he wore on occasions.His manner had recently lost much
of its gruffness."Stephen," said he, "they are serving out cartridges and uniforms to the
regiments at the arsenal.asked Stephen, when they had reached the
street."Captain Lyon is not the man to sit still and let the Governor take the
first trick, sir," said the Judge.As they got on the Fifth Street car, Stephen's attention was at once
attracted to a gentleman who sat in a corner, with his children about
him.He was lean, and he had a face of great keenness and animation.He
had no sooner spied Judge Whipple than he beckoned to him with a kind of
military abruptness."That is Major William T. Sherman," said the Judge to Stephen."He
used to be in the army, and fought in the Mexican War.He came here two
months ago to be the President of this Fifth Street car line."They crossed over to him, the Judge introducing Stephen to Major
Sherman, who looked at him very hard, and then decided to bestow on him
a vigorous nod."Well, Whipple," he said, "this nation is going to the devil; eh?"For it was a bold man who expressed
radical opinions (provided they were not Southern opinions) in a St."Who's man enough in Washington
to shake his fist in a rebel's face?Our leniency--our timidity--has
paralyzed us, sir."By this time those in the car began to manifest considerable interest in
the conversation.Major Sherman paid them no attention, and the Judge,
once launched in an argument, forgot his surroundings."Seventy-five thousand for three months!"said the Major, vehemently,
"a bucketful on a conflagration I tell you, Whipple, we'll need all the
water we've got in the North."The Judge expressed his belief in this, and also that Mr.Lincoln would
draw all the water before he got through.Now's the time to stop
'em.The longer we let 'em rear and kick, the harder to break 'em.You
don't catch me going back to the army for three months.If they want me,
they've got to guarantee me three years.Turning
to Stephen, he added: "Don't you sign any three months' contract, young
man."By this time the car was full, and silent.No one had
offered to quarrel with the Major.Nor did it seem likely that any one
would."I'm afraid I can't go, sir.""Because, sir," said the Judge, bluntly, "his mother's a widow, and they
have no money.He was a lieutenant in one of Blair's companies before
the call came."The Major looked at Stephen, and his expression changed.Stephen's expression must have satisfied him, but he nodded again, more
vigorously than before.But he hoped to fall out of the talk.Much to his
discomfiture, the Major gave him another of those queer looks.His whole
manner, and even his appearance, reminded Stephen strangely of Captain
Elijah Brent."Aren't you the young man who made the Union speech in Mercantile
Library Hall?"At that the Major put out his hand impulsively, and gripped Stephen's."Well, sir," he said, "I have yet to read a more sensible speech, except
some of Abraham Lincoln's.Brinsmade gave it to me to read.Whipple,
that speech reminded me of Lincoln.Lincoln's debate with Judge Douglas at 'Freeport," said
Stephen; beginning to be amused."I admire your frankness, sir," he said."I meant to say that its logic
rather than its substance reminded one of Lincoln.""I tried to learn what I could from him, Major Sherman."At length the car stopped, and they passed into the Arsenal grounds.Drawn up in lines on the green grass were four regiments, all at last
in the blue of their country's service.Old soldiers with baskets of
cartridges were stepping from file to file, giving handfuls to the
recruits.Many of these thrust them in their pockets, for there were not
enough belts to go around.The men were standing at ease, and as Stephen
saw them laughing and joking lightheartedly his depression returned.It was driven away again by Major Sherman's vivacious comments.For
suddenly Captain Lyon, the man of the hour, came into view.cried the Major, "he's a man after my own heart.Just
look at him running about with his hair flying in the wind, and the
papers bulging from his pockets.But
this isn't the time to be dignified.If there were some like Lyon in
Washington, our troops would be halfway to New Orleans by this time.The gallant Captain was a sight, indeed, and vividly described by Major
Sherman's picturesque words as he raced from regiment to regiment,
and from company to company, with his sandy hair awry, pointing,
gesticulating, commanding.In him Stephen recognized the force that had
swept aside stubborn army veterans of wavering faith, that snapped the
tape with which they had tied him.Would he be duped by the Governor's ruse of establishing a State Camp at
this time?Stephen, as he gazed at him, was sure that he would not.This
man could see to the bottom, through every specious argument.Little
matters of law and precedence did not trouble him.Nor did he believe
elderly men in authority when they told gravely that the state troops
were there for peace.After the ranks were broken, Major Sherman and the Judge went to talk to
Captain Lyon and the Union Leader, who was now a Colonel of one of
the Volunteer regiments.Stephen sought Richter, who told him that the
regiments were to assemble the morning of the morrow, prepared to march."We are not consulted, my friend," he said."Will you come into my
quarters and have a bottle of beer with Tiefel?"It was not their fault that his sense at their comradeship
was gone.To him it was as if the ties that had bound him to them were
asunder, and he was become an outcast.THE STONE THAT IS REJECTED

That Friday morning Stephen awoke betimes with a sense that something
was to happen.For a few moments he lay still in the half comprehension
which comes after sleep when suddenly he remembered yesterday's
incidents at the Arsenal, and leaped out of bed."I think that Lyon is going to attack Camp Jackson to-day," he said to
his mother after breakfast, when Hester had left the room."I went down to the Arsenal with the Judge yesterday and saw them
finishing the equipment of the new regiments.Any one could see that from the way Lyon was flying about.I think he
must have proof that the Camp Jackson people have received supplies from
the South."Brice looked fixedly at her son, and then smiled in spite of the
apprehension she felt."Is that why you were working over that map of the city last night?""I was trying to see how Lyon would dispose his troops.I meant to tell
you about a gentleman we met in the street car, a Major Sherman who used
to be in the army.Brinsmade knows him, and Judge Whipple, and many
other prominent men here.Louis some months ago to take
the position of president of the Fifth Street Line.He is the keenest,
the most original man I have ever met.As long as I live I shall never
forget his description of Lyon.""Is the Major going back into the army?"Brice, Stephen
did not remark the little falter in her voice.He laughed over the
recollection of the conversation in the street car."Not unless matters in Washington change to suit him," he said."He
thinks that things have been very badly managed, and does not scruple
to say so anywhere.I could not have believed it possible that two men
could have talked in public as he and Judge Whipple did yesterday and
not be shot down.I thought that it was as much as a man's life is worth
to mention allegiance to the Union here in a crowd.Sherman pitched into the Rebels in that car full of people was enough to
make your hair stand on end.""He must be a bold man," murmured Mrs."Does he think that the--the Rebellion can be put down?""Not with seventy-five thousand men, nor with ten times that number."Brice sighed, and furtively wiped her eyes with her handkerchief."I am afraid we shall see great misery, Stephen," she said.From that peaceful little room war and its horrors seemed
very far away.The morning sun poured in through the south windows and
was scattered by the silver on the sideboard.From above, on the wall,
Colonel Wilton Brice gazed soberly down.Stephen's eyes lighted on the
portrait, and his thoughts flew back to the boyhood days when he used to
ply his father with questions about it.Then the picture had suggested
only the glory and honor which illumines the page of history.Something
worthy to look back upon, to keep ones head high.The hatred and the
suffering and the tears, the heartrending, tearing apart for all time of
loving ones who have grown together,--these were not upon that canvas,
Will war ever be painted with a wart?The sound of feet was heard on the pavement.Stephen rose, glancing at
his mother."I am going to the Arsenal," he said.To her, as has been said, was given wisdom beyond most women.She did
not try to prevent him as he kissed her good-by.But when the door had
shut behind him, a little cry escaped her, and she ran to the window to
strain her eyes after him until he had turned the corner below.His steps led him irresistibly past the house of the strange flag,
ominously quiet at that early hour.At sight of it anger made him hot
again.Louis stood at the end of the line, fast
filling with curious people who had read in their papers that morning of
the equipment of the new troops.There was little talk among them, and
that little guarded.It was a May morning to rouse a sluggard; the night air tingled into
life at the touch of the sunshine, the trees in the flitting glory
of their first green.Stephen found the shaded street in front of the
Arsenal already filled with an expectant crowd.Sharp commands broke the
silence, and he saw the blue regiments forming on the lawn inside the
wall.Truly, events were in the air,--great events in which he had no
part.As he stood leaning against a tree-box by the curb, dragged down once
more by that dreaded feeling of detachment, he heard familiar voices
close beside him.Leaning forward, he saw Eliphalet Hopper and Mr.Hopper," he said, "in spite of what you say, I expect you
are dust as eager as I am to see what is going on.You've taken an early
start this morning for sightseeing."Eliphalet's equanimity was far from shaken."I don't cal'late to take a great deal of stock in the military," he
answered.And a man must keep an eye on what
is moving."Cluyme ran his hand through his chop whiskers, and lowered his
voice."You're right, Hopper," he assented."And if this city is going to be
Union, we ought to know it right away."Stephen, listening with growing indignation to this talk, was unaware of
a man who stood on the other side of the tree, and who now came forward
before Mr."My friend," said the stranger, quietly, "I think we have met before,
when your actions were not greatly to your credit.I do not forget a
face, even when I see it in the dark.Now I hear you utter words which
are a disgrace to a citizen of the United States.As soon as Stephen recovered from the shock of his surprise, he saw that
Eliphalet had changed countenance.The manner of an important man of
affairs, which he hay so assiduously cultivated, fell away from him.He
took a step backward, and his eyes made an ugly shift.Stephen rejoiced
to see the stranger turn his back on the manager of Carvel & Company
before that dignitary had time to depart, and stand unconcernedly there
as if nothing had occurred.He was not a man you would look at twice, ordinarily, he was smoking a
great El Sol cigar.He wore clothes that were anything but new, a slouch
hat, and coarse grained, square-toed boots.His trousers were creased at
the knees.His head fell forward a little from his square shoulders, and
leaned a bit to one side, as if meditatively.He had a light brown beard
that was reddish in the sun, and he was rather short than otherwise.And yet the very plainness of the man's
appearance only added to his curiosity.His
words, his action, too, had been remarkable.The art of administering
a rebuke like that was not given to many men.It was perfectly quiet,
perfectly final.And then, when it was over, he had turned his back and
dismissed it.Next Stephen began to wonder what he could know about Hopper.Stephen
had suspected Eliphalet of subordinating principles to business gain,
and hence the conversation with Mr.Cluyme had given him no shock in
the way of a revelation, But if Hopper were a rogue, ought not Colonel
Carvel to hear it?Ought not he, Stephen Brice, to ask this man with the
cigar what he knew, and tell Judge Whipple?The sudden rattle of drums
gave him a start, and cruelly reminded him of the gulf of prejudice and
hatred fast widening between the friends.All this time the stranger stood impassively chewing his cigar, his hand
against the tree-box.A regiment in column came out of the Arsenal gate,
the Union leader in his colonel's uniform, on horseback at its head.He pulled up in the street opposite to Stephen, and sat in his saddle,
chatting with other officers around him.Then the stranger stepped across the limestone gutter and walked up
to the Colonel's horse, He was still smoking.This move, too, was
surprising enough, It argued even more assurance."Colonel Blair, my name is Grant," he said briefly.The Colonel faced quickly about, and held out his gloved hand cordially,
"Captain Ulysses Grant," said he; "of the old army?""I wanted to wish you luck," he said."Thank you, Grant," answered the Colonel."I moved to Illinois after I left here," replied Mr.Grant, as quietly
as before, "and have been in Galena, in the Leather business there.I
went down to Springfield with the company they organized in Galena, to
be of any help I could.They made me a clerk in the adjutant general's
office of the state I ruled blanks, and made out forms for a while."He
paused, as if to let the humble character of this position sink into
the Colonel's comprehension."Then they found out that I'd been
quartermaster and commissary, and knew something about military orders
Now I'm a state mustering officer.I came down to Belleville to muster
in a regiment, which wasn't ready.And so I ran over here to see what
you fellows were doing."If this humble account had been delivered volubly, and in another tone,
it is probable that the citizen-colonel would not have listened, since
the events of that day were to crown his work of a winter.Grant
possessed a manner of holding attention.. It was very evident, however;
that Colonel Blair had other things to think of.Nevertheless he said
kindly:

"Aren't you going in, Grant?""I can't afford to go in as a captain of volunteers," was the calm
reply: "I served nine years in the regular army and I think I can
command a regiment."The Colonel, whose attention was called away at that moment, did not
reply.Some of the younger officers
who were there, laughed as they followed his retreating figure.cried one, a lieutenant whom Stephen recognized
as having been a bookkeeper at Edwards, James, & Doddington's, and whose
stiff blue uniform coat creased awkwardly."I guess I'm about as fit to
command a regiment as Grant is.""That man's forty years old, if he's a day," put in another."I remember
when he came here to St.He'd resigned from
the army on the Pacific Coast.He put up a log cabin down on the Gravois
Road, and there he lived in the hardest luck of any man I ever saw until
last year."I spotted him by the El Sol cigar.He used to bring a
load of wood to the city once in a while, and then he'd go over to the
Planters' House, or somewhere else, and smoke one of these long fellows,
and sit against the wall as silent as a wooden Indian.After that he
came up to the city without his family and went into real estate one
winter.Curious, it is just a year ago this
month than he went over to Illinois.He's an honest fellow, and hard
working enough, but he don't know how.laughed the first, again, as of this in particular
had struck his sense of humor."I guess he won't get a regiment in a
hurry, There's lots of those military carpet-baggers hanging around for
good jobs now.""He might fool you fellows yet," said the one caller, though his tone
was not one of conviction."I understand he had a first-rate record an
the Mexican War."Just then an aide rode up, and the Colonel gave a sharp command which
put an end to this desultory talk.As the First Regiment took up
the march, the words "Camp Jackson" ran from mouth to mouth on the
sidewalks.Catching fire, Stephen ran with the crowd, and leaping on
passing street car, was borne cityward with the drums of the coming
hosts beating in his ears.In the city, shutters were going up on the stores.The streets were
filled with, restless citizens seeking news, and drays were halted here
and there on the corners, the white eyes and frenzied calls of the <DW64>
drivers betraying their excitement.While Stephen related to his mother
the events of the morning, Hester burned the dinner.It lay; still
untouched, on the table when the throbbing of drums sent them to the
front steps.Sigel's regiment had swung into the street, drawing in its
wake a seething crowd.Three persons came out of the big house next door.One was Anna
Brinsmade; and there was her father, his white hairs uncovered.His sister was cringing to him appealingly, and he
struggling in her grasp.Out of his coat pocket hung the curved butt of
a pepperbox revolver."Do you think I can stay here while my
people are shot down by a lot of damned Dutchman?"Brinsmade, sternly, "I cannot let you join a mob.I
cannot let you shoot at men who carry the Union flag.""You cannot prevent me, sir," shouted the young man, in a frenzy."When
foreigners take our flag for them own, it is time for us to shoot them
down."Wrenching himself free, he ran down the steps and up the street ahead of
the regiment.Then the soldiers and the noisy crowd were upon them and
while these were passing the two stood there as in a dream.After that
silence fell upon the street, and Mr.Brinsmade turned and went back
into the house, his head bowed as in prayer.Stephen and his mother drew
back, but Anne saw them."He is a rebel," she faltered.She looked at Stephen appealingly, unashamed of the tears in her eyes."I cannot stay here mother," he said.As he slammed the gate, Anne ran down the steps calling his name.He
paused, and she caught his sleeve."I knew you would go," she said, "I knew you would go.Oh, Stephen, you
have a cool head.But when he reached the corner and
looked back he saw that she had gone in at his own little gate to
meet his mother.Now and again he was
stopped by feverish questions, but at length he reached the top of the
second ridge from the river, along which crowded Eighteenth Street now
runs.Spencer Catherwood had
built two years before on the outskirts of the town, with the wall at
the side, and the brick stable and stable yard.As Stephen approached
it, the thought came to him how little this world's goods avail in times
of trouble.One of the big Catherwood boys was in the blue marching
regiment that day, and had been told by his father never again to darken
his doors.Another was in Clarence Colfax's company of dragoons, and
still another had fled southward the night after Sumter.Stephen stopped at the crest of the hill, in the white dust of the
new-turned street, to gaze westward.Clouds were gathering in the sky,
but the sun still shone brightly, Half way up the rise two blue lines
had crawled, followed by black splotches, and at the southwest was the
glint of the sun on rifle barrels.Directed by a genius in the art of
war, the regiments were closing about Camp Jackson.As he stood there meditating and paying no attention to those who
hurried past, a few familiar notes were struck on a piano.They came
through the wide-shuttered window above his head.Then a girl's voice
rose above the notes, in tones that were exultant:--

       "Away down South in de fields of cotton,
        Cinnamon seed and sandy bottom,
        Look away, look away, Look away, look away.Den I wish I was in Dixie's Land,
        Oh, oh!In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand,
        And live and die in Dixie's Land.The song ceased amid peals of girlish laughter.Jinny Carvel, how dare you!""We
shall have a whole regiment of Hessians in here."Old Uncle Ben, the Catherwoods' coachman, came out of the stable yard.The whites of his eyes were rolling, half in amusement, half in terror.Seeing Stephen standing there, he exclaimed:

"Mistah Brice, if de Dutch take Camp Jackson, is we <DW65>s gwinter be
free?"Stephen did not answer, for the piano had started again,

       "If ever I consent to be married,
        And who could refuse a good mate?The man whom I give my hand to,
        Must believe in the Rights of the State."Then the blinds were flung aside, and a young lady in
a dress of white trimmed with crimson stood in the window, smiling.For an
instant she stared at him, and then turned to the girls crowding behind
her.What she said, he did not wait to hear.THE TENTH OF MAY

Would the sons of the first families surrender, "Never!"cried a young
lady who sat behind the blinds in Mrs.It seemed to
her when she stopped to listen for the first guns of the coming battle
that the tumult in her heart would drown their roar."But, Jinny," ventured that Miss Puss Russell who never feared to speak
her mind, "it would be folly for them to fight.The Dutch and Yankees
outnumber them ten to one, and they haven't any powder and bullets.""And Camp Jackson is down in a hollow," said Maude Catherwood,
dejectedly.And yet hopefully, too, for at the thought of bloodshed she
was near to fainting."Oh," exclaimed Virginia, passionately, "I believe you want them to
surrender.I should rather see Clarence dead than giving his sword to a
Yankee."At that the other two were silent again, and sat on through an endless
afternoon of uncertainty and hope and dread in the darkened room.Catherwood's heavy step was heard as he paced the hall.From time to time they glanced at Virginia, as if to fathom her
thought.She and Puss Russell had come that day to dine with Maude.Catherwood's Ben, reeking of the stable, had brought the rumor of the
marching on the camp into the dining-room, and close upon the heels of
this the rumble of the drums and the passing of Sigel's regiment.It was
Virginia who had the presence of mind to slam the blinds in the faces of
the troops, and the crowd had cheered her.It was Virginia who flew to
the piano to play Dixie ere they could get by, to the awe and admiration
of the girls and the delight of Mr.Catherwood who applauded her spirit
despite the trouble which weighed upon him.Once more the crowd had
cheered,--and hesitated.But the Dutch regiment slouched on, impassive,
and the people followed.Virginia remained at the piano, her mood exalted patriotism, uplifted
in spirit by that grand song.At first she had played it with all her
might.She laughed in very scorn of the booby soldiers
she had seen.A million of these, with all the firearms in the world,
could not prevail against the flower of the South.Then she had begun
whimsically to sing a verse of a song she had heard the week before, and
suddenly her exaltation was fled, and her fingers left the keys.Gaining
the window, trembling, half-expectant, she flung open a blind.The troops, the people, were gone, and there alone in the road
stood--Stephen Brice.The others close behind her saw him, too, and Puss
cried out in her surprise.The impression, when the room was dark once
more, was of sternness and sadness,--and of strength.Effaced was the
picture of the plodding recruits with their coarse and ill-fitting
uniforms of blue.Not a word escaped her, nor could they tell
why--they did not dare to question her then.An hour passed, perhaps
two, before the shrill voice of a boy was heard in the street below.They heard the patter of his bare feet on the pavement, and the cry
repeated.Bitter before, now was she on fire.Close her lips as tightly as she might, the tears forced themselves to
her eyes.How hard it is for us of this age to understand that feeling.The girls gathered around her, pale and frightened and anxious.Suddenly
courage returned to her, the courage which made Spartans of Southern
women.Catherwood was on the sidewalk,
talking to a breathless man.Barbo, Colonel Carvel's
book-keeper."Yes," he was saying, "they--they surrendered.There was nothing else
for them to do.Catherwood from a kind of stupor."Virginia, we shall make them smart for this yet, My God!"he cried,
"what have I done that my son should be a traitor, in arms against his
own brother fighting for his people?To think that a Catherwood should
be with the Yankees!You, Ben," he shouted, suddenly perceiving an
object for his anger."What do you mean by coming out of the yard?By
G-d, I'll have you whipped.I'll show you <DW65>s whether you're to be
free or not."Catherwood was a good man, who treated his servants well.Suddenly he dropped Virginia's hand and ran westward down the hill.Well
that she could not see beyond the second rise.Let us stand on the little mound at
the northeast of it, on the Olive Street Road, whence Captain Lyon's
artillery commands it.Davis Avenue is
no longer a fashionable promenade, flashing with bright dresses.Those
quiet men in blue, who are standing beside the arms of the state troops,
stacked and surrendered, are United States regulars.They have been in
Kansas, and are used to scenes of this sort.The five Hessian regiments have surrounded the camp.Each commander
has obeyed the master mind of his chief, who has calculated the time
of marching with precision.Here, at the western gate, Colonel Blair's
regiment is in open order.See the prisoners taking their places between
the ranks, some smiling, as if to say all is not over yet; some with
heads hung down, in sulky shame.Still others, who are true to the
Union, openly relieved.But who is this officer breaking his sword to
bits against the fence, rather than surrender it to a Yankee?Listen to
the crowd as they cheer him.Listen to the epithets and vile names which
they hurl at the stolid blue line of the victors, "Mudsills!""<DW64>
Worshippers."Yes, the crowd is there, seething with conflicting passions.Men with
brows bent and fists clenched, yelling excitedly.Others pushing, and
eager to see,--there in curiosity only.And, alas, women and children
by the score, as if what they looked upon were not war, but a parade,
a spectacle.As the gray uniforms file out of the gate, the crowd has
become a mob, now flowing back into the fields on each side of the road,
now pressing forward vindictively until stopped by the sergeants and
corporals.Listen to them calling to sons, and brothers, and husbands in
gray!See, there is a woman who spits in a soldier's face!Throughout it all, the officers sit their horses, unmoved.A man on the
bank above draws a pistol and aims at a captain.A German private steps
from the ranks, forgetful of discipline, and points at the man, who is
cursing the captain's name.The captain, imperturbable, orders his man
back to his place.Now are the prisoners of that regiment all in place between the two
files of it.A band (one of those which played lightsome music on the
birthday of the camp) is marched around to the head of the column.The
regiment with its freight moves on to make place for a battalion of
regulars, amid imprecations and cries of "Hurrah for Jeff Davis!"Stephen Brice stood among the people in Lindell's Grove, looking up at
the troops on the road, which was on an embankment.Through the rows of
faces he had searched in vain for one.His motive he did not attempt
to fathom--in truth, he was not conscious at the time of any motive.He
heard the name shouted at the gate."Here they are,--the dragoons!Dismounted, at the head of his
small following, the young Captain walked erect.He did not seem to hear
the cheers.His face was set, and he held his gloved hand over the place
where his sword had been, as if over a wound.On his features, in his
attitude, was stamped the undying determination of the South.How those
thoroughbreds of the Cavaliers showed it!The
fire of humiliation burned, but could not destroy their indomitable
spirit.They were the first of their people in the field, and the last
to leave it.Historians may say that the classes of the South caused the
war; they cannot say that they did not take upon themselves the greatest
burden of the suffering.Twice that day was the future revealed to Stephen.Once as he stood
on the hill-crest, when he had seen a girl in crimson and white in
a window,--in her face.And now again he read it in the face of her
cousin.It was as if he had seen unrolled the years of suffering that
were to come.In that moment of deep bitterness his reason wavered.Surely there was no such feeling in the North as these
people betrayed.That most dangerous of gifts, the seeing of two
sides of a quarrel, had been given him.He
sympathized with the Southern people.They had befriended him in his
poverty.Why had he not been born, like Clarence Colfax, the owner of a
large plantation, the believer in the divine right of his race to rule?Would that his path had been as
straight, his duty as easy, as that of the handsome young Captain.Presently these thoughts were distracted by the sight of a back
strangely familiar.The back belonged to a gentleman who was
energetically climbing the embankment in front of him, on the top
of which Major Sexton, a regular, army officer, sat his horse.The
gentleman was pulling a small boy after him by one hand, and held a
newspaper tightly rolled in the other.Stephen smiled to himself when it
came over him that this gentleman was none other than that Mr.William
T. Sherman he had met in the street car the day before.Somehow Stephen
was fascinated by the decision and energy of Mr.He gave Major Saxton a salute, quick and genial.Then, almost
with one motion he unrolled the newspaper, pointed to a paragraph, and
handed it to the officer.Major Saxton was still reading when a drunken
ruffian clambered up the bank behind them and attempted to pass through
the lines.Sherman slid down the
bank with his boy into the grove beside Stephen.A corporal pitched the drunkard backwards over the bank, and
he rolled at Mr.With a curse, he picked himself up,
fumbling in his pocket.There was a flash, and as the smoke rolled from
before his eyes, Stephen saw a man of a German regiment stagger and
fall.It was the signal for a rattle of shots.Stones and bricks filled the
air, and were heard striking steel and flesh in the ranks.The regiment
quivered,--then halted at the loud command of the officers, and the
ranks faced out with level guns, Stephen reached for Mr.Sherman's boy,
but a gentleman had already thrown him and was covering his body.He contrived to throw down a woman standing beside him before the
mini-balls swished over their heads, and the leaves and branches began
to fall.Between the popping of the shots sounded the shrieks of wounded
women and children, the groans and curses of men, and the stampeding of
hundreds.He was about to obey when a young; man, small and agile, ran past him
from behind, heedless of the panic.Stopping at the foot of the bank he
dropped on one knee, resting his revolver in the hollow of his left
arm.At the same time two of the soldiers above
lowered their barrels to cover him.When it
rolled away, Brinsmade lay on the ground.He staggered to his feet with
an oath, and confronted a young man who was hatless, and upon whose
forehead was burned a black powder mark.he cried, reaching out wildly, "curse you, you d--d Yankee.Maddened, he made a rush at Stephen's throat.But Stephen seized his
hands and bent them down, and held them firmly while he kicked and
struggled.he panted; "curse you, you let me go and I'll kill
you,--you Yankee upstart!"One of the
officers, seeing the struggle, started down the bank, was reviled, and
hesitated."Let him go, Brice," he said, in a tone of command.Whereupon Brinsmade made a dash for his pistol on the ground."Now see here, Jack," he said, picking it up, "I don't want to shoot
you, but I may have to.That young man saved your life at the risk of
his own.If that fool Dutchman had had a ball in his gun instead of a
wad, Mr.Brinsmade took one long look at Stephen,
turned on his heel, and walked off rapidly through the grove.And it may
be added that for some years after he was not seen in St.For a moment the other two stood staring after him.Sherman
took his boy by the hand.Brice," he said, "I've seen a few things done in my life, but
nothing better than this.Perhaps the day may come when you and I may
meet in the army.They don't seem to think much of us now," he added,
smiling, "but we may be of use to 'em later.If ever I can serve you,
Mr.Brice, I beg you to call on me."Sherman, nodding his head
vigorously, went away southward through the grove, toward Market Street.The dead were being laid in carriages, and the
wounded tended by such physicians as chanced to be on the spot.Stephen,
dazed at what had happened, took up the march to town.He strode faster
than the regiments with their load of prisoners, and presently he found
himself abreast the little file of dragoons who were guarded by some of
Blair's men.It was then that he discovered that the prisoners' band in
front was playing "Dixie."They are climbing the second hill, and are coming now to the fringe
of new residences which the rich citizens have built.In the windows and on the steps of others women are
crying or waving handkerchiefs and calling out to the prisoners, some
of whom are gay, and others sullen.A distracted father tries to break
through the ranks and rescue his son.Ah, here is the Catherwood house.Catherwood, with her hand on her husband's arm, with
red eyes, is scanning those faces for the sight of George.Will the Yankees murder him for treason,
or send him North to languish the rest of his life?James has,
across the street, and is even now being carried into the house.Few
of us can see into the hearts of those women that day, and speak of the
suffering there.His face is cast down as
he passes the house from which he is banished.Nor do father, or mother,
or sister in their agony make any sound or sign.The
welcome and the mourning and the tears are all for him.The band is playing "Dixie" once more.George is coming, and some one
else.The girls are standing in a knot bend the old people, dry-eyed,
their handkerchiefs in their hands.Some of the prisoners take off their
hats and smile at the young lady with the chiselled features and brown
hair, who wears the red and white of the South as if she were born to
them.Ah, at last she sees him, walking erect
at the head of his dragoons.He gives her one look of entreaty, and that
smile which should have won her heart long ago.As if by common consent
the heads of the troopers are uncovered before her.How bravely she
waves at them until they are gone down the street!Then only do her eyes
fill with tears, and she passes into the house.Had she waited, she might have seen a solitary figure leaving the line
of march and striding across to Pine Street.That night the sluices of the heavens were opened, and the blood was
washed from the grass in Lindell Grove.The rain descended in floods
on the distracted city, and the great river rose and flung brush from
Minnesota forests high up on the stones of the levee.Down in the long
barracks weary recruits, who had stood and marched all the day long,
went supperless to their hard pallets.Many a boy, prisoner or volunteer, sobbed
himself to sleep in the darkness.All were prisoners alike, prisoners
of war.Sobbed themselves to sleep, to dream of the dear homes that were
here within sight and sound of them, and to which they were powerless to
go.Sisters, and mothers, and wives were there, beyond the rain, holding
out arms to them.But what of
the long nights when husband and wife have lain side by side?What of
the children who ask piteously where their father is going, and who are
gathered by a sobbing mother to her breast?Where is the picture of that
last breakfast at home?So in the midst of the cheer which is saddest in
life comes the thought that, just one year ago, he who is the staff
of the house was wont to sit down just so merrily to his morning meal,
before going to work in the office.Why had they not thanked God on
their knees for peace while they had it?See the brave little wife waiting on the porch of her home for him to go
by.The sun shines, and the grass is green on the little plot, and the
geraniums red.Last spring she was sewing here with a song on her lips,
watching for him to turn the corner as he came back to dinner.Her good
neighbors, the doctor and his wife, come in at the little gate to cheer
her.Why does God mock her with sunlight and
with friends?And that is his dear face, the second from the end.Look, he is smiling bravely, as if to say a thousand
tender things."Will, are the flannels in your knapsack?You have not
forgotten that medicine for your cough?"What courage sublime is that
which lets her wave at him?Well for you, little woman, that you cannot
see the faces of the good doctor and his wife behind you.Oh, those guns
of Sumter, how they roar in your head!Ay, and will roar again, through
forty years of widowhood!Brice was in the little parlor that Friday night, listening to the
cry of the rain outside.Why
should she be happy, and other mothers miserable?The day of reckoning
for her happiness must surely come, when she must kiss Stephen a brave
farewell and give him to his country.For the sins of the fathers are
visited on the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate Him who is the Ruler of all things.The bell rang, and Stephen went to the door.That gentleman was suddenly aged, and his clothes were wet
and spattered with mud.He sank into a chair, but refused the spirits
and water which Mrs."Stephen," he said, "I have been searching the city for John.Did you
see him at Camp Jackson--was he hurt?""I think not, sir," Stephen answered, with clear eyes."I saw him walking southward after the firing was all over.""If you will excuse me,
madam, I shall hurry to tell my wife and daughter.I have been able to
find no one who saw him."As he went out he glanced at Stephen's forehead.But for once in his
life, Mr.Brinsmade was too much agitated to inquire about the pain of
another."Stephen, you did not tell me that you saw John," said his mother, when
the door was closed.IN THE ARSENAL

There was a dismal tea at Colonel Carvel's house in Locust Street that
evening Virginia did not touch a mouthful, and the Colonel merely made a
pretence of eating.Addison Colfax had driven in
from Bellegarde, nor could it rain fast enough or hard enough to wash
the foam from her panting horses.She did not wait for Jackson to come
out with an umbrella, but rushed through the wet from the carriage
to the door in her haste to urge the Colonel to go to the Arsenal and
demand Clarence's release.Carvel assured her
it would do no good, in vain that he told her of a more important matter
that claimed him.Could there be a more important matter than his
own nephew kept in durance, and in danger of being murdered by Dutch
butchers in the frenzy of their victory?Colfax shut herself up in
her room, and through the door Virginia heard her sobs as she went down
to tea.The Colonel made no secret of his uneasiness.With his hat on his head,
and his hands in his pockets, he paced up and down the room.He let his
cigar go out,--a more serious sign still.Finally he stood with his face
to the black window, against which the big drops were beating in a fury.Virginia sat expressionless at the head of the table, still in that gown
of white and crimson, which she had worn in honor of the defenders of
the state.Expressionless, save for a glance of solicitation at her
father's back.If resolve were feminine, Virginia might have sat for
that portrait.There was a light in her dark blue eyes.Underneath there
were traces of the day's fatigue.When she spoke, there was little life
in her voice."Aren't you going to the Planters' House, Pa The Colonel turned, and
tried to smile."I reckon not to-night, Jinny."To find out what they are going to do with Clarence," she said
indignantly."I reckon they don't know at the Planters' House," he said."Then--" began Virginia, and stopped."Then why not go to the Barracks?Order the carriage, and I will go with
you."He stood looking down at her fixedly, as was sometimes
his habit."Jinny," he said slowly, "Jinny, do you mean to marry Clarence?"The suddenness of the question took her breath.But she answered
steadily:

"Yes."Still he stood, and it seemed to her that her father's gaze pierced to
her secret soul."Come here, my dear," he said.He held out his arms, and she fluttered into them.It was not the first time she had cried out her troubles
against that great heart which had ever been her strong refuge.From
childhood she had been comforted there.Had she broken her doll, had
Mammy Easter been cross, had lessons gone wrong at school, was she
ill, or weary with that heaviness of spirit which is woman's inevitable
lot,--this was her sanctuary.This burden God Himself had sent,
and none save her Heavenly Father might cure it.Through his great love
for her it was given to Colonel Carvel to divine it--only vaguely.Many times he strove to speak, and could not.But presently, as if
ashamed of her tears, she drew back from him and took her old seat on
the arm of his chair.By the light of his intuition, the Colonel chose tins words well.What
he had to speak of was another sorrow, yet a healing one."You must not think of marriage now, my dear, when the bread we eat may
fail us.Jinny, we are not as rich as we used to be.Our trade was
in the South and West, and now the South and West cannot pay.Hopper yesterday, and he tells me that we must be
prepared.""And did you think I would care, dear?""I can bear
with poverty and rags, to win this war.""His own eyes were dim, but pride shone in them.Jackson came in on
tiptoe, and hesitated.At the Colonel's motion he took away the china
and the silver, and removed the white cloth, and turned low the lights
in the chandelier.He went out softly, and closed the door."Pa," said Virginia, presently, "do you trust Mr.He improved the business greatly before this trouble
came.And even now we are not in such straits as some other houses.""Eliphalet Hopper will serve you so long as
he serves himself."I think you do him an injustice, my dear," answered the Colonel.But
uneasiness was in his voice."Hopper is hard working, scrupulous to a
cent.He owns two slaves now who are running the river.He keeps out of
politics, and he has none of the Yankee faults."Getting up, he went over to the
bell-cord at the door and pulled it."To Jefferson City, dear, to see the Governor.He smiled, and stooped to kiss her."Yes," he answered, "in the rain as far as the depot, I can trust
you, Jinny.And Lige's boat will be back from New Orleans to-morrow or
Sunday."The next morning the city awoke benumbed, her heart beating but feebly.A long line of boats lay idle,
with noses to the levee.Men stood on the street corners in the rain,
reading of the capture of Camp Jackson, and of the riot, and thousands
lifted up their voices to execrate the Foreign City below Market Street.A vague terror, maliciously born, subtly spread.The Dutch had broken
up the camp, a peaceable state institution, they had shot down innocent
women and children.What might they not do to the defenceless city under
their victorious hand, whose citizens were nobly loyal to the South?Ladies who ventured out that day
crossed the street to avoid Union gentlemen of their acquaintance.It was early when Mammy Easter brought the news paper to her mistress.Virginia read the news, and ran joyfully to her aunt's room.Three times
she knocked, and then she heard a cry within.Then the key was turned
and the bolt cautiously withdrawn, and a crack of six inches disclosed
her aunt."Oh, how you frightened me, Jinny!""I thought it was the
Dutch coming to murder us all, What have they done to Clarence?""We shall see him to-day, Aunt Lillian," was the joyful answer."The
newspaper says that all the Camp Jackson prisoners are to be set free
to-day, on parole.Oh, I knew they would not dare to hold them.The
whole state would have risen to their rescue."Colfax did not receive these tidings with transports.She permitted
her niece to come into her room, and then: sank into a chair before the
mirror of her dressing-table, and scanned her face there."I could not sleep a wink, Jinny, all night long.I
am afraid I am going to have another of my attacks."I'll get it for you," said Virginia, used to her aunt's vagaries."It says that they will be paroled to-day, and that they passed a
comfortable night.""It must be a Yankee lie," said the lady.I saw them
torturing him in a thousand ways the barbarians!I know he had to sleep
on a dirty floor with low-down trash.""But we shall have him here to-night, Aunt Lillian!""Mammy, tell Uncle Ben that Mr."Has he gone down to see
Clarence?""He went to Jefferson City last night," replied Virginia.Colfax exclaimed in horror at this news."Do you mean that he has deserted us?""That he has left us
here defenceless,--at the mercy of the Dutch, that they may wreak their
vengeance upon us women?If I were your
age and able to drag myself to the street, I should be at the Arsenal
now.I should be on my knees before that detestable Captain Lyon, even
if he is a Yankee.""I do not go on my knees to any man," she said."Rosetta, tell Ned I
wish the carriage at once."Her aunt seized her convulsively by the arm."Your Pa would never forgive
me if anything happened to you."A smile, half pity, crossed the girl's anxious face."I am afraid that I must risk adding to your misfortune, Aunt Lillian,"
she said, and left the room.His was one of the Union houses which
she might visit and not lose her self respect.Like many Southerners,
when it became a question of go or stay, Mr.Brinsmade's unfaltering
love for the Union had kept him in.Bell, and later
had presided at Crittenden Compromise meetings.In short, as a man of
peace, he would have been willing to sacrifice much for peace.And now
that it was to be war, and he had taken his stand uncompromisingly with
the Union, the neighbors whom he had befriended for so many years could
not bring themselves to regard him as an enemy.He never hurt their
feelings; and almost as soon as the war began he set about that work
which has been done by self-denying Christians of all ages,--the relief
of suffering.He visited with comfort the widow and the fatherless, and
many a night in the hospital he sat through beside the dying, Yankee and
Rebel alike, and wrote their last letters home.And Yankee and Rebel alike sought his help and counsel in time of
perplexity or trouble, rather than hotheaded advice from their own
leaders.Brinsmade's own carriage was drawn up at his door; and that
gentleman himself standing on the threshold.He came down his steps
bareheaded in the wet to hand Virginia from her carriage.Courteous and kind as ever, he asked for her father and her aunt as
he led her into the house.However such men may try to hide their own
trials under a cheerful mien, they do not succeed with spirits of a
kindred nature.With the others, who are less generous, it matters
not.Virginia was not so thoughtless nor so selfish that she could not
perceive that a trouble had come to this good man.Absorbed as she was
in her own affairs, she forgot some of them in his presence.The fire
left her tongue, and to him she could not have spoken harshly even of
an enemy.Such was her state of mind, when she was led into the
drawing-room.From the corner of it Anne arose and came forward to throw
her arms around her friend."Jinny, it was so good of you to come."Because we are Union," said honest Anne, wishing to have no shadow of
doubt."Anne," she cried, "if you were German, I believe
I should love you."I should not have dared go to your house,
because I know that you feel so deeply."That Jack has run away--has gone South, we think.Perhaps," she cried,
"perhaps he may be dead."She drew Anne to the sofa and
kissed her."No, he is not dead," she said gently, but with a confidence in her
voice of rare quality."He is not dead, Anne dear, or you would have
heard."Had she glanced up, she would have seen Mr.He
looked kindly at all people, but this expression he reserved for those
whom he honored.A life of service to others had made him guess that,
in the absence of her father, this girl had come to him for help of some
kind."Virginia is right, Anne," he said."John has gone to fight for his
principles, as every gentleman who is free should; we must remember
that this is his home, and that we must not quarrel with him, because
we think differently.""There is
something I can do for you, my dear?"And yet her honesty was as
great as Anne's.She would not have it thought that she came for other
reasons."My aunt is in such a state of worry over Clarence that I came
to ask you if you thought the news true, that the prisoners are to be
paroled.She thinks it is a--" Virginia flushed, and bit a rebellious
tongue.Brinsmade smiled at the slip she had nearly made.He
understood the girl, and admired her."I'll drive to the Arsenal with you, Jinny," he answered."I know
Captain Lyon, and we shall find out certainly.""You will do nothing of the kind, sir," said Virginia, with emphasis."Had I known this--about John, I should not have come."What a gentleman of the old school
he was, with his white ruffled shirt and his black stock and his eye
kindling with charity."My dear," he answered, "Nicodemus is waiting.I was just going myself
to ask Captain Lyon about John."Virginia's further objections were cut
short by the violent clanging of the door-bell, and the entrance of a
tall, energetic gentleman, whom Virginia had introduced to her as
Major Sherman, late of the army, and now president of the Fifth Street
Railroad.He then proceeded, as was
evidently his habit, directly to the business on which he was come.Brinsmade," he said, "I heard, accidentally, half an hour ago that
you were seeking news of your son.I regret to say, sir, that the news I
have will not lead to a knowledge of his whereabouts.But in justice to
a young gentleman of this city I think I ought to tell you what happened
at Camp Jackson."With
some gesticulation which added greatly to the force of the story,
he gave a most terse and vivid account of Mr.John's arrival at the
embankment by the grove--of his charging a whole regiment of Union
volunteers.Sherman did not believe in
mincing matters even to a father and sister."And, sir," said he, "you may thank the young man who lives next door to
you--Mr.Brice, I believe--for saving your son's life."Virginia felt Anne's hand tighten But her own was limp.A hot wave swept
over her, Was she never to hear the end of this man."Yes, sir, Stephen Brice," answered Mr."And I never in my life
saw a finer thing done, in the Mexican War or out of it.""As sure as I know you," said the Major, with excessive conviction.Brinsmade, "I was in there last night, I knew the young
man had been at the camp.He told me
that he had, by the embankment.But he never mentioned a word about
saving his life.""By glory, but he's even better than I
thought him, Did you see a black powder mark on his face?""Why, yes, sir, I saw a bad burn of some kind on his forehead.""Well, sir, if one of the Dutchmen who shot at Jack had known enough to
put a ball in his musket, he would have killed Mr.Brice, who was only
ten feet away, standing before your son."Anne gave a little cry--Virginia was silent--Her lips were parted.Though she realized it not, she was thirsting %a hear the whole of the
story.The Major told it, soldier fashion, but well.Sherman) had seen Brice throw the woman down and
had cried to him to lie down himself how the fire was darting down the
regiment, and how men and women were falling all about them; and how
Stephen had flung Jack and covered him with his body.Had she any right to treat
such a man with contempt?She remembered hour he had looked, at her when
he stood on the corner by the Catherwoods' house.And, worst of all, she
remembered many spiteful remarks she had made, even to Anne, the gist of
which had been that Mr.Brice was better at preaching than at fighting.She knew now--and she had known in her heart before--that this was the
greatest injustice she could have done him.It was Anne who tremblingly asked the Major.Sherman,
apparently, was not the man to say that Jack would have shot Stephen had
he not interfered.John would have
shot the man who saved his life.Brinsmade and Anne had
gone upstairs to the sickbed, these were the tidings the Major told
Virginia, who kept it in her heart.The reason he told her was because
she had guessed a part of it.Brinsmade drove to the Arsenal with her that Saturday,
in his own carriage.Forgetful of his own grief, long habit came to
him to talk cheerily with her.He told her many little anecdotes of his
travel, but not one of them did she hear.Again, at the moment when she
thought her belief in Clarence and her love for him at last secure, she
found herself drawing searching comparisons between him and the quieter
young Bostonian.In spite of herself she had to admit that Stephen's
deed was splendid.Clarence had been capable of the deed,--even to the rescue of an enemy.But--alas, that she should carry it out to a remorseless end--would
Clarence have been equal to keeping silence when Mr.Stephen Brice had not even told his mother, so Mr.As if to aggravate her torture, Mr.Brinsmade's talk drifted to the
subject of young Mr.He told her of the
brave struggle Stephen had made, and how he had earned luxuries, and
often necessities, for his mother by writing for the newspapers.Brinsmade, "often I have been unable to sleep, and
have seen the light in Stephen's room until the small hours of the
morning.""Can't you tell me something bad
about him?The good gentleman started, and looked searchingly at the girl by his
side, flushed and confused.Perhaps he thought--but how can we tell what
he thought?How can we guess that our teachers laugh at our pranks after
they have caned us for them?We do not remember that our parents have
once been young themselves, and that some word or look of our own brings
a part of their past vividly before them.Brinsmade was silent, but
he looked out of the carriage window, away from Virginia.And presently,
as they splashed through the mud near the Arsenal, they met a knot of
gentlemen in state uniforms on their way to the city.Nicodemus stopped
at his master's signal.Here was George Catherwood, and his father was
with him."They have released us on parole," said George."Yes, we had a fearful
night of it.They could not have kept us--they had no quarters."How changed he was from the gay trooper of yesterday!His bright uniform
was creased and soiled and muddy, his face unshaven, and dark rings of
weariness under his eyes."Do you know if Clarence Colfax has gone home?""Clarence is an idiot," cried George, ill-naturedly.Brinsmade, of
all the prisoners here, he refused to take the parole, or the oath of
allegiance.He swears he will remain a prisoner until he is exchanged.""The young man is Quixotic," declared the elder Catherwood, who was not
himself in the best of humors.Brinsmade, with as much severity as he was ever known
to use, "sir, I honor that young man for this more than I can tell you.Nicodemus, you may drive on."Perhaps George had caught sight of a face in the depths of the carriage,
for he turned purple, and stood staring on the pavement after his
choleric parent had gone on.Of all the thousand and more young men who had upheld
the honor of their state that week, there was but the one who chose to
remain in durance vile within the Arsenal wall--Captain Clarence Colfax,
late of the Dragoons.Brinsmade was rapidly admitted to the Arsenal, and treated with the
respect which his long service to the city deserved.He and Virginia
were shown into the bare military room of the commanding officer, and
thither presently came Captain Lyon himself.Virginia tingled with
antagonism when she saw this man who had made the city tremble, who had
set an iron heel on the flaming brand of her Cause.He, too, showed the
marks of his Herculean labors, but only on his clothes and person.His
long red hair was unbrushed, his boots covered with black mud, and his
coat unbuttoned.His face was ruddy, and his eye as clear as though
he had arisen from twelve hours' sleep.He bowed to Virginia (not too
politely, to be sure).Her own nod of are recognition did not seem to
trouble him."Yes, sir," he said incisively, in response to Mr.Brinsmade's question,
"we are forced to retain Captain Colfax.He prefers to remain a prisoner
until he is exchanged.He refuses to take the oath of allegiance to the
United States."And why should he be made to, Captain Lyon?In what way has he opposed
the United States troops?""You will pardon me, Miss Carvel," said Captain Lyon, gravely, "if I
refuse to discuss that question with you."Colfax is a near relative of yours, Miss Carvel,"
the Captain continued."His friends may come here to see him during
the day.And I believe it is not out of place for me to express my
admiration of the captain's conduct.You may care to see him now--"

"Thank you," said Virginia, curtly."Orderly, my respects to Captain Colfax, and ask him if a he will be
kind enough to come in here.Brinsmade," said the Captain, "I
should like a few words with you, sir."And so, thanks to the Captain's
delicacy, when Clarence arrived he found Virginia alone.She was much
agitated She ran toward him as he entered the door, calling his name."Max, you are going to stay here?"Aglow with admiration, she threw herself into his arms.Now, indeed, was
she proud of him.Of all the thousand defenders of the state, he alone
was true to his principles--to the South.Within sight of home, he alone
had chosen privation.She looked up into his face, which showed marks of excitement and
fatigue.She knew that he could live on
excitement.The thought came to her--was it that which sustained him
now?Surely the touch of this experience
would transform the boy into the man.This was the weak point in the
armor which she wore so bravely for her cousin.He had known neither care nor
responsibility.His one longing from a child had been that love of
fighting and adventure which is born in the race.Until this gloomy
day in the Arsenal, Virginia had never characterized it as a love of
excitement---as any thing which contained a selfish element.She looked
up into his face, I say, and saw that which it is given to a woman only
to see.His eyes burned with a light that was far away.Even with his
arms around her he seemed to have forgotten her presence, and that she
had come all the way to the Arsenal to see him.Her hands dropped limply
from his shoulders She drew away, as he did not seem to notice.Above and beyond the sacrifice of a woman's life, the
joy of possessing her soul and affection, is something more desirable
still--fame and glory--personal fame and glory, The woman may share
them, of course, and be content with the radiance.When the Governor
in making his inauguration speech, does he always think of the help the
little wife has given him.And so, in moments of excitement, when we see
far ahead into a glorious future, we do not feel the arms about us,
or value the sweets which, in more humdrum days, we labored so hard to
attain.Virginia drew away, and the one searching glance she gave him he did
not see.He was staring far beyond; tears started in her eyes, and she
turned from him to look out over the Arsenal grounds, still wet and
heavy with the night's storm.She
thought of the supper cooking at home.And yet, in that moment of bitterness Virginia loved him.Such are the
ways of women, even of the proudest, who love their country too.It was
but right that he should not think of her when the honor of the South
was at stake; and the anger that rose within her was against those nine
hundred and ninety-nine who had weakly accepted the parole."He has gone to Jefferson City, to see the Governor.."

"And you came alone?"What a relief that should have come
among the first.She was
afraid," (Virginia had to smile), "she was afraid the Yankees would kill
you.""They have behaved very well for Yankees," replied he, "No luxury, and
they will not hear of my having a servant.They are used to doing their
own work.But they have treated me much better since I refused to take
their abominable oath.""And you will be honored for it when the news reaches town."Clarence asked eagerly, "I reckon they will
think me a fool!""I should like to hear any one say so," she flashed out."No," said Virginia, "our friends will force them to release you.But you have done nothing to be imprisoned
for.""I do not want to be
released.""You do not want to be released," she repeated.If I remain a prisoner, it will
have a greater effect--for the South."She smiled again, this time at the boyish touch of heroics.Experience,
responsibility, and he would get over that.She remembered once, long
ago, when his mother had shut him up in his room for a punishment, and
he had tortured her by remaining there for two whole days.It was well on in the afternoon when she drove back to the city with Mr.Neither of them had eaten since morning, nor had they even
thought of hunger.Brinsmade was silent, leaning back in the corner
of the carriage, and Virginia absorbed in her own thoughts.Drawing near
the city, that dreaded sound, the rumble of drums, roused them.A shot
rang out, and they were jerked violently by the starting of the horses.As they dashed across Walnut at Seventh came the fusillade.Down the vista of the street was a mass of
blue uniforms, and a film of white smoke hanging about the columns of
the old Presbyterian Church Mr.Brinsmade quietly drew her back into the
carriage.The shots ceased, giving place to an angry roar that struck terror to
her heart that wet and lowering afternoon.Nicodemus tugging at the reins, and great splotches of
mud flying in at the windows.The roar of the crowd died to an ominous
moaning behind them.Brinsmade was speaking:--
"From battle and murder, and from sudden death--from all sedition, privy
conspiracy, and rebellion,--Good Lord, deliver us."He was repeating the Litany--that Litany which had come down through the
ages.They had chanted it in Cromwell's time, when homes were ruined and
laid waste, and innocents slaughtered.They had chanted it on the dark,
barricaded stairways of mediaeval Paris, through St.Bartholomew's
night, when the narrow and twisted streets, ran with blood.They had
chanted it in ancient India, and now it was heard again in the New World
and the New Republic of Peace and Good Will.The girl flinched at the word which the good gentleman had
uttered in his prayers.Was she a traitor to that flag for which her
people had fought in three wars?She burned to blot it
forever from the book Oh, the bitterness of that day, which was prophecy
of the bitterness to come.Brinsmade escorted her up her own steps.He held her hand a little at parting, and bade her be of good cheer.Perhaps he guessed something of the trial she was to go through that
night alone with her aunt, Clarence's mother.Brinsmade did not go
directly home.He went first to the little house next door to his.Brice and Judge Whipple were in the parlor: What passed between them
there has not been told, but presently the Judge and Mr.Brinsmade came
out together and stood along time in, the yard, conversing, heedless of
the rain.THE STAMPEDE

Sunday dawned, and the people flocked to the churches.But even in the
house of God were dissension and strife.Posthelwaite's Virginia saw men and women rise from their knees and
walk out--their faces pale with anger.Mark's the prayer for
the President of the United States was omitted.Catherwood nodded approvingly over the sermon in which the South was
justified, and the sanction of Holy Writ laid upon her Institution.With not indifferent elation these gentlemen watched the departure of
brethren with whom they had labored for many years, save only when Mr.Brinsmade walked down the aisle never to return.So it is that war, like
a devastating flood, creeps insistent into the most sacred places, and
will not be denied.Davitt, at least, preached that day to an united
congregation,--which is to say that none of them went out.Hopper,
who now shared a pew with Miss Crane, listened as usual with a most
reverent attention.The clouds were low and the streets wet as people
walked home to dinner, to discuss, many in passion and some in sorrow,
the doings of the morning.A certain clergyman had prayed to be
delivered from the Irish, the Dutch, and the Devil.Was it he who
started the old rumor which made such havoc that afternoon?Those
barbarians of the foreign city to the south, drunk with power, were to
sack and loot the city.How it flew across street and alley, from
yard to yard, and from house to house!Privileged Ned ran into the
dining-room where Virginia and her aunt were sitting, his eyes rolling
and his face ashen with terror, crying out that the Dutch were marching
on the city, firebrands in hand and murder in their hearts."De Gen'ral done gib out er procl'mation, Miss Jinny," he cried."De
Gen'ral done say in dat procl'mation dat he ain't got no control ober de
Dutch soldiers.""Oh Miss Jinny, ain't you gwineter Glencoe?Ain't you gwineter flee
away?Every fambly on dis here street's gwine away--is packin' up fo' de
country.Doan't you hear 'em, Miss Jinny?What'll your pa say to Ned of
he ain't make you clear out!Doan't you hear de carridges a-rattlin' off
to de country?"Virginia rose in agitation, yet trying to be calm, and to remember
that the safety of the household depended upon her alone.That was her
thought,--bred into her by generations,--the safety of the household,
of the humblest slave whose happiness and welfare depended upon her
father's bounty.How she longed in that instant for her father or
Captain Lige, for some man's strength, to depend upon.She has seen her aunt swoon before,
and her maid Susan knows well what to do."Laws Mussy, no, Miss Jinny.One <DW65> laik me doan't make no
difference.My Marsa he say: 'Whaffor you leave ma house to be ramsacked
by de Dutch?'Oh Miss Jinny, you an' Miss Lill an' Mammy
Easter an' Susan's gwine with Jackson, an' de othah niggahs can walk.Ephum an' me'll jes' put up de shutters an' load de Colonel's gun."By this time the room was filled with excited <DW64>s, some crying,
and some laughing hysterically.Uncle Ben had come in from the kitchen;
Jackson was there, and the women were a wailing bunch in the corner by
the sideboard.Old Ephum, impassive, and Ned stood together.Virginia's
eye rested upon them, and the light of love and affection was in it.Yes, carriages were indeed rattling outside, though
a sharp shower was falling.Across the street Alphonse, M. Renault's
butler, was depositing bags and bundles on the steps.M. Renault himself
bustled out into the rain, gesticulating excitedly.Spying her at the
window, he put his hands to his mouth, cried out something, and ran in
again.Virginia flung open the sash and listened for the dreaded sound
of drums.Then she crossed quickly over to where her aunt was lying on
the lounge."O Jinny," murmured that lady, who had revived, "can't you do something?They will be here any moment to burn us, to
murder us--to--oh, my poor boy!Why isn't he here to protect his mother!Why was Comyn so senseless, so thoughtless, as to leave us at such a
time!""I don't think there is any need to be frightened," said Virginia, with
a calmness that made her aunt tremble with anger."It is probably only a
rumor.Brinsmade's and ask him about it."However loath to go, Ned departed at once.All honor to those old-time
<DW64>s who are now memories, whose devotion to their masters was next
to their love of God.A great fear was in Ned's heart, but he went.And he believed devoutly that he would never see his young mistress any
more.Colfax is summoning
that courage which comes to persons of her character at such times.She
gathers her jewels into a bag, and her fine dresses into her trunk,
with trembling hands, although she is well enough now.The picture of
Clarence in the diamond frame she puts inside the waist of her gown.No,
she will not go to Bellegarde.With frantic
haste she closes the trunk, which Ephum and Jackson carry downstairs and
place between the seats of the carriage.Ned had had the horses in it
since church time.It is three in the afternoon, and Jackson explains that,
with the load, they would not reach there until midnight, if at all.Yes; many of the first families live there,
and would take them in for the night.Equipages of all sorts are
passing,--private carriages and public, and corner-stand hacks.The
black drivers are cracking whips over galloping horses.Pedestrians are hurrying by with bundles under their arms, some running
east, and some west, and some stopping to discuss excitedly the chances
of each direction.From the river comes the hoarse whistle of the boats
breaking the Sabbath stillness there.Virginia leaned against the iron railing of the steps, watching the
scene, and waiting for Ned to return from Mr.Her face was
troubled, as well it might be.The most alarming reports were cried up
to her from the street, and she looked every moment for the black smoke
of destruction to appear to the southward.Around her were gathered the
Carvel servants, most of them crying, and imploring her not to leave
them.Colfax's trunk was brought down and placed in the
carriage where three of them might have ridden to safety, a groan of
despair and entreaty rose from the faithful group that went to her
heart."Miss Jinny, you ain't gwineter leave yo' ol mammy?""Hush, Mammy," she said."No, you shall all go, if I have to stay
myself.Ephum, go to the livery stable and get another carriage."She went up into her own deserted room to gather the few things she
would take with her--the little jewellery case with the necklace of
pearls which her great-grandmother had worn at her wedding.Rosetta and
Mammy Easter were of no use, and she had sent them downstairs again.With a flutter she opened her wardrobe door, to take one last look at
the gowns there.They were part of happier days
gone by.She fell down on her knees and opened the great drawer at the
bottom, and there on the top lay the dainty gown which had belonged
to Dorothy Manners.A tear fell upon one of the flowers of the stays.Irresistibly pressed into her mind the memory of Anne's fancy dress
ball,--of the episode by the gate, upon which she had thought so often
with burning face.The voices below grow louder, but she does not hear.She is folding the
gown hurriedly into a little package.It was her great-grandmother's;
her chief heirloom after the pearls.Silk and satin from Paris are
left behind.With one glance at the bed in which she had slept since
childhood, and at the picture over it which had been her mother's, she
hurries downstairs.And Dorothy Manners's gown is under her arm.On the
landing she stops to brush her eyes with her handkerchief.Ned simply pointed out a young man standing on the
steps behind the <DW64>s.Crimson stains were on Virginia's cheeks,
and the package she carried under her arm was like lead.The young
man, although he showed no signs of excitement, reddened too as he came
forward and took off his hat.But the sight of him had acurious effect
upon Virginia, of which she was at first unconscious.A sense of
security came upon her as she looked at his face and listened to his
voice.Brinsmade has gone to the hospital, Miss Carvel," he said.Brinsmade asked me to come here with your man in the hope that I might
persuade you to stay where you are.""Then the Germans are not moving on the city?"It was that smile that angered her,
that made her rebel against the advice he had to offer; that made her
forget the insult he had risked at her hands by coming there.For she
believed him utterly, without reservation.The moment he had spoken she
was convinced that the panic was a silly scare which would be food for
merriment in future years.And yet--was not that smile in derision of
herself--of her friends who were running away?Was it not an assumption
of Northern superiority, to be resented?"It is only a malicious rumor, Miss Carvel," he answered."You have
been told so upon good authority, I suppose," she said dryly.And at the
change in her tone she saw his face fall."I have not," he replied honestly, "but I will submit it to your own
judgment.Yesterday General Harney superseded Captain Lyon in command
in St.Some citizens of prominence begged the General to send the
troops away, to avoid further ill-feeling and perhaps--bloodshed."(They
both winced at the word.)"Colonel Blair represented to the General that
the troops could not be sent away, as they had been enlisted to serve
only in St.Louis; whereupon the General in his proclamation states that
he has no control over these Home Guards.That sentence has been twisted
by some rascal into a confession that the Home Guards are not to be
controlled.I can assure you, Miss Carvel," added Stephen, speaking
with a force which made her start and thrill, "I can assure you from a
personal knowledge of the German troops that they are not a riotous lot,
and that they are under perfect control.If they were not, there are
enough regulars in the city to repress them."And she was silent, forgetful of the hub-bub around her.It
was then that her aunt called out to her, with distressing shrillness,
from the carriage:-- "Jinny, Jinny, how can you stand there talking to
young men when our lives are in danger?"She glanced hurriedly at Stephen, who said gently; "I do not wish to
delay you, Miss Carvel, if you are bent upon going."His tone was not resentful, simply quiet.Ephum turned the
corner of the street, the perspiration running on his black face."Miss Jinny, dey ain't no carridges to be had in this town.This was the occasion for another groan from the <DW64>s, and they began
once more to beseech her not to leave them.In the midst of their cries
she heard her aunt calling from the carriage, where, beside the trunk,
there was just room for her to squeeze in."Jinny," cried that lady, frantically, "are you to go or stay?The
Hessians will be here at any moment.Oh, I cannot stay here to be
murdered!"Unconsciously the girl glanced again at Stephen.He had not gone, but
was still standing in the rain on the steps, the one figure of strength
and coolness she had seen this afternoon.Distracted, she blamed the
fate which had made this man an enemy.How willingly would she have
leaned upon such as he, and submitted to his guidance.Unluckily at
that moment came down the street a group which had been ludicrous on any
other day, and was, in truth, ludicrous to Stephen then.At the head
of it was a little gentleman with red mutton-chop whiskers, hatless, in
spite of the rain beginning to fall.His face was the very caricature of
terror.His clothes, usually neat, were awry, and his arms were full
of various things, not the least conspicuous of which was a magnificent
bronze clock.It was this object that caught Virginia's eye.But years
passed before she laughed over it.Cluyme (for it was he)
trotted his family.Cluyme, in a pink wrapper, carried an armful
of the family silver; then came Belle with certain articles of feminine
apparel which need not be enumerated, and the three small Cluymes of
various ages brought up the rear.Cluyme, at the top of his speed, was come opposite to the carriage
when the lady occupant got out of it.Clutching at his sleeve, she
demanded where he was going.His wife coming after
him had a narrower escape still.Colfax retained a handful of lace
from the wrapper, the owner of which emitted a shriek of fright."Virginia, I am going to the river," said Mrs."No, indeedy, Miss Lilly, I ain't a-gwine 'thout
young Miss.The Dutch kin cotch me an' hang me, but I ain't a-gwine
'thout Miss Jinny."Colfax drew her shawl about her shoulders with dignity."Ill as I am, I shall walk.Bear
witness that I have spent a precious hour trying to save you.If I live
to see your father again, I shall tell him that you preferred to stay
here and carry on disgracefully with a Yankee, that you let your own
aunt risk her life alone in the rain.She did not run down the steps, but she caught
her aunt by the arm ere that lady had taken six paces.The girl's face
frightened Mrs.Colfax into submission, and she let herself be led back
into the carriage beside the trunk.Colfax's stung
Stephen to righteous anger and resentment--for Virginia.As to himself, he had looked for insult.He turned to go that he might
not look upon her confusion; and hanging on the resolution, swung on his
heel again, his eyes blazeing.He saw in hers the deep blue light of
the skies after an evening's storm.She was calm, and save for a little
quiver of the voice, mistress of herself as she spoke to the group of
cowering servants."Mammy," she said, "get up on the box with Ned.And, Ned, walk the
horses to the levee, so that the rest may follow.Ephum, you stay here
with the house, and I will send Ned back to keep you company."With these words, clasping tightly the precious little bundle under her
arm, she stepped into the carriage.Heedless of the risk he ran, sheer
admiration sent Stephen to the carriage door."If I can be of any service, Miss Carvel," he said, "I shall be happy."And as the horses slipped and started she slammed the door in his face.Down on the levee wheels rattled over the white stones washed clean by
the driving rain.The drops pelted the chocolate water into froth, and a
blue veil hid the distant bluffs beyond the Illinois bottom-lands.Down
on the Levee rich and poor battled for places on the landing-stages, and
would have thrown themselves into the flood had there been no boats
to save them from the dreaded Dutch.Attila and his Huns were not
more feared.What might not its
Barbarians do when roused?The rich and poor struggled together; but
money was a power that day, and many were pitilessly turned off because
they did not have the high price to carry them--who knew where?Boats which screamed, and boats which had a dragon's roar were backing
out of the close ranks where they had stood wheel-house to wheel-house,
and were dodging and bumping in the channel.See, their guards are black
with people!Colfax, when they are come out of the narrow street
into the great open space, remarks this with alarm.All the boats will
be gone before they can get near one.She
is thinking of other things than the steamboats, and wondering whether
it had not been preferable to be killed by Hessians.Vance, is
a friend of the family.What a mighty contempt did Ned and his kind have
for foot passengers!Laying about him with his whip, and shouting at the
top of his voice to make himself heard, he sent the Colonel's Kentucky
bays through the crowd down to the Barbara's landing stage, the people
scampering to the right and left, and the Carvel servants, headed by
Uncle Ben, hanging on to the carriage springs, trailing behind.He will tell you to this day how
Mr.Catherwood's carriage was pocketed by drays and bales, and how Mrs.James's horses were seized by the bridles and turned back.Ned had a
head on his shoulders, and eyes in his head.He spied Captain Vance
himself on the stage, and bade Uncle Ben hold to the horses while he
shouldered his way to that gentleman.The result was that the Captain
came bowing to the carriage door, and offered his own cabin to the
ladies.But the <DW65>s---he would take no <DW65>s except a maid for
each; and he begged Mrs.Colfax's pardon--he could not carry her trunk.So Virginia chose Mammy Easter, whose red and yellow turban was awry
from fear lest she be left behind and Ned was instructed to drive the
rest with all haste to Bellegarde.Colfax his
arm, and Virginia his eyes.He escorted the ladies to quarters in the
texas, and presently was heard swearing prodigiously as the boat was
cast off.It was said of him that he could turn an oath better than any
man on the river, which was no mean reputation.Colfax was assisted to bed by Susan.Virginia stood by the little
window of the cabin, and as the Barbara paddled and floated down the
river she looked anxiously for signals of a conflagration.Nay, in that
hour she wished that the city might burn.So it is that the best of us
may at times desire misery to thousands that our own malice may be
fed.Virginia longed to see the yellow flame creep along the wet,
gray clouds.Passionate tears came to her eyes at the thought of the
humiliation she had suffered,--and before him, of all men.Could she
ever live with her aunt after what she had said?"Carrying on with that
Yankee!"Her anger, too, was still against Stephen.Once more he had been sent by
circumstances to mock her and her people.If the city would only burn,
that his cocksure judgment might for once be mistaken, his calmness for
once broken!The rain ceased, the clouds parted, and the sun turned the muddy river
to gold.The bluffs shone May-green in the western flood of light, and a
haze hung over the bottom-lands.Not a sound disturbed the quiet of
the city receding to the northward, and the rain had washed the pall
of smoke from over it.On the boat excited voices died down to natural
tones; men smoked on the guards and promenaded on the hurricane deck,
as if this were some pleasant excursion.Women waved to the other boats
flocking after.Colfax stirred in
her berth and began to talk.Virginia did not move

"Jinny!"In that hour she remembered that great good-natured man, her
mother's brother, and for his sake Colonel Carvel had put up with much
from his wife's sister in-law.She could pass over, but never forgive
what her aunt had said to her that afternoon.Colfax had often been
cruel before, and inconsiderate.But as the girl thought of the speech,
staring out on the waters, it suddenly occurred to her that no lady
would have uttered it.In all her life she had never realized till now
that her aunt was not a lady.From that time forth Virginia's attitude
toward her aunt was changed.She controlled herself, however, and answered something, and went out
listlessly to find the Captain and inquire the destination of the boat.At the foot of the companionway
leading to the saloon deck she saw, of all people, Mr.Eliphalet Hopper
leaning on the rail, and pensively expectorating on the roof of the
wheel-house.In another mood Virginia would have laughed, for at sight
of her he straightened convulsively, thrust his quid into his cheek, and
removed his hat with more zeal than the grudging deference he usually
accorded to the sex.Clearly Eliphalet would not have chosen the
situation."I cal'late we didn't get out any too soon, Miss Carvel," he remarked,
with a sad attempt at jocoseness."There won't be a great deal in that
town when the Dutch get through with it.""I think that there are enough men left in it to save it," said
Virginia.Hopper found no suitable answer to this, for he made
none.He continued to glance at her uneasily.There was an impudent
tribute in his look which she resented strongly."He's down below--ma'am," he replied."Yes," she said, with abrupt maliciousness, "you may tell me where you
are going.""I cal'late, up the Cumberland River.That's where she's bound for,
if she don't stop before she gets there Guess there ain't many of 'em
inquired where she was goin', or cared much," he added, with a ghastly
effort to be genial."I didn't see any use in gettin' murdered, when I couldn't do anything."He stared after her up the companionway, bit off a
generous piece of tobacco, and ruminated.If to be a genius is to
possess an infinite stock of patience, Mr.But it was not a pleasant smile to look upon.She had told her aunt the news, and stood
in the breeze on the hurricane deck looking southward, with her hand
shading her eyes.The 'Barbara Lane' happened to be a boat with a
record, and her name was often in the papers.She had already caught up
with and distanced others which had had half an hour's start of her, and
was near the head of the procession.Virginia presently became aware that people were gathering around her in
knots, gazing at a boat coming toward them.Others had been met which,
on learning the dread news, turned back.But this one kept her bow
steadily up the current, although she had passed within a biscuit-toss
of the leader of the line of refugees.It was then that Captain Vance's
hairy head appeared above the deck.he said, "if here ain't pig-headed Brent, steaming the
'Jewanita' straight to destruction.""Oh, are you sure it's Captain Brent?""If that there was Shreve's old Enterprise come to life again, I'd lay
cotton to sawdust that Brent had her.Danged if he wouldn't take her
right into the jaws of the Dutch."The Captain's words spread, and caused considerable excitement.On board
the Barbara Lane were many gentlemen who had begun to be shamefaced over
their panic, and these went in a body to the Captain and asked him to
communicate with the 'Juanita'.Whereupon a certain number of whistles
were sounded, and the Barbara's bows headed for the other side of the
channel.As the Juanita drew near, Virginia saw the square figure and clean,
smooth-shaven face of Captain Lige standing in front of his wheel-house
Peace crept back into her soul, and she tingled with joy as the bells
clanged and the bucket-planks churned, and the great New Orleans packet
crept slowly to the Barbara's side."You ain't goin' in, Brent?"At the sound of his voice Virginia could
have wept."The Dutch are sacking the city," said Vance.A general titter went along the guards, and Virginia blushed."I'm on my reg'lar trip, of course," said Vance.Out there on the sunlit
river the situation seemed to call for an apology."Seems to be a little more loaded than common," remarked Captain Lige,
dryly, at which there was another general laugh."If you're really goin' up," said Captain Vance, "I reckon there's a few
here would like to be massacred, if you'll take 'em."Brent; "I'm bound for the barbecue."While the two great boats were manoeuvring, and slashing with one wheel
and the other, the gongs sounding, Virginia ran into the cabin."Oh, Aunt Lillian," she exclaimed, "here is Captain Lige and the
Juanita, and he is going to take us back with him.It its unnecessary here to repeat the moral persuasion which Virginia
used to get her aunt up and dressed.That lady, when she had heard the
whistle and the gongs, had let her imagination loose.Turning her face
to the wall, she was in the act of repeating her prayers as her niece
entered.A big stevedore carried her down two decks to where the gang-plank
was thrown across.Captain Lige himself was at the other end.His face
lighted, Pushing the people aside, he rushed across, snatched the lady
from the <DW64>'s arms, crying:

"Jinny!The stevedore's
services were required for Mammy Easter.And behind the burly shield
thus formed, a stoutish gentleman slipped over, all unnoticed, with a
carpet-bag in his hand It bore the initials E. H.

The plank was drawn in.The great wheels began to turn and hiss, the
Barbara's passengers waved good-by to the foolhardy lunatics who had
elected to go back into the jaws of destruction.Colfax was put
into a cabin; and Virginia, in a glow, climbed with Captain Lige to the
hurricane deck.There they stood for a while in silence, watching the
broad stern of the Barbara growing smaller."Just to think," Miss Carvel
remarked, with a little hysterical sigh, "just to think that some of
those people brought bronze clocks instead of tooth-brushes.""And what did you bring, my girl?"asked the Captain, glancing at the
parcel she held so tightly under her arm.He never knew why she blushed so furiously.THE STRAINING OF ANOTHER FRIENDSHIP

Captain Lige asked but two questions: where was the Colonel, and was
it true that Clarence had refused to be paroled?Though not possessing
over-fine susceptibilities, the Captain knew a mud-drum from a lady's
watch, as he himself said.In his solicitude for Virginia, he saw that
she was in no state of mind to talk of the occurrences of the last few
days.So he helped her to climb the little stair that winds to the top
of the texas,--that sanctified roof where the pilot-house squats.The
girl clung to her bonnet Will you like her any the less when you know
that it was a shovel bonnet, with long red ribbons that tied under
her chin?"Captain Lige," she said, almost
tearfully, as she took his arm, "how I thank heaven that you came up the
river this afternoon!""Jinny," said the Captain, "did you ever know why cabins are called
staterooms?""Why, no," answered she, puzzled."There was an old fellow named Shreve who ran steamboats before Jackson
fought the redcoats at New Orleans.In Shreve's time the cabins were
curtained off, just like these new-fangled sleeping-car berths.The old
man built wooden rooms, and he named them after the different states,
Kentuck, and Illinois, and Pennsylvania.So that when a fellow came
aboard he'd say: 'What state am I in, Cap?'And from this river has the
name spread all over the world--stateroom.That's mighty interesting,"
said Captain Lige."Yea," said Virginia; "why didn't you tell me long ago.""And I'll bet you can't say," the Captain continued, "why this house
we're standing on is called the texas.""Because it is annexed to the states," she replied, quick a flash."Well, you're bright," said he."Old Tufts got that notion, when Texas
came in.Bill Jenks was Captain Brent's senior pilot.His skin hung on his face
in folds, like that of a rhinoceros It was very much the same color.His
grizzled hair was all lengths, like a worn-out mop; his hand reminded
one of an eagle's claw, and his teeth were a pine yellow.He greeted
only such people as he deemed worthy of notice, but he had held Virginia
in his arms."William," said the young lady, roguishly, "how is the eye, location,
and memory?"When this happened it was put in
the Juanita's log."So the Cap'n be still harpin' on that?"he said, "Miss Jinny, he's just
plumb crazy on a pilot's qualifications.""He says that you are the best pilot on the river, but I don't believe
it," said Virginia.He made a place for her on the leather-padded
seat at the back of the pilot house, where for a long time she sat
staring at the flag trembling on the jackstaff between the great sombre
pipes.The sun fell down, but his light lingered in the air above as the
big boat forged abreast the foreign city of South St.There
was the arsenal--grim despite its dress of green, where Clarence was
confined alone.Captain Lige came in from his duties below."Well, Jinny, we'll soon be
at home," he said."We've made a quick trip against the rains.""And--and do you think the city is safe?""Jinny, would
you like to blow the whistle?""I should just love to," said Virginia.Jenks's
directions she put her toe on the tread, and shrank back when the
monster responded with a snort and a roar.River men along the levee
heard that signal and laughed.The joke was certainly not on sturdy
Elijah Brent.An hour later, Virginia and her aunt and the Captain, followed by Mammy
aster and Rosetta and Susan, were walking through the streets of the
stillest city in the Union.All that they met was a provost's guard, for
St.Once in a while they saw the light of
some contemptuous citizen of the residence district who had stayed to
laugh.Out in the suburbs, at the country houses of the first families,
people of distinction slept five and six in a room--many with only a
quilt between body and matting.Little wonder that these dreamed of
Hessians and destruction.In town they slept with their doors open,
those who remained and had faith.Martial law means passes and
explanations, and walking generally in the light of day.Martial law
means that the Commander-in-chief, if he be an artist in well doing,
may use his boot freely on politicians bland or beetle-browed.No police
force ever gave the sense of security inspired by a provost's guard.Captain Lige sat on the steps of Colonel Carvel's house that night, long
after the ladies were gone to bed.The only sounds breaking the silence
of the city were the beat of the feet of the marching squads and the
call of the corporal's relief.But the Captain smoked in agony until the
clouds of two days slipped away from under the stars, for he was trying
to decide a Question.Then he went up to a room in the house which had
been known as his since the rafters were put down on that floor.The next morning, as the Captain and Virginia sit at breakfast together
with only Mammy Easter to cook and Rosetta to wait on them, the Colonel
bursts in.He is dusty and travel-stained from his night on the train,
but his gray eyes light with affection as he sees his friend beside his
daughter."Jinny," he cries as he kisses her, "Jinny, I'm proud oil you, my girl!You didn't let the Yankees frighten you--But where is Jackson?"And so the whole miserable tale has to be told over again, between
laughter and tears on Virginia's part, and laughter and strong language
on Colonel Carvel's.What--blessing that Lige met them, else the
Colonel might now be starting for the Cumberland River in search of his
daughter.The Captain does not take much part in the conversation, and
he refuses the cigar which is offered him."Lige," he says, "this is the first time to my knowledge.""I smoked too many last night," says the Captain.The Colonel sat down,
with his feet against the mantel, too full of affairs to take much
notice of Mr."The Yanks have taken the first trick--that's sure," he said."But I
think we'll laugh last, Jinny.The
state has got more militia, or will have more militia in a day or
two.We won't miss the thousand they stole in Camp Jackson.And I've got a few commissions right here," and he
tapped his pocket."Pa," said Virginia, "did you volunteer?""The Governor wouldn't have me," he answered."He said I was more good
here in St.The Colonel listened with
many exclamations, slapping his knee from time to time as she proceeded.he cried, when she had finished, "the boy has it in him, after
all!They can't hold him a day--can they, Lige?"(No answer from the
Captain, who is eating his breakfast in silence.)"All that we have to
do is to go for Worington and get a habeas corpus from the United States
District Court.The Captain got up excitedly, his face
purple."I reckon you'll have to excuse me, Colonel," he said."There's a cargo
on my boat which has got to come off."And without more ado he left the
room.In consternation they heard the front door close behind him.And
yet, neither father nor daughter dared in that hour add to the trial
of the other by speaking out the dread that was in their hearts.The
Colonel smoked for a while, not a word escaping him, and then he patted
Virginia's cheek."I reckon I'll run over and see Russell, Jinny," he said, striving to
be cheerful.He stopped
abruptly in the hall and pressed his hand to his forehead."My God," he
whispered to himself, "if I could only go to Silas!"Colfax's lawyer, of whose politics it is not necessary to speak.There
was plenty of excitement around the Government building where his Honor
issued the writ.There lacked not gentlemen of influence who went with
Mr.Russell and Colonel Carvel and the lawyer and the Commissioner to
the Arsenal.They were admitted to the presence of the indomitable Lyon,
who informed them that Captain Colfax was a prisoner of war, and, since
the arsenal was Government property, not in the state.The Commissioner
thereupon attested the affidavit to Colonel Carvel, and thus the
application for the writ was made legal.These things the Colonel reported to Virginia; and to Mrs.Colfax, who
received them with red eyes and a thousand queries as to whether that
Yankee ruffian would pay any attention to the Sovereign law which he
pretended to uphold; whether the Marshal would not be cast over the
Arsenal wall by the slack of his raiment when he went to serve the writ.This was not the language, but the purport, of the lady's questions.Colonel Carvel had made but a light breakfast: he had had no dinner,
and little rest on the train.But he answered his sister-in-law with
unfailing courtesy.He was too honest to express a hope which he did not
feel.He had returned that evening to a dreary household.During the
day the servants had straggled in from Bellegarde, and Virginia had had
prepared those dishes which her father loved.Colfax chose to keep
her room, for which the two were silently thankful.The Colonel was humming a tune as he went down the stairs, but
Virginia was not deceived.He would not see the yearning in her eyes as
he took his chair; he would not glance at Captain Lige's empty seat.She caught her breath when she saw that the
food on his plate lay untouched.He pushed his chair away, such suffering in his look as she had never
seen."Jinny," he said, "I reckon Lige is for the Yankees.""I have known it all along," she said, but faintly."My God," cried the Colonel, in agony, "to think that he kept it from me
I to think that Lige kept it from me!""It is because he loves you, Pa," answered the girl, gently, "it is
because he loves us."Virginia got up, and went softly around the
table."Yes," he said, his voice lifeless.But her courage was not to be lightly shaken."Pa, will you forbid him
to come here--now?"A long while she waited for his answer, while the big clock ticked out
the slow seconds in the hall, and her heart beat wildly."As long as I have a roof, Lige may come under
it."She did not ask him where he was
going, but ordered Jackson to keep the supper warm, and went into the
drawing-room.The lights were out, then, but the great piano that was
her mother's lay open.That wondrous
hymn which Judge Whipple loved, which for years has been the comfort
of those in distress, floated softly with the night air out of the
open window.Colonel Carvel heard it, and
paused.He did not stop again until he reached the narrow street at the top
of the levee bank, where the quaint stone houses of the old French
residents were being loaded with wares.He took a few steps back-up the
hill.Then he wheeled about, walked swiftly down the levee, and on to
the landing-stage beside which the big 'Juanita' loomed in the night.On
her bows was set, fantastically, a yellow street-car.Its unexpected appearance there had
served to break the current of his meditations.He stood staring at it,
while the roustabouts passed and repassed, noisily carrying great logs
of wood on shoulders padded by their woollen caps."That'll be the first street-car used in the city of New Orleans, if it
ever gets there, Colonel.""Reckon I'll have to stay here and boss the cargo all night.Want to
get in as many trips as I can before--navigation closes," the Captain
concluded significantly."You were never too busy to come for
supper, Lige.Captain Lige shot at him a swift look."Come over here on the levee," said the Colonel, sternly.They walked
out together, and for some distance in silence."Lige," said the elder gentleman, striking his stick on the stones, "if
there ever was a straight goer, that's you.You've always dealt squarely
with me, and now I'm going to ask you a plain question."I'm North, I reckon," answered the Captain, bluntly.It was a long time before he spoke again.The Captain waited
like a man who expects and deserve, the severest verdict."And you wouldn't tell me, Lige?"My God, Colonel," exclaimed the other, passionately, "how could I?I
owe what I have to your charity.But for you and--and Jinny I should
have gone to the devil.If you and she are taken away, what have I left
in life?I was a coward, sir, not to tell you.And yet,--God help me,--I can't stand by and see the nation go to
pieces.Your fathers fought that
we Americans might inherit the earth--" He stopped abruptly.Then he
continued haltingly, "Colonel, I know you're a man of strong feelings
and convictions.All I ask is that you and Jinny will think of me as a
friend--"

He choked, and turned away, not heeding the direction of his feet.The
Colonel, his stick raised, stood looking after him.He was folded in the
near darkness before he called his name.He came back, wondering, across the rough stones until he stood beside
the tall figure.Below them, the lights glided along the dark water."Lige, didn't I raise you?Haven't I taught you that my house was your
home?But--but never speak to me again of this night!Not a word passed between them as they went up the quiet street.At the
sound of their feet in the entry the door was flung open, and Virginia,
with her hands out stretched, stood under the hall light."Oh, Pa, I knew you would bring him back," she said.OF CLARENCE

Captain Clarence Colfax, late of the State Dragoons, awoke on Sunday
morning the chief of the many topics of the conversation of a big city.His conduct drew forth enthusiastic praise from the gentlemen and ladies
who had thronged Beauregard and Davis avenues, and honest admiration
from the party which had broken up the camp.There were many doting parents, like Mr.Catherwood, whose boys had
accepted the parole, whose praise was a trifle lukewarm, to be sure.But popular opinion, when once aroused, will draw a grunt from the most
grudging.We are not permitted, alas, to go behind these stern walls and discover
how Captain Colfax passed that eventful Sunday of the Exodus.We know
that, in his loneliness, he hoped for a visit from his cousin, and took
to pacing his room in the afternoon, when a smarting sense of injustice
crept upon him.And how was he to guess, as he
looked out in astonishment upon the frightened flock of white boats
swimming southward, that his mother and his sweetheart were there?On Monday, while the Colonel and many prominent citizens were busying
themselves about procuring the legal writ which was at once to release
Mr.Colfax, and so cleanse the whole body of Camp Jackson's defenders
from any, veiled intentions toward the Government, many well known
carriages drew up before the Carvel House in Locust Street to
congratulate the widow and the Colonel upon the possession of such a
son and nephew.There were some who slyly congratulated Virginia, whose
martyrdom it was to sit up with people all the day long.Colfax
kept her room, and admitted only a few of her bosom friends to cry with
her.When the last of the callers was gone, Virginia was admitted to her
aunt's presence."Aunt Lillian, to-morrow morning Pa and I are going to the Arsenal with
a basket for Max.Pa seems to think there is a chance that he may come
back with us.The lady smiled wearily at the proposal, and raised her hands in
protest, the lace on the sleeves of her dressing gown falling away from
her white arms.she exclaimed, "when I can't walk to my bureau after that
terrible Sunday.No," she added, with conviction,
"I never again expect to see him alive.Comyn says they may release him,
does he?The girl went away, not in anger or impatience, but in sadness.Brought
up to reverence her elders, she had ignored the shallowness of her
aunt's character in happier days.Colfax's conduct carried
a prophecy with it.Virginia sat down on the landing to ponder on the
years to come,--on the pain they were likely to bring with them from
this source--Clarence gone to the war; her father gone (for she felt
that he would go in the end), Virginia foresaw the lonely days of trial
in company with this vain woman whom accident made her cousin's mother.Ay, and more, fate had made her the mother of the man she was to marry.The girl could scarcely bear the thought--through the hurry and swing of
the events of two days she had kept it from her mind.To-morrow he would be coming home
to her joyfully for his reward, and she did not love him.She was bound
to face that again and again.She had cheated herself again and again
with other feelings.She had set up intense love of country in the
shrine where it did not belong, and it had answered--for a while.She
saw Clarence in a hero's light--until a fatal intimate knowledge made
her shudder and draw back.Captain Lige's cheery voice roused her from below--and her father's
laugh.And as she went down to them she thanked God that this friend had
been spared to him.Never had the Captain's river yarns been better told
than at the table that evening.Virginia did not see him glance at the
Colonel when at last he had brought a smile to her face."I'm going to leave Jinny with you, Lige," said Mr."Worington has some notion that the Marshal may go to the Arsenal
to-night with the writ.she pleaded

The Colonel was taken aback.He stood looking down at her, stroking his
goatee, and marvelling at the ways of woman."The horses have been out all day, Jinny," he said, "I am going in the
cars.""I can go in the cars, too.""There is only a chance that we shall see Clarence," he went on,
uneasily."It is better than sitting still," cried Virginia, as she ran away to
get the bonnet with the red strings."Lige,--" said the Colonel, as the two stood awaiting her in the hall,
"I can't make her out.It was a long journey, in a bumping car with had springs that rattled
unceasingly, past the string of provost guards.The Colonel sat in the
corner, with his head bent down over his stick At length, cramped and
weary, they got out, and made their way along the Arsenal wall, past the
sentries to the entrance.The sergeant brought his rifle to a "port".Carver

"Captain Colfax was taken to Illinois in a skiff, quarter of an hour
since."Captain Lige gave vent to a long, low whistle.he exclaimed, "and the river this high!Before he could answer came the noise of steps from the direction of
the river, and a number of people hurried up excitedly.Worington, the lawyer, and caught him by the sleeve.Worington glanced at the sentry, and pulled the Colonel past the
entrance and into the street."They have started across with him in a light skiff----four men and a
captain.And a lot of us, who suspected
what they were up to, were standing around.When we saw 'em come down,
we made a rush and had the guard overpowered But Colfax called out to
stand back.""Cuss me if I understand him," said Mr."He told us to
disperse, and that he proposed to remain a prisoner and go where they
sent him."Then--"Move on please, gentlemen," said the sentry,
and they started to walk toward the car line, the lawyer and the Colonel
together.Virginia put her hand through the Captain's arm.In the
darkness he laid his big one over it."Don't you be frightened, Jinny, at what I said, I reckon they'll fetch
up in Illinois all right, if I know Lyon.There, there," said Captain
Lige, soothingly.She had endured more in
the past few days than often falls to the lot of one-and-twenty.He thought of the
many, many times he had taken her on his knee and kissed her tears.He
might do that no more, now.There was the young Captain, a prisoner on
the great black river, who had a better right, Elijah Brent wondered, as
they waited in the silent street for the lonely car, if Clarence loved
her as well as he.It was vary late when they reached home, and Virginia went silently up
to her room.Colonel Carvel stared grimly after her, then glanced at his
friend as he turned down the lights.The eyes of the two met, as of old,
in true understanding.The sun was still slanting over the tops of the houses the next morning
when Virginia, a ghostly figure, crept down the stairs and withdrew
the lock and bolt on the front door.The street was still, save for
the twittering of birds and the distant rumble of a cart in its early
rounds.The chill air of the morning made her shiver as she scanned the
entry for the newspaper.Dismayed, she turned to the clock in the hall.She sat long behind the curtains in her father's little library, the
thoughts whirling in her brain as she watched the growing life of
another day.Once she stole softly back to
the entry, self-indulgent and ashamed, to rehearse again the bitter and
the sweet of that scene of the Sunday before.She summoned up the image
of the young man who had stood on these steps in front of the frightened
servants.She seemed to feel again the calm power and earnestness of his
face, to hear again the clear-cut tones of his voice as he advised
her.Then she drew back, frightened, into the sombre library,
conscience-stricken that she should have yielded to this temptation
then, when Clarence--She dared not follow the thought, but she saw the
light skiff at the mercy of the angry river and the dark night.If he were spared, she prayed for strength to
consecrate herself to him A book lay on the table, and Virginia took
refuge in it.And her eyes glancing over the pages, rested on this
verse:--

       "Thy voice is heard thro' rolling drums,
        That beat to battle where he stands;
        Thy face across his fancy comes,
        And gives the battle to his hands."The paper brought no news, nor mentioned the ruse to which Captain Lyon
had resorted to elude the writ by transporting his prisoner to Illinois.Newspapers were not as alert then as now.Colonel Carvel was off early
to the Arsenal in search of tidings.He would not hear of Virginia's
going with him.Captain Lige, with a surer instinct, went to the river.Twice Virginia was summoned to her aunt, and
twice she made excuse.It was the Captain who returned first, and she
met him at the door."He is alive," said the Captain, tremulously, "alive and well, and
escaped South."She took a step toward him, and swayed.For a
brief instant he held her in his arms and then he led her to the great
armchair that was the Colonel's."Lige," she said, "--are you sure that this is not--a kindness?""No, Jinny," he answered quickly, "but things were mighty close.They struck out straight
across, but they drifted and drifted like log-wood.And then she began
to fill, and all five of 'em to bail.The
five soldiers came up on that bit of an island below the Arsenal.They
hunted all night, but they didn't find Clarence.And they got taken off
to the Arsenal this morning.""I knew that much this morning," he continued, "and so did your pa.But
the Andrew Jackson is just in from Memphis, and the Captain tells me
that he spoke the Memphis packet off Cape Girardeau, and that Clarence
was aboard.She picked him up by a miracle, after he had just missed a
round trip through her wheel-house."CHAPTER I. INTRODUCING A CAPITALIST

A cordon of blue regiments surrounded the city at first from Carondelet
to North St.The crowds liked best to go to
Compton Heights, where the tents of the German citizen-soldiers were
spread out like so many slices of white cake on the green beside the
city's reservoir.Thence the eye stretched across the town, catching the
dome of the Court House and the spire of St.Away to the west,
on the line of the Pacific railroad that led halfway across the state,
was another camp.Then another, and another, on the circle of the fan,
until the river was reached to the northward, far above the bend.Within
was a peace that passed understanding,--the peace of martial law.Without the city, in the great state beyond, an irate governor had
gathered his forces from the east and from the west.Letters came and
went between Jefferson City and Jefferson Davis, their purport being
that the Governor was to work out his own salvation, for a while
at least.Louis, struck in a night by the fever of
militarism, arose and went to Glencoe.Prying sergeants and commissioned
officers, mostly of hated German extraction, thundered at the door
of Colonel Carvel's house, and other houses, there--for Glencoe was
a border town.They searched the place more than once from garret to
cellar, muttered guttural oaths, and smelled of beer and sauerkraut, The
haughty appearance of Miss Carvel did not awe them--they were blind
to all manly sensations.The Colonel's house, alas, was one of many in
Glencoe written down in red ink in a book at headquarters as a place
toward which the feet of the young men strayed.Good evidence was
handed in time and time again that the young men had come and gone, and
red-faced commanding officers cursed indignant subalterns, and implied
that Beauty had had a hand in it.Councils of war were held over the
advisability of seizing Mr.Carvel's house at Glencoe, but proof was
lacking until one rainy night in June a captain and ten men spurred up
the drive and swung into a big circle around the house.The Captain
took off his cavalry gauntlet and knocked at the door, more gently than
usual.The Captain was given an
audience more formal than one with the queen of Prussia could have been,
Miss Carvel was infinitely more haughty than her Majesty.Was not the
Captain hired to do a degrading service?Indeed, he thought so as he
followed her about the house and he felt like the lowest of criminals
as he opened a closet door or looked under a bed.He was a beast of the
field, of the mire.How Virginia shrank from him if he had occasion to
pass her!Her gown would have been defiled by his touch.And yet the
Captain did not smell of beer, nor of sauerkraut; nor did he swear in
any language.He did his duty apologetically, but he did it.He pulled
a man (aged seventeen) out from under a great hoop skirt in a little
closet, and the man had a pistol that refused its duty when snapped in
the Captain's face.This was little Spencer Catherwood, just home from a
military academy.Spencer was taken through the rain by the chagrined Captain to the
headquarters, where he caused a little embarrassment.No damning
evidence was discovered on his person, for the pistol had long since
ceased to be a firearm.And so after a stiff lecture from the Colonel
he was finally given back into the custody of his father.Despite the
pickets, the young men filtered through daily,--or rather nightly.Presently some of them began to come back, gaunt and worn and tattered,
among the grim cargoes that were landed by the thousands and tens of
thousands on the levee.And they took them (oh, the pity of it!)Lynch's slave pen, turned into a Union prison of
detention, where their fathers and grandfathers had been wont to send
their disorderly and insubordinate <DW65>s.They were packed away, as
the miserable slaves had been, to taste something of the bitterness
of the <DW64>'s lot.So came Bert Russell to welter in a low room whose
walls gave out the stench of years.How you cooked for them, and schemed
for them, and cried for them, you devoted women of the South!You spent
the long hot summer in town, and every day you went with your baskets
to Gratiot Street, where the infected old house stands, until--until one
morning a lady walked out past the guard, and down the street.She was
civilly detained at the corner, because she wore army boots.If you were a young lady of the proper principles
in those days, you climbed a steep pair of stairs in the heat, and stood
in line until it became your turn to be catechised by an indifferent
young officer in blue who sat behind a table and smoked a horrid cigar.He had little time to be courteous.He was not to be dazzled by a bright
gown or a pretty face; he was indifferent to a smile which would have
won a savage.His duty was to look down into your heart, and extract
therefrom the nefarious scheme you had made to set free the man you
loved ere he could be sent north to Alton or Columbus.My dear, you
wish to rescue him, to disguise him, send him south by way of Colonel
Carvel's house at Glencoe.At least, he will
have died for the South.First politics, and then war, and then more politics, in this our
country.Your masterful politician obtains a regiment, and goes to war,
sword in hand.He fights well, but he is still the politician.It
was not a case merely of fighting for the Union, but first of getting
permission to fight.Camp Jackson taken, and the prisoners exchanged
south, Captain Lyon; who moved like a whirlwind, who loved the Union
beyond his own life, was thrust down again.A mutual agreement was
entered into between the Governor and the old Indian fighter in command
of the Western Department, to respect each other.How Lyon chafed, and paced the Arsenal walks while he might have
saved the state.Then two gentlemen went to Washington, and the next
thing that happened was Brigadier General Lyon, Commander of the
Department of the West.Would General Lyon confer with the Governor of Missouri?Yes, the
General would give the Governor a safe-conduct into St.Louis, but
his Excellency must come to the General.His Excellency came, and the
General deigned to go with the Union leader to the Planters House.Conference, five hours; result, a safe-conduct for the Governor back.And this is how General Lyon ended the talk.His words, generously
preserved by a Confederate colonel who accompanied his Excellency,
deserve to be writ in gold on the National Annals."Rather than concede to the state of Missouri the right to demand that
my Government shall not enlist troops within her limits, or bring troops
into the state whenever it pleases; or move its troops at its own will
into, out of, or through, the state; rather than concede to the state of
Missouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my Government in
any matter, however unimportant, I would" (rising and pointing in turn
to every one in the room) "see you, and you, and you, and you, and every
man, woman, and child in this state, dead and buried."Then, turning
to the Governor, he continued, "This means war.In an hour one of my
officers will call for you and conduct you out of my lines."And thus, without another word, without an inclination of the head, he
turned upon his heel and strode out of the room, rattling his spurs and
clanking his sabre.In less than two months that indomitable leader was
lying dead beside Wilson's Creek, among the oaks on Bloody Hill.What he
would have been to this Union, had God spared him, we shall never know.He saved Missouri, and won respect and love from the brave men who
fought against him.What prayers rose to heaven,
and curses sank to hell, when the news of them came to the city by
the river!Flags were made by loving fingers, and shirts and bandages.Trembling young ladies of Union sympathies presented colors to regiments
on the Arsenal Green, or at Jefferson Barracks, or at Camp Benton to the
northwest near the Fair Grounds.And then the regiments marched through
the streets with bands playing that march to which the words of the
Battle Hymn were set, and those bright ensigns snapping at the front;
bright now, and new, and crimson.But soon to be stained a darker red,
and rent into tatters, and finally brought back and talked over and
cried over, and tenderly laid above an inscription in a glass case, to
be revered by generations of Americans to confer What can stir the
soul more than the sight of those old flags, standing in ranks like
the veterans they are, whose duty has been nobly done?The blood of the
color-sergeant is there, black now with age.But where are the tears of
the sad women who stitched the red and the white and the blue together?The regiments marched through the streets and aboard the boats, and
pushed off before a levee of waving handkerchiefs and nags.Later--much later, black headlines, and grim
lists three columns long,--three columns of a blanket sheet!"The City
of Alton has arrived with the following Union dead and wounded, and
the following Confederate wounded (prisoners)."In a never-ceasing procession they steamed up the river; those calm
boats which had been wont to carry the white cargoes of Commerce now
bearing the red cargoes of war.And they bore away to new battlefields
thousands of fresh-faced boys from Wisconsin and Michigan and Minnesota,
gathered at Camp Benton.Some came back with their color gone and their
red cheeks sallow and bearded and sunken.Stephen Brice, with a pain over his heart and a lump in his throat,
walked on the pavement beside his old company, but his look avoided
their faces.He wrung Richter's hand on the landing-stage.The good German's eyes were filled as he said good-by."You will come, too, my friend, when the country needs you," he said."Now" (and he shrugged his shoulders), "now have we many with no cares
to go.I have not even a father--" And he turned to Judge Whipple, who
was standing by, holding out a bony hand."God bless you, Carl," said the Judge And Carl could scarce believe his
ears.He got aboard the boat, her decks already blue with troops, and as
she backed out with her whistle screaming, the last objects he saw were
the gaunt old man and the broad-shouldered young man side by side on the
edge of the landing.Stephen's chest heaved, and as he walked back to the office with the
Judge, he could not trust himself to speak.Back to the silent office
where the shelves mocked them.The Judge closed the ground-glass door
behind him, and Stephen sat until five o'clock over a book.No, it was
not Whittlesey, but Hardee's "Tactics."He shut it with a slam, and went
to Verandah Hall to drill recruits on a dusty floor,--narrow-chested
citizens in suspenders, who knew not the first motion in right about
face.For Stephen was an adjutant in the Home Guards--what was left of
them.One we know of regarded the going of the troops and the coming of the
wounded with an equanimity truly philosophical.When the regiments
passed Carvel & Company on their way riverward to embark, Mr.Hopper did
not often take the trouble to rise from his chair, nor was he ever known
to go to the door to bid them Godspeed.This was all very well, because
they were Union regiments.Hopper did not contribute a horse,
nor even a saddle-blanket, to the young men who went away secretly in
the night, without fathers or mothers or sisters to wave at them.One scorching afternoon in July Colonel Carvel came into the office,
too hurried to remark the pain in honest Ephum's face as he watched his
master.The sure signs of a harassed man were on the Colonel.Since May
he had neglected his business affairs for others which he deemed public,
and which were so mysterious that even Mr.Hopper could not get wind
of them.These matters had taken the Colonel out of town.But now the
necessity of a pass made that awkward, and he went no farther than
Glencoe, where he spent an occasional Sunday.Hopper rose from
his chair when Mr.Carvel entered,--a most unprecedented action.Sitting down at his desk, he drummed upon it
uneasily.Eliphalet crossed the room quickly, and something that was very near a
smile was on his face.Carvel's chair with
a semi-confidential air,--one wholly new, had the Colonel given it a
thought.He did not, but began to finger some printed slips of paper
which had indorsements on their backs.His fine lips were tightly
closed, as if in pain.Hopper," he said, "these Eastern notes are due this week, are they
not?""There is no use mincing matters, Hopper.You know as well as I that
there is no money to pay them," said he, with a certain pompous attempt
at severity which characterized his kind nature.You have brought this business up to a modern footing, and made
it as prosperous as any in the town.I am sorry, sir, that those
contemptible Yankees should have forced us to the use of arms, and cut
short many promising business careers such as yours, sir.And the good gentleman looked
out of the window.He was thinking of a day, before the Mexican War,
when his young wife had sat in the very chair filled by Mr."These notes cannot be met," he repeated, and his voice was near to
breaking.The flies droning in the hot office made the only sound.Outside the
partition, among the bales, was silence.Hopper, with a remarkable ease, "I cal'late these
notes can be met."The Colonel jumped as if he had heard a shot, and one of the notes fell
to the floor.Eliphalet picked it up tenderly, and held it."There isn't a bank in town
that will lend me money.I--I haven't a friend--a friend I may ask who
can spare it, sir."Suavity was come upon
it like a new glove and changed the man.Now
he had poise, such poise as we in these days are accustomed to see in
leather and mahogany offices."I will take up those notes myself, sir."cried the Colonel, incredulously, "You?"There was not a deal of hypocrisy in his
nature, and now he did not attempt the part of Samaritan.He did not
beam upon the Colonel and remind him of the day on which, homeless and
friendless, he had been frightened into his store by a drove of mules.But his day,--the day toward which he had striven unknown and
unnoticed for so many years--the day when he would laugh at the pride of
those who had ignored and insulted him, was dawning at last.When we
are thoughtless of our words, we do not reckon with that spark in little
bosoms that may burst into flame and burn us.Not that Colonel Carvel
had ever been aught but courteous and kind to all.His station in life
had been his offence to Eliphalet, who strove now to hide an exultation
that made him tremble."I cal'late that I can gather together enough to meet the notes,
Colonel.Here followed an interval
of sheer astonishment to Mr."And you will take my note for the amount?"The Colonel pulled his goatee, and sat back in his chair, trying to face
the new light in which he saw his manager.He knew well enough that the
man was not doing this out of charity, or even gratitude.He reviewed
his whole career, from that first morning when he had carried bales to
the shipping room, to his replacement of Mr.Hood, and there was nothing
with which to accuse him.He remembered the warnings of Captain Lige
and Virginia.He could not in honor ask a cent from the Captain now.He
would not ask his sister-in-law, Mrs.Colfax, to let him touch the money
he had so ably invested for her; that little which Virginia's mother had
left the girl was sacred.Carvel had lain awake with the agony of those
Eastern debts.Not to pay was to tarnish the name of a Southern
gentleman.His house would bring nothing
in these times.He rose and began to pace the floor, tugging at his
chin.Hopper, who sat calmly on, and the
third time stopped abruptly before him."Where the devil did you get this money, sir?""I haven't been extravagant, Colonel, since I've worked for you,"
he said."It don't cost me much to live.The furrows in the Colonel's brow deepened."You offer to lend me five times more than I have ever paid you, Mr.Tell me how you have made this money before I accept it."Eliphalet had never been able to meet that eye since he had known it.But he went to his desk, and drew a long sheet of
paper from a pigeonhole."These be some of my investments," he answered, with just a tinge of
surliness."I cal'late they'll stand inspection.I ain't forcing you to
take the money, sir," he flared up, all at once."I'd like to save the
business."He went unsteadily to his desk, and none save
God knew the shock that his pride received that day.To rescue a name
which had stood untarnished since he had brought it into the world, he
drew forth some blank notes, and filled them out.But before he signed
them he spoke:

"You are a business man, Mr.Hopper," said he, "And as a business man
you must know that these notes will not legally hold.The courts are abolished, and all transactions here in St."One moment, sir," cried the Colonel, standing up and towering to his
full height."Law or no law, you shall have the money and interest, or
your security, which is this business.I need not tell you, sir, that my
word is sacred, and binding forever upon me and mine.""I'm not afraid, Colonel," answered Mr.Hopper, with a feeble attempt at
geniality.He was, in truth, awed at last."If you
were--this instant you should leave this place."He sat down, and
continued more calmly: "It will not be long before a Southern Army
marches into St."Do you reckon we can hold the business together until then,
Mr.God forbid that we should smile at the Colonel's simple faith.And if
Eliphalet Hopper had done so, his history would have ended here."Leave that to me, Colonel," he said soberly.The good Colonel sighed as he signed, away that
business which had been an honor to the city where it was founded, I
thank heaven that we are not concerned with the details of their talk
that day.Why should we wish to know the rate of interest on those
notes, or the time?Hopper filled out his check, and presently departed.It was the
signal for the little force which remained to leave.Outside, in the
store; Ephum paced uneasily, wondering why his master did not come out.Presently he crept to the door of the office, pushed it open, and beheld
Mr.Carvel with his head bowed, down in his hands."Marse Comyn, you know what I done promise young MISS long time ago,
befo'--befo' she done left us?"He saw the faithful old <DW64> but dimly.Faintly he heard the pleading
voice."Marse Comyn, won' you give Ephum a pass down, river, ter fotch Cap'n
Lige?""Ephum," said the Colonel, sadly, "I had a letter from the Captain
yesterday.His boat is a Federal transport, and he is in
Yankee pay."Ephum took a step forward, appealingly, "But de Cap'n's yo' friend,
Marse Comyn.He ain't never fo'get what you done fo' him, Marse Comyn.He ain't in de army, suh.""And I am the Captain's friend, Ephum," answered the Colonel, quietly."But I will not ask aid from any man employed by the Yankee Government.No--not from my own brother, who is in a Pennsylvania regiments."Ephum shuffled out, and his heart was lead as he closed the store that
night.Hopper has boarded a Fifth Street car, which jangles on with many
halts until it comes to Bremen, a German settlement in the north of the
city.At Bremen great droves of mules fill the street, and crowd the
entrances of the sale stables there.Whips are cracking like pistol
shots, Gentlemen with the yellow cavalry stripe of the United States
Army are pushing to and fro among the drivers and the owners, and
fingering the frightened animals.A herd breaks from the confusion
and is driven like a whirlwind down the street, dividing at the Market
House.They are going to board the Government transport--to die on the
battlefields of Kentucky and Missouri.Hopper alights from the car with complacency.He stands for a
while on a corner, against the hot building, surveying the busy scene,
unnoticed.Was it not a prophecy,--that drove which sent him into
Mr.Presently a man with a gnawed yellow mustache and a shifty eye walks out
of one of the offices, and perceives our friend.Eliphalet extends a hand to be squeezed and returned."Wal, I jest reckon," is the answer: The fellow was interrupted by the
appearance of a smart young man in a smart uniform, who wore an air of
genteel importance.He could not have been more than two and twenty, and
his face and manners were those of a clerk.The tan of field service was
lacking on his cheek, and he was black under the eyes."Hullo, Ford," he said, jocularly."Howdy, Cap," retorted the other."Wal, suh, that last lot was an extry,
fo' sure.Gov'ment
ain't cheated much on them there at one-eighty a head, I reckon."Ford said this with such an air of conviction and such a sober face
that the Captain smiled.And at the same time he glanced down nervously
at the new line of buttons on his chest."I guess I know a mule from a Newfoundland dog by this time," said he."Wal, I jest reckon," asserted Mr."Cap'n
Wentworth, allow me to make you acquainted with Mr.Hopper,
Cap'n Wentworth.""You interested in
mules, Mr."I don't cal'late to be," said.Let us hope that our worthy
has not been presented as being wholly without a sense of humor.He
grinned as he looked upon this lamb in the uniform of Mars, and added,
"I'm just naturally patriotic, I guess.Cap'n, 'll you have a drink?""It's d--d tiresome lookin' at mules all
day in the sun."Davitt that his mission work does not extend to Bremen,
that the good man's charity keeps him at the improvised hospital down
town.Hopper has resigned the superintendency of his Sunday School,
it is true, but he is still a pillar of the church.The young officer leans against the bar, and listens to stories by
Mr.Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear.And Eliphalet understands that
the good Lord put some fools into the world in order to give the smart
people a chance to practise their talents.Hopper neither drinks nor
smokes, but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere.When at length the Captain has marched out, with a conscious but manly
air, Mr.Hopper turns to Ford--"Don't lose no time in presenting them
vouchers at headquarters," says he.And
there's grumbling about this Department in the Eastern papers, If we
have an investigation, we'll whistle.He tosses off a pony of Bourbon, but
his face is not a delight to look upon, "Hopper, you'll be a d--d rich
man some day."And because I ain't got no capital, I only get
four per cent.""Don't one-twenty a day suit you?"And you've got horse contracts, and
blanket contracts besides.What's to prevent my goin' south
when the vouchers is cashed?""Then your mother'll have
to move out of her little place."NEWS FROM CLARENCE

The epithet aristocrat may become odious and fatal on the banks of the
Mississippi as it was on the banks of the Seine.Thousands of our population, by the
sudden stoppage of business, are thrown out of employment.When gaunt
famine intrudes upon their household, it is but natural that they should
inquire the cause.Virginia did not read this editorial, because it appeared in that
abhorred organ of the Mudsills, the 'Missouri Democrat.'The wheels of
fortune were turning rapidly that first hot summer of the war time.Let
us be thankful that our flesh and blood are incapable of the fury of
the guillotine.But when we think calmly of those days, can we escape
without a little pity for the aristocrats?Do you think that many of
them did not know hunger and want long before that cruel war was over?How bravely they met the grim spectre which crept so insidiously into
their homes!Colfax, peevishly, one morning as they
sat at breakfast, "why do you persist it wearing that old gown?It has
gotten on my nerves, my dear.You really must have something new made,
even if there are no men here to dress for.""Aunt Lillian, you must not say such things.I do not think that I ever
dressed to please men.""Tut, tut; my dear, we all do.We must not go shabby in such times as these, or be out of
fashion, Did you know that Prince Napoleon was actually coming here for
a visit this autumn?I am having a fitting at
Miss Elder's to-day."She did not reply as she poured out her
aunt's coffee."Jinny," said that lady, "come with me to Elder's, and I will give you
some gowns.If Comyn had been as careful of his own money as of mine,
you could dress decently.""I think I do dress decently, Aunt Lillian," answered the girl."I do
not need the gowns.Give me the money you intend to pay for them, and I
can use it for a better purpose."Colfax arranged her lace pettishly."I am sick and tired of this superiority, Jinny.""Hodges goes through the lines to-morrow
night."But you have no idea where
Clarence is."exclaimed her aunt, "I would not trust him.How do you know
that he will get through the Dutch pickets to Price's army?Wasn't
Souther captured last week, and that rash letter of Puss Russell's
to Jack Brinsmade published in the Democrat?"She laughed at the
recollection, and Virginia was fain to laugh too."Puss hasn't been
around much since.I hope that will cure her of saying what she thinks
of people.""I'll save my money until Price drives the Yankees from the state, and
Clarence marches into the city at the head of a regiment," Mrs.Colfax
went on, "It won't be long now.""Oh, you can't have read the papers.And don't you remember the letter
Maude had from George?They need the bare necessities of life, Aunt
Lillian.And half of Price's men have no arms at all."Colfax, "bring me a newspaper."All we know is that Lyon has left
Springfield to meet our troops, and that a great battle is coming,
Perhaps--perhaps it is being fought to-day."Colfax burst into tears, "Oh, Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so
cruel!"That very evening a man, tall and lean, but with the shrewd and kindly
eye of a scout, came into the sitting-room with the Colonel and handed
a letter to Mrs.In the hall he slipped into Virginia's hand
another, in a "Jefferson Davis" envelope, and she thrust it in her
gown--the girl was on fire as he whispered in her ear that he had seen
Clarence, and that he was well.In two days an answer might be left
at Mr.But she must be careful what she wrote, as the
Yankee scouts were active.Clarence, indeed, had proven himself a man.Glory and uniform became
him well, but danger and deprivation better.The words he had written,
careless and frank and boyish, made Virginia's heart leap with pride.Colfax's letter began with the adventure below the Arsenal, when
the frail skiff had sunk near the island, He told how he had heard the
captain of his escort sing out to him in the darkness, and how he had
floated down the current instead, until, chilled and weary, he had
contrived to seize the branches of a huge tree floating by.And how by a
miracle the moon had risen.When the great Memphis packet bore down upon
him, he had, been seen from her guards, and rescued and made much of;
and set ashore at the next landing, for fear her captain would get into
trouble.In the morning he had walked into the country, first providing
himself with butternuts and rawhide boots and a bowie-knife.Virginia
would never have recognized her dashing captain of dragoons in this
guise.The letter was long for Clarence, and written under great difficulties
from date to date.For nearly a month he had tramped over mountains
and across river bottoms, waiting for news of an organized force of
resistance in Missouri.Begging his way from cabin to cabin, and living
on greasy bacon and corn pone, at length he crossed the swift Gasconade
(so named by the French settlers because of its brawling ways) where
the bridge of the Pacific railroad had been blown up by the Governor's
orders.Then he learned that the untiring Lyon had steamed up the
Missouri and had taken possession of Jefferson City without a blow, and
that the ragged rebel force had fought and lost at Booneville.Footsore,
but undaunted, he pushed on to join the army, which he heard was
retreating southward along the western tier of counties of the state.On the banks of the Osage he fell in with two other young amen in as bad
a plight as himself.They travelled together, until one day some rough
farmers with shotguns leaped out of a bunch of willows on the borders
of a creek and arrested all three for Union spies.Clarence tried to explain that he had not long since been the dapper
captain of the State Dragoons.His Excellency, the Governor of Missouri (so acknowledged by all good
Southerners), likewise laughed when Mr.Colfax and the two others were
brought before him.His Excellency sat in a cabin surrounded by a camp
which had caused the dogs of war to howl for very shame.Louis in butternuts and
rawhide boots?""Give me a razor," demanded Clarence, with indignation, "a razor and a
suit of clothes, and I will prove it."A suit of clothes You know not what you ask."George Catherwood was
brought in,--or rather what had once been George.Now he was a big
frontiersman with a huge blond beard, and a bowie, knife stuck into
his trousers in place of a sword.He recognized his young captain of
dragoons the Governor apologized, and Clarence slept that night in the
cabin.The next day he was given a horse, and a bright new rifle which
the Governor's soldiers had taken from the Dutch at Cole Camp on the way
south, And presently they made a junction with three thousand more who
were their images.This was Price's army, but Price had gone ahead into
Kansas to beg the great McCulloch and his Confederates to come to their
aid and save the state."Dear mother, I wish that you and Jinny and Uncle Comyn could have
   seen this country rabble.How you would have laughed, and cried,
   because we are just like them.In the combined army two thousand
   have only bowie-knives or clubs.Some have long rifles of Daniel
   Boone's time, not fired for thirty years.And the impedimenta are a
   sight.Open wagons and conestogas and carryalls and buggies, and
   even barouches, weighted down with frying-pans and chairs and
   feather beds.But we've got spirit, and we can whip Lyon's Dutchmen
   and Yankees just as we are.Spirit is what counts, and the Yankees
   haven't got it, I was made to-day a Captain of Cavalry under
   Colonel Rives.I ride a great, raw-boned horse like an elephant.He jolts me until I am sore,--not quite as easy as my thoroughbred,
   Jefferson.Tell Jinny to care for him, and have him ready when we
   march into St."COWSKIN PRAIRIE, 9th July."We have whipped Sigel on the prairie by <DW53> Creek and killed--we
   don't know how many.Tell Maude that George distinguished himself
   in the fight."We have at last met McCulloch and his real soldiers.We cheered
   until we cried when we saw their ranks of gray, with the gold
   buttons and the gold braid and the gold stars.General McCulloch
   has taken me on his staff, and promised me a uniform.But how to
   clothe and feed and arm our men!We have only a few poor cattle,
   and no money.We shall whip the
   Yankees before we starve."Colfax did not cease to bewail the hardship which
her dear boy was forced to endure.He, who was used to linen sheets and
eider down, was without rough blanket or shelter; who was used to the
best table in the state, was reduced to husks."But, Aunt Lillian," cried Virginia, "he is fighting for the South.If
he were fed and clothed like the Yankees, we should not be half so proud
of him."Why set down for colder gaze the burning words that Clarence wrote to
Virginia.How she pored over that letter, and folded it so that even
the candle-droppings would not be creased and fall away!He was happy,
though wretched because he could not see her.It was the life he had
longed for.he was proving his usefulness
in this world.He was no longer the mere idler whom she had chidden."Jinny, do you remember saying so many years ago that our ruin would
   come of our not being able to work?How I wish you could see us
   felling trees to make bullet-moulds, and forging slugs for canister,
   and making cartridges at night with our bayonets as candlesticks.Jinny dear, I know that you will keep up your courage.I can see
   you sewing for us, I can hear you praying for us."It was, in truth, how Virginia learned to sew.Her fingers were pricked and sore weeks after she began.Sad
to relate, her bandages, shirts, and havelocks never reached the
front,--those havelocks, to withstand the heat of the tropic sun, which
were made in thousands by devoted Union women that first summer of the
war, to be ridiculed as nightcaps by the soldiers."Why should not our soldiers have them, too?"They were never so happy as when sewing on them against
the arrival of the Army of Liberation, which never came.The long, long days of heat dragged slowly, with little to cheer those
families separated from their dear ones by a great army.Clarence might
die, and a month--perhaps a year--pass without news, unless he were
brought a prisoner to St.How Virginia envied Maude because the
Union lists of dead and wounded would give her tidings of her brother
Tom, at least!How she coveted the many Union families, whose sons and
brothers were at the front, this privilege!We were speaking of the French Revolution, when, as Balzac remarked, to
be a spy was to be a patriot.Heads are not so cheap in our Anglo-Saxon
countries; passions not so fierce and uncontrollable.Compare, with a
prominent historian, our Boston Massacre and St.Compare Camp Jackson, or Baltimore, where a
few people were shot, with some Paris street scenes after the Bastille.Our own provost marshal was
hissed in the street, and called "Robespierre," and yet he did not fear
the assassin's knife.Our own Southern aristocrats were hemmed in in
a Union city (their own city).No women were thrown into prison, it is
true.Yet one was not permitted to shout for Jeff Davis on the street
corner before the provost's guard.Once in a while a detachment of
the Home Guards, commanded by a lieutenant; would march swiftly into a
street and stop before a house, whose occupants would run to the rear,
only to encounter another detachment in the alley.One day, in great excitement, Eugenie Renault rang the bell of the
Carvel house, and ran past the astounded Jackson up the stairs to
Virginia's room, the door of which she burst open.she cried, "Puss Russell's house is surrounded by Yankees,
and Puss and Emily and all the family are prisoners!"said Virginia, dropping in her excitement her
last year's bonnet, which she was trimming with red, white, and red."Because," said Eugenie, sputtering with indignation "because they waved
at some of our poor fellows who were being taken to the slave pen.Russell's house under guard--Puss had a
small--"

"Confederate flag," put in Virginia, smiling in spite of herself."And she waved it between the shutters," Eugenie continued."And some
one told, the provost marshal.He has had the house surrounded, and the
family have to stay there.""Then," said Miss Renault, in a voice of awe, "then each one of the
family is to have just a common army ration.They are to be treated as
prisoners.""Oh, those Yankees are detestable!"As soon as our army is organized and equipped, they shall
pay for it ten times over."She tried on the bonnet, conspicuous with
its red and white ribbons, before the glass.Then she ran to the closet
and drew forth the white gown with its red trimmings."Wait for me,
Genie," she said, "and we'll go down to Puss's house together.It may
cheer her to see us.""But not in that dress," said Eugenie, aghast.And her eyes flashed so
that Eugenie was frightened.Miss Renault regarded her friend with something of adoration from
beneath her black lashes.It was about five in the afternoon when they
started out together under Virginia's white parasol, Eugenie's slimmer
courage upheld by her friend's bearing.We must remember that
Virginia was young, and that her feelings were akin to those our
great-grandmothers experienced when the British held New York.It was
as if she had been born to wear the red and white of the South.Elderly
gentlemen of Northern persuasion paused in their homeward walk to smile
in admiration,--some sadly, as Mr.Young gentlemen found an
excuse to retrace their steps a block or two.But Virginia walked on
air, and saw nothing.She was between fierce anger and exaltation.She
did not deign to drop her eyes as low as the citizen sergeant and guard
in front of Puss Russell's house (these men were only human, after all);
she did not so much as glance at the curious people standing on the
corner, who could not resist a murmur of delight.The citizen sergeant
only smiled, and made no move to arrest the young lady in red and white.Nor did Puss fling open the blinds and wave at her.Russell won't let her," said Virginia,
disconsolately, "Genie, let's go to headquarters, and show this Yankee
General Fremont that we are not afraid of him."Eugenie's breath was taken away by the very boldness of this
proposition.. She looked up timidly into Virginia's face, and
hero-worship got the better of prudence.The house which General Fremont appropriated for his use when he came
back from Europe to assume command in the West was not a modest one.It
still stands, a large mansion of brick with a stone front, very tall and
very wide, with an elaborate cornice and plate-glass windows, both tall
and broad, and a high basement.Two stately stone porches capped by
elaborate iron railings adorn it in front and on the side.In short, the house is of that type built
by many wealthy gentlemen in the middle of the century, which has best
stood the test of time,--the only type which, if repeated to-day, would
not clash with the architectural education which we are receiving.A
spacious yard well above the pavement surrounds it, sustained by a wall
of dressed stones, capped by an iron fence.The whole expressed wealth,
security, solidity, conservatism.Alas, that the coal deposits under
the black mud of our Western states should, at length, have driven
the owners of these houses out of them!They are now blackened, almost
buried in soot; empty, or half-tenanted by boarders, Descendants of the
old families pass them on their way to business or to the theatre with
a sigh.The sons of those who owned them have built westward, and
west-ward again, until now they are six miles from the river.On that summer evening forty years ago, when Virginia and Eugenie came
in sight of the house, a scene of great animation was before them.Talk
was rife over the commanding general's pomp and circumstance.He had
just returned from Europe, where pomp and circumstance and the military
were wedded.Foreign officers should come to America to teach our
army dress and manners.A dashing Hungarian commanded the general's
body-guard, which honorable corps was even then drawn up in the street
before the house, surrounded at a respectable distance by a crowd
that feared to jest.They felt like it save when they caught the stern
military eye of the Hungarian captain.Virginia gazed at the glittering
uniforms, resplendent in the sun, and at the sleek and well-fed horses,
and scalding tears came as she thought of the half-starved rabble of
Southern patriots on the burning prairies.Just then a sharp command
escaped in broken English from the Hungarian.The people in the yard of
the mansion parted, and the General himself walked proudly out of the
gate to the curb, where his charger was pawing the gutter.As he put
foot to the stirrup, the eye of the great man (once candidate, and again
to be, for President) caught the glint of red and white on the corner.For an instant he stood transfixed to the spot, with one leg in the air.Then he took it down again and spoke to a young officer of his staff,
who smiled and began to walk toward them.Little Eugenie's knees
trembled.She seized Virginia's arm, and whispered in agony."Oh, Jinny, you are to be arrested, after all.Oh, I wish you hadn't
been so bold!""Hush," said Virginia, as she prepared to slay the young officer with
a look.She felt like flying at his throat, and choking him for the
insolence of that smile.How dare he march undaunted to within six paces
of those eyes?The crowd drew back, But did Miss Carvel retreat?"Oh, I hope he will arrest me," she said passionately, to Eugenie."He will start a conflagration beyond the power of any Yankee to quell."No, those were not
the words, surely.He bowed very
low and said:

"Ladies, the General's compliments, and he begs that this much of the
sidewalk may be kept clear for a few moments."What was left for them, after that, save a retreat?But he was not
precipitate.Miss Virginia crossed the street with a dignity and bearing
which drew even the eyes of the body-guard to one side.And there she
stood haughtily until the guard and the General had thundered away.A
crowd of black-coated civilians, and quartermasters and other officers
in uniform, poured out of the basement of the house into the yards.One
civilian, a youngish man a little inclined to stoutness, stopped at the
gate, stared, then thrust some papers in his pocket and hurried down
the side street.Three blocks thence he appeared abreast of Miss Carvel.More remarkable still, he lifted his hat clear of his head.Hopper, with his newly acquired equanimity and poise,
startled her."May I have the pleasure," said that gentleman, "of accompanying you
home?"Eugenie giggled, Virginia was more annoyed than she showed."You must not come out of your way," she said."I am
sure you must go back to the store.Had Virginia but known, this occasional tartness in her speech gave
Eliphalet an infinite delight, even while it hurt him.His was a nature
which liked to gloat over a goal on the horizon He cared not a whit for
sweet girls; they cloyed.He
had revised his vocabulary for just such an occasion, and thrown out
some of the vernacular."Business is not so pressing nowadays, Miss Carvel," he answered, with a
shade of meaning."Then existence must be rather heavy for you," she said.She made
no attempt to introduce him to Eugenie."If we should have any more
victories like Bull Run, prosperity will come back with a rush," said
the son of Massachusetts."Southern Confederacy, with Missouri one of
its stars an industrial development of the South--fortunes in cotton."Virginia turned quickly, "Oh, how dare you?""How dare you
speak flippantly of such things?"His suavity was far from overthrown."I assure you that I want to see the
South win."What he did not know was that words seldom convince women.But he added something which reduced her incredulity for the time."Do
you cal'late," said he,--that I could work for your father, and wish
ruin to his country?""But you are a Yankee born," she exclaimed."There be a few sane Yankees," replied Mr.A remark
which made Eugenie laugh outright, and Virginia could not refrain from a
smile.But much against her will he walked home with her.She was indignant by
the time she reached Locust Street.He had never dared do such a thing
before, What had got into the man?Was it because he had become
a manager, and governed the business during her father's frequent
absences?Hopper's politics, he would always be to
her a low-born Yankee, a person wholly unworthy of notice.At the corner of Olive Street, a young man walking with long strides
almost bumped into them.He paused looked back, and bowed as if
uncertain of an acknowledgment.He had
been very close to her, and she had had time to notice that his coat was
threadbare.When she looked again, he had covered half the block.Why should she care if Stephen Brice had seen her in company with Mr.Eliphalet, too, had seen Stephen, and this had added zest to his
enjoyment.It was part of the fruits of his reward.He wished in that
short walk that he might meet Mr.Cluyme and Belle, and every man and
woman and child in the city whom he knew.From time to time he glanced
at the severe profile of the aristocrat beside him (he had to look up a
bit, likewise), and that look set him down among the beasts of prey.For she was his rightful prey, and he meant not to lose one tittle of
enjoyment in the progress of the game.Many and many a night in the bare
little back room at Miss Crane's, Eliphalet had gloated over the very
event which was now come to pass.Not a step of the way but what he had
lived through before.The future is laid open to such men as he.Since he had first seen the
black cloud of war rolling up from the South, a hundred times had he
rehearsed the scene with Colonel Carvel which had actually taken place
a week before.A hundred times had he prepared his speech and manner for
this first appearance in public with Virginia after he had forced the
right to walk in her company.The words he had prepared--commonplace, to
be sure, but carefully chosen--flowed from his lips in a continual nasal
stream.The girl answered absently, her feminine instinct groping after
a reason for it all.She brightened when she saw her father at the
doors and, saying good by to Eugenie, tripped up the steps, bowing to
Eliphalet coldly."Why, bless us, Jinny," said the Colonel, "you haven't been parading the
town in that costume!You'll have us in Lynch's slave pen by to-morrow
night.laughed he, patting her under the chin, "there's no
doubt about your sentiments, anyhow.""I've been over to Puss Russell's house," said she, breathless."They've
closed it up, you know--" (He nodded.)"And then we went--Eugenie and I,
to headquarters, just to see what the Yankees would do.""You must take care, honey,"
he said, lowering his voice."They suspect me now of communicating with
the Governor and McCulloch.Jinny, it's all very well to be brave, and
to stand by your colors.But this sort of thing," said he, stroking the
gown, "this sort of thing doesn't help the South, my dear, and only
sets spies upon us.Ned tells me that there was a man in plain clothes
standing in the alley last night for three hours.""Pa," cried the girl, "I'm so sorry."Suddenly searching his face with
a swift instinct, she perceived that these months had made it yellow and
lined."Pa, dear, you must come to Glencoe to-morrow and rest You must
not go off on any more trips.""It isn't the trips, Jinny There are duties, my dear, pleasant
duties--Jinny--"

"Yes?"The Colonel's eye had suddenly fallen on Mr.Hopper, who was still
standing at the bottom of the steps.He checked himself abruptly as
Eliphalet pulled off his hat,

"Howdy, Colonel?"Virginia was motionless, with her back to the intruder, She was frozen
by a presentiment.As she saw her father start down the steps, she
yearned to throw herself in front of him--to warn him of something; she
knew not what.Then she heard the Colonel's voice, courteous and kindly
as ever.And yet it broke a little as he greeted his visitor."Won't--won't you come in, Mr.Virginia started

"I don't know but what I will, thank you, Colonel," he answered; easily."I took the liberty of walking home with your daughter."Virginia fairly flew into the house and up the stairs.Gaining her room,
she shut the door and turned the key, as though he might pursue her
there.The man's face had all at once become a terror.She threw herself
on the lounge and buried her face in her hands, and she saw it still
leering at her with a new confidence.Presently she grew calmer; rising,
she put on the plainest of her scanty wardrobe, and went down the
stairs, all in a strange trepidation new to her.She had never been in
fear of a man before.She hearkened over the banisters for his voice,
heard it, and summoned all her courage.How cowardly she had been to
leave her father alone with him.Colfax
ignored him as completely as if his chair had been vacant He glanced at
that lady once, and smiled, for he was tasting the sweets of victory.It was Virginia who entertained him, and even the Colonel never guessed
what it cost her.Eliphalet himself marvelled at her change of manner,
and gloated over that likewise.Not a turn or a quiver of the victim's
pain is missed by your beast of prey.The Colonel was gravely polite,
but preoccupied.Had he wished it, he could not have been rude to a
guest.Hopper a cigar with the same air that he would
have given it to a governor."Thank'ee, Colonel, I don't smoke," he said, waving the bog away.Colfax flung herself out of the room.It was ten o'clock when Eliphalet reached Miss Crane's, and picked his
way up the front steps where the boarders were gathered."The war doesn't seem to make any difference in your business, Mr.Hopper," his landlady remarked, "where have you been so late?""I happened round at Colonel Carvel's this afternoon, and stayed for tea
with 'em," he answered, striving to speak casually.Abner Reed's room later than usual that
night.THE SCOURGE OF WAR

"Virginia," said Mrs.Colfax, the next morning on coming downstairs, "I
am going back to Bellegarde today.I really cannot put up with such a
person as Comyn had here to tea last night."It is safe to say that she had never accurately
gauged the force which Virginia's respect for her elders, and affection
for her aunt through Clarence, held in check.Now there had arisen in front of her a tall
person of authority, before whom she deferred instinctively.It was not
what Virginia said, for she would not stoop to tirade.Colfax sank
into a chair, seeing only the blurred lines of a newspaper the girl had
thrust into her hand."There has been a battle at Wilson's Creek," said Virginia, in an
emotionless voice."General Lyon is killed, for which I suppose we
should be thankful.More than seven hundred of the wounded are on their
way here.They are bringing them one hundred and twenty miles, from
Springfield to Rollo, in rough army wagons, with scarcely anything to
eat or drink.""At what time shall I order the carriage
to take you to Bellegarde?"Colfax leaned forward and caught the hem of her niece's gown."Oh,
let me stay," she cried, "let me stay."As you please, Aunt Lillian," she answered."You know that you may
always stay here.I only beg of you one thing, that when you have
anything to complain of, you will bring it to me, and not mention it
before Pa."Oh, Jinny," sobbed the lady, in tears again, "how can you be so cruel
at such a time, when my nerves are all in pieces?"But she did not lift her voice at dinner, which was very poor indeed for
Colonel Carvel's house.All day long Virginia, assisted by Uncle Ben and
Aunt Easter, toiled in the stifling kitchen, preparing dainties which
she had long denied herself.At evening she went to the station at
Fourteenth Street with her father, and stood amongst the people, pressed
back by the soldiers, until the trains came in.Alas, the heavy basket
which the Colonel carried on his arm was brought home again.The first
hundred to arrive, ten hours in a hot car without food or water, were
laid groaning on the bottom of great furniture vans, and carted to the
new House of Refuge Hospital, two miles to the south of the city.The next day many good women went there, Rebel and Union alike, to have
their hearts wrung.The new and cheap building standing in the hot sun
reeked with white wash and paint.The miserable men lay on the hard
floor, still in the matted clothes they had worn in battle.Those were
the first days of the war, when the wages of our passions first came to
appal us.Many of the wounds had not been tended since they were dressed
on the field weeks before.Colfax went too, with the Colonel and her niece, although she
declared repeatedly that she could not go through with such an
ordeal.Carvel had to assist her to the
waiting-room.Then he went back to the improvised wards to find Virginia
busy over a gaunt Arkansan of Price's army, whose pitiful, fever-glazed
eyes were following her every motion.His frontiersman's clothes,
stained with blackened blood, hung limp over his wasted body.At
Virginia's bidding the Colonel ran downstairs for a bucket of fresh
water, and she washed the caked dust from his face and hands.Brinsmade who got the surgeon to dress the man's wound, and to prescribe
some of the broth from Virginia's basket.For the first time since the
war began something of happiness entered her breast.Brinsmade who was everywhere that day, answering the
questions of distracted mothers and fathers and sisters who thronged
the place; consulting with the surgeons; helping the few who knew how to
work in placing mattresses under the worst cases; or again he might have
been seen seated on the bare floor with a pad on his knee, taking down
the names of dear ones in distant states,--that he might spend his night
writing to them.They put a mattress under the Arkansan.Virginia did not leave him until
he had fallen asleep, and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken
face.Dismayed at the fearful sights about her, awed by the groans that
rose on every side, she was choosing her way swiftly down the room to
join her father and aunt in the carriage below.She felt that another little while
in this heated, horrible place would drive her mad.She was almost at
the door when she came suddenly upon a sight that made her pause.An elderly lady in widow's black was kneeling beside a man groaning in
mortal agony, fanning away the flies already gathering about his face.He wore the uniform of a Union sergeant,--dusty and splotched and torn.A small Testament was clasped convulsively in the fingers of his right
band.Virginia lingered, whelmed in pity,
thrilled by a wonderful womanliness of her who knelt there.Her face the
girl had not even seen, for it was bent over the man.The sweetness of
her voice held Virginia as in a spell, and the sergeant stopped groaning
that he might listen:

"You have a wife?""A boy, ma'am--born the week--before I came--away.""I shall write to your wife," said the lady, so gently that Virginia
could scarce hear, "and tell her that you are cared for.He gave the address faintly--some little town in Minnesota.Then he
added, "God bless you, lady."Just then the chief surgeon came and stood over them.The lady turned
her face up to him, and tears sparkled in her eyes.Virginia felt them
wet in her own.Nobility, character,
efficiency,-all were written on that face.Nobility spoke in the large
features, in the generous mouth, in the calm, gray eyes.Virginia had
seen her often before, but not until now was the woman revealed to her."Doctor, could this man's life be saved if I took him to my home?"The surgeon got down beside her and took the man's pulse.For a while the doctor knelt there, shaking his head."He has
fainted," he said.The surgeon
smiled,--such a smile as a good man gives after eighteen hours of
amputating, of bandaging, of advising,--work which requires a firm hand,
a clear eye and brain, and a good heart.Brice," he said, "I shall be glad to get you permission
to take him, but we must first make him worth the taking.He glanced hurriedly about the busy room, and
then added, "We must have one more to help us.""I am afraid we must go, dear," he said, "your aunt is getting
impatient.""Won't you please go without me, Pa?""Perhaps I can be of
some use."The Colonel cast a wondering glance at the limp uniform, and went
away.The surgeon, who knew the Carvel family, gave Virginia a look of
astonishment.Brice's searching gaze that brought the color
to the girl's, face."Thank you, my dear," she said simply.As soon as he could get his sister-in-law off to Locust Street in the
carriage, Colonel Carvel came back.For two reeking hours he stood
against the newly plastered wall.Even he was surprised at the fortitude
and skill Virginia showed from the very first, when she had deftly
cut away the stiffened blue cloth, and helped to take off the rough
bandages.At length the fearful operation was finished, and the weary
surgeon, gathering up his box, expressed with all the energy left to
him, his thanks to the two ladies.The work of her hands had sustained
her while it lasted, but now the ordeal was come.She went down the
stairs on her father's arm, and out into the air.Brice was beside her, and had taken her by the hand.she was saying, "God will reward you for this act.You have
taught many of us to-day a lesson we should have learned in our Bibles."Virginia trembled with many emotions, but she answered nothing.The
mere presence of this woman had a strange effect upon the girl,--she was
filled with a longing unutterable.It was not because Margaret Brice
was the mother of him whose life had been so strangely blended with
hers--whom she saw in her dreams.And yet now some of Stephen's traits
seemed to come to her understanding, as by a revelation.Virginia had
labored through the heat of the day by Margaret Brice's side doing His
work, which levels all feuds and makes all women sisters.One brief
second had been needful for the spell.The Colonel bowed with that courtesy and respect which distinguished
him, and Mrs.Brice left them to go back into the room of torment, and
watch by the sergeant's pallet.Virginia's eyes followed her up the
stairs, and then she and her father walked slowly to the carriage.With
her foot on the step Virginia paused."Pa," she said, "do you think it would be possible to get them to let us
take that Arkansan into our house?""Why, honey, I'll ask Brinsmade if you like," said the Colonel."Here he
comes now, and Anne."It was Virginia who put the question to him."My dear," replied that gentleman, patting her, "I would do anything
in the world for you.I'll see General Fremont this very afternoon.Virginia," he added, soberly, "it is such acts as yours to-day that give
us courage to live in these times.""Oh, Jinny, I saw what you were doing for one of our men.It was well that Virginia did not see the smile on
the face of the commanding general when Mr.Brinsmade at length got to
him with her request.This was before the days when the wounded arrived
by the thousands, when the zeal of the Southern ladies threatened to
throw out of gear the workings of a great system.But the General, had
had his eye on Mr.Brinsmade, with dignity, "is a gentleman.When he gives his word, it is sacred, sir.""Even to an enemy," the General put in, "By George, Brinsmade, unless I
knew you, I should think that you were half rebel yourself.Well, well,
he may have his Arkansan."Brinsmade, when he conveyed the news to the Carvel house, did not
say that he had wasted a precious afternoon in the attempt to interview
his Excellency, the Commander in-chief.It was like obtaining an
audience with the Sultan or the Czar.Citizens who had been prominent
in affairs for twenty years, philanthropists and patriotic-spirited men
like Mr.Brinsmade, the mayor, and all the ex-mayors mopped their brows
in one of the general's anterooms of the big mansion, and wrangled with
beardless youths in bright uniforms who were part of the chain.The
General might have been a Richelieu, a Marlborough.His European notions
of uniformed inaccessibility he carried out to the letter.He was
a royal personage, seldom seen, who went abroad in the midst of a
glittering guard.It did not seem to weigh with his Excellency that
these simple and democratic gentlemen would not put up with this sort of
thing.That they who had saved the city to the Union were more or less
in communication with a simple and democratic President; that in all
their lives they had never been in the habit of sitting idly for two
hours to mop their brows.On the other hand, once you got beyond the gold lace and the etiquette,
you discovered a good man and a patriot.It was far from being the
General's fault that Mr.Hopper and others made money in mules and
worthless army blankets.Such things always have been, and always will
be unavoidable when this great country of ours rises from the deep sleep
of security into which her sons have lulled her, to demand her sword.We
shall never be able to realize that the maintenance of a standing army
of comfortable size will save millions in the end.So much for Democracy
when it becomes a catchword.The General was a good man, had he done nothing else than encourage the
Western Sanitary Commission, that glorious army of drilled men and women
who gave up all to relieve the suffering which the war was causing.Would that a novel--a great novel--might be written setting forth with
truth its doings.The hero of it could be Calvin Brinsmade, and a nobler
hero than he was never under a man's hand.For the glory of generals
fades beside his glory.Brice home from
her trying day in the hospital.Stephen, just returned from drill
at Verandah hall, met her at the door.She would not listen to his
entreaties to rest, but in the evening, as usual, took her sewing to the
porch behind the house, where there was a little breeze."Such a singular thing happened to-day, Stephen," she said."It was
while we were trying to save the life of a poor sergeant who had lost
his arm.I hope we shall be allowed to have him here."It was soon after I had come upon this poor fellow," she said."I saw
the--the flies around him.And as I got down beside him to fan them away
I had such a queer sensation.I knew that some one was standing behind
me, looking at me.Allerdyce came, and I asked him about the
man, and he said there was a chance of saving him if we could only get
help.Then some one spoke up,--such a sweet voice.It was that Miss
Carvel my dear, with whom you had such a strange experience when you
bought Hester, and to whose party you once went.Do you remember that
they offered us their house in Glencoe when the Judge was so ill?""She is a wonderful creature," his mother continued.And wasn't it a remarkable offer for a Southern woman to
make?They feel so bitterly, and--and I do not blame them."The good
lady put down on her lap the night-shirt she was making.And, my dear, her
capability astonished me.One might have thought that she had always
been a nurse.The experience was a dreadful one for me--what must
it have been for her.After the operation was over, I followed her
downstairs to where she was standing with her father in front of the
building, waiting for their carriage.I felt that I must say something
to her, for in all my life I have never seen a nobler thing done.When I
saw her there, I scarcely knew what to say.It was then three o'clock, and she had been working steadily in that
place since morning.I am sure she could not have borne it much longer.Sheer courage carried her through it, I know, for her hand trembled so
when I took it, and she was very pale.Her father, the Colonel, was with her, and he bowed to me with such
politeness.He had stood against the wall all the while we had worked,
and he brought a mattress for us.I have heard that his house is
watched, and that they have him under suspicion for communicating
with the Confederate leaders."I hope they will not get into any trouble.""I hope not, mother," said Stephen.It was two mornings later that Judge Whipple and Stephen drove to the
Iron Mountain depot, where they found a German company of Home Guards
drawn up.On the long wooden platform under the sheds Stephen
caught sight of Herr Korner and Herr Hauptmann amid a group of their
countrymen.Little Korner came forward to clasp his hands.The tears ran
on his cheeks, and he could not speak for emotion.Judge Whipple, grim
and silent, stood apart.But he uncovered his head with the others when
the train rolled in.Reverently they entered a car where the pine boxes
were piled one on another, and they bore out the earthly remains of
Captain Carl Richter.Far from the land of his birth, among those same oaks on Bloody Hill
where brave Lyon fell, he had gladly given up his life for the new
country and the new cause he had made his own.That afternoon in the cemetery, as the smoke of the last salute to a
hero hung in the flickering light and drifted upward through the
great trees, as the still air was yet quivering with the notes of the
bugle-call which is the soldiers requiem, a tall figure, gaunt and bent,
stepped out from behind the blue line of the troops.He carried in his hand a wreath of white roses--the first
of many to be laid on Richter's grave.And yet he had not filled it
with sadness.For many a month, and many a year, Stephen could not look
upon his empty place without a pang.He missed the cheery songs and the
earnest presence even more than he had thought.Carl Richter,--as his
father before him,--had lived for others.Both had sacrificed their
bodies for a cause.One of them might be pictured as he trudged with
Father Jahn from door to door through the Rhine country, or shouldering
at sixteen a heavy musket in the Landwehr's ranks to drive the tyrant
Napoleon from the beloved Fatherland Later, aged before his time,
his wife dead of misery, decrepit and prison-worn in the service of a
thankless country, his hopes lived again in Carl, the swordsman of Jena.Then came the pitiful Revolution, the sundering of all ties, the elder
man left to drag out his few weary days before a shattered altar.In
Carl a new aspiration had sprung up, a new patriotism stirred.His, too,
had been the sacrifice.Happy in death, for he had helped perpetuate
that great Union which should be for all time the refuge of the
oppressed.THE LIST OF SIXTY

One chilling day in November, when an icy rain was falling on the black
mud of the streets, Virginia looked out of the window.Her eye was
caught by two horses which were just skeletons with the skin stretched
over them.One had a bad sore on his flank, and was lame.They were
pulling a rattle-trap farm wagon with a buckled wheel.On the seat a
man, pallid and bent and scantily clad, was holding the reins in his
feeble hands, while beside him cowered a child of ten wrapped in a
ragged blanket.In the body of the wagon, lying on a mattress pressed
down in the midst of broken, cheap furniture and filthy kitchen ware,
lay a gaunt woman in the rain.Her eyes were closed, and a hump on the
surface of the dirty quilt beside her showed that a child must be there.From such a picture the girl fled in tears.But the sight of it, and of
others like it, haunted her for weeks.Through those last dreary days of
November, wretched families, which a year since had been in health and
prosperity, came to the city, beggars, with the wrecks of their homes.The history of that hideous pilgrimage across a state has never been
written.Still they came by the hundred, those families.The father of one, hale and strong when
they started, died of pneumonia in the public lodging-house.The walls
of that house could tell many tales to wring the heart.Brinsmade, did he choose to speak of his own charities.He found
time, between his labors at the big hospital newly founded, and his
correspondence, and his journeys of love,--between early morning and
midnight,--to give some hours a day to the refugees.Throughout December they poured in on the afflicted city, already
overtaxed.All the way to Springfield the road was lined with remains
of articles once dear--a child's doll, a little rocking-chair, a 
print that has hung in the best room, a Bible text.Anne Brinsmade, driven by Nicodemus, went from house to house to solicit
old clothes, and take them to the crowded place of detention.Christmas
was drawing near--a sorry Christmas, in truth.And many of the wanderers
were unclothed and unfed.More battles had been fought; factions had arisen among Union men.Louis to take charge of the Department,
and the other with his wondrous body-guard was gone.The most serious problem confronting the new general--was how to care
for the refugees.A council of citizens was called at headquarters, and
the verdict went forth in the never-to-be-forgotten Orders No."Inasmuch," said the General, "as the Secession army had driven these
people from their homes, Secession sympathizers should be made to
support them."He added that the city was unquestionably full of these.Indignation was rife the day that order was published.Sixty prominent
"disloyalists" were to be chosen and assessed to make up a sum of ten
thousand dollars."They may sell my house over my head before I will pay a cent," cried
Mr.Who were
to be on this mysterious list of "Sixty"?That was the all-absorbing
question of the town.It was an easy matter to pick the conspicuous
ones.Colonel Carvel was sure to be there, and Mr.Addison Colfax
lived for days in a fermented state of excitement which she declared
would break her down; and which, despite her many cares and worries,
gave her niece not a little amusement.For Virginia was human, and one
morning she went to her aunt's room to read this editorial from the
newspaper:-- "For the relief of many palpitating hearts it may be well
to state that we understand only two ladies are on the ten thousand
dollar list.""Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so cruel as to read me that, when
you know that I am in a state of frenzy now?It makes it an absolute certainty that Madame Jules and I will have to
pay.We are the only women of importance in the city."That afternoon she made good her much-uttered threat, and drove to
Bellegarde.Only the Colonel and Virginia and Mammy Easter and Ned were
left in the big house.Rosetta and Uncle Ben and Jackson had been
hired out, and the horses sold,--all save old Dick, who was running,
long-haired, in the fields at Glencoe.Christmas eve was a steel-gray day, and the sleet froze as it fell.Since morning Colonel Carvel had sat poking the sitting-room fire, or
pacing the floor restlessly.He was observed
night and day by Federal detectives.Virginia strove to amuse him, to
conceal her anxiety as she watched him.Well she knew that but for her
he would long since have fled southward, and often in the bitterness of
the night-time she blamed herself for not telling him to go.Ten years
had seemed to pass over him since the war had begun.All day long she had been striving to put away from her the memory of
Christmas eves past and gone of her father's early home-coming from the
store, a mysterious smile on his face; of Captain Lige stamping noisily
into the house, exchanging uproarious jests with Ned and Jackson.The
Captain had always carried under his arm a shapeless bundle which he
would confide to Ned with a knowing wink.And then the house would be
lighted from top to bottom, and Mr.Brinsmade came in for a long evening with Mr.Carvel over great bowls of
apple toddy and egg-nog.And Virginia would have her own friends in the
big parlor.That parlor was shut up now, and icy cold.Then there was Judge Whipple, the joyous event of whose year was his
Christmas dinner at Colonel Carvel's house.Brice's little table, and wondered whether he would miss
them as much as they missed him.War may break friendships, but it
cannot take away the sacredness of memories.The sombre daylight was drawing to an early close as the two stood
looking out of the sitting-room window.A man's figure muffled in
a greatcoat slanting carefully across the street caught their eyes.It was the same United States deputy marshal she had
seen the day before at Mr."Pa," she cried, "do you think he is coming here?""Pa, you must promise me to take down the mahogany bed in your room.I could not bear to see them take that.Let me put
it in the garret."The Colonel was distressed, but he spoke without a tremor.We must leave this house just as it is."Then he added,
strangely enough for him, "God's will be done."And Ned, who was cook and housemaid, came in with
his apron on."Does you want to see folks, Marse Comyn?"The Colonel rose, and went to the door himself.He was an imposing
figure as he stood in the windy vestibule, confronting the deputy.Virginia's first impulse was to shrink under the stairs.Then she came
out and stood beside her father.He was a young man with a smooth face, and
a frank brown eye which paid its tribute to Virginia.He did not appear
to relish the duty thrust upon him.He fumbled in his coat and drew from
his inner pocket a paper."Colonel Carvel," said he, "by order of Major General Halleck, I serve
you with this notice to pay the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars
for the benefit of the destitute families which the Rebels have driven
from their homes.In default of payment within a reasonable time such
personal articles will be seized and sold at public auction as will
satisfy the demand against you.""You may tell the
General that the articles may be seized.That I will not, while in my
right mind, be forced to support persons who have no claim upon me."It was said in the tone in which he might have refused an invitation to
dinner.He had gone into many houses that week;
had seen indignation, hysterics, frenzy.He had even heard men and women
whose sons and brothers were in the army of secession proclaim their
loyalty to the Union.But this dignity, and the quiet scorn of the girl
who had stood silent beside them, were new.He bowed, and casting his
eyes to the vestibule, was glad to escape from the house.Then he turned toward Virginia, thoughtfully
pulled his goatee, and laughed gently."Lordy, we haven't got three
hundred and fifty dollars to our names," said he.That fierce valley of the
Missouri, which belches fitful blizzards from December to March, is
sometimes quiet.Then the hot winds come up from the Gulf, and sleet
melts, and windows are opened.In those days the streets will be fetlock
deep in soft mud.It is neither summer, nor winter, nor spring, nor
anything.It was such a languorous afternoon in January that a furniture van,
accompanied by certain nondescript persons known as United States
Police, pulled up at the curb in front of Mr.Eugenie,
watching at the window across the street, ran to tell her father, who
came out on his steps and reviled the van with all the fluency of his
French ancestors.Mammy Easter opened the door, and then stood with her arms akimbo, amply
filling its place.Her lips protruded, and an expression of defiance
hard to describe sat on her honest black face.I 'low you knows dat jes as well as me."An embarrassed
silence, and then from Mammy, "Whaffor you laffin at?""Now I reckon you knows dat he ain't.Ef he was, you ain't come here
'quirin' in dat honey voice.""You tink I
dunno whaffor you come?You done come heah to rifle, an' to loot, an'
to steal, an' to seize what ain't your'n.You come heah when young Marse
ain't to home ter rob him.""Ned, whaffor you hidin'
yonder?Ef yo' ain't man to protect Marse Comyn's prop-ty, jes han' over
Marse Comyn's gun."The marshal and his men had stood, half amused, more than half baffled
by this unexpected resistance.Mammy Easter looked so dangerous that it
was evident she was not to be passed without extreme bodily discomfort."Who is
you to come heah 'quiring fo' her!I ain't agwine--"

"Mammy!"Mammy backed out of the door and clutched at
her bandanna."Mammy, what is all this noise about?""These heah men, Miss Jinny, was gwine f'r t' carry away all yo' pa's
blongin's.I jes' tol' 'em dey ain't comin' in ovah dis heah body."He caught sight of the face of
Miss Carvel within, and stopped abruptly."I have a warrant here from the Provost Marshal, ma'am, to seize
personal property to satisfy a claim against Colonel Carvel."Virginia took the order, read it, and handed it back."I do not see how
I am to prevent you," she said.I--I can't tell you how sorry I am.Then he
entered the chill drawing-room, threw open the blinds and glanced around
him."I expect all that we want is right here," he said.And at the sight of
the great chandelier, with its cut-glass crystals, he whistled.Then he
walked over to the big English Rothfield piano and lifted the lid.Involuntarily he rested himself on the mahogany
stool, and ran his fingers over the keys.They seemed to Virginia,
standing motionless in the ball, to give out the very chords of agony.The piano, too, had been her mother's.It had once stood in the brick
house of her grandfather Colfax at Halcyondale.The songs of Beatrice
lay on the bottom shelf of the what-not near by.No more, of an evening
when they were alone, would Virginia quietly take them out and play
them over to the Colonel, as he sat dreaming in the window with his
cigar,--dreaming of a field on the borders of a wood, of a young girl
who held his hand, and sang them softly to herself as she walked by his
side.And, when they reached the house in the October twilight, she had
played them for him on this piano.Often he had told Virginia of those
days, and walked with her over those paths.The deputy closed the lid, and sent out to the van for a truck.For the first time she heard the words of Mammy Easter."Come along upstairs wid yo' Mammy, honey.Dis ain't no place for us,
I reckon."Her words were the essence of endearment.And yet, while she
pronounced them, she glared unceasingly at the intruders."Oh, de good
Lawd'll burn de wicked!"Virginia went back into the room
and stood before the deputy."Isn't there something else you could take?"I have a necklace--"

"No, miss.And there ain't nothing quite
so salable as pianos."She watched them, dry-eyed, as they carried it away.Only Mammy Easter guessed at the pain in Virginia's breast, and
that was because there was a pain in her own.They took the rosewood
what-not, but Virginia snatched the songs before the men could
touch them, and held them in her arms.They seized the mahogany
velvet-bottomed chairs, her uncle's wedding present to her mother; and,
last of all, they ruthlessly tore up the Brussels carpet, beginning near
the spot where Clarence had spilled ice-cream at one of her children's
parties.She could not bear to look into the dismantled room when they had gone.Ned closed the blinds once
more, and she herself turned the key in the lock, and went slowly up the
stairs.CHAPTER V. THE AUCTION

"Stephen," said the Judge, in his abrupt way, "there isn't a great deal
doing.Let's go over to the Secesh property sales."The seizures and intended sale of
secession property had stirred up immense bitterness and indignation in
the city.There were Unionists (lukewarm) who denounced the measure as
unjust and brutal.The feelings of Southerners, avowed and secret, may
only be surmised.Rigid ostracism was to be the price of bidding on any
goods displayed, and men who bought in handsome furniture on that day
because it was cheap have still, after forty years, cause to remember
it.It was not that Stephen feared ostracism.Anne Brinsmade was almost the
only girl left to him from among his former circle of acquaintances.The Misses Russell showed him very
plainly that they disapproved of his politics.The hospitable days at
that house were over.Miss Catherwood, when they met on the street,
pretended not to see him, and Eugenie Renault gave him but a timid nod.The loyal families to whose houses he now went were mostly Southerners,
in sentiment against forced auctions.However, he put on his coat, and sallied forth into the sharp air, the
Judge leaning on his arm."Stephen," said he, presently, "I guess I'll do a little bidding."And, if he really wished to bid,
Stephen knew likewise that no consideration would stop him."You don't approve of this proceeding, sir, I suppose," said the Judge."Then," said the Judge, tartly, "by bidding, we help to support starving
Union families.You should not be afraid to bid, sir.""I am not afraid to bid, Judge Whipple."He did not see the smile on the
Judge's face."Then you will bid in certain things for me," said Mr.Here
he hesitated, and shook free the rest of the sentence with a wrench."Colonel Carvel always had a lot of stuff I wanted.Now I've got the
chance to buy it cheap."There was silence again, for the space of a whole block.Finally,
Stephen managed to say:-- "You'll have to excuse me, sir.cried the Judge, stopping in the middle of a cross-street, so
that a wagon nearly ran over his toes."I was once a guest in Colonel Carvel's house, sir.Neither the young man nor the old knew all it was costing the other to
say these things.The Judge took a grim pleasure in eating his heart.And as for Stephen, he often went to his office through Locust Street,
which was out of his way, in the hope that he might catch a glimpse of
Virginia.He had guessed much of the privations she had gone through.He knew that the Colonel had hired out most of his slaves, and he had
actually seen the United States Police drive across Eleventh Street with
the piano that she had played on.The Judge was laughing quietly,--not a pleasant laugh to hear,--as they
came to Morgan's great warerooms.A crowd blocked the pavement, and
hustled and shoved at the doors,--roughs, and soldiers off duty, and
ladies and gentlemen whom the Judge and Stephen knew, and some of whom
they spoke to.All of these were come out of curiosity, that they might
see for themselves any who had the temerity to bid on a neighbor's
household goods.The long hall, which ran from street to street, was
packed, the people surging backward and forward, and falling roughly
against the mahogany pieces; and apologizing, and scolding, and swearing
all in a breath.The Judge, holding tightly to Stephen, pushed his way
fiercely to the stand, vowing over and over that the commotion was a
secession trick to spoil the furniture and stampede the sale.In truth,
it was at the Judge's suggestion that a blue provost's guard was called
in later to protect the seized property.How many of those mahogany pieces, so ruthlessly tumbled about before
the public eye, meant a heartache!Wedding presents of long ago, dear to
many a bride with silvered hair, had been torn from the corner where the
children had played--children who now, alas, were grown and gone to war.Yes, that was the Brussels rug that had lain before the fire, and which
the little feet had worn in the corner.Those were the chairs the little
hands had harnessed, four in a row, and fallen on its side was the
armchair--the stage coach itself.There were the books, held up to
common gaze, that a beloved parent had thumbed with affection.Yes, and
here in another part of the hall were the family horses and the family
carriage that had gone so often back and forth from church with the
happy brood of children, now scattered and gone to war.As Stephen reached his place beside the Judge, Mr.And, if glances could have killed, many a bidder would have
dropped dead.The heavy dining-room table which meant so much to the
family went for a song to a young man recently come from Yankeeland,
whose open boast it was--like Eliphalet's secret one--that he would one
day grow rich enough to snap his fingers in the face of the Southern
aristocrats.Catherwood, his face
haggard and drawn, watched the sideboard he had given his wife on her
silver wedding being sold to a pawnbroker.Stephen looked in vain for Colonel Carvel--for Virginia.He did not want
to see them there.He knew by heart the list of things which had been
taken from their house.He understood the feeling which had sent the
Judge here to bid them in.When the auctioneer came to the Carvel list, and the well-known name was
shouted out, the crowd responded with a stir and pressed closer to the
stand.And murmurs were plainly heard in more than one direction."Now, gentlemen, and ladies," said the seller, "this here is a genuine
English Rothfield piano once belonging to Colonel Carvel, and the
celebrated Judge Colfax of Kaintucky."He lingered fondly over the
names, that the impression might have time to sink deep."This here
magnificent instrument's worth at the very least" (another pause)
"twelve hundred dollars.He struck a base note of the keys, then a treble, and they vibrated
in the heated air of the big hall.Had he hit the little C of the top
octave, the tinkle of that also might have been heard."Gentlemen and ladies, we have to begin somewheres.A menacing murmur gave place to the accusing silence.Some there were
who gazed at the Rothfield with longing eyes, but who had no intention
of committing social suicide.Suddenly a voice, the rasp of which
penetrated to St.The owner was
a seedy man with a straw-, drunkard's mustache.He was leaning
against the body of Mrs.Russell's barouche (seized for sale), and those
about him shrank away as from smallpox.His hundred-dollar offer was
followed by a hiss.When Judge Whipple drew himself up to his full six feet, that was a
warning to those that knew him.As he doubled the bid, the words came
out with the aggressive distinctness of a man who through a long life
has been used to opposition.He with the gnawed yellow mustache pushed
himself clear of the barouche, his smouldering cigar butt dropping to
the floor.And this is how Judge Whipple braved public opinion once more.As he
stood there, defiant, many were the conjectures as to what he could wish
to do with the piano of his old friend.Those who knew the Judge (and
there were few who did not) pictured to themselves the dingy little
apartment where he lived, and smiled.Whatever his detractors might have
said of him, no one was ever heard to avow that he had bought or sold
anything for gain.Could it have been of admiration for
the fine old man who towered there glaring defiance at those about him?"Give me a strong and consistent enemy," some great personage has said,
"rather than a lukewarm friend."Three score and five years the Judge
had lived, and now some were beginning to suspect that he had a heart.But it was let out to many more
that day, and they went home praising him who had once pronounced his
name with bitterness.Before he of the yellow mustache could pick up
his cigar from the floor and make another bid, the Judge had cried out
a sum which was the total of Colonel Carvel's assessment.Many recall
to this day how fiercely he frowned when the applause broke forth
of itself; and when he turned to go they made a path for him, in
admiration, the length of the hall, down which he stalked, looking
neither to the right nor left.Stephen followed him, thankful for the
day which had brought him into the service of such a man.And so it came about that the other articles were returned to Colonel
Carvel with the marshal's compliments, and put back into the cold parlor
where they had stood for many years.The men who brought them offered to
put down the carpet, but by Virginia's orders the rolls were stood up in
the corner, and the floor left bare.And days passed into weeks, and no
sign or message came from Judge Whipple in regard to the piano he had
bought.Virginia did not dare mention it to the Colonel.It had been carried by six sweating <DW64>s up the
narrow stairs into the Judge's office.Whipple's orders cleared a corner of his inner office and bedroom of
papers and books and rubbish, and there the bulky instrument was finally
set up.The Judge watched the
proceeding grimly, choking now and again from the dust that was raised,
yet uttering never a word.He locked the lid when the van man handed him
the key, and thrust that in his pocket.Stephen had of late found enough to do in St.He was the kind of
man to whom promotions came unsought, and without noise.In the autumn
he had been made a captain in the Halleck Guards of the State Militia,
as a reward for his indefatigable work in the armories and his knowledge
of tactics.Twice his company had been called out at night, and once
they made a campaign as far as the Merimec and captured a party of
recruits who were destined for Jefferson Davis.Brinsmade heard of his promotion and this exploit, and yet scarcely
a day went by that he did not see the young man at the big hospital.For
Stephen helped in the work of the Sanitary Commission too, and so strove
to make up in zeal for the service in the field which he longed to give.Brinsmade moved out to their place on the
Bellefontaine Road.This was to force Anne to take a rest.For the
girl was worn out with watching at the hospitals, and with tending
the destitute mothers and children from the ranks of the refugees.The
Brinsmade place was not far from the Fair Grounds,--now a receiving
camp for the crude but eager regiments of the Northern states.Brinsmade's, when the day's duty was done, the young Union officers
used to ride, and often there would be half a dozen of them to tea.That
house, and other great houses on the Bellefontaine Road with which this
history has no occasion to deal, were as homes to many a poor fellow who
would never see home again.Sometimes Anne would gather together such
young ladies of her acquaintance from the neighbor hood and the city as
their interests and sympathies permitted to waltz with a Union officer,
and there would be a little dance.To these dances Stephen Brice was
usually invited.One such occasion occurred on a Friday in January, and Mr.Brinsmade
himself called in his buggy and drove Stephen to the country early in
the afternoon.He and Anne went for a walk along the river, the surface
of which was broken by lumps of yellow ice.Gray clouds hung low in the
sky as they picked their way over the frozen furrows of the ploughed
fields.The grass was all a yellow-brown, but the north wind which
swayed the bare trees brought a touch of color to Anne's cheeks.Before
they realized where they were, they had nearly crossed the Bellegarde
estate, and the house itself was come into view, standing high on the
<DW72> above the withered garden."The shutters are up," said Stephen.Colfax had
come out here not long a--"

"She came out for a day just before Christina," said Anne, smiling, "and
then she ran off to Kentucky.I think she was afraid that she was one of
the two women on the list of Sixty.""It must have been a blow to her pride when she found that she was not,"
said Stephen, who had a keen remembrance of her conduct upon a certain
Sunday not a year gone.Impelled by the same inclination, they walked in silence to the house
and sat down on the edge of the porch.The only motion in the view was
the smoke from the slave quarters twisting in the wind, and the hurrying
ice in the stream.said Anne, with a sigh, "how she loved to romp!What good
times we used to have here together!"But you could not make her show
it.The other morning when she came out to our house I found her sitting
at the piano.I am sure there were tears in her eyes, but she would not
let me see them.She made some joke about Spencer Catherwood running
away.What do you think the Judge will do with that piano, Stephen?""The day after they put it in his room he came in with a great black
cloth, which he spread over it.And Anne, turning to him timidly, gave him a long,
searching look."I think that we ought to go back."They went out by the long entrance road, through the naked woods.Only a little while before he had had one of those
vivid dreams of Virginia which left their impression, but not their
substance, to haunt him.On those rare days following the dreams her
spirit had its mastery over his.He pictured her then with a glow on her
face which was neither sadness nor mirth,--a glow that ministered to
him alone.And yet, he did not dare to think that he might have won her,
even if politics and war had not divided them.When the merriment of the dance was at its height that evening, Stephen
stood at the door of the long room, meditatively watching the bright
gowns and the flash of gold on the uniforms as they flitted past.Presently the opposite door opened, and he heard Mr.Brinsmade's voice
mingling with another, the excitable energy of which recalled some
familiar episode.Almost--so it seemed--at one motion, the owner of the
voice had come out of the door and had seized Stephen's hand in a warm
grasp,--a tall and spare figure in the dress of a senior officer.The
military frock, which fitted the man's character rather than the man,
was carelessly open, laying bare a gold-buttoned white waistcoat and an
expanse of shirt bosom which ended in a black stock tie.The ends of the
collar were apart the width of the red clipped beard, and the mustache
was cropped straight along the line of the upper lip.The forehead rose
high, and was brushed carelessly free of the hair.The nose was almost
straight, but combative."The boy doesn't remember me," said the gentleman, in quick tones,
smiling at Mr."Yes, sir, I do," Stephen made haste to answer.He glanced at the star
on the shoulder strap, and said."Now in command at Camp Benton, Stephen," Mr."Won't
you sit down, General?""No," said the General, emphatically waving away the chair.Then his keen face suddenly lighted with amusement,--and
mischief, Stephen thought."So you've heard of me since we met, sir?"Guess you heard I was crazy," said the General, in his downright
way."He's been reading the lies in the newspapers too, Brinsmade," the
General went on rapidly."I'll make 'em eat their newspapers for saying
I was crazy.That's the Secretary of War's doings.Ever tell you what
Cameron did, Brinsmade?He and his party were in Louisville last fall,
when I was serving in Kentucky, and came to my room in the Galt House.Well, we locked the door, and Miller sent us up a good lunch and wine,
After lunch, the Secretary lay on my bed, and we talked things over.He
asked me what I thought about things in Kentucky.Secretary, here is the whole Union line from the
Potomac to Kansas.Here's McClellan in the East with one hundred miles
of front.Here's Fremont in the West with one hundred miles.Here we
are in Kentucky, in the centre, with three hundred miles to defend.McClellan has a hundred thousand men, Fremont has sixty thousand.You
give us fellows with over three hundred miles only eighteen thousand.''Two hundred
thousand before we get through,' said I. Cameron pitched up his hands
in the air.says he, 'where are they to come from?''The
northwest is chuck full of regiments you fellows at Washington won't
accept,' said I.Secretary, you'll need 'em all and
more before we get done with this Rebellion.'Well, sir, he was very
friendly before we finished, and I thought the thing was all thrashed
out.he goes back to Washington and gives it out that I'm
crazy, and want two hundred thousand men in Kentucky.Then I am ordered
to report to Halleck in Missouri here, and he calls me back from Sedalia
because he believes the lies."Stephen, who had in truth read the stories in question a month or two
before, could not conceal his embarrassment He looked at the man in
front of him,--alert, masterful intelligent, frank to any stranger who
took his fancy,--and wondered how any one who had talked to him could
believe them."They have to print something, General," he said."I'll give 'em something to print later on," answered the General,
grimly."Brinsmade, you fellows did have
a session with Fremont, didn't you?Anderson sent me over here last
September, and the first man I ran across at the Planters' House was
Appleton. ''To see Fremont,'
I said.'You don't think
Fremont'll see you, do you?''Well,' says Tom, 'go
'round to his palace at six to-morrow morning and bribe that Hungarian
prince who runs his body-guard to get you a good place in the line of
senators and governors and first citizens, and before nightfall you
may get a sight of him, since you come from Anderson.Not one man in
a hundred,' says Appleton, I not one man in a hundred, reaches his
chief-of-staff.'Next morning," the General continued in a staccato
which was often his habit, "had breakfast before daybreak and went
'round there.Place just swarming with Californians--army contracts."More
Californians, and by gad--old Baron Steinberger with his nose hanging
over the register.""Fremont was a little difficult to get at, General," said Mr."Things were confused and discouraged when those first contracts were
awarded.Fremont was a good man, and it wasn't his fault that the
inexperience of his quartermasters permitted some of those men to get
rich."To be sure
he was--didn't get along with Blair.These court-martials you're having
here now have stirred up the whole country.I guess we'll hear now how
those fortunes were made.To listen to those witnesses lie about each
other on the stand is better than the theatre."Stephen laughed at the comical and vivid manner in which the General set
this matter forth.He himself had been present one day of the sittings
of the court-martial when one of the witnesses on the prices of mules
was that same seedy man with the straw- mustache who had bid for
Virginia's piano against the Judge."Come, Stephen," said the General, abruptly, "run and snatch one of
those pretty girls from my officers."They deserve more, sir," answered Stephen.Whereupon the General laid
his hand impulsively on the young man's shoulder, divining what Stephen
did not say.said be; "you are doing the work in this war, not we.We
do the damage--you repair it.Brinsmade and you
gentlemen who help him, where would our Western armies be?Don't you
go to the front yet a while, young man.We need the best we have
in reserve.""You've had military
training of some sort?""He's a captain in the Halleck Guards, sir," said Mr.Brinsmade,
generously, "and the best drillmaster we've had in this city.He's seen
service, too, General."Stephen reddened furiously and started to protest, when the General
cried:-- "It's more than I have in this war.Come, come, I knew he was a
soldier.Let's see what kind of a strategist he'll make.Brinsmade, have
you got such a thing as a map?"Brinsmade had, and led the way back
into the library.The General shut the door, lighted a cigar with a
single vigorous stroke of a match, and began to smoke with quick puffs.Stephen was puzzled how to receive the confidences the General was
giving out with such freedom.When the map was laid on the table, the General drew a pencil from his
pocket and pointed to the state of Kentucky.Then he drew a line from
Columbus to Bowling Green, through Forts Donelson and Henry."Now, Stephen," said he, "there's the Rebel line.Show me the proper
place to break it."Stephen hesitated a while, and then pointed at the centre.He drew a heavy line across the
first, and it ran almost in the bed of the Tennessee River."Very question Halleck asked me the other day, and that's
how I answered it.Now, gentlemen, there's a man named Grant down in
that part of the country.Ever heard of him,
Brinsmade?He used to live here once, and a year ago he was less than I
was.The recollection of the scene in the street by the Arsenal that May
morning not a year gone came to Stephen with a shock."I saw him," he cried; "he was Captain Grant that lived on the Gravois
Road.But surely this can't be the same man who seized Paducah and was
in that affair at Belmont."They kicked him around Springfield awhile, after
the war broke out, for a military carpet-bagger.Then they gave him for
a regiment the worst lot of ruffians you ever laid eyes on.He made 'em march halfway across the
state instead of taking the cars the Governor offered.I guess
he is the man that chased the Rebs out of Belmont.Then his boys broke
loose when they got into the town.The Rebs
came back and chased 'em out into their boats on the river.Brinsmade,
you remember hearing about that."Grant did the coolest thing you ever saw.He sat on his horse at the
top of the bluff while the boys fell over each other trying to get on
the boat.Yes, sir, he sat there, disgusted, on his horse, smoking a
cigar, with the Rebs raising pandemonium all around him.And then, sir,"
cried the General, excitedly, "what do you think he did?Hanged if he
didn't force his horse right on to his haunches, slide down the whole
length of the bank and ride him across a teetering plank on to the
steamer.And the Rebs just stood on the bank and stared.They were so
astonished they didn't even shoot the man."And now, Stephen," he added, "just you run off and take hold
of the prettiest girl you can find.If any of my boys object, say I sent
you."It was little Tiefel, now a first
lieutenant with a bristly beard and tanned face, come to town on a few
days' furlough.He had been with Lyon at Wilson's Creek, and he had
a sad story to tell of how he found poor Richter, lying stark on that
bloody field, with a smile of peace upon his face.Strange that he
should at length have been killed by a sabre!It was a sad meeting for those two, since each reminded the other of
a dear friend they would see no more on earth.They went out to sup
together in the German style; and gradually, over his beer, Tiefel
forgot his sorrow.Stephen listened with an ache to the little man's
tales of the campaigns he had been through.So that presently Tiefel
cried out:

"Why, my friend, you are melancholy as an owl."He is no more crazy than I am," said Stephen, warmly--

"Is he not?"answered Tiefel, "then I will show you a mistake.You
recall last November he was out to Sedalia to inspect the camp there,
and he sleeps in a little country store where I am quartered.Now up
gets your General Sherman in the middle of the night,--midnight,--and
marches up and down between the counters, and waves his arms.So, says
he, 'land so,' says he, 'Sterling Price will be here, and Steele here,
and this column will take that road, and so-and-so's a damned fool.So he walks up and down for three eternal hours.Says
he, 'Pope has no business to be at Osterville, and Steele here at
Sedalia with his regiments all over the place.They must both go into
camp at La Mine River, and form brigades and divisions, that the troops
may be handled.'""If that's insanity," cried Stephen so strongly as to surprise the
little man; "then I wish we had more insane generals.It just shows
how a malicious rumor will spread.What Sherman said about Pope's and
Steele's forces is true as Gospel, and if you ever took the trouble to
look into that situation, Tiefel, you would see it."And Stephen brought
down his mug on the table with a crash that made the bystanders jump.It was not a month after that that Sherman's prophecy of the quiet
general who had slid down the bluff at Belmont came true.The whole
country bummed with Grant's praises.Moving with great swiftness and
secrecy up the Tennessee, in company with the gunboats of Commodore
Foote, he had pierced the Confederate line at the very point Sherman
had indicated.Fort Henry had fallen, and Grant was even then moving to
besiege Donelson.Brinsmade prepared to leave at once for the battlefield, taking with
him too Paducah physicians and nurses.All day long the boat was loading
with sanitary stores and boxes of dainties for the wounded.It was muggy
and wet--characteristic of that winter--as Stephen pushed through the
drays on the slippery levee to the landing.He had with him a basket his mother had put up.Brinsmade from the Judge It was while he was picking his way
along the crowded decks that he ran into General Sherman.The General
seized him unceremoniously by the shoulder."Good-by, Stephen," he said."Good-by, General," said Stephen, shifting his basket to shake hands."Ordered to Paducah," said the General.He pulled Stephen off the guards
into an empty cabin."Brice," said he, earnestly, "I haven't forgotten
how you saved young Brinsmade at Camp Jackson.They tell me that you are
useful here.I say, don't go in unless you have to.I don't mean force,
you understand.But when you feel that you can go in, come to me or
write me a letter.That is," he added, seemingly inspecting Stephen's
white teeth with approbation, "if you're not afraid to serve under a
crazy man."It has been said that the General liked the lack of effusiveness of
Stephen's reply.ELIPHALET PLAYS HIS TRUMPS

Summer was come again.Through interminable days, the sun beat down upon
the city; and at night the tortured bricks flung back angrily the heat
with which he had filled them.Great battles had been fought, and vast
armies were drawing breath for greater ones to come."Jinny," said the Colonel one day, "as we don't seem to be much use in
town, I reckon we may as well go to Glencoe."Virginia, threw her arms around her father's neck.For many months
she had seen what the Colonel himself was slow to comprehend--that his
usefulness was gone.The days melted into weeks, and Sterling Price and
his army of liberation failed to come.The vigilant Union general and
his aides had long since closed all avenues to the South.For, one fine
morning toward the end of the previous summer, when the Colonel was
contemplating a journey, he had read that none might leave the city
without a pass, whereupon he went hurriedly to the office of the Provost
Marshal.There he had found a number of gentlemen in the same plight,
each waving a pass made out by the Provost Marshal's clerks, and waiting
for that officer's signature.The Colonel also procured one of these,
and fell into line.The Marshal gazed at the crowd, pulled off his coat,
and readily put his name to the passes of several gentlemen going east.Bub Ballington, whom the Colonel knew, but pretended not
to."Not very profitable to be a minute-man, eh?"Ballington trying not to look indignant
as he makes for the door.A small silver bell rings on the Marshal's
desk, the one word: "Spot!"breaks the intense silence, which is one way
of saying that Mr.Ballington is detained, and will probably be lodged
that night at Government expense."Well, Colonel Carvel, what can I do for you this morning?"asked the
Marshal, genially.The Colonel pushed back his hat and wiped his brow."I reckon I'll wait
till next week, Captain," said Mr."It's pretty hot to travel
just now."There were many in the office who
would have liked to laugh, but it did not pay to laugh at some people.In the proclamation of martial law was much to make life less endurable
than ever.All who were convicted by a court-martial of being rebels
were to have property confiscated, and slaves set free.Then there was
a certain oath to be taken by all citizens who did not wish to have
guardians appointed over their actions.There were many who swallowed
this oath and never felt any ill effects.Jacob Cluyme was one, and
came away feeling very virtuous.Hopper did not have indigestion after taking it, but
Colonel Carvel would sooner have eaten, gooseberry pie, which he had
never tasted but once.That summer had worn away, like a monster which turns and gives hot
gasps when you think it has expired.It took the Arkansan just a month,
under Virginia's care, to become well enough to be sent to a Northern
prison He was not precisely a Southern gentleman, and he went to sleep
over the "Idylls of the King."But he was admiring, and grateful, and
wept when he went off to the boat with the provost's guard, destined
for a Northern prison.He had taken her away from
her aunt (who would have nothing to do with him), and had given her
occupation.She nor her father never tired of hearing his rough tales of
Price's rough army.His departure was about the time when suspicions were growing set.The
favor had caused comment and trouble, hence there was no hope of giving
another sufferer the same comfort.One of
the mysterious gentlemen who had been seen in the vicinity of Colonel
Carvel's house was arrested on the ferry, but he had contrived to be rid
of the carpet-sack in which certain precious letters were carried.Hopper's visits to Locust Street had
continued at intervals of painful regularity.It is not necessary to
dwell upon his brilliant powers of conversation, nor to repeat the
platitudes which he repeated, for there was no significance in Mr.The Colonel had found that out, and was
thankful.His manners were better; his English decidedly better.It was for her father's sake, of course, that Virginia bore with
him.She tried to be just, and it
occurred to her that she had never before been just.Again and again she
repeated to herself that Eliphalet's devotion to the Colonel at this
low ebb of his fortunes had something in it of which she did not suspect
him.Hopper as an uneducated Yankee
and a person of commercial ideals.But now he was showing virtues,--if
virtues they were,--and she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.With his great shrewdness and business ability, why did he not take
advantage of the many opportunities the war gave to make a fortune?For Virginia had of late been going to the store with the Colonel,--who
spent his mornings turning over piles of dusty papers, and Mr.Hopper
had always been at his desk.After this, Virginia even strove to be kind to him, but it was uphill
work.The front door never closed after one of his visits that suspicion
was not left behind.Could it be that
there was a motive under all this plotting?He struck her inevitably as
the kind who would be content to mine underground to attain an end.The
worst she could think of him was that he wished to ingratiate himself
now, in the hope that, when the war was ended, he might become a partner
in Mr.She had put even this away as unworthy of her.Once she had felt compelled to speak to her father on the subject."I believe I did him an injustice, Pa," she said."Not that I like him
any better now.But I do think that if he had been as unscrupulous as I thought, he
would have deserted you long ago for something more profitable.He would
not be sitting in the office day after day making plans for the business
when the war is over."She remembered how sadly he had smiled at her over the top of his paper."You are a good girl, Jinny," he said.Toward the end of July of that second summer riots broke out in the
city, and simultaneously a bright spot appeared on Virginia's horizon.This took the form, for Northerners, of a guerilla scare, and an order
was promptly issued for the enrollment of all the able-bodied men in the
ten wards as militia, subject to service in the state, to exterminate
the roving bands.Whereupon her Britannic Majesty became extremely
popular,--even with some who claimed for a birthplace the Emerald Isle.Hundreds who heretofore had valued but lightly their British citizenship
made haste to renew their allegiance; and many sought the office of the
English Consul whose claims on her Majesty's protection were vague, to
say the least.For the first time,
when Virginia walked to the store with her father, Eliphalet was not
there."I don't blame him for not wanting to fight for the Yankees," she said."Then why doesn't he fight for the South he asked"

"Fight for the South!""I reckon not, too," said the Colonel, dryly.For the following week curiosity prompted Virginia to take that walk
with the Colonel.Hopper being still absent, she helped him to sort
the papers--those grimy reminders of a more prosperous time gone
by.Carvel would run across one which seemed to bring some
incident to his mind; for he would drop it absently on his desk, his
hand seeking his chin, and remain for half an hour lost in thought.The Colonel answered
them all truthfully--generally with that dangerous suavity for which he
was noted.Twice a seedy man with a gnawed yellow mustache had come in
to ask Eliphalet's whereabouts.On the second occasion this individual
became importunate."You don't know nothin' about him, you say?""I 'low I kin 'lighten you a little.""Good day, sir," said the Colonel."I guess you'll like to hear what I've got to say."Carvel in his natural voice, "show this man out."Ford slunk out without Ephum's assistance.But he half turned at the
door, and shot back a look that frightened Virginia."Oh, Pa," she cried, in alarm, "what did he mean?""I couldn't tell you, Jinny," he answered.But she noticed that he was
very thoughtful as they walked home.The next morning Eliphalet had not
returned, but a corporal and guard were waiting to search the store for
him.The Colonel read the order, and invited them in with hospitality.He even showed them the way upstairs, and presently Virginia heard them
all tramping overhead among the bales.Her eye fell upon the paper they
had brought, which lay unfolded on her father's desk.It was signed
Stephen A. Brice, Enrolling Officer.That very afternoon they moved to Glencoe, and Ephum was left in sole
charge of the store.At Glencoe, far from the hot city and the cruel
war, began a routine of peace.Virginia was a child again, romping
in the woods and fields beside her father.The color came back to her
cheeks once more, and the laughter into her voice.The two of them, and
Ned and Mammy, spent a rollicking hour in the pasture the freedom
of which Dick had known so long, before the old horse was caught and
brought back into bondage.After that Virginia took long drives with her
father, and coming home, they would sit in the summer house high above
the Merimec, listening to the crickets' chirp, and watching the day fade
upon the water.The Colonel, who had always detested pipes, learned to
smoke a corncob.He would sit by the hour, with his feet on the rail of
the porch and his hat tilted back, while Virginia read to him.Poe
and Wordsworth and Scott he liked, but Tennyson was his favorite.One afternoon when Virginia was sitting in the summer house alone, her
thoughts wandering back, as they sometimes did, to another afternoon
she had spent there,--it seemed so long ago,--when she saw Mammy Easter
coming toward her."Honey, dey's comp'ny up to de house.He's
on de porch, talkin' to your Pa.In truth, the solid figure of Eliphalet himself was on the path some
twenty yards behind her.His hat was in his hand; his hair was plastered
down more neatly than ever, and his coat was a faultless and sober
creation of a Franklin Avenue tailor.He carried a cane, which was
unheard of.Virginia sat upright, and patted her skirts with a gesture
of annoyance--what she felt was anger, resentment.Suddenly she rose,
swept past Mammy, and met him ten paces from the summer house."How-dy-do, Miss Virginia," he cried pleasantly."Your father had a
notion you might be here."Her greeting would have frozen a man
of ardent temperament.But it was not precisely ardor that Eliphalet
showed.There was something in
the man's air to-day.Her words seemed to relieve some tension in him."Well, I did, first of all.You're considerable smart, Miss Jinny, but
I'll bet you can't tell me where I was, now.""I cal'lated it might interest you to know
how I dodged the Sovereign State of Missouri.General Halleck made an
order that released a man from enrolling on payment of ten dollars.Then I was drafted into the Abe Lincoln Volunteers; I paid a
substitute.And so here I be, exercising life, and liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.""If your substitute gets
killed, I suppose you will have cause for congratulation."Eliphalet laughed, and pulled down his cuffs."That's his lookout,
I cal'late," said he.He glanced at the girl in a way that made her
vaguely uneasy.She turned from him, back toward the summer house.Eliphalet's eyes smouldered as they rested upon her figure."I've heard considerable about the beauties of this place.Would you
mind showing me 'round a bit?"Not since that first evening in Locust Street had it taken on such
assurance, And yet she could not be impolite to a guest."Certainly not," she replied, but without looking up.He came to the summer house, glanced around it with apparent
satisfaction, and put his foot on the moss-grown step.She leaped quickly into the doorway before him, and
stood facing him, framed in the climbing roses.He drew back,
staring in astonishment at the crimson in her face.She had been groping
wildly for excuses, and found none."Because," she said, "because I ask you not to."With dignity: "That
should be sufficient.""Well," replied Eliphalet, with an abortive laugh, "that's funny, now.Womenkind get queer notions, which I cal'late we've got to respect and
put up with all our lives--eh?"Her anger flared at his leer and at his broad way of gratifying her
whim.And she was more incensed than ever at his air of being at
home--it was nothing less.She strove still to hide her
resentment."There is a walk along the bluff," she said, coldly, "where the view is
just as good."But she purposely drew him into the right-hand path, which led, after
a little, back to the house.Despite her pace he pressed forward to her
side."Miss Jinny," said he, precipitately, "did I ever strike you as a
marrying man?"Virginia stopped, and put her handkerchief to her face, the impulse
strong upon her to laugh.Eliphalet was suddenly transformed again into
the common commercial Yankee.He was in love, and had come to ask her
advice."I never thought of you as of the marrying kind, Mr.Hopper," she
answered, her voice quivering.Indeed, he was irresistibly funny as he stood hot and ill at ease.The
Sunday coat bore witness to his increasing portliness by creasing across
from the buttons; his face, fleshy and perspiring, showed purple veins,
and the little eyes receded comically, like a pig's."Well, I've been thinking serious of late about getting married," he
continued, slashing the rose bushes with his stick."I don't cal'late
to be a sentimental critter.I'm not much on high-sounding phrases, and
such things, but I'd give you my word I'd make a good husband.""Please be careful of those roses, Mr."Beg pardon," said Eliphalet.He began to lose track of his tenses--that
was the only sign he gave of perturbation.Louis
without a cent, Miss Jinny, I made up my mind I'd be a rich man before
I left it.If I was to die now, I'd have kept that promise.I'm not
thirty-four, and I cal'late I've got as much money in a safe place as a
good many men you call rich.I'm not saying what I've got, mind you.I've stopped chewing--there was a time when I
done that."That is all very commendable, Mr.Hopper," Virginia said, stifling a
rebellious titter."But,--but why did you give up chewing?""I am informed that the ladies are against it," said Eliphalet,--"dead
against it.You wouldn't like it in a husband, now, would you?"This time the laugh was not to be put down."I confess I shouldn't," she
said."Thought so," he replied, as one versed.His tones took on a nasal
twang."Well, as I was saying, I've about got ready to settle down, and
I've had my eye on the lady this seven years.""The lady," said Eliphalet, bluntly, "is you."He glanced at her
bewildered face and went on rapidly: "You pleased me the first day I set
eyes on you in the store I said to myself, 'Hopper, there's the one for
you to marry.'I'm plain, but my folks was good people.I set to work
right then to make a fortune for you, Miss Jinny.I'm a plain business man with no frills.You're the kind that was raised in the lap of luxury.You'll need a man
with a fortune, and a big one; you're the sort to show it off.I've got
the foundations of that fortune, and the proof of it right here.And I
tell you,"--his jaw was set,--"I tell you that some day Eliphalet Hopper
will be one of the richest men in the West."He had stopped, facing her in the middle of the way, his voice strong,
his confidence supreme.At first she had stared at him in dumb wonder.Then, as she began to grasp the meaning of his harangue, astonishment
was still dominant,--sheer astonishment.But,
as he finished, the thatch of the summer house caught her eye.A vision
arose of a man beside whom Eliphalet was not worthy to crawl.She
thought of Stephen as he had stood that evening in the sunset, and this
proposal seemed a degradation.But she caught the look on Eliphalet's
face, and she knew that he would not understand.This was one who
rose and fell, who lived and loved and hated and died and was buried
by--money.For a second she looked into his face as one who escapes a pit gazes
over the precipice, and shuddered.As for Eliphalet, let it not be
thought that he had no passion.This was the moment for which he had
lived since the day he had first seen her and been scorned in the store.That type of face, that air,--these were the priceless things he would
buy with his money.Crazed with the very violence of his long-pent
desire, he seized her hand.He staggered back, and stood for a moment motionless, as though stunned.Then, slowly, a light crept into his little eyes which haunted her for
many a day."You--won't--marry me?"exclaimed Virginia, her face burning with
the shame of it.She was standing with her hands behind her, her back
against a great walnut trunk, the crusted branches of which hung over
the bluff.Even as he looked at her, Eliphalet lost his head, and
indiscretion entered his soul.You've got no notion of my
money, I say."If you owned the whole of
California, I would not marry you."He
slipped his hand into a pocket, as one used to such a motion, and drew
out some papers."I cal'late you ain't got much idea of the situation, Miss Carvel," he
said; "the wheels have been a-turning lately.You're poor, but I guess
you don't know how poor you are,--eh?The Colonel's a man of honor,
ain't he?"For her life she could not have answered,--nor did she even know why she
stayed to listen."Well," he said, "after all, there ain't much use in your lookin' over
them papers.I'll tell you what they say: they
say that if I choose, I am Carvel & Company."The little eyes receded, and he waited a moment, seemingly to prolong a
physical delight in the excitement and suffering of a splendid creature."I cal'late you despise me, don't you?"he went on, as if that, too,
gave him pleasure."But I tell you the Colonel's a beggar but for me.All you've got to do is to say you'll be my
wife, and I tear these notes in two.(He
made the motion with his hands.)"Carvel & Company's an old firm,--a
respected firm.You wouldn't care to see it go out of the family, I
cal'late."But she did none of the things he expected.She said, simply:--"Will you please follow me, Mr.And he followed her,--his shrewdness gone, for once.Save for the rise and fall of her shoulders she seemed calm.The path
wound through a jungle of waving sunflowers and led into the shade in
front of the house.His
pipe lay with its scattered ashes on the boards, and his head was bent
forward, as though listening.When he saw the two, he rose expectantly,
and went forward to meet them."Pa," she said, "is it true that you have borrowed money from this man?"Carvel angry once, and his soul had quivered.Terror, abject terror, seized him now, so that his knees smote together.As well stare into the sun as into the Colonel's face.In one stride
he had a hand in the collar of Eliphalet's new coat, the other pointing
down the path."It takes just a minute to walk to that fence, sir," he said sternly."If you are any longer about it, I reckon you'll never get past it.Hopper's gait down the flagstones was
an invention of his own.It was neither a walk, nor a trot, nor a run,
but a sort of sliding amble, such as is executed in nightmares.Singing
in his head was the famous example of the eviction of Babcock from the
store,--the only time that the Colonel's bullet had gone wide.And down
in the small of his back Eliphalet listened for the crack of a pistol,
and feared that a clean hole might be bored there any minute.Once
outside, he took to the white road, leaving a trail of dust behind him
that a wagon might have raised.Fear lent him wings, but neglected to
lift his feet.The Colonel passed his arm around his daughter, and pulled his goatee
thoughtfully.And Virginia, glancing shyly upward, saw a smile in the
creases about his mouth: She smiled, too, and then the tears hid him
from her.Strange that the face which in anger withered cowards and made men look
grave, was capable of such infinite tenderness,--tenderness and sorrow.The Colonel took Virginia in his arms, and she sobbed against his
shoulder, as of old."Yes--"

"Lige was right, and--and you, Jinny--I should never have trusted him.The sun was slanting in yellow bars through
the branches of the great trees, and a robin's note rose above the bass
chorus of the frogs.In the pauses, as she listened, it seemed as if she
could hear the silver sound of the river over the pebbles far below."Honey," said the Colonel,--"I reckon we're just as poor as white
trash.""Honey," he said again, after a pause, "I must keep my word and let him
have the business.""There is a little left, a very little," he continued slowly, painfully.It was left you by Becky--by your mother.It is in a railroad company in New York, and safe, Jinny.""Oh, Pa, you know that I do not care," she cried."It shall be yours and
mine together.And we shall live out here and be happy."He was in his familiar
posture of thought, his legs slightly apart, his felt hat pushed back,
stroking his goatee.But his clear gray eyes were troubled as they
sought hers, and she put her hand to her breast."Virginia," he said, "I fought for my country once, and I reckon I'm
some use yet awhile.It isn't right that I should idle here, while
the South needs me, Your Uncle Daniel is fifty-eight, and Colonel of a
Pennsylvania regiment.--Jinny, I have to go."It was in her blood as well as his.The Colonel
had left his young wife, to fight in Mexico; he had come home to lay
flowers on her grave.She knew that he thought of this; and, too, that
his heart was rent at leaving her.She put her hands on his shoulders,
and he stooped to kiss her trembling lips.They walked out together to the summer-house, and stood watching the
glory of the light on the western hills."Jinn," said the Colonel, "I
reckon you will have to go to your Aunt Lillian.But I know that my girl can take care of herself.In case--in case I do
not come back, or occasion should arise, find Lige.Let him take you to
your Uncle Daniel.He is fond of you, and will be all alone in Calvert
House when the war is over.And I reckon that is all I have to say.I
won't pry into your heart, honey.I
like the boy, and I believe he will quiet down into a good man."Virginia did not answer, but reached out for her father's hand and held
its fingers locked tight in her own.From the kitchen the sound of Ned's
voice rose in the still evening air."Sposin' I was to go to N' Orleans an' take sick and die,
     Laik a bird into de country ma spirit would fly."And after a while down the path the red and yellow of Mammy Easter's
bandanna was seen.Laws, if I ain't ramshacked de premises fo' you
bof.De co'n bread's gittin' cold."That evening the Colonel and Virginia thrust a few things into her
little leather bag they had chosen together in London.Virginia had
found a cigar, which she hid until they went down to the porch, and
there she gave it to him; when he lighted the match she saw that his
hand shook.Half an hour later he held her in his arms at the gate, and she heard
his firm tread die in the dust of the road.WITH THE ARMIES OF THE WEST

We are at Memphis,--for a while,--and the Christmas season is
approaching once more.And yet we must remember that war recognizes no
Christmas, nor Sunday, nor holiday.The brown river, excited by rains,
whirled seaward between his banks of yellow clay.Now the weather was
crisp and cold, now hazy and depressing, and again a downpour.A spirit possessed the place, a restless
spirit called William T. Sherman.He prodded Memphis and laid violent
hold of her.She groaned, protested, turned over, and woke up, peopled
by a new people.When these walked, they ran, and they wore a blue
uniform.Rain nor heat nor
tempest kept them in.And yet they joked, and Memphis laughed (what was
left of her), and recognized a bond of fellowship.The General joked,
and the Colonels and the Commissary and the doctors, down to the sutlers
and teamsters and the salt tars under Porter, who cursed the dishwater
Mississippi, and also a man named Eads, who had built the new-fangled
iron boxes officially known as gunboats.The like of these had
never before been seen in the waters under the earth.The loyal
citizens--loyal to the South--had been given permission to leave the
city.The General told the assistant quartermaster to hire their houses
and slaves for the benefit of the Federal Government.Likewise he laid
down certain laws to the Memphis papers defining treason.He gave
out his mind freely to that other army of occupation, the army of
speculation, that flocked thither with permits to trade in cotton.The
speculators gave the Confederates gold, which they needed most, for the
bales, which they could not use at all.The forefathers of some of these gentlemen were in old Egypt under
Pharaoh--for whom they could have had no greater respect and fear than
their descendants had in New Egypt for Grant or Sherman.And a certain acquaintance of ours
materially added to his fortune by selling in Boston the cotton which
cost him fourteen cents, at thirty cents.One day the shouting and the swearing and the running to and fro came
to a climax.Those floating freaks which were all top and drew nothing,
were loaded down to the guards with army stores and animals and wood and
men,--men who came from every walk in life.Whistles bellowed, horses neighed.The gunboats chased hither and
thither, and at length the vast processions paddled down the stream with
naval precision, under the watchful eyes of a real admiral.Residents of Memphis from the river's bank watched the pillar of smoke
fade to the southward and ruminated on the fate of Vicksburg.A little later he wrote to the
Commander-in-Chief at Washington, "The valley of the Mississippi is
America."Vicksburg taken, this vast Confederacy would be chopped in two.Night fell to the music of the paddles, to the scent of the officers'
cigars, to the blood-red vomit of the tall stacks and the smoky flame of
the torches.Then Christmas Day dawned, and there was Vicksburg lifted
two hundred feet above the fever swamps, her court-house shining in
the morning sun.Vicksburg, the well-nigh impregnable key to America's
highway.When old Vick made his plantation on the Walnut Hills, he chose
a site for a fortress of the future Confederacy that Vauban would have
delighted in.Yes, there were the Walnut Hills, high bluffs separated from the
Mississippi by tangled streams and bayous, and on their crests the
Parrotts scowled.It was a queer Christmas Day indeed, bright and warm;
no snow, no turkeys nor mince pies, no wine, but just hardtack and bacon
and foaming brown water.On the morrow the ill-assorted fleet struggled up the sluggish Yazoo,
past impenetrable forests where the cypress clutched at the keels, past
long-deserted cotton fields, until it came at last to the black ruins of
a home.It spread out by brigade
and division and regiment and company, the men splashing and paddling
through the Chickasaw and the swamps toward the bluffs.The Parrotts
began to roar.A certain regiment, boldly led, crossed the bayou at a
narrow place and swept resistless across the sodden fields to where the
bank was steepest.The fire from the battery scorched the hair of their
heads.But there they stayed, scooping out the yellow clay with torn
hands, while the Parrotts, with lowered muzzles, ploughed the <DW72> with
shells.There they stayed, while the blue lines quivered and fell back
through the forests on that short winter's afternoon, dragging their
wounded from the stagnant waters.But many were left to die in agony in
the solitude.Like a tall emblem of energy, General Sherman stood watching the attack
and repulse, his eyes ever alert.He paid no heed to the shells which
tore the limbs from the trees about him, or sent the swamp water in
thick spray over his staff.Now and again a sharp word broke from his
lips, a forceful home thrust at one of the leaders of his columns."Sixth Missouri, General," said an aide, promptly.The General sat late in the Admiral's gunboat that night, but when
he returned to his cabin in the Forest Queen, he called for a list of
officers of the Sixth Missouri.His finger slipping down the roll paused
at a name among the new second lieutenants."Yes, General, when it fell dark.""Let me see the casualties,--quick."That night a fog rolled up from the swamps, and in the morning
jack-staff was hid from pilot-house.Before the attack could be renewed,
a political general came down the river with a letter in his pocket
from Washington, by virtue of which he took possession of the three army
core, and their chief, subpoenaed the fleet and the Admiral, and went
off to capture Arkansas Post.Three weeks later, when the army was resting at Napoleon, Arkansas, a
self-contained man, with a brown beard arrived from Memphis, and took
command.He smoked incessantly in his
cabin.He had look in his face that
boded ill to any that might oppose him.Time and labor be counted
as nothing, compared with the accomplishment of an object.Back to
Vicksburg paddled the fleet and transports.Across the river from the
city, on the pasty mud behind the levee's bank were dumped Sherman's
regiments, condemned to week of ditch-digging, that the gunboats might
arrive at the bend of the Mississippi below by a canal, out of reach of
the batteries.Day in and day out they labored, officer and men.Sawing
off stumps under the water, knocking poisonous snakes by scores from the
branches, while the river rose and rose and rose, and the rain crept
by inches under their tent flies, and the enemy walked the parapet of
Vicksburg and laughed.Two gunboats accomplished the feat of running the
batteries, that their smiles might be sobered.To the young officers who were soiling their uniform with the grease of
saws, whose only fighting was against fever and water snakes, the news
of an expedition into the Vicksburg side of the river was hailed with
caps in the air.To be sure, the saw and axe, and likewise the levee and
the snakes, were to be there, too.But there was likely to be a little
fighting.The rest of the corps that was to stay watched grimly as the
detachment put off in the little 'Diligence' and 'Silver Wave'.All the night the smoke-pipes were batting against the boughs of oak and
cottonwood, and snapping the trailing vines.Some other regiments
went by another route.The ironclads, followed in hot haste by General
Sherman in a navy tug, had gone ahead, and were even then shoving with
their noses great trunks of trees in their eagerness to get behind the
Rebels.The Missouri regiment spread out along the waters, and were soon
waist deep, hewing a path for the heavier transports to come.Presently
the General came back to a plantation half under water, where Black
Bayou joins Deer Creek, to hurry the work in cleaning out that Bayou.The light transports meanwhile were bringing up more troops from a
second detachment.All through the Friday the navy great guns were
heard booming in the distance, growing quicker and quicker, until
the quivering air shook the hanging things in that vast jungle.Saws
stopped, and axes were poised over shoulders, and many times that day
the General lifted his head anxiously.As he sat down in the evening in
a slave cabin redolent with corn pone and bacon, the sound still hovered
among the trees and rolled along the still waters.It was three o'clock Saturday morning when
the sharp challenge of a sentry broke the silence.A <DW64>, white eyed,
bedraggled, and muddy, stood in the candle light under the charge of a
young lieutenant.The officer saluted, and handed the General a roll of
tobacco."I found this man in the swamp, sir.He has a message from the
Admiral--"

The General tore open the roll and took from it a piece of tissue paper
which he spread out and held under the candle.He turned to a staff
officer who had jumped from his bed and was hurrying into his coat."Kilby Smith
and all men here across creek to relief at once.I'll take canoe through
bayou to Hill's and hurry reenforcements."The staff officer paused, his hand on the latch of the door.You're not going through that sewer in a
canoe without an escort!""I guess they won't look for a needle in that haystack," the General
answered."Get back to your
regiment, Brice, if you want to go," he said.All through the painful march that
followed, though soaked in swamp water and bruised by cypress knees, he
thought of Sherman in his canoe, winding unprotected through the black
labyrinth, risking his life that more men might be brought to the rescue
of the gunboats.The story of that rescue has been told most graphically by Sherman
himself.How he picked up the men at work on the bayou and marched them
on a coal barge; how he hitched the barge to a navy tug; how he met the
little transport with a fresh load of troops, and Captain Elijah Brent's
reply when the General asked if he would follow him."As long as the
boat holds together, General."The boughs hammered
at the smoke-pipes until they went by the board, and the pilothouse fell
like a pack of cards on the deck before they had gone three miles and a
half.Then the indomitable Sherman disembarked, a lighted candle in his
hand, and led a stiff march through thicket and swamp and breast-deep
backwater, where the little drummer boys carried their drums on their
heads.At length, when they were come to some Indian mounds, they found
a picket of three, companies of the force which had reached the flat the
day before, and had been sent down to prevent the enemy from obstructing
further the stream below the fleet."The Admiral's in a bad way, sir," said the Colonel who rode up to meet
the General.Those clumsy ironclads of his can't move
backward or forward, and the Rebs have been peppering him for two days."Just then a fusillade broke from the thickets, nipping the branches from
the cottonwoods about them.The force swept forward, with the three picket companies in the swamp on
the right.And presently they came in sight of the shapeless ironclads
with their funnels belching smoke, a most remarkable spectacle.How
Porter had pushed them there was one of the miracles of the war.Then followed one of a thousand memorable incidents in the life of a
memorable man.General Sherman, jumping on the bare back of a scrawny
horse, cantered through the fields.And the bluejackets, at sight of
that familiar figure, roared out a cheer that might have shaken the
drops from the wet boughs.The Admiral and the General stood together on
the deck, their hands clasped.And the Colonel astutely remarked, as he
rode up in answer to a summons, that if Porter was the only man whose
daring could have pushed a fleet to that position, Sherman was certainly
the only man who could have got him out of it."Colonel," said the General, "that move was well executed, sir.Admiral,
did the Rebs put a bullet through your rum casks?And now," he added, wheeling on the Colonel when each had a glass
in his hand, "who was in command of that company on the right, in the
swamp?"He's a second lieutenant, General, in the Sixth Missouri.Captain
wounded at Hindman, and first lieutenant fell out down below.His name
is Brice, I believe."Some few days afterward, when the troops were slopping around again at
Young's Point, opposite Vicksburg, a gentleman arrived on a boat
from St.He paused on the levee to survey with concern and
astonishment the flood of waters behind it, and then asked an officer
the way to General Sherman's headquarters.The officer, who was greatly
impressed by the gentleman's looks, led him at once to a trestle bridge
which spanned the distance from the levee bank over the flood to a house
up to its first floor in the backwaters.The officer looked inquiringly at the gentleman, who gave his name.The officer could not repress a smile at the next thing that happened.Out hurried the General himself, with both hands outstretched.he cried, "if it isn't Brinsmade.Come right in, come
right in and take dinner.I'll send
and tell Grant you're here.Brinsmade, if it wasn't for you and your
friends on the Western Sanitary Commission, we'd all have been dead of
fever and bad food long ago.""I guess a
good many of the boys are laid up now," he added."I've come down to do what I can, General," responded Mr."I want to go through all the hospitals to see that our nurses
are doing their duty and that the stores are properly distributed.""You shall, sir, this minute," said the General.He dropped instantly
the affairs which he had on hand, and without waiting for dinner the
two gentlemen went together through the wards where the fever raged.The
General surprised his visitor by recognizing private after private in
the cots, and he always had a brief word of cheer to brighten their
faces, to make them follow him with wistful eyes as he passed beyond
them."That's poor Craig," he would say, "corporal, Third Michigan.They
tell me he can't live," and "That's Olcott, Eleventh Indiana.cried the General, when they were out in the air again, "how I wish
some of these cotton traders could get a taste of this fever.They keep
well--the vultures--And by the way, Brinsmade, the man who gave me no
peace at all at Memphis was from your city.Why, I had to keep a whole
corps on duty to watch him."As long as
I live I shall never forget it."He has always seemed
inoffensive, and I believe he is a prominent member of one of our
churches.""I guess that's so," answered the General, dryly."I ever I set eyes on
him again, he's clapped into the guardhouse.Brinsmade, presently, "have
you ever heard of Stephen Brice?You may
remember talking to him one evening at my house."He
paused on the very brink of relating again the incident at Camp Jackson,
when Stephen had saved the life of Mr."Brinsmade,
for three days I've had it on my mind to send for that boy.I like him," cried General Sherman, with tone
and gesture there was no mistaking.Brinsmade, who liked
Stephen, too, rejoiced at the story he would have to tell the widow."He
has spirit, Brinsmade.I told him to let me know when he was ready to go
to war.The first thing I hear of
him is that he's digging holes in the clay of Chickasaw Bluff, and his
cap is fanned off by the blast of a Parrott six feet above his head.Next thing he turns up on that little expedition we took to get Porter
to sea again.When we got to the gunboats, there was Brice's company
on the flank.He handled those men surprisingly, sir--surprisingly.I
shouldn't have blamed the boy if one or two Rebs got by him.But no, he
swept the place clean."By this time they had come back to the bridge
leading to headquarters, and the General beckoned quickly to an orderly."My compliments to Lieutenant Stephen Brice, Sixth Missouri, and ask him
to report here at once.Brice's company were swinging axes when the
orderly arrived, and Mr.Brice had an axe himself, and was up to his
boot tops in yellow mud.The orderly, who had once been an Iowa farmer, was near grinning when he
gave the General's message and saw the lieutenant gazing ruefully at his
clothes.Entering headquarters, Stephen paused at the doorway of the big room
where the officers of the different staffs were scattered about,
smoking, while the <DW64> servants were removing the dishes from the
table.The sunlight, reflected from the rippling water outside, danced
on the ceiling.At the end of the room sat General Sherman, his uniform,
as always, a trifle awry.His soft felt hat with the gold braid was
tilted forward, and his feet, booted and spurred, were crossed.Small
wonder that the Englishman who sought the typical American found him in
Sherman.The sound that had caught Stephen's attention was the General's voice,
somewhat high-pitched, in the key that he used in telling a story."Sin gives you a pretty square deal, boys, after all.Generally a man
says, 'Well, I can resist, but I'll have my fun just this once.'Stephen made his way to the General, whose bright eyes wandered rapidly
over him as he added:

"This is the condition my officers report in, Brinsmade,--mud from head
to heel."Stephen had sense enough to say nothing, but the staff officers laughed,
and Mr.Brinsmade smiled as he rose and took Stephen's hand."I am delighted to see that you are well, sir," said he, with that
formal kindliness which endeared him to all."Your mother will be
rejoiced at my news of you.You will be glad to hear that I left her
well, Stephen.""They are well, sir, and took pleasure in adding to a little box which
your mother sent.Judge Whipple put in a box of fine cigars, although he
deplores the use of tobacco.""He is ailing, sir, it grieves me to say.Your mother desired to have him moved to her house,
but he is difficult to stir from his ways, and he would not leave his
little room.We have got old Nancy, Hester's mother,
to stay with him at night, and Mrs.Brice divides the day with Miss
Jinny Carvel, who comes in from Bellegarde every afternoon."exclaimed Stephen, wondering if he heard aright.And at
the mention of her name he tingled."She has been much honored
for it.You may remember that the Judge was a close friend of her
father's before the war.And--well, they quarrelled, sir."When--when was the Judge taken ill, Mr.The
thought of Virginia and his mother caring for him together was strangely
sweet."Two days before I left, sir, Dr.Polk had warned him not to do so much.But the Doctor tells me that he can see no dangerous symptoms."Brinsmade how long he was to be with them."I am going on to the other camps this afternoon," said he."But I
should like a glimpse of your quarters, Stephen, if you will invite
me.Your mother would like a careful account of you, and Mr.Whipple,
and--your many friends in St."You will find my tent a little wet, air," replied Stephen, touched.Here the General, who had been sitting by watching them with a very
curious expression, spoke up."That's hospitality for you, Brinsmade!"Brinsmade made their way across plank and bridge to
Stephen's tent, and his mess servant arrived in due time with the
package from home.But presently, while they sat talking of many things,
the canvas of the fly was thrust back with a quick movement, and who
should come stooping in but General Sherman himself.He sat down on a
cracker box."Well, well, Brice," said the General, winking at Mr.Brinsmade, "I
think you might have invited me to the feast.The General chose one and lighted
it."Why, yes, sir, when I can.""Then light up, sir," said the General, "and sit down, I've been
thinking lately of court-martialing you, but I decided to come 'round
and talk it over with you first.That isn't strictly according to
the rules of the service."They began to draft, sir, and I couldn't stand it any longer."You were in the Home Guards, if I
remember right.Brinsmade tells me you were useful in many ways
What was your rank in the Home Guards?""A second lieutenant in temporary command, General.""Couldn't they do better for you than a second-lieutenancy?"Brinsmade spoke up, "They offered him
a lieutenant-colonelcy."The General was silent a moment: Then he said "Do you remember meeting
me on the boat when I was leaving St.Louis, after the capture of Fort
Henry?""Very well, General," he replied, General Sherman leaned
forward."And do you remember I said to you, 'Brice, when you get ready to come
into this war, let me know.'Then he said gravely, but with just a
suspicion of humor about his mouth:-- "General, if I had done that, you
wouldn't be here in my tent to-day."Like lightning the General was on his feet, his hand on Stephen's
shoulder."By gad, sir," he cried, delighted, "so I wouldn't."A STRANGE MEETING

The story of the capture of Vicksburg is the old, old story of failure
turned into success, by which man is made immortal.It involves the
history of a general who never retraced his steps, who cared neither
for mugwump murmurs nor political cabals, who took both blame and praise
with equanimity.Through month after month of discouragement, and work
gone for naught, and fever and death, his eyes never left his goal.And
by grace of the wisdom of that President who himself knew sorrow and
suffering and defeat and unjust censure, General Grant won.The canal abandoned, one red night fleet and transports
swept around the bend and passed the city's heights, on a red river.The Parrotts and the Dahlgrens roared, and the high bluffs flung out the
sound over the empty swamp land.Then there came the landing below, and the cutting loose from a
base--unheard of.Corps behind cursed corps ahead for sweeping the
country clear of forage.Confederate generals in
Mississippi were bewildered.One night, while crossing with his regiment a pontoon bridge, Stephen
Brice heard a shout raised on the farther shore.Sitting together on
a log under a torch, two men in slouch hats were silhouetted.That one
talking with rapid gestures was General Sherman.The impassive profile
of the other, the close-cropped beard and the firmly held cigar that
seemed to go with it,--Stephen recognized as that of the strange Captain
Grant who had stood beside him in the street by the Arsenal He had not
changed a whit.Motionless, he watched corps after corps splash by,
artillery, cavalry, and infantry, nor gave any sign that he heard their
plaudits.At length the army came up behind the city to a place primeval, where
the face of the earth was sore and tortured, worn into deep gorges by
the rains, and flung up in great mounds.Stripped of the green magnolias
and the cane, the banks of clay stood forth in hideous yellow nakedness,
save for a lonely stunted growth, or a bare trunk that still stood
tottering on the edge of a banks its pitiful withered roots reaching out
below.First of all there was a murderous assault, and a still more murderous
repulse.Three times the besiegers charged, sank their color staffs
into the redoubts, and three times were driven back.Then the blue army
settled into the earth and folded into the ravines.Three days in that
narrow space between the lines lay the dead and wounded suffering untold
agonies in the moist heat.Then came a truce to bury the dead, to bring
back what was left of the living.Like clockwork from the Mississippi's banks
beyond came the boom and shriek of the coehorns on the barges.The big
shells hung for an instant in the air like birds of prey, and then could
be seen swooping down here and there, while now and anon a shaft of
smoke rose straight to the sky, the black monument of a home.Here was work in the trenches, digging the flying sap by night and
deepening it by day, for officers and men alike.From heaven a host of
blue ants could be seen toiling in zigzags forward, ever forward, along
the rude water-cuts and through the hills.A waiting carrion from her
vantage point on high marked one spot then another where the blue ants
disappeared, and again one by one came out of the burrow to hurry down
the trench,--each with his ball of clay.In due time the ring of metal and sepulchred voices rumbled in the
ground beneath the besieged.Counter mines were started, and through the
narrow walls of earth commands and curses came.Above ground the saps
were so near that a strange converse became the rule.Both sides were starving, the one for tobacco and
the other for hardtack and bacon.These necessities were tossed across,
sometimes wrapped in the Vicksburg news-sheet printed on the white
side of a homely green wall paper.At other times other amenities were
indulged in.Hand-grenades were thrown and shells with lighted fuses
rolled down on the heads of acquaintances of the night before, who
replied from wooden coehorns hooped with iron.The Union generals learned (common item in a siege) that the citizens
of Vicksburg were eating mule meat.Not an officer or private in the
Vicksburg armies who does not remember the 25th of June, and the hour
of three in an afternoon of pitiless heat.Silently the long blue files
wound into position behind the earth barriers which hid them from the
enemy, coiled and ready to strike when the towering redoubt on the
Jackson road should rise heavenwards.By common consent the rifle
crack of day and night was hushed, and even the Parrotts were silent.Stillness closed around the white house of Shirley once more, but not
the stillness it had known in its peaceful homestead days.This was
the stillness of the death prayer.Eyes staring at the big redoubt were
dimmed.At last, to those near, a little wisp of blue smoke crept out.The sun was darkened, and a hot
blast fanned the upturned faces.In the sky, through the film of
shattered clay, little black dots scurried, poised, and fell again as
arms and legs and head less trunks and shapeless bits of wood and iron.Scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty
thousand bayonets, and a hundred shells were shrieking across the
crater's edge.Earth to earth, alas, and dust to dust!Men who ran
across that rim of a summer's after-noon died in torture under tier upon
tier of their comrades,--and so the hole was filled.An upright cannon marks the spot where a scrawny oak once stood on
a scarred and baked hillside, outside of the Confederate lines at
Vicksburg.Under the scanty shade of that tree, on the eve of the
Nation's birthday, stood two men who typified the future and the past.As at Donelson, a trick of Fortune's had delivered one comrade of old
into the hands of another.Now she chose to kiss the one upon whom she
had heaped obscurity and poverty and contumely.He had ceased to think
or care about Fortune.And hence, being born a woman, she favored him.They noted the friendly greeting
of old comrades, and after that they saw the self-contained Northerner
biting his cigar, as one to whom the pleasantries of life were past and
gone.The South saw her General turn on his heel.Both sides honored him for the fight he had made.But war
does not reward a man according to his deserts.The next day--the day our sundered nation was born Vicksburg
surrendered: the obstinate man with the mighty force had conquered.See
the gray regiments marching silently in the tropic heat into the folds
of that blue army whose grip has choked them at last.Silently, too, the
blue coats stand, pity and admiration on the brick-red faces.The arms
are stacked and surrendered, officers and men are to be parolled when
the counting is finished.The formations melt away, and those who for
months have sought each other's lives are grouped in friendly talk.The
coarse army bread is drawn eagerly from the knapsacks of the blue, smoke
quivers above a hundred fires, and the smell of frying bacon brings a
wistful look into the gaunt faces.Tears stand in the eyes of many a man
as he eats the food his Yankee brothers have given him on the birthday
of their country.Stephen Brice, now a captain in General
Lauman's brigade, sees with thanksgiving the stars and stripes flutter
from the dome of that court-house which he had so long watched from
afar.Later on, down a side street, he pauses before a house with its
face blown away.On the verge of one of its jagged floors is an old
four-posted bed, and beside it a child's cot is standing pitifully,--the
tiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the
foot.So much for one of the navy's shells.While he was thinking of the sadness of it all, a little scene was
acted: the side door of the house opened, a weeping woman came out, and
with her was a tall Confederate Colonel of cavalry.Gallantly giving her
his arm, he escorted her as far as the little gate, where she bade him
good by with much feeling.With an impulsive movement he drew some money
from his pocket, thrust it upon her, and started hurriedly away that
he might not listen to her thanks.Such was his preoccupation that
he actually brushed into Stephen, who was standing beside a tree."Excuse me, seh," he said contritely."Certainly," said Stephen, smiling; "it was my fault for getting in your
way.""Not at all, seh," said the cavalry Colonel; "my clumsiness, seh."He did not pass on, but stood pulling with some violence a very long
mustache."Damn you Yankees," he continued, in the same amiable tone,
"you've brought us a heap of misfortune.Why, seh, in another week we'd
been fo'ced to eat <DW65>s."The Colonel made such a wry face that Stephen laughed in spite of
himself.He had marked the man's charitable action, and admired his
attempt to cover it.The Colonel seemed to be all breadth, like a card.The face was scant, perchance from lack
of food, the nose large, with a curved rim, and the eyes blue gray.He
wore clay-flecked cavalry boots, and was six feet five if an inch, so
that Stephen's six seemed insignificant beside him."Captain," he said, taking in Stephen's rank, "so we won't qua'l as to
who's host heah.One thing's suah," he added, with a twinkle, "I've been
heah longest.Seems like ten yeahs since I saw the wife and children
down in the Palmetto State.I can't offer you a dinner, seh.We've
eaten all the mules and rats and sugar cane in town."(His eye seemed to
interpolate that Stephen wouldn't be there otherwise.)"But I can offer
you something choicer than you have in the No'th."Whereupon he drew from his hip a dented silver flask.The Colonel
remarked that Stephen's eyes fell on the coat of arms."Prope'ty of my grandfather, seh, of Washington's Army.My name is
Jennison,--Catesby Jennison, at your service, seh," he said."You have
the advantage of me, Captain.""My name is Brice," said Stephen.The big Colonel bowed decorously, held out a great, wide hand, and
thereupon unscrewed the flask.Now Stephen had never learned to like
straight whiskey, but he took down his share without a face.The exploit
seemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor
justice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with
still greater ceremony, and they walked off down the street together.Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple's cigars, to which
his new friend gave unqualified praise.On every hand Vicksburg showed signs of hard usage.Houses with gaping
chasms in their sides, others mere heaps of black ruins; great trees
felled, cabins demolished, and here and there the sidewalk ploughed
across from curb to fence."Lordy I how my ears ache since your
damned coehorns have stopped.The noise got to be silence with us, seh,
and yesterday I reckoned a hundred volcanoes had bust.Tell me," said he
"when the redoubt over the Jackson road was blown up, they said a <DW65>
came down in your lines alive."Yes," said Stephen, smiling; "he struck near the place where my company
was stationed."I reckon he fell on it," said Colonel Catesby Jennison, as if it were a
matter of no special note."And now tell me something," said Stephen."How did you burn our
sap-rollers?"This time the Colonel stopped, and gave himself up to hearty laughter."Why, that was a Yankee trick, sure enough," he cried."Some ingenious
cuss soaked port fire in turpentine, and shot the wad in a large-bore
musket."The Colonel laughed again, still more heartily."Explosive
bullets!--Good Lord, it was all we could do to get percussion caps.Do you know how we got percussion caps, seh?Three of our
officers--dare-devils, seh--floated down the Mississippi on logs.One
fellow made his way back with two hundred thousand.He's the pride of
our Vicksburg army.A chivalrous man, a forlorn-hope
man.The night you ran the batteries he and some others went across to
your side in skiffs--in skiffs, seh, I say--and set fire to the houses
in De Soto, that we might see to shoot.And then he came back in the
face of our own batteries and your guns.That man was wounded by a trick
of fate, by a cussed bit of shell from your coehorns while eating his
dinner in Vicksburg.He's pretty low, now, poor fellow," added the
Colonel, sadly.demanded Stephen, fired with a desire to see the man."Well, he ain't a great ways from here," said the Colonel."Perhaps you
might be able to do something for him," he continued thoughtfully."I'd
hate to see him die.The doctor says he'll pull through if he can get
care and good air and good food."He seized Stephen's arm in a fierce
grip."No," said the Colonel, thoughtfully, as to himself, "you don't look
like the man to fool."Whereupon he set out with great strides, in marked contrast to his
former languorous gait, and after a while they came to a sort of gorge,
where the street ran between high banks of clay.There Stephen saw the
magazines which the Confederates had dug out, and of which he had heard.But he saw something, too, of which he had not heard, Colonel Catesby
Jennison stopped before an open doorway in the yellow bank and knocked.A woman's voice called softly to him to enter.They went into a room hewn out of the solid clay.Carpet was stretched
on the floor, paper was on the walls, and even a picture.There was
a little window cut like a port in a prison cell, and under it a bed,
beside which a middle-aged lady was seated.She had a kindly face which
seemed to Stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture
of restraint.She pointed to the bed, where a sheet lay limply over the
angles of a wasted frame.said the lady,--"it is the first time in two days that he has
slept."But the sleeper stirred wearily, and woke with a start.The face, so yellow and peaked, was of the type that grows even more
handsome in sickness, and in the great fever-stricken eyes a high spirit
burned.For an instant only the man stared at Stephen, and then he
dragged himself to the wall.The eyes of the other two were both fixed on the young Union Captain.cried Jennison, seizing Stephen's rigid arm, "does he look as
bad as that?"I--I know him," answered Stephen.He stepped quickly to the bedside,
and bent over it."This is too much, Jennison," came from the bed a voice that was
pitifully weak; "why do you bring Yankees in here?""Captain Brice is a friend of yours, Colfax," said the Colonel, tugging
at his mustache.I have met Captain Colfax--"

"Colonel, sir.""Colonel Colfax, before the war!And if he would like to go to St.Louis, I think I can have it arranged at once."In silence they waited for Clarence's answer Stephen well knew what was
passing in his mind, and guessed at his repugnance to accept a favor
from a Yankee.He wondered whether there was in this case a special
detestation.And so his mind was carried far to the northward to the
memory of that day in the summer-house on the Meramee heights.Virginia
had not loved her cousin then--of that Stephen was sure.But now,--now
that the Vicksburg army was ringing with his praise, now that he was
unfortunate--Stephen sighed.His comfort was that he would be the
instrument.The lady in her uneasiness smoothed the single sheen that covered the
sick man.From afar came the sound of cheering, and it was this that
seemed to rouse him.And then, with
some vehemence, "What is he doing in Vicksburg?"Stephen looked at Jennison, who winced."The city has surrendered," said that officer."Then you can afford to be generous," he said, with a bitter laugh."But you haven't whipped us yet, by a good deal.Jennison," he cried,
"Jennison, why in hell did you give up?""Colfax," said Stephen, coming forward, "you're too sick a man to talk.It may be that I can have you sent North
to-day.""You can do as you please," said Clarence, coldly, "with a--prisoner."Bowing to the lady, he strode out of
the room.Colonel Jennison, running after him, caught him in the street."He's sick--and God Almighty,
he's proud--I reckon," he added with a touch of humility that went
straight to Stephen's heart."I reckon that some of us are too derned
proud--But we ain't cold."And I hope, Colonel, that we may meet
again--as friends.""Hold on, seh," said Colonel Catesby Jennison; "we
may as well drink to that."Fortunately, as Stephen drew near the Court House, he caught sight of
a group of officers seated on its steps, and among them he was quick to
recognize General Sherman."Brice," said the General, returning his salute, "been celebrating this
glorious Fourth with some of our Rebel friends?""Yes, sir," answered Stephen, "and I came to ask a favor for one of
them."Seeing that the General's genial, interested expression did not
change, he was emboldened to go on."This is one of their colonels, sir.He is the man who floated down the river on a
log and brought back two hundred thousand percussion caps--"

"Good Lord," interrupted the General, "I guess we all heard of him after
that.What else has he done to endear himself?""Well, General, he rowed across the river in a skiff the night we ran
these batteries, and set fire to De Soto to make targets for their
gunners.""I'd like to see that man," said the General, in his eager way."What I was going to tell you, sir.After he went through all this, he
was hit by a piece of mortar shell, while sitting at his dinner.He's
rather far gone now, General, and they say he can't live unless he can
be sent North.I--I know who he is in St.And I thought that as
long as the officers are to be paroled I might get your permission to
send him up to-day.""I know the breed," said he, "I'll bet he didn't
thank you.""I like his grit," said the General, emphatically, "These young bloods
are the backbone of this rebellion, Brice.They
never did anything except horse-racing and cock-fighting.They ride like
the devil, fight like the devil, but don't care a picayune for anything.And, good Lord, how
they hate a Yankee!He's a cousin of that
fine-looking girl Brinsmade spoke of.Be a
pity to disappoint her--eh?""Why, Captain, I believe you would like to marry her yourself!Take my
advice, sir, and don't try to tame any wildcats.""I'm glad to do a favor for that young man," said the General, when
Stephen had gone off with the slip of paper he had given him."I like to
do that kind of a favor for any officer, when I can.Did you notice how
he flared up when I mentioned the girl?"This is why Clarence Colfax found himself that evening on a hospital
steamer of the Sanitary Commission, bound north for St.BELLEGARDE ONCE MORE

Supper at Bellegarde was not the simple meal it had been for a year past
at Colonel Carvel's house in town.Colfax was proud of her table,
proud of her fried chickens and corn fritters and her desserts.How
Virginia chafed at those suppers, and how she despised the guests whom
her aunt was in the habit of inviting to some of them!And when none
was present, she was forced to listen to Mrs.Colfax's prattle about the
fashions, her tirades against the Yankees."I'm sure he must be dead," said that lady, one sultry evening in July.Her tone, however, was not one of conviction.A lazy wind from the river
stirred the lawn of Virginia's gown.The girl, with her hand on the
wicker back of the chair, was watching a storm gather to the eastward,
across the Illinois prairie."I don't see why you say that, Aunt Lillian," she replied."Bad news
travels faster than good."It is cruel of him not to send us a line,
telling us where his regiment is."She had long since learned that the wisdom of
silence was the best for her aunt's unreasonableness.Certainly, if
Clarence's letters could not pass the close lines of the Federal troops,
news of her father's Texas regiment could not come from Red River."How was Judge Whipple to-day?"Brice,--isn't that her name?--doesn't take him to
her house.Virginia began to rock slowly, and her foot tapped the porch.Brice has begged the Judge to come to her.But he says he has
lived in those rooms, and that he will die there,--when the time comes."You have become quite a Yankee
yourself, I believe, spending whole days with her, nursing that old
man.""The Judge is an old friend of my father's; I think he would wish it,"
replied the girl, in a lifeless voice.Her speech did not reveal all the pain and resentment she felt.She
thought of the old man racked with pain and suffering in the heat, lying
patient on his narrow bed, the only light of life remaining the presence
of the two women.They came day by day, and often Margaret Brice had
taken the place of the old negress who sat with him at night.Yes, it was worship; it had been worship since the
day she and her father had gone to the little whitewashed hospital.Providence had brought them together at the Judge's bedside.The
marvellous quiet power of the older woman had laid hold of the girl in
spite of all barriers.Often when the Judge's pain was eased sufficiently for him to talk, he
would speak of Stephen.The mother never spoke of her son, but a light
would come into her eyes at this praise of him which thrilled Virginia
to see.And when the good lady was gone, and the Judge had fallen into
slumber, it would still haunt her.Was it out of consideration for her that Mrs.Brice would turn the Judge
from this topic which he seemed to love best?Virginia could not admit
to herself that she resented this.She had heard Stephen's letters to
the Judge.Strong and manly they were, with plenty
of praises for the Southern defenders of Vicksburg.Only yesterday
Virginia had read one of these to Mr.Well
that his face was turned to the window, and that Stephen's mother was
not there!"He says very little about himself," Mr."Had it
not been for Brinsmade, we should never know that Sherman had his eye on
him, and had promoted him.We should never have known of that exploit
at Chickasaw Bluff.But what a glorious victory was Grant's capture of
Vicksburg, on the Fourth of July!I guess we'll make short work of the
Rebels now."No, the Judge had not changed much, even in illness.Virginia laid the letter down, and tears started to her eyes as
she repressed a retort.It was not the first time this had happened.How strange
that, with all his thought of others, he should fall short here!One day, after unusual forbearance, Mrs.Brice had overtaken Virginia
on the stairway.Well she knew the girl's nature, and how difficult she
must have found repression."My dear," she had said, "you are a wonderful woman."But
Virginia had driven back to Bellegarde with a strange elation in her
heart.Some things the Judge had forborne to mention, and for this Virginia was
thankful.But she had overheard Shadrach telling old
Nancy how Mrs.Brice had pleaded with him to move it, that he might have
more room and air.And Colonel Carvel's name had
never once passed his lips.Many a night the girl had lain awake listening to the steamboats as they
toiled against the river's current, while horror held her.Horror lest
her father at that moment be in mortal agony amongst the heaps left by
the battle's surges; heaps in which, like mounds of ashes, the fire was
not yet dead.Fearful tales she had heard in the prison hospitals of
wounded men lying for days in the Southern sun between the trenches at
Vicksburg, or freezing amidst the snow and sleet at Donelson.What a life had been
Colonel Carvel's!Another, and he had lost his fortune, his home, his friends, all that
was dear to him.And that daughter, whom he loved best in all the world,
he was perchance to see no more.Colfax, yawning, had taken a book and gone to bed.Still Virginia
sat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the lightning
quivered across the eastern sky.She heard the crunch of wheels in the
gravel.A bar of light, peopled by moths, slanted out of the doorway and fell
on a closed carriage."Your cousin Clarence has come home, my dear," he said."He was among
the captured at Vicksburg, and is paroled by General Grant."Brinsmade, tell me--all--"

"No, he is not dead, but he is very low.Russell has been kind
enough to come with me."But they were all there in the light,
in African postures of terror,--Alfred, and <DW71>, and Mammy Easter, and
Ned.They lifted the limp figure in gray, and carried it into the hall
chamber, his eyes closed, his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy.Heavily, Virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt.There is little need to dwell on the dark days which followed--Clarence
hanging between life and death.That his life was saved was due to
Virginia and to Mammy Easter, and in no particle to his mother.Colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing, until Virginia
was driven to desperation, and held a council of war with Dr.Then
her aunt grew jealous, talked of a conspiracy, and threatened to send
for Dr.By spells she wept,
when they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door.She
would creep in to him in the night during Mammy Easter's watches and
talk him into a raging fever.But Virginia slept lightly and took the
alarm.More than one scene these two had in the small hours, while Ned
was riding post haste over the black road to town for the Doctor.By the same trusty messenger did Virginia contrive to send a note to
Mrs.Brice, begging her to explain her absence to Judge Whipple.By day
or night Virginia did not leave Bellegarde.Polk, while
walking in the garden, found the girl fast asleep on a bench, her sewing
on her lap.Would that a master had painted his face as he looked down
at her!'Twas he who brought Virginia daily news of Judge Whipple.He had become more querulous
and exacting with patient Mrs.But often, when he got into his buggy the Doctor found
the seat filled with roses and fresh fruit.What Virginia's feelings were at this time no one will ever know.God
had mercifully given her occupation, first with the Judge, and later,
when she needed it more, with Clarence.It was she whom he recognized
first of all, whose name was on his lips in his waking moments.With
the petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away.Unless
Virginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose.He put his
hot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours.Then, and only then, did he seem contented.The wonder was that her health did not fail.People who saw her during
that fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled.Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came frequently to inquire, was quieted
before her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that
presence.Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered.Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the
effects which people saw.And this is why
we cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature.It is God who
changes,--who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial.Happy,
thrice happy, those whom He chasteneth.And yet how many are there who
could not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.Little by little Clarence mended, until he came to sit out on the porch
in the cool of the afternoon.Then he would watch for hours the tassels
stirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond,
while the two women sat by.Colfax's headaches came
on, and Virginia was alone with him, he would talk of the war; sometimes
of their childhood, of the mad pranks they played here at Bellegarde,
of their friends.Only when Virginia read to him the Northern account of
the battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement; and
he clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of
Jackson and the fall of Port Hudson.Of love he spoke not a word, and
now that he was better he ceased to hold her hand.But often when she
looked up from her book, she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon
her, and a look in them of but one interpretation.The Doctor came but every other day now, in the afternoon.It was his
custom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with Virginia,
his stout frame filling the rocking-chair.Polk's indulgence was
gossip--though always of a harmless nature: how Mr.Cluyme always
managed to squirm over to the side which was in favor, and how Maude
Catherwood's love-letter to a certain dashing officer of the Confederate
army had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful Democrat.It was the Doctor who gave Virginia news of the Judge, and sometimes he
would mention Mrs.Then Clarence would raise his head; and once
(she saw with trepidation) he had opened his lips to speak.One day the Doctor came, and Virginia looked into his face and divined
that he had something to tell her.He sat but a few moments, and when he
arose to go he took her hand."I have a favor to beg of you, Jinny," he said, "Judge has lost his
nurse.Do you think Clarence could spare you for a little while every
day?Polk continued, somewhat hurriedly for
him, "but the Judge cannot bear a stranger near him, and I am afraid to
have him excited while in this condition."And Clarence, watching, saw her color
go.Polk, "but her son Stephen has come home from the
army.He was transferred to Lauman's brigade, and then he was wounded."He jangled the keys in his pocket and continued "It seems that he had no
business in the battle.Johnston in his retreat had driven animals into
all the ponds and shot them, and in the hot weather the water was soon
poisoned.Brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made
the charge, and he is now in a dreadful condition He is a fine fellow,"
added the Doctor, with a sigh, "General Sherman sent a special physician
to the boat with him.He is--" Subconsciously the Doctor's arm sought
Virginia's back, as though he felt her swaying.But he was looking at
Clarence, who had jerked himself forward in his chair, his thin hands
convulsively clutching at the arms of it.In his astonishment the Doctor passed his palm across his brow, and for
a moment he did not answer.Virginia had taken a step from him, and was
standing motionless, almost rigid, her eyes on his face.he said, repeating the word mechanically; "my God, I hope not.The danger is over, and he is resting easily.If he were not," he said
quickly and forcibly, "I should not be here."The Doctor's mare passed more than one fleet--footed trotter on the
road to town that day.And the Doctor's black servant heard his master
utter the word "fool" twice, and with great emphasis.For a long time Virginia stood on the end of the porch, until the
heaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence
gaze upon her before she turned to face him."Virginia, sit here a moment; I have something to tell you."She came and took the chair beside him, her heart beating, her breast
rising and falling.She looked into his eyes, and her own lashes fell
before the hopelessness there But he put out his fingers wasted by
illness, and she took them in her own.He began slowly, as if every word cost him pain.I cannot remember the time
when I did not love you, when I did not think of you as my wife.All I
did when we played together was to try to win your applause.That was my
nature I could not help it.Do you remember the day I climbed out on the
rotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pear--when
I fell on the roof of Alfred's cabin?It was
because you kissed it and cried over me.You are crying now," he said
tenderly.It isn't to make you sad that I am saying this."I have had a great deal of time to think lately, Jinny, I was not
brought up seriously,--to be a man.I have been thinking of that day
just before you were eighteen, when you rode out here.The grapes were purple, and a purple
haze was over there across the river.You were
grown a woman then, and I was still nothing but a boy.Do you remember
the doe coming out of the forest, and how she ran screaming when I tried
to kiss you?It was true what you said, that I was wild and utterly useless,
I had never served or pleased any but myself,--and you.I had never
studied or worked, You were right when you told me I must learn
something,--do something,--become of some account in the world."Clarence, after what you have done for the South?""Crossed the river and burned
houses.Floated down the river on a log
after a few percussion caps."And how many had the courage to do that?""Pooh," he said, "courage!If I did not
have that, I would send <DW71> to my father's room for his ebony box and
blow my brains out.No, Jinny, I am nothing but a soldier of fortune.I never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure, to
shirk work.I wanted to go with Walker, you remember.I wanted to distinguish myself," he added with a gesture."But
that is all gone now, Jinny.Now
I see how an earnest life might have won you.She raised her head, frightened, and looked at him searchingly."One day," he said, "one day a good many years ago you and I and Uncle
Comyn were walking along Market Street in front of Judge Whipple's
office, and a slave auction was going on.A girl was being sold on whom
you had set your heart.There was some one in the crowd, a Yankee, who
bid her in and set her free.He saw her profile, her lips parted, her look far away, She inclined her
head."Yes," said her cousin, "so do I remember him.He has crossed my path
many times since, Virginia.And mark what I say--it was he whom you
had in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of
myself, It was Stephen Brice.""I dare anything, Virginia," he answered quietly.And I am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you
had in mind.""The impression of him has never left it.Again, that
night at the Brinsmades', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had
lost you when I got back.He had been there when I was away, and gone
again."It was a horrible mistake, Max," she faltered."I was waiting for you
down the road, and stopped his horse instead.It--it was nothing--"

"It was fate, Jinny.How I hated that
man," he cried, "how I hated him?""Yes," he said, "hated!But now--"

"But now?"I have not--I could not tell you before: He
came into the place where I was lying in Vicksburg, and they told
him that my only chance was to come North, I turned my back upon him,
insulted him.Yet he went to Sherman and had me brought home--to you,
Virginia.If he loves you,--and I have long suspected that he does--"

"Oh, no," she cried, hiding her face "No.""I know he loves you, Jinny," her cousin continued calmly, inexorably.It was a brave
thing to do, and a generous.He
thought that he was saving me for you.He was giving up the hope of
marrying you himself."Unless you had seen her then, you had never
known the woman in her glory."Clarence Colfax, have you known and loved
me all my life that you might accuse me of this?"Jinny, do you mean it?"In answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that
was hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead.Long after she had
disappeared in the door he sat staring after her.But later, when Mammy Easter went to call her mistress for supper, she
found her with her face buried in the pillows.CHAPTER X. IN JUDGE WHIPPLE'S OFFICE

After this Virginia went to the Judge's bedside every day, in the
morning, when Clarence took his sleep.She read his newspapers to him
when he was well enough.She read the detested Missouri Democrat, which
I think was the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with.To have
her beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than
she could bear.Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung
the paper out of the window, and left the room."My dear," he said, smiling admiration, "forgive an old bear.A selfish
old bear, Jinny; my only excuse is my love for the Union.When you are
not here, I lie in agony, lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown
to me, Jinny.And if God sees fit to spare our great country, the day
will come when you will go down on your knees and thank Him for the
inheritance which He saved for your children.You are a good woman, my
dear, and a strong one.I have hoped that you will see the right.That you will marry a great citizen, one unwavering in his service and
devotion to our Republic."The Judge's voice trembled with earnestness
as he spoke.And the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with
the sacred fire of his life's purpose.Undaunted as her spirit was, she
could not answer him then.Once, only once, he said to her: "Virginia, I loved your father better
than any man I ever knew.Please God I may see him again before I die."But sometimes at twilight his eyes would
rest on the black cloth that hid it.Virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud
upon a life of happiness that was dead and gone.Virginia had not been with Judge Whipple during the critical week after
Stephen was brought home.But Anne had told her that his anxiety was
a pitiful thing to see, and that it had left him perceptibly weaker.So fast that on some days
Virginia, watching him, would send Ned or Shadrach in hot haste for Dr.At noon Anne would relieve Virginia,--Anne or her mother,--and
frequently Mr.For it is those who have
the most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds.As the hour
for their coming drew near, the Judge would be seeking the clock, and
scarce did Anne's figure appear in the doorway before the question had
arisen to his lips--"And how is my young Captain to-day?"That is what he called him,--"My young Captain."Virginia's choice of
her cousin, and her devotion to him, while seemingly natural enough,
had drawn many a sigh from Anne.She thought it strange that Virginia
herself had never once asked her about Stephen's condition and she spoke
of this one day to the Judge with as much warmth as she was capable of."Jinny's heart is like steel where a Yankee is concerned.If her best
friend were a Yankee--"

Judge Whipple checked her, smiling."She has been very good to one Yankee I know of," he said.Brice, I believe she worships her.""But when I said that Stephen was much better to-day, she swept out of
the room as if she did not care whether he lived or died.""Well, Anne," the Judge had answered, "you women are a puzzle to me.I
guess you don't understand yourselves," he added.That was a strange month in the life of Clarence Colfax,--the last
of his recovery, while he was waiting for the news of his exchange.Bellegarde was never more beautiful, for Mrs.Colfax had no whim of
letting the place run down because a great war was in progress.Though
devoted to the South, she did not consecrate her fortune to it.Clarence
gave as much as he could.Whole afternoons Virginia and he would sit in the shaded arbor seat;
or at the cool of the day descend to the bench on the lower tier of
the summer garden, to steep, as it were, in the blended perfumes of the
roses and the mignonettes and the pinks.Often through the night he pondered on the change in her.But he was troubled to analyze her gravity, her dignity.Was this
merely strength of character, the natural result of the trials through
which she had passed, the habit acquired of being the Helper and
comforter instead of the helped and comforted?Long years afterward the
brightly  portrait of her remained in his eye,--the simple linen
gown of pink or white, the brown hair shining in the sunlight, the
graceful poise of the head.And the background of flowers--flowers
everywhere, far from the field of war.Sometimes, when she brought his breakfast on a tray in the morning,
there was laughter in her eyes.In the days gone by they had been all
laughter.He said it over to himself
many, many times in the day.He would sit for a space, feasting his eyes
upon her until she lifted her look to his, and the rich color flooded
her face.He was not a lover to sit quietly by, was Clarence.And yet,
as the winged days flew on, that is what he did, It was not that she
did not respond to his advances, he did not make them.Was it the chivalry inherited from a long life of Colfaxes who
were gentlemen?Something of awe had crept into his feeling
for her.As the month wore on, and the time drew near for him to go back to the
war, a state that was not quite estrangement, and yet something very
like it, set in.Doubts bothered him, and he dared not
give them voice.By night he would plan his speeches,--impassioned,
imploring.To see her in her marvellous severity was to strike him dumb.Whether she loved him, whether she did not love
him, she would not give him up.Through the long years of their lives
together, he would never know.He was not a weak man now, was Clarence
Colfax.He was merely a man possessed of a devil, enchained by the power
of self-repression come upon her whom he loved.And day by day that power seemed to grow more intense,--invulnerable.Among her friends and in the little household it had raised Virginia to
heights which she herself did not seem to realize.She was become the
mistress of Bellegarde.Colfax was under its sway, and doubly
miserable because Clarence would listen to her tirades no more.Nor had
she taken pains to hide the sarcasm in her voice.His answer, bringing with it her remembrance of her husband at certain
times when it was not safe to question him, had silenced her.Addison
Colfax had not been a quiet man."Whenever Virginia is ready, mother," he had replied.He knew in his heart that if he were to ask her permission
to send for Dr.Posthelwaite to-morrow that she would say yes.Tomorrow
came,--and with it a great envelope, an official, answer to Clarence's
report that he was fit for duty once more.He
was to proceed to Cairo, there to await the arrival of the transport
Indianapolis, which was to carry five hundred officers and men from
Sandusky Prison, who were going back to fight once more for the
Confederacy.O that they might have seen the North, all those brave men
who made that sacrifice.That they might have realized the numbers and
the resources and the wealth arrayed against them!It was a cool day for September, a perfect day, an auspicious day, and
yet it went the way of the others before it.This was the very fulness
of the year, the earth giving out the sweetness of her maturity, the
corn in martial ranks, with golden plumes nodding.The forest still
in its glory of green.They walked in silence the familiar paths, and
Alfred, clipping the late roses for the supper table, shook his
white head as they passed him.The sun, who had begun to hurry on his
southward journey, went to bed at six.The few clothes Clarence was to
take with him had been packed by Virginia in his bag, and the two were
standing in the twilight on the steps of the house, when Ned came around
the corner.He called his young mistress by name, but she did not hear
him.She started as from a sleep, and paused.He wore that air of mystery so
dear to darkeys."Gemmen to see you, Miss Jinny."The <DW64> pointed to the lilac shrubbery.said Clarence, sharply: "If a man is
there, bring him here at once.""Reckon he won't come, Marse Clarence."said Ned, "He fearful skeered ob
de light ob day.He got suthin very pertickler fo' Miss Jinny.""No sah--yessah--leastwise I'be seed 'um.The word was hardly out of his mouth before Virginia had leaped down the
four feet from the porch to the flower-bed and was running across the
lawn toward the shrubbery.Parting the bushes after her, Clarence found
his cousin confronting a large man, whom he recognized as the carrier
who brought messages from the South."Pa has got through the lines," she said breathlessly."He--he came up
to see me."He went to Judge Whipple's rooms, ma'am.I
reckoned you knew it, Miss Jinny," Robinson added contritely."Clarence," she said, "I must go at once.""I will go with you," he said; "you cannot go alone."In a twinkling Ned
and <DW71> had the swift pair of horses harnessed, and the light carriage
was flying over the soft clay road toward the city.Brinsmade's place, the moon hung like a great round lantern under
the spreading trees about the house.Clarence caught a glimpse of his
cousin's face in the light.She was leaning forward, her gaze fixed
intently on the stone posts which stood like monuments between the
bushes at the entrance.Then she drew back again into the dark corner
of the barouche.She was startled by a sharp challenge, and the carriage
stopped.Looking out, she saw the provost's guard like black card
figures on the road, and Ned fumbling for his pass.On they drove into the city streets until the dark bulk of the Court
House loomed in front of them, and Ned drew rein at the little stairway
which led to the Judge's rooms.Virginia, leaping out of the carriage,
flew up the steps and into the outer office, and landed in the Colonel's
arms."Why do you risk your life in this way?If the
Yankees catch you--"

"They won't catch me, honey," he answered, kissing her.Then he held her
out at arm's length and gazed earnestly into her face.Trembling, she
searched his own."I'm not precisely young, my dear," he said, smiling.His hair was
nearly white, and his face scared.But he was a fine erect figure of a
man, despite the shabby clothes he wore, and the mud-bespattered boots."Pa," she whispered, "it was foolhardy to come here."I came to see you, Jinny, I reckon.And when I got home to-night and
heard Silas was dying, I just couldn't resist.He's the oldest friend
I've got in St.Louis, honey and now--now--"

"Pa, you've been in battle?""And you weren't hurt; I thank God for that," she whispered.After a
while: "Is Uncle Silas dying?"Polk is in there now, and says that he can't last
through the night.Silas has been asking for you, honey, over and over.He says you were very good to him,--that you and Mrs.Brice gave up
everything to nurse him.""She was here night and day until her son
came home.She is a noble woman--"

"Her son?"Silas has done nothing
the last half-hour but call his name.He says he must see the boy before
he dies.Polk says he is not strong enough to come.""Oh, no, he is not strong enough," cried Virginia.The Colonel looked
down at her queerly.She turned hurriedly, glanced around
the room, and then peered down the dark stairway.I wonder why he did not follow me up?"Then after a long pause, seeing her father said nothing, she added,
"Perhaps he was waiting for you to see me alone.I will go down to see
if he is in the carriage."The Colonel started with her, but she pulled him back in alarm."You will be seen, Pa," she cried.He stayed at the top of the passage, holding open the door that she
might have light.When she reached the sidewalk, there was Ned standing
beside the horses, and the carriage empty.Fust I seed was a man plump out'n Willums's, Miss Jinny.He was
a-gwine shufflin' up de street when Marse Clarence put out after him,
pos' has'e.She stood for a moment on the pavement in thought, and paused on the
stairs again, wondering whether it were best to tell her father.Perhaps
Clarence had seen--she caught her breath at the thought and pushed open
the door."Oh, Pa, do you think you are safe here?""Why, yes, honey, I
reckon so," he answered."Ned says he ran after a man who was hiding in an entrance.Pa, I am
afraid they are watching the place.""I don't think so, Jinny.I came here with Polk, in his buggy, after
dark."Virginia, listening, heard footsteps on the stairs, and seized her
father's sleeve."Think of the risk you are running, Pa," she whispered.She would have
dragged him to the closet.Brinsmade entered, and with him a lady veiled.How long
he stared at his old friend Virginia could not say.It seemed to her an
eternity.Brice has often told since how straight the Colonel
stood, his fine head thrown back, as he returned the glance.Brinsmade came forward, with his hand outstretched."Comyn," said he, his voice breaking a little, "I have known you these
many years as a man of unstained honor.God will judge whether I have done my duty.""I give
you my word of honor as a gentleman that I came into this city for no
other reason than to see my daughter.And hearing that my old friend was
dying, I could not resist the temptation, sir--"

Mr.How many men do you think would risk their
lives so, Mrs."Thank God he will now
die happy.I know it has been much on his mind.""And in his name, madam,--in the name of my oldest and best friend,--I
thank you for what you have done for him.I trust that you will allow me
to add that I have learned from my daughter to respect and admire you.I
hope that your son is doing well.""He is, thank you, Colonel Carvel.If he but knew that the Judge were
dying, I could not have kept him at home.Polk says that he must not
leave the house, or undergo any excitement."Just then the door of the inner room opened, and Dr.Brinsmade, and he patted Virginia."The Judge is still asleep," he said gently."And--he may not wake up in
this world."Silently, sadly, they went together into that little room where so
much of Judge Whipple's life had been spent.And
how completely they filled it,--these five people and the big Rothfield
covered with the black cloth.Virginia pressed her father's arm as they
leaned against it, and brushed her eyes.The Doctor turned the wick of
the night-lamp.What was that upon the sleeper's face from which they drew back?The divine light which is shed upon those
who have lived for others, who have denied themselves the lusts of the
flesh, For a long space, perhaps an hour, they stayed, silent save for
a low word now and again from the Doctor as he felt the Judge's heart.Tableaux from the past floated before Virginia's eyes.Of the old days,
of the happy days in Locust Street, of the Judge quarrelling with her
father, and she and Captain Lige smiling nearby.And she remembered how
sometimes when the controversy was finished the Judge would rub his nose
and say:

"It's my turn now, Lige."Whereupon the Captain would open the piano, and she would play the hymn
that he liked best.What was it in Silas Whipple's nature that courted the pain of memories?What pleasure could it have been all through his illness to look upon
this silent and cruel reminder of days gone by forever?She had heard
that Stephen Brice had been with the Judge when he had bid it in.She
wondered that he had allowed it, for they said that he was the only
one who had ever been known to break the Judge's will.Virginia's
eyes rested on Margaret Brice, who was seated at the head of the bed,
smoothing the pillows The strength of Stephen's features were in hers,
but not the ruggedness.Her features were large, indeed, yet stanch and
softened.The widow, as if feeling Virginia's look upon her, glanced up
from the Judge's face and smiled at her.The girl  with pleasure,
and again at the thought which she had had of the likeness between
mother and son.Still the Judge slept on, while they watched.And at length the thought
of Clarence crossed Virginia's mind.Whispering to her father, she stole out on tiptoe.Descending to the street, she was unable to gain any news of Clarence
from Ned, who was becoming alarmed likewise.Perplexed and troubled, she climbed the stairs again.No sound came from
the Judge's room Perhaps Clarence would be back at any moment.She sat down to think,--her elbows on the desk
in front of her, her chin in her hand, her eyes at the level of a line
of books which stood on end.--Chitty's Pleadings, Blackstone, Greenleaf
on Evidence.Absently; as a person whose mind is in trouble, she reached
out and took one of them down and opened it.Across the flyleaf, in a
high and bold hand, was written the name, Stephen Atterbury Brice.She dropped the book, and, rising abruptly, crossed quickly to the other
side of the room.Then she turned, hesitatingly, and went back.This was
his desk--his chair, in which he had worked so faithfully for the man
who lay dying beyond the door.For him whom they all loved--whose last
hours they were were to soothe.Wars and schisms may part our bodies,
but stronger ties unite our souls.Through Silas Whipple, through his
mother, Virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with Stephen
Brice.In a thousand ways she was reminded, lest she drive it from her
belief.She might marry another, and that would not matter.She sank again into his chair, and gave herself over to the thoughts
crowding in her heart.How the threads of his life ran next to hers, and
crossed and recrossed them.The slave auction, her dance with him, the
Fair, the meeting at Mr.Brinsmade's gate,--she knew them all.Her dreams of him--for she did dream
of him.And now he had saved Clarence's life that she might marry her
cousin.Again she glanced at the
signature in the book, as if fascinated by the very strength of it.She
turned over a few pages of the book, "Supposing the defendant's counsel
essays to prove by means of--" that was his writing again, a marginal,
note.There were marginal notes on every page--even the last was covered
with them, And then at the end, "First reading, February, 1858.Bought with some of money obtained by first article
for M.That capacity for work, incomparable gift, was what she had
always coveted the most.Again she rested her elbows on the desk and her
chin on her hands, and sighed unconsciously.She had not heard the step on the stair.She did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his
voice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.Slowly she raised her face to his, unbelief and wonder in her
eyes,--unbelief and wonder and fright.But
when she met the quality of his look, the grave tenderness of it, she
trembled, and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting
quivered and became a blur.He never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him.She
herself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person
exhaled.He needed not to have
spoken for her to have felt that.She
knew alone that it was nigh irresistible, and she grasped the back of
the chair as though material support might sustain her."Not--not yet, They are waiting for the end."he asked in grave surprise, glancing at the door of the
Judge's room."I am waiting for my cousin," she said.Even as she spoke she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate.Intuition told her that he, too, was
thinking of that time.Now he had found her at his desk, and, as if that
were not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid
open at his signature.Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.He was here, and is gone
somewhere."He did not seem to take account of the speech.And his silence--goad
to indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- "You saved him, Mr.I--we
all--thank you so much.And that is not all I want to say.It is a poor
enough acknowledgment of what you did,--for we have not always treated
you well."Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand
in pained protest.But she continued: "I shall regard it as a debt I can
never repay.It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help
you, but I shall pray for that opportunity.""I did nothing, Miss Carvel, nothing that the most unfeeling man in our
army would not do.Nothing that I would not have done for the merest
stranger.""You saved him for me," she said.She turned away from him for
very shame, and yet she heard him saying:-- "Yes, I saved him for you."His voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength
to suffer, to put aside the thought of self.A note to which her soul
responded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of
woman."Oh, you ought not to have come here to-night."It does not matter much," he answered."I guessed it,--because my mother had left me.""Oh, you ought not to have come!""The Judge has been my benefactor," he answered quietly."I could walk,
and it was my duty to come."He smiled, "I had no carriage," he said.With the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under
him."You must sit down at once," she cried."But I am not tired," he replied."Oh, you must sit down, you must, Captain Brice."He started at the
title, which came so prettily from her lips, "Won't you please!"And, as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky, she smiled.He glanced at the book, and the bit of sky was crimson."It is your book," she stammered."I did not know that it was yours
when I took it down.I--I was looking at it while I was waiting for
Clarence.""It is dry reading," he remarked, which was not what he wished to say."And yet--"

"Yes?"The confession had slipped to her
lips.She was sitting on the edge of his desk, looking down at him.All the will that was left him averted his head.And the seal of honor was upon his speech.And he wondered if man were
ever more tempted.Then the evil spread its wings, and soared away into the night.Peace seemed to come upon them both, quieting the
tumult in their hearts, and giving them back their reason.Respect like
wise came to the girl,--respect that was akin to awe."My mother has me how faithfully you nursed the Judge, Miss Carvel.It
was a very noble thing to do.""Not noble at all," she replied hastily, "your mother did the most of
it, And he is an old friend of my father--"

"It was none the less noble," said Stephen, warmly, "And he quarrelled
with Colonel Carvel.""My father quarrelled with him," she corrected."It was well that I
should make some atonement.And yet mine was no atonement, I love Judge
Whipple.It was a--a privilege to see your mother every day--oh, how
he would talk of you!I think he loves you better than any one on this
earth.""Tell me about him," said Stephen, gently.Virginia told him, and into the narrative she threw the whole of her
pent-up self.How patient the Judge had been, and the joy he had derived
from Stephen's letters."You were very good to write to him so often,"
she said.It seemed like a dream to Stephen, like one of the many dreams
of her, the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken.He
could not recall a time when she had not been rebellious, antagonistic.And now--as he listened to her voice, with its exquisite low tones and
modulations, as he sat there in this sacred intimacy, perchance to be
the last in his life, he became dazed.His eyes, softened, with supreme
eloquence cried out that she, was his, forever and forever.The magnetic
force which God uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her.Then the door swung open, and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, ran into
the room.He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides,
and his words died on his lips.It was Stephen who rose to meet him, and with her eyes the girl followed
his motions.The broad and loosely built frame of the Northerner, his
shoulders slightly stooping, contrasted with Clarence's slighter figure,
erect, compact, springy.The Southerner's eye, for that moment, was
flint struck with the spark from the steel.Stephen's face, thinned by
illness, was grave.For an instant
they stood thus regarding each other, neither offering a hand.It was
Stephen who spoke first, and if there was a trace of emotion in his
voice, one who was listening intently failed to mark it."I am glad to see that you have recovered, Colonel Colfax," he said."I should indeed be without gratitude if I did not thank Captain Brice
for my life," answered Clarence.She had detected the
undue accent on her cousin's last words, and she glanced apprehensively
at Stephen."Miss Carvel has already thanked me sufficiently, sir," he said."I am
happy to have been able to have done you a good turn, and at the same
time to have served her so well.It is
to her your thanks are chiefly due.I believe that I am not going too
far, Colonel Colfax," he added, "when I congratulate you both."Before her cousin could recover, Virginia slid down from the desk and
had come between them.How her eyes shone and her lip trembled as she
gazed at him, Stephen has never forgotten.What a woman she was as she
took her cousin's arm and made him a curtsey."What you have done may seem a light thing to you, Captain Brice," she
said."That is apt to be the way with those who have big hearts.You
have put upon Colonel Colfax, and upon me, a life's obligation."When she began to speak, Clarence raised his head.As he glanced,
incredulous, from her to Stephen, his look gradually softened, and
when she had finished, his manner had become again frank, boyish,
impetuous--nay, penitent."Forgive me, Brice," he cried.I--I did you an injustice, and you, Virginia.I was a fool--a
scoundrel.""No, you were neither," he said.Then upon his face came the smile of
one who has the strength to renounce, all that is dearest to him--that
smile of the unselfish, sweetest of all.She was to see it once again, upon the features of one who bore a
cross,--Abraham Lincoln.Clarence looked, and then he turned away toward
the door to the stairway, as one who walks blindly, in a sorrow.His hand was on the knob when Virginia seemed to awake.She flew after
him:

"Wait!"Then she raised her eyes, slowly, to Stephen, who was standing
motionless beside his chair."My father is in the Judge's room," she said."I thought--"

"That he was an officer in the Confederate Army.She took
a step toward him, appealingly."Oh, he is not a spy," she cried."He has given Mr Brinsmade his word
that he came here for no other purpose than to see me.Then he heard
that the Judge was dying--"

"He has given his word to Mr."Then," said Stephen, "what Mr.Brinsmade sanctions is not for me to
question."She gave him yet another look, a fleeting one which he did not see.Then
she softly opened the door and passed into the room of the dying man.As for Clarence, he stood for a space staring
after them.Then he went noiselessly down the stairs into the street.LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT

When the Judge opened his eyes for the last time in this world, they
fell first upon the face of his old friend, Colonel Carvel.Twice he
tried to speak his name, and twice he failed.The third time he said it
faintly."Comyn, what are you doing here?"I reckon I came to see you, Silas," answered the Colonel."To see me die," said the Judge, grimly.Colonel Carvel's face twitched, and the silence in that little room
seemed to throb."Comyn," said the Judge again, "I heard that you had gone South to fight
against your country.Can it be that you have at last
returned in your allegiances to the flag for which your forefathers
died?"Poor Colonel Carvel

"I am still of the same mind, Silas," he said.The Judge turned his face away, his thin lips moving as in prayer.But
they knew that he was not praying, "Silas," said Mr.Carvel, "we were
friends for twenty years.Let us be friends again, before--"

"Before I die," the Judge interrupted, "I am ready to die.I have had a hard life, Comyn, and few friends.I--I did not know how to make them.Yet no man ever valued those few
more than!But," he cried, the stern fire unquenched to the last, "I
would that God had spared me to see this Rebellion stamped out.To those watching, his eyes seemed fixed on a
distant point, and the light of prophecy was in them."I would that
God had spared me to see this Union supreme once more.A high destiny is reserved for this nation--!I think the
highest of all on this earth."Amid profound silence he leaned back on
the pillows from which he had risen, his breath coming fast.None dared
look at the neighbor beside them."Would you not like to see a
clergyman, Judge?"The look on his face softened as he turned to her."No, madam," he answered; "you are clergyman enough for me.You are near
enough to God--there is no one in this room who is not worthy to stand
in the presence of death.Yet I wish that a clergyman were here, that
he might listen to one thing I have to say.When I was a boy I worked my
way down the river to New York, to see the city.He said to me, 'Sit down, my son, I want to talk to you.I said to him, 'No,
sir, I am not Senator Whipple's son.If the
bishop had wished to talk to me after that, Mrs.Brice, he might have
made my life a little easier--a little sweeter.I know that they are not
all like that.But it was by just such things that I was embittered when
I was a boy."He stopped, and when he spoke again, it was more slowly,
more gently, than any of them had heard him speak in all his life
before."I wish that some of the blessings which I am leaving now had
come to me then--when I was a boy.I might have done my little share in
making the world a brighter place to live in, as all of you have done.Yes, as all of you are now doing for me.I am leaving the world with a
better opinion of it than I ever held in life.God hid the sun from me
when I was a little child.Margaret Brice," he said, "if I had had such
a mother as you, I would have been softened then.I thank God that He
sent you when He did."The widow bowed her head, and a tear fell upon his pillow."I have done nothing," she murmured, "nothing.""So shall they answer at the last whom He has chosen," said the Judge."I was sick, and ye visited me.He has promised to remember those who do
that.He has
given you a son whom all men may look in the face, of whom you need
never be ashamed.Stephen," said the Judge, "come here."Stephen made his way to the bedside, but because of the moisture in his
eyes he saw but dimly the gaunt face.And yet he shrank back in awe at
the change in it.So must all of the martyrs have looked when the
fire of the <DW19>s licked their feet.So must John Bunyan have stared
through his prison bars at the sky."Stephen," he said, "you have been faithful in a few things.So shall
you be made ruler over many things.The little I have I leave to you,
and the chief of this is an untarnished name.I know that you will be
true to it because I have tried your strength.Listen carefully to what
I have to say, for I have thought over it long.In the days gone by our
fathers worked for the good of the people, and they had no thought of
gain.A time is coming when we shall need that blood and that bone in
this Republic.Wealth not yet dreamed of will flow out of this land, and
the waters of it will rot all save the pure, and corrupt all save the
incorruptible.Half-tried men wilt go down before that flood.You and
those like you will remember how your fathers governed,--strongly,
sternly, justly.Serve your city, serve your state, but above all serve
your country."He paused to catch his breath, which was coming painfully now, and
reached out his bony hand to seek Stephen's."I was harsh with you at
first, my son," he went on.And when I had tried
you I wished your mind to open, to keep pace with the growth of this
nation.I sent you to see Abraham Lincoln that you might be born
again--in the West.I saw it when you came back--I
saw it in your face.O God," he cried, with sudden eloquence."I would
that his hands--Abraham Lincoln's hands--might be laid upon all who
complain and cavil and criticise, and think of the little things in
life: I would that his spirit might possess their spirit!"They marvelled and were awed, for never in all his
days had such speech broken from this man."Good-by, Stephen," he said,
when they thought he was not to speak again."Hold the image of Abraham
Lincoln in front of you.You--you are a man after his
own heart--and--and mine."They started for ward, for his eyes
were closed.But presently he stirred again, and opened them."Brinsmade," he said, "Brinsmade, take care of my orphan girls.The <DW64> came forth, shuffling and sobbing, from the doorway."You ain't gwine away, Marse Judge?""Yes, Shadrach, good-by.You have served me well, I have left you
provided for."Shadrach kissed the hand of whose secret charity he knew so much.Then
the Judge withdrew it, and motioned to him to rise.And Colonel Carvel came from the corner where he had
been listening, with his face drawn.You were my friend when there was none other.You were
true to me when the hand of every man was against me.You--you have
risked your life to come to me here, May God spare it for Virginia."At the sound of her name, the girl started.And when she kissed him on the forehead, he trembled.Weakly he reached up and put his hands on her shoulders.The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the
button at his throat.There, on a piece of cotton twine, hung a little key, She took it off,
but still his hands held her."I have saved it for you, my dear," he said."God bless you--" why did
his eyes seek Stephen's?--"and make your life happy.Virginia--will you
play my hymn--once more--once more?"They lifted the night lamp from the piano, and the medicine.It was
Stephen who stripped it of the black cloth it had worn, who stood by
Virginia ready to lift the lid when she had turned the lock.The girl's
exaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the well-remembered chords,
and those who heard were lifted, lifted far above and beyond the power
of earthly spell."Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom
        Lead Thou me on
        The night is dark, and I am far from home;
        Lead Thou me on.I do not ask to see
        The distant scene; one step enough for me."A sigh shook Silas Whipple's wasted frame, and he died.Brinsmade and the Doctor were the first to leave the little room
where Silas Whipple had lived and worked and died, Mr.Brinsmade bent
upon one of those errands which claimed him at all times.Virginia sat on, a vague fear haunting her,--a fear
for her father's safety.These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow,
remained to torture her.Softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano,
and opened the door of the outer office.A clock in a steeple near by
was striking twelve.Only Stephen
saw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out
lifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the
door.First of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning
dimly, and the discovery gave her a shock.Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze
was held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the
room.A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined
in the semi-darkness, she knew it.She took a step nearer, and a cry
escaped her.The man was Eliphalet Hopper.He got down from the sill with a motion
at once sheepish and stealthy.Her breath caught, and instinctively she
gave back toward the door, as if to open it again."I've got something I want to say to you, Miss
Virginia."But she
shivered and paused, horrified at the thought of what she was about to
do.Her father was in that room--and Stephen.She must keep them there,
and get this man away.She must not show fright before him, and yet she
could not trust her voice to speak just then.She must not let him know
that she was afraid of him--this she kept repeating to herself.Virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him, even
swiftly, and turn up the gas.He started back, blinking as the
jet flared.For a moment she stood beside it, with her head high;
confronting him and striving to steady herself for speech."Judge Whipple--died--to-night."The dominating note in his answer was a whine, as if, in spite of
himself, he were awed."I ain't here to see the Judge."She felt her
lips moving, but knew not whether the words had come.The look in his little eyes was the filmy look of
those of an animal feasting."I came here to see you," he said, "--you."She was staring at him now,
in horror."And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some
one else--in there," said Mr.He smiled, for she was swaying, her lids half closed.By a supreme
effort she conquered her terror and looked at him.The look was in his
eyes still, intensified now."How dare you speak to me after what has happened!If Colonel
Carvel were here, he would--kill you."He flinched at the name and the word, involuntarily.He wiped his
forehead, hot at the very thought.Then,
remembering his advantage, he stepped close to her."He is here," he said, intense now."He is here, in that there room."Virginia struggled, and yet she refrained from crying
out."He never leaves this city without I choose.I can have him hung if
I choose," he whispered, next to her.she cried; "oh, if you choose!"Still his body crept closer, and his face closer."There's but one price to pay," he said hoarsely, "there's but one price
to pay, and that's you--you.I cal'late you'll marry me now."Delirious at the touch of her, he did not hear the door open.Her senses
were strained for that very sound.She heard it close again, and a
footstep across the room.She knew the step--she knew the voice, and her
heart leaped at the sound of it in anger.An arm in a blue sleeve came
between them, and Eliphalet Hopper staggered and fell across the books
on the table, his hand to his face.Towered was the impression that came to Virginia then, and so she
thought of the scene ever afterward.Small bits, like points of tempered
steel, glittered in Stephen's eyes, and his hands following up the
mastery he had given them clutched Mr.Twice Stephen
shook him so that his head beat upon the table.he cried, but he kept his voice low.And then, as if
he expected Hopper to reply: "Shall I kill you?"He turned slowly, and his hands fell from
Mr.Hopper's cowering form as his eyes met hers.Even he could not
fathom the appeal, the yearning, in their dark blue depths.And yet what
he saw there made him tremble."He--he won't touch me again while you
are here."Eliphalet Hopper raised himself from the desk, and one of the big books
fell with a crash to the floor.Then they saw him shrink, his eyes fixed
upon some one behind them.Before the Judge's door stood Colonel Carvel,
in calm, familiar posture, his feet apart, and his head bent forward as
he pulled at his goatee."What is this man doing here, Virginia?"She did not answer
him, nor did speech seem to come easily to Mr.Perhaps the sight of Colonel Carvel had brought before him too, vividly
the memory of that afternoon at Glencoe.All at once Virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this man's
hands.At a word from him her father would be shot as a spy--and Stephen
Brice, perhaps, as a traitor.But if Colonel Carvel should learn that he
had seized her,--here was the terrible danger of the situation.Well she
knew what the Colonel would do.She trusted in
his coolness that he would not.Before a word of reply came from any of the three, a noise was heard
on the stairway.There followed four seconds
of suspense, and then Clarence came in.She saw that his face wore a
worried, dejected look.It changed instantly when he glanced about
him, and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out Eliphalet Hopper
standing in sullen aggressiveness, beside the table."So you're the spy, are you?"Then he turned his
back and faced his uncle."I saw, him in Williams's entry as we drove
up.He strode to the open window at the back
of the office, and looked out, There was a roof under it."The sneak got in here," he said."He knew I was waiting for him in the
street.Hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where Stephen had struck
him."No, I ain't the spy," he said, with a meaning glance at the Colonel."I cal'late that he knows," Eliphalet replied, jerking his head toward
Colonel Carvel.What's to prevent my
calling up the provost's guard below?"he continued, with a smile that
was hideous on his swelling face.It was the Colonel who answered him, very quickly and very clearly.Stephen, who was watching him, could not tell
whether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the Colonel's
mouth as he added.Hopper did not move, but his eyes shifted to Virginia's form.Stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see
her.said the Colonel, in the mild voice that
should have been an ominous warning.It
was clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this; that he had waited
in the window to deal with Virginia alone.But now the very force of a
desire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless.His
voice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain."Let's be calm about this business, Colonel," he said."We won't say
anything about the past.But I ain't set on having you shot.There's a
consideration that would stop me, and I cal'late you know what it is."But before he had taken a step Virginia
had crossed the room swiftly, and flung herself upon him.The last word came falteringly,
faintly."Let me go,--honey," whispered the Colonel, gently.His eyes did not
leave Eliphalet.He tried to disengage himself, but her fingers were
clasped about his neck in a passion of fear and love.And then, while
she clung to him, her head was raised to listen.The sound of Stephen
Brice's voice held her as in a spell.His words were coming coldly,
deliberately, and yet so sharply that each seemed to fall like a lash.Hopper, if ever I hear of your repeating what you have seen or
heard in this room, I will make this city and this state too hot for
you to live in.I know how you hide in areas, how you talk
sedition in private, how you have made money out of other men's misery.And, what is more, I can prove that you have had traitorous dealings
with the Confederacy.General Sherman has been good enough to call
himself a friend of mine, and if he prosecutes you for your dealings
in Memphis, you will get a term in a Government prison, You ought to be
hung.Colonel Carvel has shown you the door.FROM THE LETTERS OF MAJOR STEPHEN BRICE

Of the Staff of General Sherman on the March to the Sea, and on the
March from Savannah Northward.HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI GOLDSBORO, N.C.MARCH
24, 1865

DEAR MOTHER: The South Carolina Campaign is a thing of the past.I pause
as I write these words--they seem so incredible to me.We have marched
the four hundred and twenty-five miles in fifty days, and the General
himself has said that it is the longest and most important march ever
made by an organized army in a civilized country.I know that you will
not be misled by the words "civilized country."Not until the history of
this campaign is written will the public realize the wide rivers and
all but impassable swamps we have crossed with our baggage trains and
artillery.The roads (by courtesy so called) were a sea of molasses and
every mile of them has had to be corduroyed.For fear of worrying you I
did not write you from Savannah how they laughed at us for starting at
that season of the year.They said we would not go ten miles, and I most
solemnly believe that no one but "Uncle Billy" and an army organized and
equipped by him could have gone ten miles.You have probably remarked in the tone of my letters ever since we left
Kingston for the sea, a growing admiration for "my General."It seems very strange that this wonderful tactician can be the same man
I met that day going to the Arsenal in the streetcar, and again at Camp
Jackson.I am sure that history will give him a high place among the
commanders of the world.Certainly none was ever more tireless than
he.He never fights a battle when it can be avoided, and his march into
Columbia while threatening Charleston and Augusta was certainly a master
stroke of strategy.You should see him as
he rides through the army, an erect figure, with his clothes all angular
and awry, and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes.You can hear his name running from file to file; and some times the
new regiments can't resist cheering.He generally says to the
Colonel:--"Stop that noise, sir.On our march to the sea, if the orders were ever given to turn
northward, "the boys" would get very much depressed.One moonlight night
I was walking my horse close to the General's over the pine needles,
when we overheard this conversation between two soldiers:-- "Say, John,"
said one, "I guess Uncle Billy don't know our corps is goin' north.""I wonder if he does,'" said John."If I could only get a sight of them
white socks, I'd know it was all right."The General rode past without a word, but I heard him telling the story
to Mower the next day.I can find little if any change in his manner since I knew him first.He is brusque, but kindly, and he has the same comradeship with officers
and men--and even the <DW64>s who flock to our army.But few dare to
take advantage of it, and they never do so twice.I have been very near
to him, and have tried not to worry him or ask many foolish questions.Sometimes on the march he will beckon me to close up to him, and we have
a conversation something on this order:-- "There's Kenesaw, Brice.""Went beyond lines there with small party.Next day I thought Rebels would leave in the night.Got up before daylight, fixed telescope on stand, and waited.Saw one blue man creep up, very cautious,
looked around, waved his hat.This gives you but a faint idea of the vividness of his talk.When we
make a halt for any time, the general officers and their staffs flock
to headquarters to listen to his stories.When anything goes wrong, his
perception of it is like a lightning flash,--and he acts as quickly.By the way, I have just found the letter he wrote me, offering this
staff position.Please keep it carefully, as it is something I shall
value all my life.GAYLESVILLE, ALABAMA, October 25, 1864.MAJOR STEPHEN A. BRICE:

   Dear Sir,--The world goes on, and wicked men sound asleep.Davis
   has sworn to destroy my army, and Beauregard has come to do the
   work,--so if you expect to share in our calamity, come down.I
   offer you this last chance for staff duty, and hope you have had
   enough in the field.I do not wish to hurry you, but you can't get
   aboard a ship at sea.So if you want to make the trip, come to
   Chattanooga and take your chances of meeting me.Yours truly,

                  W. T. SHERMAN, Major General.One night--at Cheraw, I think it was--he sent for me to talk to him.I
found him lying on a bed of Spanish moss they had made for him.He asked
me a great many questions about St.Brinsmade,
especially his management of the Sanitary Commission."Brice," he said, after a while, "you remember when Grant sent me to
beat off Joe Johnston's army from Vicksburg.You were wounded then, by
the way, in that dash Lauman made.Grant thought he ought to warn me
against Johnston."'He's wily, Sherman,' said he."'Grant,' said I, 'you give me men enough and time enough to look over
the ground, and I'm not afraid of the devil.'"Nothing could sum up the man better than that.And now what a trick of
fate it is that he has Johnston before him again, in what we hope will
prove the last gasp of the war!He likes Johnston, by the way, and has
the greatest respect for him.I wish you could have peeped into our camp once in a while.In the rare
bursts of sunshine on this march our premises have been decorated with
gay red blankets, and sombre gray ones brought from the quartermasters,
and white Hudson's Bay blankets (not so white now), all being between
forked sticks.It is wonderful how the pitching of a few tents, and the
busy crackle of a few fires, and the sound of voices--sometimes merry,
sometimes sad, depending on the weather, will change the look of a
lonely pine knoll.I should be heartily ashamed
if a word of complaint ever fell from my lips.Whenever I
wake up at night with my feet in a puddle between the blankets, I think
of the men.The corduroy roads which our horses stumble over through the
mud, they make as well as march on.Our flies are carried in wagons,
and our utensils and provisions.They must often bear on their backs the
little dog-tents, under which, put up by their own labor, they crawl
to sleep, wrapped in a blanket they have carried all day, perhaps waist
deep in water.The food they eat has been in their haversacks for many a
weary mile, and is cooked in the little skillet and pot which have
also been a part of their burden.Then they have their musket and
accoutrements, and the "forty rounds" at their backs.Patiently,
cheerily tramping along, going they know not where, nor care much
either, so it be not in retreat.Ready to make roads, throw up works,
tear up railroads, or hew out and build wooden bridges; or, best of all,
to go for the Johnnies under hot sun or heavy rain, through swamp and
mire and quicksand.They marched ten miles to storm Fort McAllister.And
how the cheers broke from them when the pop pop pop of the skirmish line
began after we came in sight of Savannah!No man who has seen but not
shared their life may talk of personal hardship.We arrived at this pretty little town yesterday, so effecting a junction
with Schofield, who got in with the 3d Corps the day before.I am
writing at General Schofield's headquarters.There was a bit of a battle
on Tuesday at Bentonville, and we have come hither in smoke, as usual.But this time we thank Heaven that it is not the smoke of burning
homes,--only some resin the "Johnnies" set on fire before they left.ON BOARD DESPATCH BOAT "MARTIN."DEAR MOTHER: A most curious thing has happened.But I may as well begin
at the beginning.When I stopped writing last evening at the summons
of the General, I was about to tell you something of the battle of
Bentonville on Tuesday last.Mower charged through as bad a piece
of wood and swamp as I ever saw, and got within one hundred yards of
Johnston himself, who was at the bridge across Mill Creek.Of course we
did not know this at the time, and learned it from prisoners.As I have written you, I have been under fire very little since coming
to the staff.When the battle opened, however, I saw that if I stayed
with the General (who was then behind the reserves) I would see little
or nothing; I went ahead "to get information" beyond the line of battle
into the woods.I did not find these favorable to landscape views, and
just as I was turning my horse back again I caught sight of a commotion
some distance to my right.The Rebel skirmish line had fallen back just
that instant, two of our skirmishers were grappling with a third man,
who was fighting desperately.It struck me as singular that the fellow
was not in gray, but had on some sort of dark clothes.I could not reach them in the swamp on horseback, and was in the act of
dismounting when the man fell, and then they set out to carry him to the
rear, still farther to my right, beyond the swamp.I shouted, and one of
the skirmishers came up."We've got a spy, sir," he said excitedly.He was hid in the thicket yonder, lying flat on his face.He reckoned that our boys would run right over him and that he'd get
into our lines that way.Tim Foley stumbled on him, and he put up as
good a fight with his fists as any man I ever saw."That night I told the General, who
sent over to the headquarters of the 17th Corps to inquire.The word
came back that the man's name was Addison, and he claimed to be a Union
sympathizer who owned a plantation near by.He declared that he had been
conscripted by the Rebels, wounded, sent back home, and was now about to
be pressed in again.He had taken this method of escaping to our lines.It was a common story enough, but General Mower added in his message
that he thought the story fishy.This was because the man's appearance
was very striking, and he seemed the type of Confederate fighter who
would do and dare anything.He had a wound, which had been a bad one,
evidently got from a piece of shell.But they had been able to find
nothing on him.Sherman sent back word to keep the man until he could
see him in person.It was about nine o'clock last night when I reached
the house the General has taken.A prisoner's guard was resting outside,
and the hall was full of officers.They said that the General was
awaiting me, and pointed to the closed door of a room that had been the
dining room.Two candles were burning in pewter sticks on the bare mahogany table.There was the General sitting beside them, with his legs crossed,
holding some crumpled tissue paper very near his eyes, and reading.He
did not look up when I entered.I was aware of a man standing, tall and
straight, just out of range of the candles' rays.He wore the easy dress
of a Southern planter, with the broad felt hat.The head was flung back
so that there was just a patch of light on the chin, and the lids of the
eyes in the shadow were half closed.For the moment I felt precisely as I
had when I was hit by that bullet in Lauman's charge.I was aware of
something very like pain, yet I could not place the cause of it.But
this is what since has made me feel queer: you doubtless remember
staying at Hollingdean, when I was a boy, and hearing the story of Lord
Northwell's daredevil Royalist ancestor,--the one with the lace collar
over the dull-gold velvet, and the pointed chin, and the lazy scorn in
the eyes.Those eyes are painted with drooping lids.The first time I
saw Clarence Colfax I thought of that picture--and now I thought of the
picture first."Major Brice, do you know this gentleman?""His name is Colfax, sir--Colonel Colfax, I think"

"Thought so," said the General.I have thought much of that scene since, as I am steaming northward over
green seas and under cloudless skies, and it has seemed very unreal.I
should almost say supernatural when I reflect how I have run across this
man again and again, and always opposing him.I can recall just how he
looked at the slave auction, which seem, so long ago: very handsome,
very boyish, and yet with the air of one to be deferred to.It was
sufficiently remarkable that I should have found him in Vicksburg.But
now--to be brought face to face with him in this old dining room in
Goldsboro!I did not know how he
would act, but I went up to him and held out my hand, and said.--"How do
you do, Colonel Colfax?"I am sure that my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking
him And then his face lighted up and he gave me his hand.And he smiled
at me and again at the General, as much as to say that it was all over."We seem to run into each other, Major Brice," said he.I could see that the General, too,
was moved, from the way he looked at him.And he speaks a little more
abruptly at such times."Guess that settles it, Colonel," he said."I reckon it does, General," said Clarence, still smiling.The General
turned from him to the table with a kind of jerk and clapped his hand on
the tissue paper."These speak for themselves, sir," he said."It is very plain that they
would have reached the prominent citizens for whom they were intended if
you had succeeded in your enterprise.You were captured out of uniform
You know enough of war to appreciate the risk you ran."Call Captain Vaughan, Brice, and ask him to conduct the prisoner back."I asked him if I could write home for him or do anything else.Some day I shall tell you what he said.Then Vaughan took him out, and I heard the guard shoulder arms and tramp
away in the night.The General and I were left alone with the mahogany
table between us, and a family portrait of somebody looking down on
us from the shadow on the wall.A moist spring air came in at the open
windows, and the candles flickered.After a silence, I ventured to say:

"I hope he won't be shot, General.""Don't know, Brice," he answered.Hate to shoot him,
but war is war.Magnificent class he belongs to--pity we should have to
fight those fellows."He paused, and drummed on the table."Brice," said he, "I'm going to
send you to General Grant at City Point with despatches.I'm sorry Dunn
went back yesterday, but it can't be helped."You'll have to ride to Kinston.The railroad won't be through until
to-morrow: I'll telegraph there, and to General Easton at Morehead City.Tell Grant I expect to run up there in a
day or two myself, when things are arranged here.I turned to go, but Clarence Colfax was on my mind "General?""General, could you hold Colonel Colfax until I see you again?"It was a bold thing to say, and I quaked.And he looked at me in his
keen way, through and through "You saved his life once before, didn't
you?""You allowed me to have him sent home from Vicksburg, sir."He answered with one of his jokes--apropos of something he said on the
Court House steps at Vicksburg."Well, well," he said, "I'll see, I'll see.Thank God this war is pretty
near over.I'll let you know, Brice, before I shoot him."I rode the thirty odd miles to Kinston in--little more than three hours.A locomotive was waiting for me, and I jumped into a cab with a friendly
engineer.Soon we were roaring seaward through the vast pine forests.It was a lonely journey, and you were much in my mind.My greatest
apprehension was that we might be derailed and the despatches captured;
for as fast as our army had advanced, the track of it had closed again,
like the wake of a ship at sea.Guerillas were roving about, tearing up
ties and destroying bridges.There was one five-minute interval of excitement when, far down the
tunnel through the forest, we saw a light gleaming.The engineer said
there was no house there, that it must be a fire.But we did not slacken
our speed, and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until
we were upon them.Not one gaunt figure stood between them and us.Not one shot broke the
stillness of the night.As dawn broke I beheld the flat, gray waters of
the Sound stretching away to the eastward, and there was the boat at the
desolate wharf beside the warehouse, her steam rising white in the chill
morning air.THE SAME, CONTINUED

             HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,
              CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I arrived here safely the day before yesterday, and I hope
that you will soon receive some of the letters I forwarded on that day.It is an extraordinary place, this City Point; a military city sprung up
like a mushroom in a winter.And my breath was quite taken away when I
first caught sight of it on the high table-land.The great bay in front
of it, which the Appomattox helps to make, is a maze of rigging and
smoke-pipes, like the harbor of a prosperous seaport.There are gunboats
and supply boats, schooners and square-riggers and steamers, all huddled
together, and our captain pointed out to me the 'Malvern' flying Admiral
Porter's flag.Barges were tied up at the long wharves, and these were
piled high with wares and flanked by squat warehouses.Although it
was Sunday, a locomotive was puffing and panting along the foot of the
ragged bank.High above, on the flat promontory between the two rivers, is the city
of tents and wooden huts, the great trees in their fresh faint green
towering above the low roofs.At the point of the bluff a large flag
drooped against its staff, and I did not have to be told that this was
General Grant's headquarters.There was a fine steamboat lying at the wharf, and I had hardly stepped
ashore before they told me she was President Lincoln's.I read the name
on her--the 'River Queen'.Yes, the President is here, too, with his
wife and family.There are many fellows here with whom I was brought up in Boston.I am
living with Jack Hancock, whom you will remember well.He is a captain
now, and has a beard.I went straight to General Grant's
headquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might
build for a temporary residence.Only the high flagstaff and the Stars
and Stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind.A group of
officers stood chatting outside of it, and they told me that the General
had walked over to get his mail.He is just as unassuming and democratic
as "my general."General Rankin took me into the office, a rude room,
and we sat down at the long table there.Presently the door opened,
and a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned.We rose to our feet, and I saluted."General, this is Major Brice of General Sherman's staff.He has brought
despatches from Goldsboro," said Rankin.He nodded, took off his hat and laid it on the table, and reached out
for the despatches.While reading them he did not move, except to light
another cigar.I am getting hardened to unrealities,--perhaps I should
say marvels, now.It did not seem so
strange that this silent General with the baggy trousers was the man who
had risen by leaps and bounds in four years to be general-in-chief of
our armies.His face looks older and more sunken than it did on that
day in the street near the Arsenal, in St.Louis, when he was just a
military carpet-bagger out of a job.But
how different the impressions made by the man in authority and the same
man out of authority!He made a sufficient impression upon me then, as I told you at the time.That was because I overheard his well-merited rebuke to Hopper.But I
little dreamed that I was looking on the man who was to come out of the
West and save this country from disunion.And how quietly and simply he
has done it, without parade or pomp or vainglory.Of all those who, with
every means at their disposal, have tried to conquer Lee, he is the
only one who has in any manner succeeded.He has been able to hold him
fettered while Sherman has swept the Confederacy.And these are the two
men who were unknown when the war began.When the General had finished reading the despatches, he folded them
quickly and put them in his pocket."Sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours, Major," he
said.I talked with him for about half an hour.He is a marked contrast to Sherman in this respect.I believe that
he only opened his lips to ask two questions.You may well believe that
they were worth the asking, and they revealed an intimate knowledge of
our march from Savannah.I was interrupted many times by the arrival
of different generals, aides, etc.He sat there smoking, imperturbable.Sometimes he said "yes" or "no," but oftener he merely nodded his head.Once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant, who
floundered.The General seemed to know more than he about the matter he
had in hand.When I left him, he asked me where I was quartered, and said he hoped I
would be comfortable.Jack Hancock was waiting for me, and we walked around the city, which
even has barber shops.Everywhere were signs of preparation, for the
roads are getting dry, and the General preparing for a final campaign
against Lee.What a marvellous fight he has made with his
material.I think that he will be reckoned among the greatest generals
of our race.Of course, I was very anxious to get a glimpse of the President, and
so we went down to the wharf, where we heard that he had gone off for
a horseback ride.They say that he rides nearly every day, over the
corduroy roads and through the swamps, and wherever the boys see that
tall hat they cheer.They know it as well as the lookout tower on the
flats of Bermuda Hundred.He lingers at the campfires and swaps stories
with the officers, and entertains the sick and wounded in the hospitals.I believe that the great men don't change.Away with your Napoleons and your Marlboroughs and your Stuarts.These
are the days of simple men who command by force of character, as well as
knowledge.I believe that he will change the
world, and strip it of its vainglory and hypocrisy.In the evening, as we were sitting around Hancock's fire, an officer
came in."The President sends his compliments, Major, and wants to know if you
would care to pay him a little visit."If I would care to pay him a little visit!That officer had to hurry to
keep up with the as I walked to the wharf.He led me aboard the River
Queen, and stopped at the door of the after-cabin.Lincoln was sitting under the lamp, slouched down in his chair,
in the position I remembered so well.It was as if I had left him but
yesterday.He was whittling, and he had made some little toy for his son
Tad, who ran out as I entered.When he saw me, the President rose to his great height, a sombre,
towering figure in black.But the sad
smile, the kindly eyes in their dark caverns, the voice--all were just
the same.It was sad and lined
when I had known it, but now all the agony endured by the millions,
North and South, seemed written on it.I took his big, bony hand,
which reminded me of Judge Whipple's.Yes, it was just as if I had been
with him always, and he were still the gaunt country lawyer."Yes, sir," I said, "indeed I do."He looked at me with that queer expression of mirth he sometimes has.I didn't
think that any man could travel so close to Sherman and keep 'em.""They're unfortunate ways, sir," I said, "if they lead you to misjudge
me."He laid his hand on my shoulder, just as he had done at Freeport."I know you, Steve," he said."I shuck an ear of corn before I buy it.I've kept tab on you a little the last five years, and when I heard
Sherman had sent a Major Brice up here, I sent for you.""I tried very hard to get a glimpse of you
to-day, Mr."I'm glad to hear it, Steve," he said."Then you haven't joined the
ranks of the grumblers?You haven't been one of those who would have
liked to try running this country for a day or two, just to show me how
to do it?""No, sir," I said, laughing."I didn't think you were that kind,
Steve.Now sit down and tell me about this General of mine who wears
seven-leagued boots.What was it--four hundred and twenty miles in fifty
days?How many navigable rivers did he step across?"He began to count
on those long fingers of his."The Edisto, the Broad, the Catawba, the
Pedee, and--?""Is--is the General a nice man?""Yes, sir, he is that," I answered heartily."And not a man in the
army wants anything when he is around.You should see that Army of the
Mississippi, sir.They arrived in Goldsboro' in splendid condition."He got up and gathered his coat-tails under his arms, and began to walk
up and down the cabin.And, thinking the story of the white socks
might amuse him, I told him that."Well, now," he said, "any man that has a nickname like that is all
right.That's the best recommendation you can give the General--just
say 'Uncle Billy.'""You've given 'Uncle
Billy' a good recommendation, Steve," he said."Did you ever hear the
story of Mr."Well, when Wallace was hiring his gardener he asked him whom he had
been living with."'A ricommindation is it, sorr?Sure I have nothing agin Misther
Dalton, though he moightn't be knowing just the respict the likes of a
first-class garthener is entitled to.'"He seldom does, it seems, at his own stories.But
I could not help laughing over the "ricommindation" I had given the
General.He knew that I was embarrassed, and said kindly:-- "Now tell
me something about 'Uncle Billy's <DW15>s.'I hear that they have a most
effectual way of tearing up railroads."I told him of Poe's contrivance of the hook and chain, and how the
heaviest rails were easily overturned with it, and how the ties were
piled and fired and the rails twisted out of shape.The President
listened to every word with intense interest.he exclaimed, "we have got a general.Caesar burnt his
bridges behind him, but Sherman burns his rails.Then I began to tell him how
the <DW64>s had flocked into our camps, and how simply and plainly the
General had talked to them, advising them against violence of any kind,
and explaining to them that "Freedom" meant only the liberty to earn
their own living in their own way, and not freedom from work."We have got a general, sure enough," he cried."He talks to them
plainly, does he, so that they understand?I say to you, Brice," he went
on earnestly, "the importance of plain talk can't be overestimated.Any
thought, however abstruse, can be put in speech that a boy or a
<DW64> can grasp.Any book, however deep, can be written in terms that
everybody can comprehend, if a man only tries hard enough.When I was a
boy I used to hear the neighbors talking, and it bothered me so because
I could not understand them that I used to sit up half the night
thinking things out for myself.I remember that I did not know what the
word demonstrate meant.So I stopped my studies then and there and got a
volume of Euclid.Before I got through I could demonstrate everything in
it, and I have never been bothered with demonstrate since."I thought of those wonderfully limpid speeches of his: of the Freeport
debates, and of the contrast between his style and Douglas's.And I
understood the reason for it at last.I understood the supreme mind that
had conceived the Freeport Question.And as I stood before him then, at
the close of this fearful war, the words of the Gospel were in my mind.'So the last shall be first, and the first, last; for many be called,
but few chosen.'How I wished that all those who have maligned and tortured him could
talk with him as I had talked with him.To know his great heart would
disarm them of all antagonism.They would feel, as I feel, that his life
is so much nobler than theirs, and his burdens so much heavier, that
they would go away ashamed of their criticism.He said to me once, "Brice, I hope we are in sight of the end, now.I
hope that we may get through without any more fighting.I don't want to
see any more of our countrymen killed.And then," he said, as if talking
to himself, "and then we must show them mercy--mercy."I thought it a good time to mention Colfax's case.He has been on my
mind ever since.Once he sighed, and
he was winding his long fingers around each other while I talked.Lincoln," I concluded, "And if a
technicality will help him out, he was actually within his own skirmish
line at the time.The Rebel skirmishers had not fallen back on each side
of him.""Brice," he said, with that sorrowful smile, "a technicality might save
Colfax, but it won't save me.And I went on to tell of what he had done at Vicksburg, leaving
out, however, my instrumentality in having him sent north.(That seems to be a favorite expression of
his.)If it wasn't for them, the
South would have quit long ago."Then he looked at me in his funny way,
and said, "See here, Steve, if this Colfax isn't exactly a friend of
yours, there must be some reason why you are pleading for him in this
way.""Well, sir," I said, at length, "I should like to get him off on account
of his cousin, Miss Virginia Carvel.And I told him something about
Miss Carvel, and how she had helped you with the Union sergeant that day
in the hot hospital.And how she had nursed Judge Whipple.""She's a fine woman," he said."Those women have helped those men to
prolong this war about three years.""And yet we must save them for the nation's sake.They are to be the
mothers of our patriots in days to come.Is she a friend of yours, too,
Steve?""Not especially, sir," I answered finally."I have had to offend her
rather often.he cried, jumping up, "she's a daughter of Colonel Carvel.I
always had an admiration for that man.An ideal Southern gentleman of
the old school,--courteous, as honorable and open as the day, and as
brave as a lion.You've heard the story of how he threw a man named
Babcock out of his store, who tried to bribe him?""I heard you tell it in that tavern, sir.It
did me good to hear the Colonel praised."I always liked that story," he said."By the way, what's become of the
Colonel?""He got away--South, sir," I answered.He hasn't
been heard of since the summer of '63.And so
you want me to pardon this Colfax?""It would be presumptuous in me to go that far, sir," I replied."But I
hoped you might speak of it to the General when he comes.And I would be
glad of the opportunity to testify."He took a few strides up and down the room."Well, well," he said, "that's my vice--pardoning, saying yes.It's
always one more drink with me.It--" he smiled--"it makes me sleep
better.I've pardoned enough Rebels to populate New Orleans.Why," he
continued, with his whimsical look, "just before I left Washington, in
comes one of your Missouri senators with a list of Rebels who are shut
up in McDowell's and Alton.I said:-- "'Senator, you're not going to ask
me to turn loose all those at once?'"He said just what you said when you were speaking of Missouri a while
ago, that he was afraid of guerilla warfare, and that the war was nearly
over.And then what does he do but pull out another batch
longer than the first!you don't want me to turn these loose, too?'I think it will pay to be merciful.'"'Then durned if I don't,' I said, and I signed 'em."STEAMER "RIVER QUEEN."ON THE POTOMAC, April 9, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I am glad that the telegrams I have been able to send
reached you safely.I have not had time to write, and this will be but a
short letter.I am on the President's boat,
in the President's party, bound with him for Washington.And this is how
it happened: The very afternoon of the day I wrote you, General Sherman
himself arrived at City Point on the steamer 'Russia'.I heard the
salutes, and was on the wharf to meet him.That same afternoon he and
General Grant and Admiral Porter went aboard the River Queen to see
the President.How I should have liked to be present at that interview!After it was over they all came out of the cabin together General Grant
silent, and smoking, as usual; General Sherman talking vivaciously;
and Lincoln and the Admiral smiling and listening.I shall never expect to see such a sight again in all my days.You
can imagine my surprise when the President called me from where I was
standing at some distance with the other officers.He put his hand on my
shoulder then and there, and turned to General Sherman."Major Brice is a friend of mine, General," he said."He never told me that," said the General."I guess he's got a great many important things shut up inside of him,"
said Mr."But he gave you a good recommendation,
Sherman.He said that you wore white socks, and that the boys liked
you and called you 'Uncle Billy.'And I told him that was the best
recommendation he could give anybody."But the General only looked at me with those eyes that
go through everything, and then he laughed."Brice," he said, "You'll have my reputation ruined."Lincoln, "you don't want the Major right away, do
you?Let him stay around here for a while with me.He looked at the general-in-chief, who was smiling just
a little bit."I've got a sneaking notion that Grant's going to do
something."Lincoln," said my General, "you may have Brice.Be
careful he doesn't talk you to death--he's said too much already."I have no time now to tell you all that I have seen and heard.I have
ridden with the President, and have gone with him on errands of mercy
and errands of cheer.I have been almost within sight of what we hope is
the last struggle of this frightful war.I have listened to the guns of
Five Forks, where Sheridan and Warren bore their own colors in the front
of the charge, I was with Mr.Lincoln while the battle of Petersburg was
raging, and there were tears in his eyes.Then came the retreat of Lee and the instant pursuit of Grant,
and--Richmond.The quiet General did not so much as turn aside to enter
the smoking city he had besieged for so long.But I went there, with the
President.And if I had one incident in my life to live over again, I
should choose this.As we were going up the river, a disabled steamer
lay across the passage in the obstruction of piles the Confederates had
built.There were but a few of us in his
party, and we stepped into Admiral Porter's twelve-oared barge and were
rowed to Richmond, the smoke of the fires still darkening the sky.We
landed within a block of Libby Prison.With the little guard of ten sailors he marched the mile and a half
to General Weitzel's headquarters,--the presidential mansion of the
Confederacy.I shall remember him always as
I saw him that day, a tall, black figure of sorrow, with the high silk
hat we have learned to love.Unafraid, his heart rent with pity, he
walked unharmed amid such tumult as I have rarely seen.The windows
filled, the streets ahead of us became choked, as the word that the
President was coming ran on like quick-fire.The <DW64>s wept aloud and cried
hosannas.They pressed upon him that they might touch the hem of his
coat, and one threw himself on his knees and kissed the President's
feet.Still he walked on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins.Not as a
conqueror was he come, to march in triumph.Though there were many times when we had to fight for a path through the
crowds, he did not seem to feel the danger.Was it because he knew that his hour was not yet come?To-day, on the boat, as we were steaming between the green shores of the
Potomac, I overheard him reading to Mr.Sumner:--

          "Duncan is in his grave;
        After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
        Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
        Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
        Can touch him further."WILLARD'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, April 10, 1865.I have looked up the passage, and have written it in above.MAN OF SORROW

The train was late--very late.It was Virginia who first caught sight
of the new dome of the Capitol through the slanting rain, but she merely
pressed her lips together and said nothing.In the dingy brick station
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one person paused to look
after them, and a kind-hearted lady who had been in the car kissed the
girl good-by."You think that you can find your uncle's house, my dear?"she asked,
glancing at Virginia with concern.Through all of that long journey she
had worn a look apart."Do you think you can find your uncle's house?"And then she smiled as she looked at the honest,
alert, and squarely built gentleman beside her.Whereupon the kind lady gave the Captain her hand."You look as if you
could, Captain," said she."Remember, if General Carvel is out of town,
you promised to bring her to me.""Yes, ma'am," said Captain Lige, "and so I shall."No sah, dat ain't de kerridge
you wants.Dat's it, lady, you'se lookin at it.Kerridge, kerridge,
kerridge!"Virginia tried bravely to smile, but she was very near to tears as she
stood on the uneven pavement and looked at the scrawny horses standing
patiently in the steady downpour.All sorts of people were coming
and going, army officers and navy officers and citizens of states and
territories, driving up and driving away.She was thinking then of the multitude who came here with aching
hearts,--with heavier hearts than was hers that day.How many of the
throng hurrying by would not flee, if they could, back to the peaceful
homes they had left?Destroyed,
like her own, by the war.Women with children at their breasts, and
mothers bowed with sorrow, had sought this city in their agony.Young
men and old had come hither, striving to keep back the thoughts of dear
ones left behind, whom they might never see again.And by the thousands
and tens of thousands they had passed from here to the places of blood
beyond."Do you know where General Daniel Carvel lives?""Yes, sah, reckon I does.Virginia sank back on the stuffy cushions of the rattle-trap, and then
sat upright again and stared out of the window at the dismal scene.They
were splashing through a sea of mud.Louis,
Captain Lige had done his best to cheer her, and he did not intend to
desist now."So this is Washington, Why, it don't
compare to St.Louis, except we haven't got the White House and the
Capitol.Jinny, it would take a scow to get across the street, and we
don't have ramshackly stores and <DW65> cabins bang up against fine
Houses like that.We don't
have any dirty pickaninnies dodging among the horses in our residence
streets.I declare, Jinny, if those aren't pigs!""I hope Uncle Daniel has some breakfast for you.You've had a good deal to put up with on this trip.""Lordy, Jinny," said the Captain, "I'd put up with a good deal more than
this for the sake of going anywhere with you.""Even to such a doleful place as this?""This is all right, if the sun'll only come out and dry things up and
let us see the green on those trees," he said, "Lordy, how I do love to
see the spring green in the sunlight!""Lige," she said, "you know you're just trying to keep up my spirits.You've been doing that ever since we left home.""No such thing," he replied with vehemence."There's nothing for you to
be cast down about.""Suppose I can't make your Black
Republican President pardon Clarence!"said the Captain, squeezing her hand and trying to appear
unconcerned.Just then the rattletrap pulled up at the sidewalk, the wheels of the
near side in four inches of mud, and the Captain leaped out and spread
the umbrella.They were in front of a rather imposing house of brick,
flanked on one side by a house just like it, and on the other by a
series of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools.They
climbed the steps and rang the bell.In due time the door was opened by
a smiling yellow butler in black."Yas, miss, But he ain't to home now."Didn't he get my telegram day before
yesterday?"He's done gone since Saturday, miss."And then, evidently impressed by
the young lady's looks, he added hospitably, "Kin I do anything fo' you,
miss?""I'm his niece, Miss Virginia Carvel, and this is Captain Brent."The yellow butler's face lighted up."Come right in, Miss Jinny, Done heerd de General speak of you
often--yas'm.De General'll be to home dis a'ternoon, suah.'Twill do
him good ter see you, Miss Jinny.Walk right
in, Cap'n, and make yo'selves at home.Lizbeth--Lizbeth!"Done seed her at
Calve't House."Very well, Lizbeth," said Virginia, listlessly sitting down on the hall
sofa."Yas'm," said Lizbeth, "jes' reckon we kin."She ushered them into a
walnut dining room, big and high and sombre, with plush-bottomed chairs
placed about--walnut also; for that was the fashion in those days.But the Captain had no sooner seated himself than he shot up again and
started out."To pay off the carriage driver," he said."I'm going to the White House in a little
while.""To see your Black Republican President," she replied, with alarming
calmness."Now, Jinny," he cried, in excited appeal, "don't go doin' any such fool
trick as that.Your Uncle Dan'l will be here this afternoon.And then the thing'll be fixed all right, and no
mistake."Her reply was in the same tone--almost a monotone--which she had used
for three days.It made the Captain very uneasy, for he knew when she
spoke in that way that her will was in it."And to lose that time," she answered, "may be to have him shot.""But you can't get to the President without credentials," he objected."What," she flashed, "hasn't any one a right to see the President?You
mean to say that he will not see a woman in trouble?Then all these
pretty stories I hear of him are false.They are made up by the
Yankees."He had some notion of the multitude of calls upon Mr.But he could not, he dared not,
remind her of the principal reason for this,--Lee's surrender and the
approaching end of the war.In the distant valley of the Mississippi he had only heard of
the President very conflicting things.He had heard him criticised and
reviled and praised, just as is every man who goes to the White House,
be he saint or sinner.And, during an administration, no man at a
distance may come at a President's true character and worth.The Captain
had seen Lincoln caricatured vilely.And again he had read and heard the
pleasant anecdotes of which Virginia had spoken, until he did not know
what to believe.As for Virginia, he knew her partisanship to, and undying love for, the
South; he knew the class prejudice which was bound to assert itself, and
he had seen enough in the girl's demeanor to fear that she was going to
demand rather than implore.She did not come of a race that was wont to
bend the knee."Well, well," he said despairingly, "you must eat some breakfast first,
Jinny."She waited with an ominous calmness until it was brought in, and then
she took a part of a roll and some coffee."This won't do," exclaimed the Captain."Why, why, that won't get you
halfway to Mr."You must eat enough, Lige," she said.He was finished in an incredibly short time, and amid the protestations
of Lizbeth and the yellow butler they got into the carriage again, and
splashed and rattled toward the White House.Once Virginia glanced out,
and catching sight of the bedraggled flags on the houses in honor of
Lee's surrender, a look of pain crossed her face.The Captain could not
repress a note of warning."Jinny," said he, "I have an idea that you'll find the President a good
deal of a man.Now if you're allowed to see him, don't get him mad,
Jinny, whatever you do.""If he is something of a man, Lige, he will not lose his temper with a
woman."And just then they came in sight of the house of
the Presidents, with its beautiful portico and its broad wings.And they
turned in under the dripping trees of the grounds.A carriage with a
black coachman and footman was ahead of them, and they saw two stately
gentlemen descend from it and pass the guard at the door.The Captain helped her out in his best manner, and gave some
money to the driver."I reckon he needn't wait for us this time, Jinny," said be.She shook
her head and went in, he following, and they were directed to the
anteroom of the President's office on the second floor.There were
many people in the corridors, and one or two young officers in blue who
stared at her.But her spirits sank when they came to the anteroom.It was full of all
sorts of people.Politicians, both prosperous and seedy, full faced and
keen faced, seeking office; women, officers, and a one-armed soldier
sitting in the corner.He was among the men who offered Virginia their
seats, and the only one whom she thanked.But she walked directly to the
doorkeeper at the end of the room."Then you'll have to wait your turn, sir," he said, shaking his head and
looking at Virginia."It's slow work waiting your turn,
there's so many governors and generals and senators, although the
session's over.And added, with an inspiration,
"I must see him.She saw instantly, with a woman's instinct, that these words had had
their effect.The old man glanced at her again, as if demurring."You're sure, miss, it's life and death?""Oh, why should I say so if it were not?""The orders are very strict," he said."But the President told me to
give precedence to cases when a life is in question.Just you wait a
minute, miss, until Governor Doddridge comes out, and I'll see what I
can do for you.In a little while the heavy door
opened, and a portly, rubicund man came out with a smile on his face.He broke into a laugh, when halfway across the room, as if the memory of
what he had heard were too much for his gravity.The doorkeeper slipped
into the room, and there was a silent, anxious interval.Captain Lige started forward with her, but she restrained him."Wait for me here, Lige," she said.She swept in alone, and the door closed softly after her.The room was
a big one, and there were maps on the table, with pins sticking in them.Could this fantastically tall, stooping figure before her be that of the
President of the United States?She stopped, as from the shock he gave
her.The lean, yellow face with the mask-like lines all up and down,
the unkempt, tousled hair, the beard--why, he was a hundred times more
ridiculous than his caricatures.He might have stood for many of the
poor white trash farmers she had seen in Kentucky--save for the long
black coat.Somehow that smile changed his face a
little."I guess I'll have to own up," he answered."My name is Virginia Carvel," she said."I have come all the way from
St."Miss Carvel," said the President, looking at her intently, "I have
rarely been so flattered in my life.I--I hope I have not disappointed
you.""Oh, you haven't," she cried, her eyes flashing, "because I am what you
would call a Rebel."The mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more.And then she saw that the President was laughing."And have you a better name for it, Miss Carvel?""Because I
am searching for a better name--just now.""No, thank you," said Virginia; "I think that I can say what I have come
to say better standing."That reminds me of a story they tell
about General Buck Tanner.One day the
boys asked him over to the square to make a speech."'I'm all right when I get standing up, Liza,' he said to his wife.Only trouble is they come too cussed fast.How'm I going to stop 'em when I want to?'"'Well, I du declare, Buck,' said she, 'I gave you credit for some
sense.All you've got to do is to set down."So the General went over to the square and talked for about an hour
and a half, and then a Chicago man shouted to him to dry up."'Boys,' said he, 'it's jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you.You'll have to hand up a chair, boys, because I'm never going to get
shet of this goldarned speech any anther way.'"Lincoln had told this so comically that Virginia was forced to
laugh, and she immediately hated herself.A man who could joke at such
a time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his
office.And yet this was the President
who had conducted the war, whose generals had conquered the Confederacy.And she was come to ask him a favor.Lincoln," she began, "I have come to talk to you about my cousin,
Colonel Clarence Colfax.""I shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin, Colonel Colfax, Miss
Carvel."He is my first cousin," she retorted."Why didn't he come
with you?""He is Clarence Colfax, of St.Louis, now a Colonel in the army of the Confederate States."Virginia tossed her head in
exasperation."In General Joseph Johnston's army," she replied, trying to be patient."But now," she gulped, "now he has been arrested as a spy by General
Sherman's army.""And--and they are going to shoot him.""Oh, no, he doesn't," she cried."You don't know how brave he is!He
floated down the Mississippi on a log, out of Vicksburg, and brought
back thousands and thousands of percussion caps.He rowed across the
river when the Yankee fleet was going down, and set fire to De Soto so
that they could see to shoot."Lincoln, "that's a good starter.""Miss Carvel," said he, "that argument reminds me of a story about a man
I used to know in the old days in Illinois.His name was McNeil, and he
was a lawyer."One day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before
Judge Drake."'Judge, says McNeil, 'you oughtn't to lock this man up.It was a fair
fight, and he's the best man in the state in a fair fight.And, what's
more, he's never been licked in a fair fight in his life.'"'And if your honor does lock me up,' the prisoner put in, 'I'll give
your honor a thunderin' big lickin' when I get out.'"'Gentlemen,' said he, 'it's a powerful queer argument, but the Court
will admit it on its merits.The prisoner will please to step out on the
grass.'"She was striving against
something, she knew not what.Her breath was coming deeply, and she was
dangerously near to tears.She had come into
this man's presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor.Now she could not look into it
without an odd sensation.Told her a few funny stories--given quizzical
answers to some of her questions.Quizzical, yes; but she could not be
sure then there was not wisdom in them, and that humiliated her.She had
never conceived of such a man.And, be it added gratuitously, Virginia
deemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men.Lincoln, "to continue for the defence, I believe
that Colonel Colfax first distinguished himself at the time of Camp
Jackson, when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole."Startled, she looked up at him swiftly, and then down again."Yes,"
she answered, "yes.Lincoln, please don't hold that against
him."If she could only have seen his face then."My dear young lady," replied the President, "I honor him for it.I was
merely elaborating the argument which you have begun.On the other hand,
it is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned
and attempted to enter General Sherman's lines as a civilian,--as a
spy."He had spoken these last words very gently, but she was too excited to
heed his gentleness.She drew herself up, a gleam in her eyes like the
crest of a blue wave in a storm.she cried; "it takes more courage to be a spy than anything
else in war.You are not content in, the North
with what you have gained.You are not content with depriving us of
our rights, and our fortunes, with forcing us back to an allegiance we
despise.You are not content with humiliating our generals and putting
innocent men in prisons.But now I suppose you will shoot us all.And
all this mercy that I have heard about means nothing--nothing--"

Why did she falter and stop?"Miss Carvel," said the President, "I am afraid from what I have heard
just now, that it means nothing."Oh, the sadness of that voice,--the
ineffable sadness,--the sadness and the woe of a great nation!And the
sorrow in those eyes, the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meekly,--how
heavy none will ever know.The pain of a crown of thorns worn for a
world that did not understand.No wonder Virginia faltered and
was silent.She looked at Abraham Lincoln standing there, bent and
sorrowful, and it was as if a light had fallen upon him.But strangest
of all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength.It was the
same strength she had felt in Stephen Brice.This was the thought that
came to her.Slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds
where the wind was shaking the wet trees, past the unfinished monument
to the Father of her country, and across the broad Potomac to Alexandria
in the hazy distance.The rain beat upon the panes, and then she knew
that she was crying softly to herself.She had met a force that she
could not conquer, she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not
fathom, albeit she had known sorrow.She turned and looked through her tears
at his face that was all compassion."Tell me about your cousin," he said; "are you going to marry him?"But in
that moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her
soul.Lincoln," she said; "I was--but I did not love him.I--I think
that was one reason why he was so reckless.""The officer who happened to see Colonel Colfax captured is now in
Washington.When your name was given to me, I sent for him.Perhaps he
is in the anteroom now.I should like to tell you, first of all, that
this officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him."He strode to the bell-cord, and spoke a few
words to the usher who answered his ring.Then the door opened, and a young officer, spare,
erect, came quickly into the room, and bowed respectfully to the
President.He saw her lips part and the
color come flooding into her face.The President sighed But the light in her eyes was reflected in his own.It has been truly said that Abraham Lincoln knew the human heart.The officer still stood facing the President, the girl staring at his
profile.Lincoln,
"when you asked me to pardon Colonel Colfax, I believe that you told me
he was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured."Suddenly Stephen turned, as if impelled by the President's gaze, and so
his eyes met Virginia's.He forgot time and place,--for the while even
this man whom he revered above all men.He saw her hand tighten on the
arm of her chair.He took a step toward her, and stopped."He put in a plea, a lawyer's plea, wholly unworthy of him, Miss
Virginia.He asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality.Just the exclamation escaped her--nothing more.The
crimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks.Slowly the eyes
she had yielded to Stephen came back again and rested on the President.And now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful.Lawyer," the President continued, "that I
am not letting off Colonel Colfax on a technicality.I am sparing his
life," he said slowly, "because the time for which we have been waiting
and longing for four years is now at hand--the time to be merciful.She crossed the room, her head lifted, her heart
lifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.Lincoln," she faltered, "I did not know you when I came here.I
should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice
praise you.Oh," she cried, "how I wish that every man and woman and
child in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you
to-day.I think--I think that some of their bitterness might be taken
away."Abraham Lincoln laid his hands upon the girl.And Stephen, watching,
knew that he was looking upon a benediction.Lincoln, "I have not suffered by the South, I have
suffered with the South.Your sorrow has been my sorrow, and your pain
has been my pain.And what you have
gained," he added sublimely, "I have gained."The clouds were flying before the wind,
and a patch of blue sky shone above the Potomac.With his long arm he
pointed across the river to the southeast, and as if by a miracle a
shaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of Alexandria."In the first days of the war," he said, "a flag flew there in sight of
the place where George Washington lived and died.I used to watch
that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it.And
sometimes, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony
just there.""I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of
it was my punishment.Before we could become the great nation He has
destined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood."I say in all sincerity, may you always love it.May the day come when
this Nation, North and South, may look back upon it with reverence.Thousands upon thousands of brave Americans have died under it for what
they believed was right.But may the day come again when you will love
that flag you see there now--Washington's flag--better still."He stopped, and the tears were wet upon Virginia's lashes.Lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it.Then he began
to write, slouched forward, one knee resting on the floor, his lips
moving at the same time.When he got up again he seemed taller than
ever.he said, "I guess that will fix it.I'll have that sent to
Sherman.I have already spoken to him about the matter."He turned to Stephen
with that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear."Steve," he said, "I'll tell you a story.The other night Harlan was
here making a speech to a crowd out of the window, and my boy Tad was
sitting behind him."'No,' says Tad, 'hang on to 'em.'That is what we intend to do,--hang on to 'em.Lincoln, putting his hand again on Virginia's
shoulder, "if you have the sense I think you have, you'll hang on, too."For an instant he stood smiling at their blushes,--he to whom the power
was given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the
happiness of others.he said, "I am ten
minutes behind my appointment at the Department.Miss Virginia, you may
care to thank the Major for the little service he has done you.You can
do so undisturbed here.As he opened the door he paused and looked back at them.The smile
passed from his face, and an ineffable expression of longing--longing
and tenderness--came upon it.For a space, while his spell was upon them, they did not stir.Then
Stephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him.It was Virginia who first found her voice, and she
called him by his name."Oh, Stephen," she said, "how sad he looked!"He was close to her, at her side.And he answered her in the earnest
tone which she knew so well."Virginia, if I could have had what I most wished for in the world, I
should have asked that you should know Abraham Lincoln."Then she dropped her eyes, and her breath came quickly."I--I might have known," she answered, "I might have known what he was.I had seen him in you, and I did not know.Do you remember that day when we were in the summer-house together at
Glencoe, long ago?"You were changed then," she said bravely."When I saw him," said Stephen, reverently, "I knew how little and
narrow I was."Then, overcome by the incense of her presence, he drew her to him until
her heart beat against his own.She did not resist, but lifted her face
to him, and he kissed her."Yes, Stephen," she answered, low, more wonderful in her surrender than
ever before.Then she hid her face against his blue coat.Oh, Stephen, how I have struggled against it!How I have tried to hate you, and couldn't.I tried to
insult you, I did insult you.And when I saw how splendidly you bore it,
I used to cry.""I loved you through it all," he said.She raised her head quickly, and awe was in her eyes."Because I dreamed of you," he answered."And those dreams used to linger
with me half the day as I went about my work.I used to think of them as
I sat in the saddle on the march.""I, too, treasured them," she said.Faintly, "I have no one but you--now."Once more he drew her to him, and she gloried in his strength."God help me to cherish you, dear," he said, "and guard you well."She drew away from him, gently, and turned toward the window."See, Stephen," she cried, "the sun has come out at last."For a while they were silent, looking out; the drops glistened on blade
and leaf, and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their
hearts.ANNAPOLIS

IT was Virginia's wish, and was therefore sacred.As for Stephen, he
little cared whither they went.And so they found themselves on that
bright afternoon in mid-April under the great trees that arch the
unpaved streets of old Annapolis.They stopped by direction at a gate, and behind it was a green cluster
of lilac bushes, which lined the walk to the big plum- house
which Lionel Carvel had built.Virginia remembered that down this walk
on a certain day in June, a hundred years agone, Richard Carvel had led
Dorothy Manners.They climbed the steps, tottering now with age and disuse, and Virginia
playfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been
wont to polish until it shone.Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy
key that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock.The door swung open, and Virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors.It was musty and damp this day as the day when Richard had come back
from England and found it vacant and his grandfather dead.But there,
at the parting of the stairs, was the triple-arched window which he had
described.Through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now, even
as then, checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green.But
the tall clock which Lionel Carvel used to wind was at Calvert House,
with many another treasure.They went up the stairs, and reverently they walked over the bare
floors, their footfalls echoing through the silent house.A score of
scenes in her great-grandfather's life came to Virginia.Here was the
room--the cornet one at the back of the main building, which looked out
over the deserted garden--that had been Richard's mother's.She recalled
how he had stolen into it on that summer's day after his return, and had
flung open the shutters.They were open now, for their locks were off.The prie-dieu was gone, and the dresser.But the high bed was there,
stripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains; and the steps by
which she had entered it.And next they went into the great square room that had been Lionel
Carvel's, and there, too, was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman
had lain with the gout, while Richard read to him from the Spectator.One side of it looked out on the trees in Freshwater Lane; and the other
across the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the
blue and white waters of the Chesapeake."Honey," said Virginia, as they stood in the deep recess of the window,
"wouldn't it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world?But you would never be content to do that," she said,
smiling reproachfully."You are the kind of man who must be in the midst
of things.In a little while you will have far more besides me to think
about."He was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice."We all have our duty to perform in the world, dear," he answered."To think that I should have married a
Puritan!What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who was
such a stanch Royalist?Why, I think I can see him frowning at me now,
from the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat.""He was well punished," retorted Stephen, "his own grandson was a Whig,
and seems to have married a woman of spirit.""I am sure that she did not allow my
great-grandfather to kiss her--unless she wanted to."And she looked up at him, half smiling, half pouting; altogether
bewitching."From what I hear of him, he was something of a man," said Stephen."I am glad that Marlborough Street isn't a crowded thoroughfare," said
Virginia.When they had seen the dining room, with its carved mantel and silver
door-knobs, and the ballroom in the wing, they came out, and Stephen
locked the door again.They walked around the house, and stood looking
down the terraces,--once stately, but crumbled now,--where Dorothy had
danced on the green on Richard's birthday.Beyond and below was the
spring-house, and there was the place where the brook dived under the
ruined wall,--where Dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the
valley before she sailed for London.The remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the
outlines of the formal garden.The trim hedges, for seventy years
neglected, had grown incontinent.The garden itself was full of wild
green things coming up through the brown of last season's growth.But
in the grass the blue violets nestled, and Virginia picked some of these
and put them in Stephen's coat."You must keep them always," she said, "because we got them here."They spied a seat beside a hoary trunk.There on many a spring day
Lionel Carvel had sat reading his Gazette.The sun hung low over the old-world gables in the street beyond the
wall, and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white, like a
bride.The sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered
in the air."Stephen, do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic, when you
came over from Anne Brinsmade's to reassure me?""But what made you think of it now?"But you were so strong, so calm,
so sure of yourself.I think that made me angry when I thought how
ridiculous I must have been."But do
you know what I had under my arm--what I was saving of all the things I
owned?""No," he answered; "but I have often wondered.""This house--this place made me think of it.It was Dorothy Manners's
gown, and her necklace.They were all the
remembrance I had of that night at Mr.Brinsmade's gate, when we came so
near to each other.""Virginia," he said, "some force that we cannot understand has brought
us together, some force that we could not hinder.It is foolish for me
to say so, but on that day of the slave auction, when I first saw you,
I had a premonition about you that I have never admitted until now, even
to myself.""Why, Stephen," she cried, "I felt the same way!""And then," he continued quickly, "it was strange that I should have
gone to Judge Whipple, who was an intimate of your father's--such a
singular intimate.And then came your party, and Glencoe, and that
curious incident at the Fair.""When I was talking to the Prince, and looked up and saw you among all
those people.""That was the most uncomfortable of all, for me.""Stephen," she said, stirring the leaves at her feet, "you might have
taken me in your arms the night Judge Whipple died--if you had wanted
to.I love you all the more for
that."Again she said:-- "It was through your mother, dearest, that we were
most strongly drawn together.I worshipped her from the day I saw her in
the hospital.I believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the
North.""My mother would have chosen you above all women, Virginia," he
answered.In the morning came to them the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.And the
same thought was in both their hearts, who had known him as it was given
to few to know him.How he had lived in sorrow; how he had died a martyr
on the very day of Christ's death upon the cross.And they believed that
Abraham Lincoln gave his life for his country even as Christ gave his
for the world.And so must we believe that God has reserved for this Nation a destiny
high upon the earth.Many years afterward Stephen Brice read again to his wife those sublime
closing words of the second inaugural:--

   "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
   right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish
   the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him
   who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his children
   --to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace
   among ourselves and with all nations."AFTERWORD

The author has chosen St.Louis for the principal scene of this story
for many reasons.Grant and Sherman were living there before the Civil
War, and Abraham Lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring
state of Illinois.It has been one of the aims of this book to show the
remarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the
West.Louis, which was founded by Laclede in 1765,
likewise became the principal meeting-place of two great streams of
emigration which had been separated, more or less, since Cromwell's day.To be sure, they were not all Cavaliers who settled in the tidewater
Colonies.There were Puritan settlements in both Maryland and Virginia.But the life in the Southern states took on the more liberal tinge which
had characterized that of the Royalists, even to the extent of affecting
the Scotch Calvinists, while the asceticism of the Roundheads was the
keynote of the Puritan character in New England.When this great country
of ours began to develop, the streams moved westward; one over what
became the plain states of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and the other
across the Blue Ridge Mountains into Kentucky and Tennessee.They mixed
along the line of the Ohio River.Louis, and, farther
west, in Kansas.The part played by
this people in the Civil War is a matter of history.The scope of this
book has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading
classes which formed the mass in this movement.But Richter, the type
of the university-bred revolutionist which emigrated after '48, is drawn
more or less from life.And the duel described actually took place in
Berlin.Louis is the author's birthplace, and his home, the home of those
friends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him
with unfaltering kindness.He begs that they will believe him when he
says that only such characters as he loves are reminiscent of those
he has known there.The city has a large population,--large enough to
include all the types that are to be found in the middle West.This book is written of a time when feeling ran high.It has been necessary to put strong speech into the mouths of the
characters.The breach that threatened our country's existence is healed
now.There is no side but Abraham Lincoln's side.And this side, with
all reverence and patriotism, the author has tried to take.Abraham Lincoln loved the South as well as the North.Camelford of to-day is certainly not the Camelot of King Arthur--but
a very respectable, commonplace little town, much like other country
towns; the same genteel linendrapers' and un-genteel ironmongers'
shops; the same old-established commercial inn, and a few ugly, but
solid-looking private houses, with their faces to the street and
their backs nestled in gardens and fields.Some of the inhabitants of
these said houses were to be seen taking a quiet afternoon stroll.Doubtless they are eminently respectable and worthy folk, leading a
mild provincial life like the people in Miss Martineau's _Deerbrook_,
or Miss Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_--of which latter quality they
have probably a good share.We let our horses rest, but we ourselves felt not the slightest wish to
rest at Camelford, so walked leisurely on till we came to the little
river Camel, and to Slaughter Bridge, said to be the point where King
Arthur's army was routed and where he received his death-wound.A
slab of stone, some little distance up the stream, is still called
"King Arthur's Tomb."But as his coffin is preserved, as well as his
Round Table, at Winchester; where, according to mediaeval tradition,
the bodies of both Arthur and Guinevere were found, and the head
of Guinevere had yellow hair; also that near the little village of
Davidstow, is a long barrow, having in the centre a mound, which is
called "King Arthur's grave"--inquiring minds have plenty of "facts" to
choose from.Possibly at last they had better resort to fiction, and
believe in Arthur's disappearance, as Tennyson makes him say,

  "To the island-valley of Avillion...
  Where I may heal me of my grievous wound."Dozmare Pool we found so far out of our route that we had to make a
virtue of necessity, and imagine it all; the melancholy moorland lake,
with the bleak hill above it, and stray glimpses of the sea beyond.A ghostly spot, and full of many ghostly stories besides the legend
of Arthur.Here Tregeagle, the great demon of Cornwall, once had his
dwelling, until, selling his soul to the devil, his home was sunk to
the bottom of the mere, and himself is heard of stormy nights, wailing
round it with other ghost-demons, in which the Cornish mind still
lingeringly believes.Visionary packs of hounds; a shadowy coach and
horses, which drives round and round the pool, and then drives into it;
flitting lights, kindled by no human hand, in places where no human
foot could go--all these tales are still told by the country folk, and
we might have heard them all.Might also have seen, in fancy, the flash
of the "brand Excalibur"; heard the wailing song of the three queens;
and pictured the dying Arthur lying on the lap of his sister Morgane la
Faye.But, I forgot, this is an un-sentimental journey.The Delabole quarries are as un-sentimental a place as one could
desire.It was very curious to come suddenly upon this world of slate,
piled up in enormous masses on either side the road, and beyond them
hills of debris, centuries old--for the mines have been worked ever
since the time of Queen Elizabeth.Houses, walls, gates, fences,
everything that can possibly be made of slate, is made.No green or
other colour tempers the all-pervading shade of bluish-grey, for
vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the quarries is abolished,
the result of which would be rather dreary, save for the cheerful
atmosphere of wholesome labour, the noise of waggons, horses,
steam-engines--such a contrast to the silence of the deserted tin-mines.But, these Delabole quarries passed, silence and solitude come back
again.Even the yearly-increasing influx of tourists fails to make
the little village of Trevena anything but a village, where the
said tourists lounge about in the one street, if it can be called a
street, between the two inns and the often-painted, picturesque old
post-office.Everything looked so simple, so home-like, that we were
amused to find we had to get ready for a _table d'hote_ dinner, in
the only available eating room where the one indefatigable waitress,
a comely Cornish girl, who seemed Argus and Briareus rolled into one,
served us--a party small enough to make conversation general, and
pleasant and intelligent enough to make it very agreeable, which does
not always happen at an English hotel.Then we sallied out to find the lane which leads to Tintagel Castle,
or Castles--for one sits in the sea, the other on the opposite heights
in the mainland, with power of communicating by the narrow causeway
which now at least exists between the rock and the shore.This seems to
confirm the legend, how the luckless husband of Ygrayne shut up himself
and his wife in two castles, he being slain in the one, and she married
to the victorious King Uther Pendragon, in the other.Both looked so steep and dangerous in the fast-coming twilight that we
thought it best to attempt neither, so contented ourselves with a walk
on the cliffs and the smooth green field which led thither.Leaning
against a gate, we stood and watched one of the grandest out of the
many grand sunsets which had blessed us in Cornwall.The black rock of
Tintagel filled the foreground; beyond, the eye saw nothing but sea,
the sea which covers vanished Lyonesse, until it met the sky, a clear
amber with long bars like waves, so that you could hardly tell where
sea ended and sky began.Then into it there swam slowly a long low
cloud, shaped like a boat, with a raised prow, and two or three figures
sitting at the stern."King Arthur and the three queens," we declared, and really a very
moderate imagination could have fancied it this."But what is that long
black thing at the bow?""Oh," observed drily the most practical of the three, "it's King
Arthur's luggage."We fell into fits of laughter, and
went home to tea and bed.DAYS FOURTEENTH, FIFTEENTH, AND SIXTEENTH--


And all Arthurian days, so I will condense them into one chapter, and
not spin out the hours that were flying so fast.Yet we hardly wished
to stop them; for pleasant as travelling is, the best delight of all
is--the coming home.Walking, to one more of those exquisite autumn days, warm as summer,
yet with a tender brightness that hot summer never has, like the love
between two old people, out of whom all passion has died--we remembered
that we were at Tintagel, the home of Ygrayne and Arthur, of King Mark
and Tristram and Iseult.I had to tell that story to my girls in the
briefest form, how King Mark sent his nephew, Sir Tristram, to fetch
home Iseult of Ireland for his queen, and on the voyage Bragswaine,
her handmaiden, gave each a love-potion, which caused the usual fatal
result; how at last Tristram fled from Tintagel into Brittany, where
he married another Iseult "of the white hands," and lived peacefully,
till, stricken by death, his fancy went back to his old love, whom he
implored to come to him.A tale--of which
the only redeeming point is the innocence, simplicity, and dignity of
the second Iseult, the unloved Breton wife, to whom none of our modern
poets who have sung or travestied the wild, passionate, miserable, ugly
story, have ever done full justice.These sinful lovers, the much-wronged but brutal King Mark, the
scarcely less brutal Uther Pendragon, and hapless Ygrayne--what a
curious condition of morals and manners the Arthurian legends unfold!A time when might was right; when every one seized what he wanted just
because he wanted it, and kept it, if he could, till a stronger hand
wrenched it from him.That in such a state of society there should
ever have arisen the dimmest dream of a man like Arthur--not perhaps
Tennyson's Arthur, the "blameless king," but even Sir Thomas Malory's,
founded on mere tradition--is a remarkable thing.Clear through all
the mists of ages shines that ideal of knighthood, enjoining courage,
honour, faith, chastity, the worship of God and the service of men.Also, in the very highest degree, inculcating that chivalrous love of
woman--not women--which barbaric nations never knew.As we looked at
that hoar ruin sitting solitary in the sunny sea, and thought of the
days when it was a complete fortress, inclosing a mass of human beings,
all with human joys, sorrows, passions, crimes--things that must have
existed in essence, however legend has exaggerated or altered them--we
could not but feel that the mere possibility of a King Arthur shining
down the dim vista of long-past centuries, is something to prove that
goodness, like light, has an existence as indestructible as Him from
whom it comes.We looked at Tintagel with its risky rock-path."It will be a hot
climb, and our bathing days are numbered.Let us go in the opposite
direction to Bossinney Cove."Practicality when weighed against Poetry is poor--Poetry always kicks
the beam.While waiting for
the tide to cover the little strip of sand, we re-mounted the winding
path, and settled ourselves like seabirds on the furthermost point of
rock, whence, just by extending a hand, we could have dropped anything,
ourselves even, into a sheer abyss of boiling waves, dizzy to look down
into, and yet delicious.So was the bath, though a little gloomy, for the sun could barely reach
the shut-in cove; and we were interfered with considerably by--not
tourists--but a line of donkeys!They were seen solemnly descending the
narrow cliff-path one by one--eleven in all--each with an empty sack
over his shoulder.Lastly came a very old man, who, without taking the
least notice of us, disposed himself to fill these sacks with sand.One after the other the eleven meek animals came forward and submitted
each to his load, which proceeding occupied a good hour and a half.I hardly know which was the most patient, the old man or his donkeys.[Illustration: CRESWICK'S MILL IN THE ROCKY VALLEY.]We began some of us to talk to his beasts, and others to himself."Yes,
it was hard work," he said, "but he managed to come down to the cove
three times a day.They all had their
names; Lucy, Cherry, Sammy, Tom, Jack, Ned;" each animal pricked up its
long ears and turned round its quiet eyes when called.Some were young
and some old, but all were very sure-footed, which was necessary here."The weight some of 'em would carry was wonderful."The old man seemed proud of the creatures, and kind to them too in a
sort of way.He had been a fisherman, he said, but now was too old for
that; so got his living by collecting sand."It makes capital garden-paths, this sand.I'd be glad to bring you
some, ladies," said he, evidently with an eye to business.When we
explained that this was impracticable, unless he would come all the way
to London, he merely said, "Oh," and accepted the disappointment.Then
bidding us a civil "Good day," he disappeared with his laden train.Nothing of the past knightly days, nothing of the
busy existing modern present affected him, or ever would do so.He
might have been own brother, or cousin, to Wordsworth's "Leech-gatherer
on the lonely moor."Whenever we think of Bossinney Cove, we shall
certainly think of that mild old man and his eleven donkeys.The day was hot, and it had been a steep climb; we decided to drive in
the afternoon, "for a rest," to Boscastle.Artists and tourists haunt this picturesque nook.A village built at
the end of a deep narrow creek, which runs far inland, and is a safe
shelter for vessels of considerable size.On either side is a high
footpath, leading to two headlands, from both of which the views of
sea and coast are very fine.And there are relics of antiquity and
legends thereto belonging--a green mound, all that remains of Bottrieux
Castle; and Ferrabury Church, with its silent tower.A peal of bells
had been brought, and the ship which carried them had nearly reached
the cove, when the pilot, bidding the captain "thank God for his safe
voyage," was answered that he "thanked only himself and a fair wind."Immediately a storm arose; and the ship went down with every soul on
board--except the pilot.So the church tower is mute--but on winter
nights the lost bells are still heard, sounding mournfully from the
depths of the sea.As we sat, watching with a vague fascination the spouting, minute by
minute, of a "blow-hole," almost as fine as the Kynance post-office--we
moralised on the story of the bells, and on the strange notions people
have, even in these days, of Divine punishments; imputing to the
Almighty Father all their own narrow jealousies and petty revenges,
dragging down God into the likeness of men, such an one as themselves,
instead of striving to lift man into the image of God.Meantime the young folks rambled and scrambled--watched with anxious
and even envious eyes--for it takes one years to get entirely
reconciled to the quiescence of the down-hill journey.And then we
drove slowly back--just in time for another grand sunset, with Tintagel
black in the foreground, until it and all else melted into darkness,
and there was nothing left but to

  "Watch the twilight stars come out
    Above the lonely sea."Next morning we must climb Tintagel, for it would be our last day.How softly the waves crept in upon the
beach--just as they might have done when they laid at Merlin's feet
"the little naked child," disowned of man but dear to Heaven, who was
to grow up into the "stainless king."He and his knights--the "shadowy people of the realm of dream,"--were
all about us, as, guided by a rheumatic old woman, who climbed feebly
up the stair, where generations of ghostly feet must have ascended and
descended, we reached a bastion and gateway, quite pre-historic.Other
ruins apparently belong to the eleventh or twelfth centuries.It may have been the very landing-place of King
Uther or King Mark, or other Cornish heroes, who held this wonderful
natural-artificial fortress in the dim days of old romance."Here are King Arthur's cups and saucers," said the old woman, pausing
in the midst of a long lament over her own ailments, to point out some
holes in the slate rock."And up there you'll find the chapel.It's an
easy climb--if you mind the path--just where it passes the spring."That spring, trickling down from the very top of the rock, and making
a verdant space all round it--what a treasure it must have been to the
unknown inhabitants who, centuries ago, entrenched themselves here--for
offence or defence--against the main-land.Peacefully it flowed on
still, with the little ferns growing, and the sheep nibbling beside
it.We idle tourists alone occupied that solitary height where those
long-past warlike races--one succeeding the other--lived and loved,
fought and died.The chapel--where the high altar and a little burial-ground beside it
can still be traced--is clearly much later than Arthur's time.However,
there are so few data to go upon, and the action of sea-storms destroys
so much every year, that even to the learned archaeologist, Tintagel is
a great mystery, out of which the imaginative mind may evolve almost
anything it likes.We sat a long time on the top of the rock--realising only the one
obvious fact that our eyes were gazing on precisely the same scene,
seawards and coastwards, that all these long-dead eyes were accustomed
to behold.Beaten by winds and waves till the grey of its slate
formation is nearly black; worn into holes by the constant action of
the tide which widens yearly the space between it and the main-land,
and gnaws the rock below into dangerous hollows that in time become
sea-caves, Tintagel still remains--and one marvels that so much of it
does still remain--a landmark of the cloudy time between legend and
actual history.Whether the ruin on the opposite height was once a portion of
Tintagel Castle, before the sea divided it, making a promontory into
an island--or whether it was the Castle Terrabil, in which Gorlois,
Ygrayne's husband, was slain--no one now can say.That both the twin
fortresses were habitable till Elizabeth's time, there is evidence to
prove.But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep
and the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in
whose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the
familiar scene.We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two
tame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about
in a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there.We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough
or a raven.So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and
scream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky
hollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the "iron
gate," over against Tintagel.We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel
we found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves
beyond Tintagel, which they declared were "the finest things they had
found in Cornwall."It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day.And, I think, the looser grows one's grasp of life, the greater is
one's longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this
wonderful, beautiful world.So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves
once more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas!not John
Curgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep.No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby
waves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat
went dancing up and down like a sea-gull!"Ay, there's some sea on, there always is here, but we'll be through it
presently," indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied
his oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all
the while.He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea,
unless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had
to be done.John moved to the kitchen.We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts
of the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click
of their hammers.Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in
summer.In winter--

"Oh, they're used to it; we're all used to it," said our man, who was
intelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven."Many a
time I've got sea-fowls' eggs on those rocks there," pointing to a
cliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly.The
gentry buy them, and we're glad of the money.Dangerous?--yes, rather;
but one must earn one's bread, and it's not so bad when you take to it
young."Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds'
eggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs."Here you are, ladies, and the sea's down a bit, as I said.Hold on,
mate, the boat will go right into the cave."And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out
of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking
on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow
that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them;
while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of
the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from
which no one could ever hope to come out alive."I don't like this at all," said a small voice."Hadn't we better get out again?"But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to
return; and begged for "only five minutes" in that wonderful place,
compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as
nothing.Yet with its
terror was mingled an awful delight."Give me but five, nay, two
minutes more!""Very well, just as you choose," was the response of meek despair.The boatmen were told to row on into
daylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic
overhanging cliffs permitted.And never, never, never in this world
shall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave.But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself
on my memory with an almost painful vividness.However, I promised not
to regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not.I did see
it, for just a glimpse; and that will serve.Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in
quiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building
dating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff,
and with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude
Haven on the other.Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild
September sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited
country which lie between Tintagel and Launceston.In the midst of
it, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round
and pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about
half-a-mile off."There, ladies, that's King Arthur's grave."The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.These varied
records of the hero's last resting-place remind one of the three heads,
said to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little
boy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man.But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur's
country is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it
alone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of
Tintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the
bright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea.Just the region, in
short, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian
legend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of
barbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes.An age in which the mere
idea of such a hero as that ideal knight

  "Who reverenced his conscience as his God:
  Whose glory was redressing human wrong:
  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it:
  Who loved one only, and who clave to her--"

rises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star.If Arthur could "come again"--perhaps in the person of one of the
descendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died
among us in this very nineteenth century--

  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--"

if this could be--what a blessing for Arthur's beloved England![Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.]L'ENVOI


Written more than a year after.The "old hen" and her chickens have

choking and blinding, as I finish the history of those fifteen innocent
days, calm as autumn, and bright as spring, when we three took our
Unsentimental Journey together through Cornwall.Many a clever critic,

  R. CLAY, SONS, AND TAYLOR,
  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C.For how doe we know that those thoughts which we have in our dreams,
are rather false then the others, seeing often they are no less lively
and significant, and let the ablest men study it as long as they please,
I beleeve they can give no sufficient reason to remove this doubt,
unless they presuppose the existence of God.For first of all, that
which I even now took for a rule, to wit, that those things which were
most clearly and distinctly conceived, are all true, is certain, only by
reason, that God is or exists, and that he is a perfect being, and that
all which we have comes from him.Whence it follows, that our Idea's or
notions, being reall things, and which come from God in all wherein they
are clear and distinct, cannot therein be but true.So that if we have
very often any which contain falshood, they cannot be but of such things
which are somewhat confus'd and obscure, because that therein they
signifie nothing to us, that's to say, that they are thus confus'd in us
only, because we are not wholly perfect.And it's evident that there is
no less contrariety that falshood and imperfection should proceed from
God, as such, then there is in this, that truth and falshood proceed
from nothing.But if we know not that whatsoever was true and reall in
us comes from a perfect and infinite being, how clear and distinct
soever our Idea's were, we should have no reason to assure us, that they
had the perfection to be true.Now after that the knowledge of God, and of the Soul hath rendred us
thus certain of this rule, it's easie to know; that the extravaganceys
which we imagin in our sleep, ought no way to make us doubt of the truth
of those thoughts which we have being awake: For if it should happen,
that even sleeping we should have a very distinct Idea; as for example,
A Geometritian should invent some new demonstration, his sleeping would
not hinder it to be true.And for the most ordinary error of our
dreames, which consists in that they represent unto us severall objects
in the same manner as our exterior senses doe, it matters not though it
give us occasion to mistrust the truth of those Ideas, because that they
may also often enough cozen us when we doe not sleep; As when to those
who have the Jaundies, all they see seems yellow; or, as the Stars or
other bodies at a distance, appear much less then they are.For in fine,
whether we sleep or wake, we ought never to suffer our selves to be
perswaded but by the evidence of our Reason; I say, (which is
observable) Of our Reason, and not of our imagination, or of our senses.As although we see the Sun most clearly, we are not therefore to judge
him to be of the bigness we see him of; and we may well distinctly
imagine the head of a Lion, set on the body of a Goat, but therefore we
ought not to conclude that there is a _Chimera_ in the world.For reason
doth not dictate to us, that what we see or imagine so, is true: But it
dictates, that all our Idea's or notions ought to have some grounds of
truth; For it were not possible, that God who is all perfect, and all
truth, should have put them in us without that: And because that our
reasonings are never so evident, nor so entire while we sleep, as when
we wake, although sometimes our imaginations be then as much or more
lively and express.It also dictates to us, that our thoughts, seeing
they cannot be all true by reason that we are not wholly perfect; what
they have of truth, ought infallibly to occur in those which we have
being awake, rather then in our dreams.V.


I should be glad to pursue this Discourse, and shew you the whole Series
of the following Truths, which I have drawn from the former: But because
for this purpose, it were now necessary for me to treat of severall
questions, which are controverted by the learned, with whom I have no
desire to imbroil my self, I beleeve it better for me to abstain from
it; and so in generall onely to discover what they are, that I may leave
the wisest to judge whether it were profitable to inform the publick
more particularly of them.I alwayes remained constant to my resolution,
to suppose no other Principle but that which I now made use of, for the
demonstration of the Existence of God, and of the Soul; and to receive
nothing for true, which did not seem to me more clear and more certain
then the demonstrations of Geometry had formerly done.And yet I dare
say, that I have not onely found out the means to satisfie my self, in a
short time, concerning all the principall difficulties which are usually
treated in Philosophy.But that also _I_ have observed certain Laws
which God hath so established in Nature, and of which he hath imprinted
such notions in our Souls, that when we shall have made sufficient
reflections upon them we cannot doubt but that they are exactly observed
in whatsoever either is, or is done in the World.Then considering the
connexion of these Laws, me thinks, I have discovercd divers Truths,
more usefull and important then whatever _I_ learn'd before, or ever
hop'd to learn.But because _I_ have endeavoured to lay open the principall of them in a
Treatise, which some considerations hinder me from publishing; _I_ can
no way better make them known, then by relating summarily what it
contains.I had a designe to comprehend all what I thought _I_ knew, before _I_
would write it, touching the nature of material things.But even as
Painters, not being able equally well to represent upon a _flat_ all the
severall facies of a solid body, chuse the principall of them, which
they place towards the light; and shadowing the others, make them appear
no more then they do to our sight: So, fearing lest _I_ should not bring
into this Discourse all which was in my thoughts, _I_ onely undertook to
set forth at large my conceptions touching the light; and upon that
occasion to add somewhat of the Sun, and of the fix'd Stars, by reason
that it proceeds almost all from thence; of the Heavens, because they
transmit it; of the Planets, of the Comets, and of the Earth, because
they cause it to reflect; and in particular, of all Bodies which are on
the earth, whether for that they are either coloured, or transparent, or
luminous; and last of all, of Man, because he is the Spectator thereof.As also, in some manner to shadow out all these things, and that _I_
might the more freely speak what _I_ judg'd, without being obliged to
follow, or to refute the opinions which are received amongst the
Learned, _I_ resolved to leave all this world here to their disputes,
and to speak onely of what would happen in a new one, if God now created
some where in those imaginary spaces matter enough to compose it, and
that he diversly and without order agitated the severall parts of this
matter, so as to compose a Chaos of it as confused as the Poets could
feign one: and that afterwards he did nothing but lend his ordinary
concurrence to Nature, and leave her to work according to the Laws he
hath established.Thus first of all _I_ described this Matter, and endevoured to
represent it such, that me thinks there is nothing in the world more
clear, or more intelligible, except what was beforesaid of God, and of
the Soul.For even _I_ expresly supposed that there was in it none of
those forms and qualities which are disputed in the Schools; nor
generally any thing but that the knowledge thereof was so naturall to
our understandings, that we could not even feigne to be ignorant of it.Besides, I made known what the Laws of Nature were; and without
grounding my reasons on any other principles, but on the infinite
perfections of God, I did endeavour to demonstrate all those which might
be questioned, and to make them appear to be such, that although God had
created divers worlds, there could have been none where they were not
observed.Afterwards _I_ shewed how the greater part of the Matter of
this _Chaos_ ought, according to those Laws, to dispose and order it
self in a certain manner, which would make it like our Heavens: And how
some of these parts were to compose an Earth, and some Planets and
Commets, some others a Sun and fix'd Starrs.And here enlarging my self
on the subject of Light, _I_ at length explain'd what that light was,
which was to be in the Sun and Stars; and thence how it travers'd in an
instant the immense spaces of the Heavens, and how it reflected it self
from Planets and Commets towards the Earth._I_ added also divers things
touching the substance, situation, the motions, and all the several
qualities of these heavens and these stars: So that _I_ thought _I_ had
said enough to make known, That there is nothing remarkable in those of
this world, which ought not, or at least could not appear altogether
like to these of that world which _I_ described.Thence _I_ came to speak particularly of the Earth; how, although I had
expresly supposed, that God had placed no weight in the Matter whereof
it was composed; yet all its parts exactly tended towards its center:
How that there being water and air upon its superficies, the disposition
of the Heavens, and of the Starrs, and chiefly of the Moon, ought to
cause a floud and an ebb, which in all circumstances was like to that
which we observe in our Seas; And besides, a certain course aswel of the
water, as of the air, from East to West, as is also observed between the
Tropicks: How the Mountains, the Seas, the Springs and Rivers might
naturally be form'd therein, and Metals run in the mines, and Plants
grow in the Fields, and generally all bodies be therein engendered which
are call'd mixt or composed.And amongst other things, because that next the Stars, I know nothing in
the world but Fire, which produceth light, I studied to make all clearly
understood which belongs to its nature; how it's made, how it's fed,
how sometimes it hath heat onely without light, and sometimes onely
light without heat; how it can introduce several colours into several
bodies, and divers other qualities; how it dissolves some, and hardens
others; how it can consume almost all, or convert them into ashes and
smoak: and last of all, how of those ashes, by the only violence of its
action, it forms glass.For this transmutation of ashes into glass,
seeming to me to be as admirable as any other operation in Nature, I
particularly took pleasure to describe it.Yet would I not inferre from all these things, that this World was
created after the manner I had proposed.For it is more probable that
God made it such as it was to be, from the beginning.But it's certain,
and 'tis an opinion commonly received amongst the Divines, That the
action whereby he now preserveth it, is the same with that by which he
created it.So that, although at the beginning he had given it no other
form but that of a Chaos (provided, that having established the Laws of
Nature, he had afforded his concurrence to it, to work as it used to do)
we may beleeve (without doing wrong to the miracle of the Creation) that
by that alone all things which are purely material might in time have
rendred themselves such as we now see them: and their nature is far
easier to conceive, when by little and little we see them brought forth
so, then when we consider them quite form'd all at once.From the description of inanimate Bodies and Plants, I pass'd to that of
Animals, and particularly to that of Men.But because I had not yet
knowledge enough to speak of them in the same stile as of the others; to
wit, in demonstrating effects by their causes, and shewing from what
seeds, and in what manner Nature ought to produce them; I contented my
self to suppose, That God form'd the body of a Man altogether like one
of ours; aswel the exteriour figure of its members, as in the interiour
conformity of its organs; without framing it of other matter then of
that which I had described; and without putting in it at the beginning
any reasonable soul, or any other thing to serve therein for a
vegetative or sensitive soul; unless he stirr'd up in his heart one of
those fires without light which I had already discovered; and that I
conceiv'd of no other nature but that which heats hay when its housed
before it be dry, or which causes new Wines to boyl when it works upon
the grape: For examining the functions which might be consequently in
this body, I exactly found all those which may be in us, without our
thinking of them; and to which our soul (that is to say, that distinct
part from our bodies, whose nature (as hath been said before) is onely
to think) consequently doth not contribute, and which are all the same
wherein we may say unreasonable creatures resemble us.Yet could I not
finde any, of those which depending from the thought, are the onely ones
which belong unto us as Men; whereas I found them all afterwards, having
supposed that God created a reasonable soul, and that he joyn'd it to
this body, after a certain manner which I describ'd.But that you might see how I treated this matter, I shall here present
you with the explication of the motion of the heart, and of the
arteries, which being the first and most general (which is observed in
animals) we may thereby easily judge what we ought to think of all the
rest.And that we may have the less difficulty to understand what I
shall say thereof, I wish those who are not versed in Anatomy, would
take the pains, before they read this, to cause the heart of some great
animal which hath lungs, to be dissected; for in all of them its very
like that of a Man: and that they may have shewn them the two cels or
concavities which are there: First that on the right side, whereto two
large conduits answer, to wit, the _vena cava_, which is the principal
receptacle of bloud, and as the body of a tree, whereof all the other
veins of the body are branches; and the arterious vein, which was so
mis-call'd, because that in effect its an artery, which taking its
_origine_ from the heart, divides it self after being come forth, into
divers branches, which every way spred themselves through the lungs.Then the other which is on the left side, whereunto in the same manner
two pipes answer, which are as large, or larger then the former; to wit,
the veinous artery, which was also il named, forasmuch as its nothing
else but a vein which comes from the lungs, where its divided into
several branches interlaid with those of the arterious vein, and those
of that pipe which is called the Whistle, by which the breath enters.And the great artery, which proceeding from the heart, disperseth its
branches thorow all the body.I would also that they would carefully
observe the eleven little skins, which, as so many little doors, open
and shut the four openings which are in these two concavities; to wit,
three at the entry of the _vena cava_, where they are so disposed, that
they can no wayes hinder the bloud which it contains from running into
the right concavity of the heart; and yet altogether hinder it from
coming out.Three at the entry of the arterious vein; which being
disposed quite contrary, permit only the bloud which is in that
concavity to pass to the lungs; but not that which is in the lungs to
return thither.And then two others at the entry of the veinous artery,
which permits the bloud to run to the left concavity of the heart, but
opposeth its return.And three at the entry of the great artery, which
permit it to go from the heart, but hinder its return thither.Neither
need we seek any other reason for the number of these skins, save only
that the opening of the veinous artery, being oval-wise, by reason of
its situation, may be fitly shut with two; whereas the other, being
round, may the better be clos'd with three.Besides, I would have them
consider, that the great artery and the arterious vein are of a
composition much stronger then the veinous artery or the _vena cava_.And that these two later grow larger before they enter into the heart,
and make (as it were) two purses, call'd the ears of the heart, which
are composed of a flesh like it; and that there is always more heat in
the heart then in any other part of the body.And in fine, that if any
drop of bloud enter into these concavities, this heat is able to make it
presently swell and dilate it self, as generally all liquors do, when
drop by drop we let them fall into a very hot vessel.For after this I need say no more for to unfold the motion of the
heart, but that when these concavities are not full of bloud,
necessarily there runs some from the _vena cava_ into the right, and
from the veinous artery into the left; for that these two vessels are
always full of it, and that their openings which are towards the heart
cannot then be shut: But that assoon as there is thus but two drops of
bloud entred, one in either of these concavities, these drops, which
cannot but be very big, by reason that their openings whereby they enter
are very large, and the vessels whence they come very full of bloud, are
rarified and dilated because of the heat which they find therein.By
means whereof, causing all the heart to swel, they drive and shut the
five little doors which are at the entry of the two vessels whence they
come, hindering thereby any more bloud to fall down into the heart, and
continuing more and more to rarifie themselves, they drive and open the
six other little doors which are at the entry of the other two vessels
whence they issue, causing by that means all the branches of the
arterious vein, and of the great artery, to swel (as it were) at the
same time with the heart: which presently after fals, as those arteries
also do, by reason that the bloud which is entred therein grows colder,
and their six little doors shut up again, and those five of the _vena
cava_, and of the veinous artery open again, and give way to two other
drops of bloud, which again swell the heart and the arteries in the same
manner as the preceding did.And because the bloud which thus enters
into the heart, passeth thorow those two purses, which are call'd the
ears; thence it comes, that their motion is contrary to the heart's, and
that they fall when that swels.Lastly, That they who know not the force of Mathematical demonstrations,
and are not accustomed to distinguish true reasons from probable ones,
may not venture to deny this without examining it, I shall advertise
them, that this motion which I have now discovered, as necessarily
follows from the onely disposition of the organs (which may plainly be
seen in the heart,) and from the heat (which we may feel with our
fingers,) and from the nature of the bloud (which we may know by
experience,) as the motions of a clock doth by the force, situation and
figure of its weight and wheels.But if it be asked, how it comes that the bloud of the veins is not
exhausted, running so continually into the heart; and how that the
arteries are not too full, since all that which passeth thorow the heart
dischargeth it self into them: I need answer nothing thereto but what
hath been already writ by an English Physician, to whom this praise must
be given, to have broken the ice in this place, and to be the first who
taught us, That there are several little passages in the extremity of
the arteries whereby the bloud which they receive from the heart,
enters the little branches of the veins; whence again it sends it self
back towards the heart: so that its course is no other thing but a
perpetuall circulation.Which he very wel proves by the ordinary
experience of Chirurgians, who having bound the arm indifferently hard
above the the place where they open the vein, which causeth the bloud to
issue more abundantly, then if it had not been bound.And the contrary
would happen, were it bound underneath, between the hand and the
incision, or bound very hard above.For its manifest, that the band
indifferently tyed, being able to hinder the bloud which is already in
the arm to return towards the heart by the veins; yet it therefore
hinders not the new from coming always by the arteries, by reason they
are placed under the veins, and that their skin being thicker, are less
easie to be press'd, as also that the bloud which comes from the heart,
seeks more forcibly to passe by them towards the hand, then it doth to
return from thence towards the heart by the veins.And since this bloud
which issues from the arm by the incision made in one of the veins, must
necessarily have some passage under the bond, to wit, towards the
extremities of the arm, whereby it may come thither by the arteries, he
also proves very well what he sayes of the course of the bloud through
certain little skins, which are so disposed in divers places along the
veins, which permit it not to pass from the middle towards the
extremities, but onely to return from the extremities towards the heart.And besides this, experience shews, That all the bloud which is in the
body may in a very little time run out by one onely artery's being cut,
although it were even bound very neer the heart, and cut betwixt it and
the ligature: So that we could have no reason to imagine that the bloud
which issued thence could come from any other part.But there are divers other things which witness, that the true cause of
this motion of the bloud is that which I have related.As first, The
difference observed between that which issues out of the veins, and that
which comes out of the arteries, cannot proceed but from its being
rarified and (as it were) distilled by passing thorow the heart: its
more subtil, more lively, and more hot presently after it comes out;
that is to say, being in the arteries, then it is a little before it
enters them, that is to say, in the veins.And if you observe, you will
finde, that this difference appears not well but about the heart; and
not so much in those places which are farther off.Next, the hardnesse
of the skin of which the artery vein and the great artery are composed,
sheweth sufficiently, that the bloud beats against them more forcibly
then against the veins.And why should the left concavity of the heart,
and the great artery be more large and ample then the right concavity,
and the arterious vein; unless it were that the bloud of the veinous
artery, having bin but onely in the lungs since its passage thorow the
heart, is more subtil, and is rarified with more force and ease then the
bloud which immediately comes from the _vena cava_.And what can the
Physicians divine by feeling of the pulse, unlesse they know, that
according as the bloud changeth its nature, it may by the heat of the
heart be rarified to be more or lesse strong, and more or lesse quick
then before.And if we examine how this heat is communicated to the
other members, must we not avow that 'tis by means of the bloud, which
passing the heart, reheats it self there, and thence disperseth it self
thorow the whole body: whence it happens, that if you take away the
bloud from any part, the heat by the same means also is taken a way.And
although the heart were as burning as hot iron, it were not sufficient
to warm the feet and the hands so often as it doth, did it not continue
to furnish them with new bloud.Besides, from thence we know also that the true use of respiration is to
bring fresh air enough to the lungs, to cause that bloud which comes
from the right concavity of the heart, where it was rarified, and (as it
were) chang'd into vapours, there to thicken, and convert it self into
bloud again, before it fall again into the left, without which it would
not be fit to serve for the nourishment of the fire which is there.Which is confirm'd, for that its seen, that animals which have no lungs
have but one onely concavity in the heart; and that children, who can
make no use of them when they are in their mothers bellies, have an
opening, by which the bloud of the _vena cava_ runs to the left
concavity of the heart, and a conduit by which it comes from the
arterious vein into the great artery without passing the lungs.Next, How would the concoction be made in the stomach, unlesse the heart
sent heat by the arteries, and therewithall some of the most fluid parts
of the bloud, which help to dissolve the meat receiv'd therein?and is
not the act which converts the juice of these meats into bloud easie to
be known, if we consider, that it is distill'd by passing and repassing
the heart, perhaps more then one or two hundred times a day?And what
need we ought else to explain the nutrition and the production of divers
humours which are in the body, but to say, that the force wherewith the
bloud in rarifying it self, passeth from the heart towards the
extremities or the arteries, causeth some of its parts to stay amongst
those of the members where they are, and there take the place of some
others, which they drive from thence?And that according to the
situation, or the figure, or the smalnesse of the pores which they
meet, some arrive sooner in one place then others.In the same manner
as we may have seen in severall sieves, which being diversly pierc'd,
serve to sever divers grains one from the other.And briefly, that which
is most remarkable herein, is the generation of the animal spirits,
which are as a most subtil wind, or rather, as a most pure and lively
flame, which continually rising in great abundance from the heart to the
brain, dischargeth it self thence by the nerves into the muscles, and
gives motion to all the members; without imagining any other reason
which might cause these parts of the bloud, which being most mov'd, and
the most penetrating, are the most fit to form these spirits, tend
rather towards the brain, then to any other part.Save onely that the
arteries which carry them thither, are those which come from the heart
in the most direct line of all: And that according to the rules of the
Mechanicks, which are the same with those of Nature, when divers things
together strive to move one way, where there is not room enough for all;
so those parts of bloud which issue from the left concavity of the heart
tend towards the brain, the weaker and less agitated are expell'd by the
stronger, who by that means arrive there alone.I had particularly enough expounded all these things in a Treatise which
I formerly had design'd to publish: In pursuit whereof, I had therein
shewed what ought to be the fabrick of the nerves and muscles of an
humane body, to cause those animall spirits which were in them, to have
the power to move those members.As we see that heads a while after they
are cut off, yet move of themselves, and bite the ground, although they
are not then animated.What changes ought to be made in the brain to
cause waking, sleeping, and dreaming: how light, sounds, smels, tasts,
heat, and all other qualities of exteriour objects, might imprint
severall _Ideas_ by means of the senses.How hunger and thirst, and the
other interiour passions might also send theirs thither.What ought to
be taken therein for common sense, where these _Ideas_ are received; for
memory which preserves them; and for fancy, which can diversly change
them, and form new ones of them; and by the same means, distributing the
animal spirits into the muscles, make the members of the body move in so
many severall fashions, and as fitly to those objects which present
themselves to its senses; and to the interiour passions which are in
them, as ours may move themselves without the consent of the Wil.Which
wil seem nothing strange to those, who knowing how many _Automatas_ or
moving Machines the industry of men can make, imploying but very few
pieces, in comparison of the great abundance of bones, muscles, nerves,
arteries, veins, and all the other parts which are in the body of every
Animal, will consider this body as a fabrick, which having been made by
the hands of God, is incomparably better ordered, and hath more
admirable motions in it then any of those which can be invented by men.And herein I particularly insisted, to make it appear, that if there
were such Machines which had organs, and the exteriour figure of an Ape,
or of any other unreasonable creature, we should finde no means of
knowing them not to be altogether of the same nature as those Animals:
whereas, if there were any which resembled our bodies, and imitated our
actions as much as morally it were possible, we should always have two
most certain ways to know, that for all that they were not reall men:
The first of which is, that they could never have the use of speech, nor
of other signes in framing it, as we have, to declare our thoughts to
others: for we may well conceive, that a Machine may be so made, that it
may utter words, and even some proper to the corporal actions, which
may cause some change in its organs; as if we touch it in some part, and
it should ask what we would say; or so as it might cry out that one
hurts it, and the like: but not that they can diversifie them to answer
sensibly to all what shall be spoken in its presence, as the dullest men
may do.And the second is, That although they did divers things aswel,
or perhaps better, then any of us, they must infallibly fail in some
others, whereby we might discover that they act not with knowledge, but
onely by the disposition of their organs: for whereas Reason is an
universal instrument which may serve in all kinde of encounters, these
organs have need of some particular disposition for every particular
action: whence it is, that its morally impossible for one Machine to
have severall organs enough to make it move in all the occurrences of
this life, in the same manner as our Reason makes us move.Now by these
two means we may also know the difference which is between Men and
Beasts: For 'tis a very remarkable thing, that there are no men so dull
and so stupid, without excepting those who are out of their wits, but
are capable to rank severall words together, and of them to compose a
Discourse, by which they make known their thoughts: and that on the
contrary, there is no other creature, how perfect or happily soever
brought forth, which can do the like.The which happens, not because
they want organs; for we know, that Pyes and Parrots can utter words
even as we can, and yet cannot speak like us; that is to say, with
evidence that they think what they say.Daniel went back to the bedroom.Whereas Men, being born deaf and
dumb, and deprived of those organs which seem to make others speak, as
much or more then beasts, usually invent of themselves to be understood
by those, who commonly being with them, have the leisure to learn their
expressions.And this not onely witnesseth, that Beasts have lesse
reason than men, but that they have none at all.For we see there needs
not much to learn to speak: and forasmuch as we observe inequality
amongst Beasts of the same kind, aswell as amongst men, and that some
are more easily managed then others; 'tis not to be believed, but that
an Ape or a Parrot which were the most perfect of its kinde, should
therein equall the most stupid child, or at least a child of a
distracted brain, if their souls were not of a nature wholly different
from ours.And we ought not to confound words with naturall motions,
which witness passions, and may be imitated by Machines aswell as by
Animals; nor think (as some of the Ancients) that beasts speak, although
we do not understand their language: for if it were true, since they
have divers organs which relate to ours, they could aswell make
themselves understood by us, as by their like.Its likewise very
remarkable that although there are divers creatures which express more
industry then we in some one of their actions; yet we may well perceive,
that the same shew none at all in many others: So that what they do
better then we, proves not at all that they have reason; for by that
reckoning they would have more then any of us, and would do better in
all other things; but rather, that they have none at all, and that its
Nature onely which works in them according to the disposition of their
organs.As wee see a Clock, which is onely composed of wheels and
springs, can reckon the hours, and measure the times more exactly then
we can with all our prudence.After this I had described the reasonable Soul, and made it appear, that
it could no way be drawn from the power of the Matter, as other things
whereof I had spoken; but that it ought to have been expresly created:
And how it suffiseth not for it to be lodg'd in our humane body as a
Pilot in his ship, to move its members onely; but also that its
necessary it be joyned and united more strongly therewith to have
thoughts and appetites like ours, and so make a reall man.I have here dilated my self a little on the subject of the Soul, by
reason 'tis of most importance; for, next the errour of those who deny
God, which I think I have already sufficiently confuted, there is none
which sooner estrangeth feeble minds from the right way of vertue, then
to imagine that the soul of beasts is of the same nature as ours, and
that consequently we have nothing to fear nor hope after this life, no
more then flies or ants.Whereas, when we know how different they are,
we comprehend much better the reasons which prove that ours is of a
nature wholly independing from the body, and consequently that it is not
subject to die with it.And that when we see no other cause which
destroys it, we are naturally thence moved to judge that it's immortall.Its now three years since I ended the Treatise which contains all these
things, and that I began to review it, to send it afterwards to the
Presse, when I understood, that persons to whom I submit, and whose
authority can no lesse command my actions, then my own Reason doth my
thoughts, had disapproved an opinion in Physicks, published a little
before by another; of which I will not say that I was, but that indeed I
had observed nothing therein, before their censure, which I could have
imagined prejudiciall either to Religion or the State; or consequently,
which might have hindred me from writing the same, had my Reason
perswaded mee thereto.And this made me fear, lest in the same manner
there might be found some one amongst mine, in which I might have been
mistaken; notwithstanding the great care I always had to admit no new
ones into my belief, of which I had not most certain demonstrations; and
not to write such as might turn to the disadvantage of any body.Which
was sufficient to oblige me to change my resolution of publishing them.For although the reasons for which I had first of all taken it, were
very strong; yet my inclination, which alwayes made me hate the trade of
Book-making, presently found me out others enough to excuse my self from
it.And these reasons on the one and other side are such, that I am not
only somewhat concern'd to speak them; but happily the Publick also to
know them.I never did much esteem those things which proceeded from mine own
brain; and so long as I have gathered no other fruits from the Method I
use, but onely that I have satisfied my self in some difficulties which
belong to speculative Sciences, or at least endeavoured to regulate my
Manners by the reasons it taught me, I thought my self not obliged to
write any thing of them.For, as for what concerns Manners, every one
abounds so much in his own sense, That we may finde as many Reformers as
heads, were it permitted to others, besides those whom God hath
established as Soveraigns over his people, or at least, to whom he hath
dispensed grace and zeal enough to be Prophets, to undertake the change
of any thing therein.And although my Speculations did very much please
me, I did beleeve that other men also had some, which perhaps pleas'd
them more.But as soon as I had acquired some generall notions touching
naturall Philosophy, and beginning to prove them in divers particular
difficulties, I observed how far they might lead a man, and how far
different they were from the principles which to this day are in use; I
judg'd, that I could not keep them hid without highly sinning against
the Law, which obligeth us to procure, as much as in us lies, the
general good of all men.For they made it appear to me, that it was
possible to attain to points of knowledge, which may be very profitable
for this life: and that in stead of this speculative Philosophy which is
taught in the Schools, we might finde out a practicall one, by which
knowing the force and workings of Fire, Water, Air, of the Starrs, of
the Heavens, and of all other Bodies which environ us, distinctly, as we
know the several trades of our Handicrafts, we might in the same manner
employ them to all uses to which they are fit, and so become masters and
possessours of Nature.Which is not onely to be desired for the
invention of very many expedients of Arts, which without trouble might
make us enjoy the fruits of the earth, and all the conveniences which
are to be found therein: But chiefly also for the preservation of
health, which (without doubt) is the first good, and the foundation of
all other good things in this life.For even the minde depends so much
on the temper and disposition of the organs of the body, that if it be
possible to finde any way of making men in the generall wiser, and more
able then formerly they were, I beleeve it ought to be sought in
Physick.True it is, that which is now in use contains but few things,
whose benefit is very remarkable: But (without any designe of slighting
of it) I assure my self, there is none, even of their own profession,
but will consent, that whatsoever is known therein, is almost nothing in
companion of what remains to be known.And that we might be freed from
very many diseases, aswell of the body as of the mind, and even also
perhaps from the weaknesses of old age, had we but knowledge enough of
their Causes, and of all the Remedies wherewith Nature hath furnished
us.Now having a designe to employ all my life in the enquiry of so
necessary a Science; and having found a way, the following of which me
thinks might infallibly lead us to it, unless we be hindred by the
shortness of life, or by defect of experiments.I judg'd that there was
no better Remedie against those two impediments, but faithfully to
communicate to the publique, all that little I should discover, and to
invite all good Wits to endevour to advance farther in contributing
every one, according to his inclination and power, to those Experiments
which are to be made, and communicating also to the publique all the
things they should learn; so that the last, beginning where the
precedent ended, and so joyning the lives and labors of many in one, we
might all together advance further then any particular Man could do.I also observ'd touching Experiments, that they are still so much the
more necessary, as we are more advanc'd in knowledg.For in the
beginning it's better to use those only which of themselves are
presented to our senses, and which we cannot be ignorant of, if we do
but make the least reflections upon them, then to seek out the rarest
and most studied ones.The reason whereof is, that those which are
rarest, doe often deceive, when we seldome know the same of the most
common ones, and that the circumstances on which they depend, are, as it
were, always so particular, and so small, that it's very uneasie to
finde them out.First, I
endevoured to finde in generall the Principles or first Causes of
whatsoever is or may be in the world, without considering any thing for
this end, but God alone who created it, or drawing them elsewhere, then
from certain seeds of Truth which naturally are in our souls.After
this, I examined what were the first and most ordinary Effects which
might be deduced from these Causes: And me thinks that thereby I found
out Heavens, Starrs, an Earth; and even on the Earth, Water, Air and
Fire, Minerals, and some other such like things, which are the most
common, and the most simple of all, and consequently the most easie to
be understood.Afterwards, when I would descend to those which were more
particular, there were so many severall ones presented themselves to me,
that I did beleeve it impossible for a humane understanding to
distinguish the forms and species of Bodies which are on the earth, from
an infinite number of others which might be there, had it been the will
of God so to place them: Nor by consequence to apply them to our use,
unless we set the Effects before the Causes, and make use of divers
particular experiments; In relation to which, revolving in my minde all
those objects which ever were presented to my senses, I dare boldly say,
I observed nothing which I could not fitly enough explain by the
principles I had found.But I must also confesse that the power of
Nature is so ample and vast, and these principles are so simple and
generall, that I can observe almost no particular Effect, but that I
presently know it might be deduced from thence in many severall ways:
and that commonly my greatest difficulty is to finde in which of these
ways it depends thereon; for I know no other expedient for that, but
again to seek some experiments, which may be such, that their event may
not be the same, if it be in one of those ways which is to be exprest,
as if it were in another.In fine, I am gotten so far, That (me thinks)
I see well enough what course we ought to hold to make the most part of
those experiments which may tend to this effect.But I also see they
are such, and of so great a number, that neither my hands nor my estate
(though I had a thousand times more then I have) could ever suffice for
all.So that according as I shall hereafter have conveniency to make
more or fewer of them, I shall also advance more or lesse in the
knowledge of Nature, which I hop'd I should make known by the Treatise
which I had written; and therein so clearly shew the benefit which the
Publick may receive thereby, that I should oblige all those in general
who desire the good of Mankinde; that is to say, all those who are
indeed vertuous, (and not so seemingly, or by opinion only) aswell to
communicate such experiments as they have already made, as to help me in
the enquiry of those which are to be made.But since that time, other reasons have made me alter my opinion, and
think that I truly ought to continue to write of all those things which
I judg'd of any importance, according as I should discover the truth of
them, and take the same care, as if I were to print them; as well that I
might have so much the more occasion throughly to examine them; as
without doubt, we always look more narrowly to what we offer to the
publick view, then to what we compose onely for our own use: and
oftentimes the same things which seemed true to me when I first
conceived them, appear'd afterwards false to me, when I was committing
them to paper: as also that I might lose no occasion of benefiting the
Publick, if I were able, and that if my Writings were of any value,
those to whose hands they should come after my death, might to make what
use of them they think fit.But that I ought not any wayes to consent that they should be published
during my life; That neither the opposition and controversies, whereto
perhaps they might be obnoxious, nor even the reputation whatsoever it
were, which they might acquire me, might give me any occasion of
mispending the time I had design'd to employ for my instruction; for
although it be true that every Man is oblig'd to procure, as much as in
him lies, the good of others; and that to be profitable to no body, is
properly to be good for nothing: Yet it's as true, that our care ought
to reach beyond the present time; and that it were good to omit those
things which might perhaps conduce to the benefit of those who are
alive, when our designe is, to doe others which shall prove farr more
advantagious to our posterity; As indeed I desire it may be known that
the little I have learnt hitherto, is almost nothing in comparison of
what I am ignorant of; and I doe not despair to be able to learn: For
it's even the same with those, who by little and little discover the
truth in Learning; as with those who beginning to grow rich, are less
troubled to make great purchases, then they were before when they were
poorer, to make little ones.Or else one may compare them to Generals of
Armies, whose Forces usually encrease porportionably to their Victories;
and who have need of more conduct to maintain themselves after the loss
of a battail, then after the gaining one, to take Towns and Provinces.For to endeavour to overcome all the difficulties and errours which
hinder us to come to the knowledg of the Truth, is truly to fight
battails.And to receive any false opinion touching a generall or
weighty matter, is as much as to lose one; there is far more dexterity
