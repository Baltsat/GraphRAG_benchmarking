Her doctor came to see her, and said, “Well, madam, I could not have
 believed it.” It is better they should err in that direction than in
 the direction of calling real illness “hysteria.”

 ‘I mean to have a hospital of my own in Edinburgh some day.‘A patient with a well-balanced nervous system will get well in just
 half the time that one of these hysterical women will.There is one
 plucky little woman in just now.She has had a bad operation, but
 nothing has ever disturbed her equilibrium.She smiles away in the
 pluckiest way, and gets well more quickly than anybody.I agree with
 Kingsley: one of the necessities of the world is to teach girls to be
 brave, and not whine over everything, and the first step for that is
 to teach them to play games!‘Fancy who has been here this evening--Bailie Walcot.He has come
 up to London on Parliamentary business.He investigated every hole
 and corner of the hospital.Littlejohn’s class with Jex’s girls at Surgery Hall.It is wonderful
 how these men who would do nothing at first are beginning to see it
 pays to be neutral now.‘We have a lot to be grateful to J. B. for; Bailie W. told me the
 Leith managers have approached the Edinburgh managers, saying, “If
 you will undertake no more women students, we will undertake to take
 both schools, and to build immediately.” Bailie Walcot said he and Mr.George’s were the _only_ two who opposed this.If they
 send us down to Leith we must make the best of it, and really try to
 make it a good school, but it will be a great pity.G. Anderson is a capital chaperone.I managed to go off without my ticket, and the damsel at the door was
 very severe, and said I must wait till Mrs.I
 waited quietly a minute or two, and was just going to ask her to send
 in to see if Mrs.Anderson had come, then a man marched in, and said
 in a lovely manner, “I have forgotten my ticket,” and she merely said,
 “You must give me your name, sir,” and let him pass.After that I gave
 my name and passed too!I found I might have waited till doomsday, for
 Mrs.I danced every dance; it was a lovely floor and
 lovely music, and you may make up your mind, papa dear, that I go to
 all the balls in Edinburgh after this.They had two odd dances called
 Barn-door.I thought it would be a kind of Sir Roger, but it was the
 oddest kind of hop, skip and dance I ever saw.G. A. it
 was something like a Schottische, only not a quarter so pretty.She
 said it was pretty when nicely danced, but people have not learnt it
 yet.G. A. that I could get some tea from the
 night nurse when I got home (because I wanted to dance the extras),
 but she was horrified at tea just before going to sleep, and swept me
 into the refreshment-room and made me drink soup by the gallon.We had an operation this morning, so you see
 dances don’t interfere with the serious business of life.Scharlieb came in here the other day, and declared I was
 qualifying for acute bronchitis; but I told her nobody could have
 acute bronchitis who had a cold bath every morning, and had been
 brought up to open windows.This is the third sit down to your letter.Talk of women at home never being able to do anything without being
 interrupted every few minutes!I think you have only to be house
 surgeon to know what being interrupted means.They not only knock
 and march in at the door, but they also whistle up the tube--most
 frightfully startling it used to be at first, to hear a sort of shrill
 fog-horn in the room.There are three high temperatures, and the
 results are sent up to me whenever they are taken.We are sponging
 them, and may have to put them into cold baths, but I hope not.G. A. told me to do it without waiting for the chief, if I thought it
 necessary, whereupon Mrs.B. remarked, “I think Miss Inglis ought to
 be warned the patient may die.”

 ‘Lovely weather here.I have been prescribing sunshine, sunshine,
 sunshine for all the patients.There are only two balconies on each
 floor, and nurse Rose is reported to have said that she supposed I
 wanted the patients hung out over the railings, for otherwise there
 would not be room.Miss W. came this morning, to Sister’s indignation.“Does not she think she can trust me for one day?” So I said it was
 only that she was so delighted at having a ward; and that I was sure
 I would do the same.“Oh,” said Sister, “I am thankful you have not a
 ward.You would bring a box with sandwiches and sit there all day.”
 I am always having former H.S.’s thrown at my head who came round
 exactly to the minute, twice a day, whereas they say I am never out
 of the wards, at least they never know when I am coming.I tell them
 I don’t want them to trot round after me with an ink-bottle.Miss R.
 says I have no idea of discipline!I make one grand round a day, with
 the ink-bottle, and then I don’t want the nurses to take any more
 notice of me.I think that is far more sensible than having fixed
 times.I quite agree the ink-bottle round ought to be at a fixed time,
 but I cannot help other things turning up to be done.‘I had to toddle off and ask for Mrs.K. She is the one who is
 appointed to give anæsthetics in the hospital.They are all most
 frightfully nervous about anæsthetics here, in all the hospitals,
 and have regular anæsthetists.In Edinburgh and Glasgow the students
 give it, under the house surgeons of course.I never saw any death,
 or anything that was very frightening.One real reason is, I believe,
 that they watch the wrong organ, viz.In Scotland they
 hardly think of the heart, and simply watch the breathing.The
 Hydrabad Commission settled conclusively that it was the breathing
 gave out first; but having made up their minds that it does not, all
 the Commissions in the world won’t convince them to the contrary.In the meantime they do their operations in fear and trembling,
 continually asking if the patient is all right.‘You never saw such a splendid out-patient department as they have
 here--a perfectly lovely, comfortable waiting-room, and pretty
 receiving waiting-room.The patients have to pay a small sum, yet they
 had over 20,000 visits this year up to November--that is about half
 the size of the Glasgow Royal, one of the biggest out-patients in the
 kingdom, and general.‘This morning I started off, meaning to go to Dr.Sister C. told me I ought to be early, and of course
 I was as late as I could be.As I was running downstairs Nurse Helen
 asked me if I had ever heard Stopford Brooke.I had heard his name,
 but I could not remember anything about him.Nurse H. said he was an
 awful heretic, and had got into trouble for his opinions.As a general
 rule men who get into trouble for their opinions are worth listening
 to--at least they _have_ opinions.Vaughan, and went off
 to Mr.He gave a capital sermon with nothing heterodox in
 it, about loving our fellow-men.I liked him, and would go to-night to
 hear his lecture on “In Memoriam,” but Sister C. is going out.‘You know you must not aim at a separate but at a mixed school in
 Edinburgh.I am sure this is best, and all the women here think so
 too.G. Anderson asked me to come and help her with a small operation
 in an hotel.She gave me a half-guinea fee for so doing.We drove
 there in a hansom, and drove back in her carriage.She was most jovial
 and talkative.We went into the Deanery, Westminster Abbey, on our way
 back to leave cards on somebody.You suddenly seem to get out of the
 noise and rush of London when you turn in there.All sorts of men were wandering about in red gowns and black
 gowns.Scharlieb was awfully nice and kind.She said she hoped I would
 get on always as well as I had here.I said I
 hoped I would do much better, for I thought I had made an awful lot of
 mistakes since I came here.The worst of being a doctor is that one’s mistakes matter so much.In
 everything else you just throw away what you have messed and begin
 again, but you cannot do that as a doctor.‘She said she expects to be called in as my consultant when I am a
 surgeon.Won’t my patients have to pay fees to get her up from London!‘Miss C. has been trying to get on to some of the medical societies,
 and has failed.I shall not demean myself by asking to get on--shall
 wait till they beseech the honour of adding my name.‘As to women doctors here having an assured position, I rather like
 the pioneer work, I think!I mean to make friends with all the nice
 doctors, and vanquish all the horrid selfish ones, and end by being a
 Missionary Professor.‘If I don’t get into the Infirmary in Edinburgh, I mean to build a
 hospital for myself, like this one.Indeed I don’t know that I should
 not like the hospital to myself better!I’ll build it where the Cattle
 Market is, at the head of Lady Lawson Street.That would be convenient
 for all the women in Fountainbridge, and the Grassmarket and Cowgate,
 and it would be comparatively high.To begin with, I mean to rent
 Eva’s hall from her for a dispensary.You see it is all arranged!’

The next course Elsie decided on taking was one of three months in
Midwifery in the Rotunda, Dublin.There was a greater equality of
teaching there in mixed classes, and also she thought the position of
the whole hospital staff was on lines which would enable her to gain
the most experience in this branch, where she ultimately achieved so
much for her fellow-citizens in Edinburgh.‘COSTIGAN’S HOTEL, UPPER SACKVILLE ST.,
      ‘DUBLIN, _Nov.‘I went over to the Rotunda and saw Dr.I am “clerk” on Mondays and Thursdays.The only other person here is
 a native from the Nizam’s Dominions.At breakfast this morning he
 told me about his children, who are quite fair “like their mother.”
 How fond he was of London, and how he would not live in India now for
 anything; he finds the climate enervating!I told him I thought India
 a first-rate place to live in, and that I should like to go back.‘By the way, fancy the franchise for the Parish Councils being
 carried.The first thing I saw when I landed was defeat of the
 Government!The _Independent_ here is jubilant, partly because the
 point of woman’s suffrage is carried, partly because the Government is
 beaten.‘So the strike has ended, and the men go back to work on their old
 wages till February.I expect both sides are sick of it, but I am glad
 the men have carried it so far.C. evidently thinks I am quite mad, for I have asked for a cold
 bath in my room.it’s not cold entoirely
 ye’ll be meaning.”

 ‘I went to see the D.’s.The first thing I was told was that a
 Miss D. sat in their church, an M.B.A very
 clever girl, she has just taken a travelling bursary and is going to
 Vienna.“But we don’t know her, they are Home Rulers!” Mrs.D. went
 on to say both she and her father were Home Rulers, but that she for
 one would not mind if they did not obtrude their politics.So, I
 thought, “Well, I won’t obtrude mine.” Then Mrs.D. said, “You must
 take a side, you know, and say distinctly what side you are on when
 you are asked.” So I thought, “Well, I’ll wait till I am asked,” and
 I have got through to-day without being asked.But, positively, they
 used the word “boycott” about those D.’s.They have been boycotted
 by the congregation.It must be rather hard to be a Home Ruler and
 a Presbyterian just now in Ireland.Positively, they frightened me
 so, I nearly squirmed under the table.However, when I looked round
 the congregation I thought I should not mind much being boycotted by
 them.D. has
 given me a standing invitation to come to dinner on Sunday.What will
 happen when I am suddenly asked to take my side, I don’t know.In the
 meantime I will let things slide!D. asked me if the Costigans
 were Catholics, and said she thought Mrs.C. looked so nice she could
 not be one.’

      ‘_Dec.1893._

 ‘I have done nothing but race after cases to-day.B., whom she said she had known before he
 was born.B. could not go, so I went.“Hech,” she said, “I came
 for a _doctor_.” “Well, I’m the doctor.Come along.” “Deed no,” she
 said; “ye’re no a doctor--ye’re just a wumman.” I did laugh, and
 marched her off.She was grandly tipsy when I left the home, so I am
 going back to see how the patient has got on, in spite of the nursing.‘I had a second polite speech made to me last night.I was introduced
 into a house by the person who came for me as the doctor.When I
 had been in about two minutes, a small man of four years old, said
 suddenly in a clear voice “That is _not_ a doctor, it’s a girl!” I
 told him he was behind the age not to know that one could be both.‘We had a chloroform scare this morning.S.’s coolness
 immensely.He finished tying his stitches quietly while two doctors
 were skipping round like a pair of frightened girls.They don’t know how to give chloroform anywhere out of
 Scotland.D. declared she was going to write to you that she had found
 I had gone out without my breakfast.I was
 out last night, and was not up when they rang over for me.So, before
 having my breakfast I just ran over to see what they wanted me for,
 and finding it would keep I came back for my breakfast to find Mrs.I am not such an idiot as to miss my meals, Papa, dearest.I always have a glass of milk and a biscuit
 when I go out at night.I know you
 cannot do work with blunt instruments, and this instrument blunts very
 easily without food and exercise.1, 1894._

 ‘I have been round all my patients to-day, and had to drink glasses
 of very questionable wine in each house.It is really very trying to
 a practical teetotaller like me.Literally, I could hardly see them
 when I left the last house!There was simply no getting off it, and I
 did not want to hurt their feelings.When they catch hold of your hand
 and say “Now, doctor dear, or doctor jewel, ye’ll just be takin’ a wee
 glass, deed an ye will,” what are you to do?‘Do you think this “Famasha” with the French in Africa is going to
 be the beginning of the big war?But, it would be the English-speaking
 peoples, Australia, the States, and Canada.‘I have made a convert to the ranks of women’s rights.B. and I had had an awful argument.I never mentioned
 the subject again, for it is no good arguing with a man who has made
 up his mind (and is a North of Ireland man, who will die in the last
 ditch into the bargain).However, in the middle of the operation, he
 suddenly said, “By the way, you are right about the suffrage, Miss
 Inglis.” Then I found he had come over about the whole question.As
 a convert is always the most violent supporter, I hope he’ll do some
 good.5, 1894._

 ‘After three months you have learnt all the Rotunda can teach.If you
 were a man, it would be worth while to stay, because senior students,
 if they are men, get a lot of the C.C.’s work to do.But they never
 think of letting you do it if you are a woman.It is not deliberate
 unfairness, but they never think of it.If one stays six months they
 examine one, and give a degree, L.M., Licentiate of Midwifery.If I
 could I would rather spend three months in Paris with Pozzi.I have
 learnt a tremendous lot here, and feel very happy about my work in
 this special line.If you can
 really afford to give me another three months it would be wiser to go
 to Paris.There are three men who are quite in the front rank there,
 Pozzi, Apostoli, and Péon.’

      ‘COSTIGAN’S, UPPER SACKVILLE STREET,
      ‘DUBLIN, _Feb.10, 1894._

 ‘I got your letter at eleven when I came down to breakfast.I shall
 never get into regular order for home again.No one blames one for
 lying in bed here or being late, for no one knows how late you have
 been up the night before, or how many cases you have been at before
 you get to the lecture.It is partly that, and partly their casual
 Irish ways.I have had a letter from Miss MacGregor this morning,
 asking what I should say to our starting together in Edinburgh.It is quite true, as she says,
 that two women are much more comfortable working together.They can
 give chloroform for one another and so on, and consult together.On
 the other hand, we could do that just as well if we simply started
 separately, and were friends.‘Miss MacGregor was one of the J.-B.lot, and she and I had awful
 rows over that question.But we certainly got on very well before
 that, and, as she says, that was not a personal question.I am quite
 sure Miss MacGregor is Scotch enough not to propose any arrangement
 which won’t be to her own advantage.Probably, I know a good many more
 people than she does.The question for me is whether it will be for my
 advantage.Miss MacGregor is
 a splendid pathologist.Nowadays one ought to do a lot of that work
 with one’s cases, and I have been puzzling over how one could, and yet
 keep aseptic.If we could make some arrangement by which we could work
 into one another’s hands in that way, I think it would be for both our
 advantages.There is one thing in favour of it, if Miss MacGregor and
 I are definitely working together, no one can be astonished at our not
 calling in other people.Miss MacGregor, apart from everything else,
 is distinctly one of our best women, and it would be nice working with
 her.What do you think of it, Papa, dear?Of course I should live at
 home in any case.My consulting rooms anyhow would have to be outside,
 for the old ladies would not climb up the stair!‘DUBLIN, _Feb.‘I do thank you so much for having let me come here.But it was
 awfully good of you to let me come.I am sure it will make a
 difference all my life.I really feel on my feet in this subject now.The more I think of it, the more I think it would be wise to start
 with Miss MacGregor.we will
 start the dispensary, and we’ll end by having a hospital like the
 Rotunda, where students shall live on the premises--female students
 only.Not that these boys are not very nice and good-natured, only
 they are out of place in the Rotunda.’

This was nearly the last letter written by Elsie to her father.In most
of her letters during the preceding months it was obvious Mr.Inglis’
health was causing her anxiety, and the inquiries and suggestions
for his well-being grew more urgent as the shadow of death fell
increasingly dark on the written pages.Elsie returned to receive his eager welcome, but even her eyes were
blinded to the rapidly approaching parting.On the 15th of March 1894,
she wrote to her brother Ernest in India, telling all the story of Mr.Inglis’ passing on the 13th of that month.There was much suffering
borne with quiet patience, ‘He never once complained: I never saw such
a patient.’ At the end, he turned towards the window, and then a bright
look came into his eyes.He said, ‘Pull down the blind.’ Then the
chivalrous, knightly soul passed into the light that never was on sea
or land.‘It was a splendid life he led,’ writes Elsie to her brother; ‘his old
 Indian friends write now and say how “the name of John Inglis always
 represented everything that was upright and straightforward and high
 principled in the character of a Christian gentleman.” He always said
 that he did not believe that death was the stopping place, but that
 one would go on growing and learning through all eternity.We had made such plans, and now it does not seem worth while to go on
 working at all.I said it would be such a joke to see Dr.Saturday afternoons were to be his, and he was to come over
 in my trap.‘He never thought of himself at all.Even when he was very ill at
 the end, he always looked up when one went in, and said, “Well, my
 darling.” I am glad I knew about nursing, for we did not need to have
 any stranger about him.He would have hated that.’




CHAPTER VI

POLITICAL ENFRANCHISEMENT AND NATIONAL POLITICS

    ‘Well done, New Zealand!I expect I shall live to have a vote.’--E.
    M. I., 1891.‘I envy not in any mood
      The captive void of noble rage,
      The linnet born within the cage,
    That never knew the summer woods.’

    ‘So the vote has come!Fancy its having taken the
    war to show them how ready we were to work!Or even to show that
    that work was necessary.Where do they think the world would have
    been without women’s work all these ages?’--E. M. I., Reni, Russia,
    June 1917.David Inglis, writing to his son on his marriage in 1845, says:--

 ‘I cannot express the deep interest, or the ardent hopes with which
 my bosom is filled on the occasion, or the earnest though humble
 prayer to the Giver of all good which it has uttered that He may shed
 abundantly upon you _both_ the rich mercies of His grace: with those
 feelings I take each of you to my heart, and give you my parental
 love and blessing.You have told me enough of the object of your fond
 choice to make her henceforth dear to me, to all of us, on her own
 account, as well as yours.‘And here, my beloved David, I would turn for a moment more
 immediately to yourself, as being now in a situation very different
 from that in which you have hitherto been placed.As a husband, then,
 it will now behove you to remember that you are not your own exclusive
 property--that for a single moment you must never forget; the tender
 love and affectionate respect and consideration which are due from you
 to the amiable individual who has bestowed on you her hand and heart,
 it will, I assure myself, be your pleasing duty to prove, by unceasing
 attention to, and solicitude for, her every wish how dearly you
 appreciate her worth, as well as _gift_; and that her future comfort
 and happiness will invariably possess an estimation in your view
 paramount to every feeling that can more immediately or personally
 affect yourself.Let such be manifest in your every act, as connected
 with every object in which _she_ is concerned.Her love and affection
 for you will then be reciprocal and pure and lasting, and thus will
 you become to each other what, under God’s blessing, you are meant to
 be--a mutual comfort and an abiding stay.Make her the confidential
 friend of your bosom, to whom its every thought must unreservedly
 be imparted--the soother of all its cares, its anxieties, and
 disappointments, when they chance to arise; the fond participator in
 all your happiness and joys, from whatever source they may spring--you
 will thus be discharging a duty which your sacred obligations at the
 altar have entailed upon you.’

This letter has been quoted with its phrasing of seventy years ago,
because it shows an advanced outlook on the position of husband and
wife, and the setting forth of their equality and the respect paid to
their several positions.Inglis’ views, both
in his perfect relations with his wife and the sympathetic liberty of
thought and action which he encouraged in his own family.This chapter is devoted to the political and public life of Elsie
Inglis.The ‘common cause’
to which she gave so much of her life has now been won.The tumult
and the turmoil are now hushed in peace and security.The age which
began in John Stuart Mill’s ‘Subjection of Women’ has ended in the
Representation of the People’s Bill.It is possible to review the
political period of the generation which produced Elsie Inglis, and her
comrades in the struggle against the disqualification of sex, without
raising any fresh controversy.Inglis was one of the finest types of
women produced by the ideals and inspiring purposes of the generation
to which she belonged.She was born when a woman was the reigning
Sovereign, and when her influence and power were at its height.Four years after her birth the Reform Bill of 1868 was to make the
first claim for women as citizens in the British Parliament.The
Married Woman’s Property Act, and the laws affecting Divorce, had
recognised them as something else than the goods and chattels or
the playthings and bondwomen of the ‘predominant partner.’ Mary
Somerville had convinced the world that a woman could have a brain.Timidly, and yet resolutely, women were claiming a higher education,
and Universities were slamming to their doors, with a petty horde
of maxims claimed to be based on divine authority.Women pioneers
mounted platforms and asserted ‘Rights,’ and qualified for jealously
closed professions--always, from the first, upheld and companied by
‘Greathearts,’ men few but chosen, who, like John Inglis, recognised
that no community was the stronger for keeping its people, be they
black or white, male or female, in any form of ignorance or bonded
serfdom.As Elsie grew up, she found herself walking in the new age.Doors
were set ajar, if not fully opened.The first wave of ridicule and of
conscientious objections had spent its force.A girl’s school might
play games decorously and not lose all genteel deportment.Girls might
show a love of knowledge, and no longer be hooted as blue-stockings.The use of the globes and cross-stitch gave place to learning which
might fit them to be educated, and useful members of the community.Ill-health ceased to be considered part of the curse of Eve, to
be borne with swooning resignation on the wide sofas of the early
Victorian Age.Ignorance and innocence were not recognised as twin
sisters, and women, having eaten of the tree of knowledge, looked round
a world which prided itself on giving equal justice to all men, and
discovered that very often that axiom covered a multitude of sins of
injustice against all womankind.It was through Elsie’s professional life that she learnt to know how
often the law was against the woman’s best interests, and it was always
in connection with some reform that she longed to initiate, that she
expressed a desire for the Vote._To her Father_

      ‘GLASGOW, 1891.‘Many thanks for your letter about women’s rights.You are ahead of
 all the world in everything, and they gradually come up into line with
 you--the Westminster Confession and everything except Home Rule!The
 amusing thing about women preaching is that they do it, but as it is
 not in the churches it is not supposed to be in opposition to Paul.They are having lots of meetings in the hall downstairs; every single
 one of them is addressed by a woman.But, of course, they could not
 give the same address in a church and with men listening!At Queen
 Margaret’s here, they are having a course of lectures on the Old
 Testament from the lecturer on that subject in the University, but
 then, of course it is not “Divinity.”’

The opponents to Woman’s Franchise admittedly occupied an illogical
position, and Elsie’s abounding sense of humour never failed to make
use of all the opportunities of laughter which the many absurdities of
the long fight evoked.No one with that sense as highly developed could
ever turn cynical or bitter.It was only when cruelty and injustice
came under her ken that a fine scorn dominated her thought and speech.She gives to her father some of these instances:--

 ‘I got a paper to sign to thank the M.P.’s who voted for Sir A.
 Rollitt’s Woman’s Suffrage Bill.I got it filled up in half a minute.There is no question among women
 who have to work for themselves about wanting the suffrage.It is the
 women who are safe and sound in their own drawing-rooms who don’t see
 what on earth they want it for.A.
 took down her case, and thought she would have to have an operation.Then her husband arrived, and calmly said she was to go home, because
 he could not look after the children.So I said that if she went she
 went on her own responsibility, for I would not give my consent.I said, “Well, take it to a hospital.” Then it
 turned out it was not ill, but had cried last night.I said I saw very
 well what it was, that he had had a bad night, and had just determined
 that his wife should have the bad night to-night, even though she was
 ill, instead of him.He did look ashamed of himself, selfish cad!Helpless creature, he could not even arrange for some one to come in
 and take charge of those children unless his wife went home to do it.She had got some one yesterday, but he had had a row with her.I gave
 him my mind pretty clearly, but I went in just now to find she had
 gone.So one woman said, “It was not ’er fault,
 Miss; ’e would have it.”

 ‘I wonder when married women will learn they have any other duty
 in the world than to obey their husbands.They were not even her
 children--they were step-children.You don’t know what trouble we
 have here with the husbands.They will come in the day before the
 operation, after the woman has been screwed up to it, and worry them
 with all sorts of outside things, and want them home when they are
 half dying.Any idea that anybody is to be thought of but themselves
 never enters their lordly minds, and the worst of it is these stupid
 idiots of women don’t seem to think so either: “’E wants it, Miss,”
 settles the question.I always say--“It does not matter one fig what
 he wants.The question is what you want.” They don’t seem to think
 they have any right to any individual existence.Well, I feel better
 now, but I wish I could have scragged that beast.I have to go to the
 wards now!‘We had another row with a tyrannical husband.I did not know whether
 to be most angry with him or his fool of a wife.She had one of the
 most painful things anybody can have, an abscess in her breast.It was
 so bad Miss Webb would not do anything for it in the out-patients’,
 but said she was to come in at once.The woman said she would go and
 arrange for somebody to look after her baby and come back at six.“_I_ cannot let my wife come in,
 as the baby is not old enough to be left with anybody else.” Did you
 ever hear anything so monstrous?That one human being is to settle
 for another human being whether she is to be cured or not.I asked
 him whether he knew how painful it was, and if he had to bear the
 pain.Miss Webb appealed to him, that he _was_ responsible for his
 wife’s health, for he seemed to assume he was not.Both grounds were
 far above his intellect, either his responsibility or his wife’s
 rights.He just stood there like an obstinate mule.We told him it
 was positively brutal, and that he was to go _at once_ and get a good
 doctor home with him if he would not let her in.‘What a fool the woman must have been to have educated him up to that.There really was no necessity for her to stay out because he said she
 was to--poor thing.Miss Webb and I have struck up a great friendship
 as the result.After we had both fumed about for some time, I said,
 “Well, the only way to educate that kind of man, or that kind of
 woman, is to get the franchise.” Miss Webb said, “Bravo, bravo,” then
 I found she was a great franchise woman, and has been having terrible
 difficulties with her L.W.A.here.’

The writer may add one more to these instances.Suffrage meetings
were of a necessity much alike, and the round of argument was much
the same.Spade-work had to be done among men and women who had the
mental outlook of these patients and the overlords of their destiny.Meetings were rarely enthusiastic or crowded, and it was often like
speaking into the heart of a pincushion.Inglis came by train straight from her practice.In memory’s halls all
meetings are alike, but one stands out, where Dr.Inglis illustrated
her argument by a fact in her day’s experience.The law does not permit
an operation on a married woman without her husband’s consent.That day
the consent had been refused, and the woman was to be left to lingering
suffering from which only death could release her.The voice and the
thrill which pervaded speaker and audience as Dr.Inglis told the tale
and pointed the moral, remains an abiding memory.Her politics were Liberal, and, what was more remarkable, she was
a convinced Home Ruler.Those who believe that women in politics
naturally take the line of the home, may find here a very strong
instance of the independent mind, producing no rift within the lute
that sounded such a perfect note of unison between her and the
prevailing influence of her youth.Inglis had done his work in
India, and his politics were of an Imperialist rather than that of a
‘Home Ruler All Round.’ When Mr.Gladstone introduced his Home Rule
Bill of 1893, Elsie complains of the obstructive talk in Parliament.Inglis gently says she seems to wish it passed without discussion.Elsie replies on the points she thinks salient and likely to work, and
wonders why they should not commend themselves to sense and not words.The family have recollections of long and not acrimonious debates well
sustained on either side.She was a member of the W.L.F., and was always impatient of the way
Party was placed before the Franchise.‘I was sorry to see how the Suffrage question was pushed into the
 background by Lady Aberdeen.However, I shall stick to the Federation,
 and bring them to their senses on that point as far as my influence
 goes.It is simply sham Liberalism that will not recognise that it is
 a real Liberal question (1893).‘That is a capital letter of Miss M‘Laren’s.It is quite true, and
 women are awful fools to truckle to their party, instead of putting
 their foot down, about the Franchise.You would certainly hear more
 about wife murders than you do at present, if the women had a vote.‘Do you know what they said at the Liberal Club the other day in
 answer to some deputation, or appeal, or rather it was said, in the
 discussion, that the Liberal Party would do all they could to remedy
 abuses and give women justice, but the vote they would not give,
 because they would put a power into women’s hand which could never be
 taken away.‘Did I tell you that I have to speak at a drawing-room meeting on
 Woman’s Suffrage?I had just refused to write
 a paper for her on the present state of medical education in the
 country, for I thought that would be too great cheek in a house
 surgeon, so I did not like to refuse the other.‘The drawing-room meeting yesterday was very good.I got there late,
 and found a fearfully and awfully fashionable audience being harangued
 by a very smart-looking man, who spoke uncommonly well, and was saying
 everything I meant to say.Elmy smiled and nodded away to me, and suddenly it flashed on
 me that I was to second the motion this man was speaking to.I was
 in such an awful funk that I got cool, and got up and told them that
 I did not think Mr.Wilkins had left any single thing for me to say;
 however, as things struck people in different ways I should simply
 tell them how it struck me, and then went ahead with what I meant to
 say when I got in.Elmy was quite pleased, and several people
 came up afterwards, and said I had got on all right.Elmy said,
 I had not repeated Mr.He was such a fluent
 speaker, he scared me awfully.’

The decade that saw the controversy of Home Rule for Ireland, was the
first that brought women prominently into political organisations.Many
women’s associations were formed, and the religious aspect as between
Ulster and the South interested many very deeply.Elsie was not a
Liberal-Unionist, and, as she states her case to her father, there is
much that shows that she was thinking the matter out for herself, on
lines which were then fresher than they are to-day.From Glasgow, in 1891, she writes:--

 ‘I have spent a wicked Sunday.I read all the morning, and then went
 up to the Infirmary to bandage with Dr.T. says I am quite
 sure to be plucked, after such worldliness.I have discovered he is
 an Australian from Victoria.D. is an Aberdeen man and a great
 admirer of George Smith.Never mind about
 the agricultural labourer, Papa dear!I am afraid Gladstone’s majority
 won’t be a working one, and we shall have the whole row over again in
 six months.D. says every available voter has been seized by the
 scruff of his neck and made to vote this time.And, six months hence
 there’ll be no fresh light on the situation, and we’ll be where we
 are now.I should not wonder if the whole thing makes us devise some
 plan for one Imperial Parliament and local government for Ireland,
 Scotland, and the Colonies, ending in making the integrity of the
 Empire “and unity of the English speaking race” more apparent than it
 is now, _and_ with the Irish contented and managing their own affairs
 in their own mad way.Gladstone has been so engrossed with his H.R.measure that he
 does not seem to have noticed these other questions that have been
 quickly growing, and he has made two big blunders about Woman’s
 Suffrage and the Labour question.I have no doubt these men are
 talking a lot of nonsense, and are trying for impossibilities, but
 there is a great deal of sense in what they say.It is no good
 shutting our eyes to the facts they bring forward.D., I am very much afraid you would not agree with him.The only point in which he agrees with you is
 that he would make everybody do what he thinks right.Only his ideas
 of right are very different from yours.He believes in an eight-hour
 day, local option, and State-owned mines.His chief amusement at
 present is arguing with me.He generally gets angry, and says, “I
 argue like a woman,” but he always pluckily begins again.He was a
 tradesman, and gave it up because he says you cannot be an honest
 tradesman nowadays.He is studying medicine; the last day I worked
 at “brains” he rampaged about the room arguing about the unearned
 increment.I tell him he must come and argue in Edinburgh--I have not
 time at present.‘I will tell you what I think of the Home Rule Bill to-morrow--that is
 to say, if I have time to read it.It is really a case of officers and
 men here just now.I can’t say “go on” instead of “come on.” I cannot
 order cold spongings and hot fomentations by the dozen and then sit in
 my room and read the newspapers, can I?’

      ‘GLASGOW, _May 1892_.‘What do you think of Lord Salisbury’s speech, inciting to rebellion
 and civil war?Now, don’t think of it as Lord Salisbury and Ulster,
 but think of it as advice given by Mr.Gladstone to the rest of
 Ireland.If you like to take the lead into your own hands and march on
 Dublin; I don’t know that any Government would care to use the forces
 of the Crown against you.You will be quite justified because the
 Government of your country is in the hands of your hereditary foes.There is only one good point in Lord Salisbury’s speech, and that is
 that he does not sham that the Ulster men are Irishmen.He calls them
 a colony from this country.Lord S. must have been feeling desperate
 before he made that speech.’

      ‘_1894_.Chamberlain’s speech was very clever.It was this special
 Home Rule Bill he pulled to pieces, and one could not help feeling
 that that would have been the result whatever the Bill had been, if
 it had been introduced by anybody but Mr.C. His argument seemed to
 be in favour of Imperial Federation, as far as I could make out.I
 have no doubt the Bill can be very much improved in committee, but
 the groundwork of it is all right.The two Houses and the gradual
 giving over of the police and land, when they have had time to find
 their feet.As to the retaining the Irish members in Parliament being
 totally illogical, there is nothing in that; we always make illogical
 things work.I expect he hates the
 Irish Party as much as any man, but he spoke up for them all the
 same.If he had not, I don’t believe Mr.Chamberlain and some of the
 others would have spoken as they did.The Conservative Party was quite
 inclined to laugh at the paid stipendiaries until Mr.‘I have been reading up the Bishop of Chester’s scheme and the Direct
 Veto Bill.It would be very nice to turn
 all the pubs into coffee-houses, but a big company over whom the
 ratepayers have no control would be just as likely to do what would
 pay best, as the tramway companies now, who work their men seventeen
 hours and their horses three, at a stretch.It would be quite a
 different thing to put the pubs under the Town and County Councils.As
 to this Bill it is not to stop people drinking, but simply to shut up
 pubs.A man can still buy his whisky and get drunk in his own house,
 but a community says, “We won’t have the nuisance of a pub at every
 corner,” and I am not sure that they have not that right, just as much
 as the private individual has to get drunk if he chooses.A great
 many men would keep straight if the temptation were not thrown in
 their faces.The system of licences was instituted for the good of the
 public, not the good of the publican.‘The Elections will be three weeks after my exam.Dearest Papa!--There
 is as much chance of Mr.Gladstone being beaten in Midlothian as there
 is of a Conservative majority.’

Another friend writes:--

 ‘I should like to send you a recollection of her in the early
 Nineties.Jessie MacGregor, wrote to my home in
 Rothesay, asking us to put up Dr.Inglis, who was to give an address
 at a Sanitary Congress to be held there.It was, I believe, her first
 public appearance, and she did do well.One woman alone on a platform
 filled with well-known doctors from all parts!Her subject was
 advocating women as sanitary inspectors.She was one of the pioneers
 in that movement also.I can well remember her, a slim little girl in
 black, fearless as ever, doing her part.After she had finished, there
 was a running criticism of her subject.Many against her view, few for
 the cause on which she was speaking.One well-known doctor asked us to picture
 his dear friend Elsie Inglis carrying out a six-foot smallpox patient.‘I think she was the first lady medical to speak at a Congress.It was
 such a pleasure to entertain her, she was so quiet and unobtrusive,
 and yet so humorous.I never met her again, but I could never forget
 her, though we were just like ships that pass in the night.’

One of her Suffrage organisers, Miss Bury, gives a vivid picture of her
work in the Suffrage cause:--

 ‘It was Dr.Elsie Inglis who brought me to Scotland, and sent me to
 organise Suffrage societies in the Highlands.I speak of her as I knew
 her, the best of chiefs, so kind and encouraging and appreciative of
 one’s efforts, even when they were not always crowned with success.I remember saying I was disappointed because the hall was only about
 three-quarters full, and her reply was, “My dear, I was not counting
 the people, I was thinking of the efforts which had brought those who
 were there.”

 ‘Her letters were an inspiration.She gave one the full responsibility
 of one’s position, and always expected the best.Resolutely direct,
 and straightforward in her dealings with me as a subordinate worker,
 she never failed to tell me of any word of appreciation that reached
 her, as she also told me candidly if she heard of any criticism.She had such a big, generous mind, even condescending to give an
 opportunity for argument when there was any difference of opinion, and
 absolutely tolerant and kind when one did not agree with her.‘She was always considerate of one’s health, and insisted that the
 hours laid down for work were not to be exceeded, or, if this was
 unavoidable, that the time must be taken off as soon as possible
 afterwards.She only saw difficulties to conquer them, and I well
 remember in one of her letters from Lazaravatz, she wrote so
 characteristically--“the work is most interesting, bristling with
 difficulties.”

 ‘My happiest recollection is of a visit to the Highlands, to speak at
 some Suffrage meetings I had arranged for her.In the train she was
 always busy writing, in that beautiful clear characteristic hand, like
 herself, triumphing over the jolting of the Highland Railway, as she
 did later in Serbia.In the early morning she had to catch a train at
 Inverness, and we went by motor from Nairn.For once the writing was
 laid aside, and she gave herself up to the enjoyment of the sunrise,
 and the beautiful lights on the Ross-shire hills, as we travelled
 along the shores of the Moray Firth.When the car broke down, out came
 the despatch case again, while the chauffeur and I put on the Stepney.There was no complaining about the lost train, a wire was sent to the
 committee apologising for her absence, and then she immediately turned
 her attention to other business.’

One who first came under her influence as a patient, and became a warm
friend, gives some reminiscences.Her greeting to the elect at the
beginning of the year was, ‘A good new year, and the Vote _this_ year.’

 ‘I remember once, as we descended the steps of St.Giles’ after
 attending a service at which the Edinburgh Town Council was present,
 she spoke joyfully of the time coming when we, the women of Edinburgh
 and of Scotland, would “help to build the New Jerusalem, with the
 weapon ready to our hand--the Vote.”’

The year 1906 brought the Liberals into political power, and with
the great wave of democratic enthusiasm which gave the Government of
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman an enormous majority there came other
expressions of the people’s will.The Franchise for women had hitherto been of academic interest in the
community: a crank, many thought it, like total abstinence or Christian
Science.The claims of women were frequently brought before Parliament
by private members, and if the Bill was not ‘talked out,’ it was talked
round, as one of the best jests of a Parliamentary holiday.The women
who advocated it were treated with tolerance, their public advocacy
was deemed a _tour de force_, and their portraits were always of the
nature of caricatures, except those in _Punch_, where the opponent was
caricatured, and the women immortalised.The Liberal party found its right wing mainly composed of Labour, and
Socialist members were returned to Parliament.From that section of
thought sprang the militant movement, and the whole question of the
enfranchisement of women took on a different aspect.This chapter does not attempt to give a history of the ‘common cause,’
or the reasons for the rapid way it came to the front, and ranked with
Ireland as among the questions which, left unsettled, became a thorn in
the side of any Government that attempted to govern against, or leaving
outside the expressed will of the people.This is no place to examine the causes which, along with the militant
movement, but always separated from them, poured such fresh life and
vigour into the old constitutional and law-abiding effort to procure
the free rights of citizenship for women.The pace quickened to an extent which was bewildering.Where a dozen
meetings a year had been the portion of many speakers, they were
multiplied by the tens and scores.A
fighting fund collected, meetings arranged, debates were held all over
the country and among all classes.A press, which had never written up
the subject while its advocates were law-abiding, tumbled over each
other to advertise every movement of all sections of suffragists.It must be admitted the militants gave them plenty of copy, and the
constitutionalists had an uneasy sense that their stable companions
would kick over the traces in some embarrassing and unexpected way on
every new occasion.Still the tide flowed steadily for the principle,
and those who had its guidance in Parliament and the country had to
use all the strength of the movement in getting it well organised and
carefully worked.Societies were federated, and the greatly growing
numbers co-ordinated into a machine which could bring the best pressure
to bear on Parliament.The well-planned Federation of Scottish
Suffrage Societies owed much to Dr.Inglis’ gift of organisation and
of taking opportunity by the hand.She was Honorary Secretary to the
Scottish Federation, and in those fighting years between 1906 and
1914 she impressed herself much on its policy.In the early years of
her professional life, she used gaily to forecast for herself a large
and paying practice.Her patients never suffered, but she sacrificed
her professional prospects in a large measure for her work for the
Franchise.She gave her time freely, and she raised money at critical
times by parting with what was of value and in her power to give.Perhaps, the writer may here again give her own reminiscences.Inglis was all too rarely social; they met almost
entirely in their suffrage work.Inglis at all was to know
her well.The transparent sincerity and simplicity of her manner left
nothing to be discovered.One felt instinctively she was a comrade
one could ‘go tiger-hunting with,’ and to be in her company was to be
sustained by a true helpmate.Invited
by the elect, and sometimes by the opponents to enjoy hospitality, Dr.Inglis was rarely able to come in time for the baked meats before we
ascended the platform, and uttered our platitudes to rooms often empty
woodyards, stuck about with a remnant of those who would be saved.She
usually met us on the platform, having arrived by the last train, and
obliged to leave by the first.There was always the smile at the last set-back, the ready joke at our
opponents, the subtle sense that she was out to win, the compelling
force of sustained effort that made at least one of her yoke-fellows
ashamed of the faint heart that could never hope to win through.Sometimes we travelled back together; more often we would meet next day
in St.Giles’ after the daily service, and our walk home was always
a cheer.‘Never mind’ the note to discouragement.‘Remember this or
that in our favour; our next move must be in this direction.’ And the
thought was always there (if her unselfconsciousness prevented it being
spoken--as one wishes to-day it had been)--‘The meeting went, because
you were there and set your whole soul on “willing” it through.’

She had no sympathy with militantism.There was no better fighter
with legitimate weapons, but she saw how closely the claim to do wrong
that good might come was related to anarchy, and her sense of true
citizenship was outraged by law-breaking which, to her clear judgment,
could only <DW44> the ultimate triumph of a cause rooted in all that
was just and righteous.She was not confused by any cross-currents
of admiration for individual courage and self-sacrifice, and her one
desire was to see that the Federation was ‘purged’ of all those who
belonged to the forces of disintegration.She had the fruit of her political sagacity, and her fearless pursuit
after integrity in deed and in word.When the moment came when she was
to go to the battle fronts of the world, a succourer of many, she went
in the strength of the Suffrage women of Scotland.They were her shield
and buckler, and their loyal support of her work and its ideals was
her exceeding great reward.Without their organised strength she could
never have called into existence those units and their equipment which
have justly earned the praises of nations allied in arms.With the rise of the militant movement, the whole Suffrage cause
passed through a cloud of opprobrium and almost universal objurgation.Women were all tarred with the same stick, and fell under one
condemnation.It is now of little moment to recall this, except in as
much as it affected Elsie Inglis.The Scottish Suffrage societies, who
gave their organisation and their workers to start the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals, found that the community desired to forget the unpopular
Suffrage, and to remember only the Scottish Hospitals.Inglis was doing were asked to avoid ‘the common cause.’
No one who knew her would consent to deny by implication one of the
deepest mainsprings of her work.The Churches were equally timid in
aught that gave comfort or consolation to those who were loyal to their
Christian social ideal for women.No organised society owes more to the
administrative work of women than does the Christian Church throughout
the world.No body of administrators have been slower to perceive that
women in responsible positions would be a strength to the Church than
have been the clergy of the Church.The writer of _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_
puts into the mouth of the clerical type of that day the argument
that the Old Testament gave an historic basis for the enslavement of
races, and St.The
spirit of Christianity has raised women from a ‘low estate,’ and women
owe everything to the results of Christianity; but the ecclesiastical
mind has never shaken off the belief that they are under a special
curse from the days of Eden, and that St.Paul’s outlook on women
in his day was the last revelation as to their future position in a
jealously-guarded corporation.Which of us, acquainted with the Church
history of our day, but remembers the General Assembly when the women
missionaries were first invited to stand by their fellow-workers and be
addressed by the Moderator on their labours and sufferings in a common
cause?It was a great shock to the fathers and brethren that their sex
should not disqualify them from standing in the Assembly, which would
have more democratic weight in the visible Church on earth if some of
its elected lay members were women serving in the courts of the Church.In this matter and in many others concerning women, the Church is not
yet triumphant over its prejudices bedded in the geological structure
of Genesis.In all periods of the enfranchisement struggle there were individual
clergy who aided women with their warm advocacy and the helpful
direction of thought.Elsie Inglis was a leader of this movement in its
connection with a high Christian ideal of the citizenship of women.Margaret’s, the church of Parliament in
history, to commemorate all her works begun and ended as a member of
Christ’s Church here on earth, it was fitting that Bishop Gore, who had
so consistently upheld the cause, should speak of her work as one who
had helped to win the equality of women in a democratic, self-governing
State.This memoir would utterly fail to reproduce a picture of Dr.Inglis if
it did not emphasise how her spirit was led and disciplined, tempered
and steeled, through this long and fiery trial to the goal of a leading
ideal.The contest trained her for her splendid achievements in
overcoming all obstacles in ministering to the sufferings of nations,
‘rightly struggling to be free.’ Her friend, Miss Wright, says:--

 ‘We did not always agree.Many were the arguments we had with her, but
 she was always willing to understand another point of view and willing
 to allow for difference of opinion.She was very fair-minded and
 reasonable, and deplored the excesses of the militant suffragettes.She was in no sense a man-hater; to her the world was composed of men
 and women, and she thought it a mistake to exalt the one unduly over
 the other.She was never embittered by her struggle for the position
 of women.She loved the fight, and the endeavour, and to arrive at any
 point just meant a fresh setting forward to another further goal.‘From her girlhood onward, her effort was to free and broaden life for
 other women, to make the world a better place to live in.‘I had a letter this week from Annie Wilson, Elsie’s great friend.She says, “It seems to me Elsie’s whole life was full of championship
 of the weak, and she was so strong in maintaining what was right.I remember once saying in connection
 with some work I was going to begin, ‘I wonder if I shall be able,’
 and Elsie saying in her bright way, ‘What man has done man can do.’
 I am so glad that she had the opportunity of showing her great
 administrative capacity, and that her power is known and acknowledged.I cannot tell you what it will be not to have
 her welcome to look forward to when I come home.”

 ‘Elsie had in many respects what is, perhaps wrongly, called a man’s
 mind.She was an Imperialist in the very best sense, and had high
 ideals for her country and people.She was a very womanly woman,
 never affecting mannish ways as a pose.If she seemed a strong-minded
 woman it was because she had strenuous work to do.She was never “a
 lone woman.” She was always one of a family, and in the heart of the
 family.Elsie always had the _lovingest_ appreciation and backing from
 her nearest and dearest, and that a wide and varied circle.So, also,
 she did not need to fight for her position; it has been said of her,
 “Whenever she began to speak her pleasant well-bred accent and manner
 gained her a hearing.” She was ever a fighter, but it was because she
 wanted those out in the cold and darkness to come into the love and
 light which she herself experienced and sought after always more fully.‘We looked forward to more frequent meetings when working days were
 done.Now she has gone forward to the great work beyond:

    ‘“Somewhere, surely, afar
    In the sounding labour home vast
    Of being, is practised that strength--
    Zealous, beneficent, firm.”’




CHAPTER VII

THE PROFESSION AND THE FAITH

    ‘Run the straight race through God’s good grace,
    Lift up thine eyes and seek His face;
    Life with its way before us lies,
    Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.’

    ‘Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.’


Elsie Inglis took up practice in Edinburgh, and worked in a happy
partnership with the late Dr.Jessie MacGregor, until the latter left
Scotland for work in America.When the University of Edinburgh admitted women to the examinations for
degrees in medicine, Dr.Inglis graduated M.B., C.M.From that
date onwards her practice, her political and suffrage work, and the
founding of the Hospice in the High Street of Edinburgh, as a nursing
home and maternity centre staffed by medical women, occupied a life
which grew and strengthened amid so many and varied experiences.Her father’s death deprived her of what had been the very centre and
mainspring of her existence.As she records the story of his passing
on, she says that she cannot imagine life without him, and that he had
been so glad to see her begin her professional career.She was not one
to lose her place in the stream of life from any morbid inaction or
useless repining.She shared the spirit of the race from which she had
sprung, a reaching forward to obtain the prize of life fulfilled with
service, and she had inherited the childlike faith and confidence which
inspired their belief in the Father of Spirits.Elsie lost in her father the one who had made her the centre of his
thoughts and of his most loving watchfulness.From the day that her
home with him was left unto her desolate, she was to become a centre to
many of her father’s wide household, and, even as she had learnt from
him, she became a stay and support to many of his children’s children.The two doctors started practice in Atholl Place, and later on they
moved into 8 Walker Street, an abode which will always be associated
with the name of Dr.M‘Laren says:--

 ‘My impressions of their joint house are all pleasant ones.They got
 on wonderfully together, and in every thing seemed to appreciate one
 another’s good qualities.They were very different, and had in many
 ways a different outlook.I remember Jessie saying once, “Elsie is so
 exceptionally generous in her attitude of mind, it would be difficult
 not to get on with her!” They both held their own opinions on various
 subjects without the difference of opinion really coming between them.Elsie said once about the arrangement, “It has all the advantages of
 marriage without any of its disabilities.” We used always to think
 they did each other worlds of good.I know how I always enjoyed a
 visit to them if it was only for an afternoon or some weeks.There was
 such an air of freedom in the whole house.You did what you liked,
 thought what you liked, without any fear of criticism or of being
 misunderstood.‘I do not know much about her practice, as medicine never interested
 me, but I believe at one time, before the Suffrage work engrossed her
 so much, she was making quite a large income.’

Professionally she suffered under two disabilities: the restricted
opportunities for clinical work in the days when she was studying her
profession, combined with the constant interruptions which the struggle
against the medical obstructionists necessitated; secondly, the
various stages in the political fight incident to obtaining that wider
enfranchisement which aimed at freeing women from all those lesser
disabilities which made them the helots of every recognised profession
and industry.When in the Scottish Women’s Hospitals abroad, Dr.Inglis rapidly
acquired a surgical skill, under the tremendous pressure of work, which
often kept her for days at the operating-table, which showed what a
great surgeon she might have been, given equal advantages in the days
of her peace practice.Inglis lost no opportunity of enlarging her knowledge.She was
a lecturer on Gynecology in the Medical College for Women which had
been started later than Dr.Jex Blake’s school, and was on slightly
broader lines.After she had started practice she went to study German
clinics; she travelled to Vienna, and later on spent two months in
America studying the work and methods of the best surgeons in New York,
Chicago, and Rochester.She advocated, at home and abroad, equal opportunities for work
and study in the laboratories for both men and women students.She
maintained that the lectures for women only were not as good as those
provided for the men, and that the women did not get the opportunity
of thorough laboratory practice before taking their exams.She thus
came into conflict with the University authorities, who refused to
accept women medical students within the University, or to recognise
extra-mural mixed classes in certain subjects.‘With a great price’ she might truly say
she had purchased her freedom, and nothing would turn her aside.If
one avenue was closed, try another.If one Principal was adamant,
his day could not last for ever; prepare the way for his successor.Indomitable, unbeaten, unsoured, Dr.Inglis, with the smiling, fearless
brow, trod the years till the influence of the ‘red planet Mars’ opened
to her and others the gate of opportunity.She had achieved many
things, and was far away from her city and its hard-earned practice
when at length, in 1916, the University, under a new ‘open-minded,
generous-hearted Head,’ opened its doors to women medical students.There were other things, besides her practice, which Dr.Inglis
subordinated in these years to the political enfranchisement of women.It has been shown in a previous chapter how keen were her political
beliefs.She joined the Central Edinburgh Women’s Liberal Association
in its earliest organised years.She acted as Vice-President in it for
sixteen years, and was one of its most active members.Gulland, the Liberal Whip, knew the value of her work, and must
have had reason to respect the order in which she placed her political
creed--first the citizenship of women, then the party organisation.He speaks of her fearless partisanship and aloof attitude towards all
local political difficulties.An obstacle to her was a thing to be
overcome, not to be sat down before.Any one in politics who sees what
is right, and cannot understand any reason why the action should not
be straight, rather than compromising, is a help to party agents at
rare intervals; normally such minds cause anxiety.Her secretary, Miss
Cunningham, says about her place in the Liberal organisation:--

 ‘Not only as a speaker--though as that she was invaluable--but as one
 who mixed freely with all our members, with her sympathy, in fact, her
 enthusiasm for everything affecting the good of women, she won respect
 and liking on every side.It was not until she became convinced that
 she could help forward the great cause for women better by being
 unattached to any party organisation that she severed her connection
 with the Liberal Party.Regretted as that severance was by all, we
 understood her point of view so well that we recognised there was no
 other course open to her.Her firm grasp of and clear insight into
 matters political made her a most valued colleague, especially in
 times of difficulty, when her advice was always to be relied upon.’

In 1901 she was a member of the Women’s Liberal League, a branch of
the W.L.A.which split off at the time of the Boer War, in opposition
to the ‘Little Englanders.’ Dr.Inglis was on its first committee, and
lent her drawing-room for meetings, addressing other meetings on the
Imperialist doctrines born in that war.When that phase of politics
ended, the League became an educational body and worked on social and
factory legislation.Among her other enterprises was the founding of the Muir Hall of
Residence for Women Students at the University.Many came up from the
country, and, like herself in former days in Glasgow, had to find
suitable, and in many cases uncomfortable, lodgings.Principal Muir’s old Indian friendship with Mr.Inglis had been most
helpful in former years, and now Lady Muir and other friends of the
women students started a Residence in George Square for them, and
Miss Robertson was appointed its first warden.Secretary to the Muir Hall till she died, and from its start was a
moving spirit in all that stood for the comfort of the students.She
attended them when they were ill, and was always ready to help them
in their difficulties with her keen, understanding advice.The child
of her love, amid all other works, was her Maternity Hospice.Of this
work Miss Mair, who was indeed ‘a nursing mother’ to so many of the
undertakings of women in the healing profession, writes of Dr.Inglis’
feeling with perfect understanding:--

 ‘To Dr.Inglis’ clear vision, even in her early years of student life,
 there shone through the mists of opposition and misunderstandings a
 future scene in which a welcome recognition would be made of women’s
 services for humanity, and with a strong, glad heart she joined with
 other pioneers in treading “the stony way” that leads to most reforms.Once landed on the firm rock of professional recognition, Dr.Inglis
 set about the philanthropic task of bringing succour and helpful
 advice to mothers and young babies and expectant mothers in the
 crowded homes in and about the High Street.There, with the help of a
 few friends, she founded the useful little Hospice that we trust now
 to see so developed and extended by an appreciative public, that it
 will merit the honoured name “The Dr.Elsie Inglis Memorial Hospice.”

 ‘This little Hospice lay very near the heart of its founder--she loved
 it--and with her always sensitive realisation of the needs of the
 future, she was convinced that this was a bit of work on the right
 lines for recognition in years to come.Some of us can recall the
 kindling eye, the inspiring tones, that gave animation to her whole
 being when talking of her loved Hospice.She saw in it a possible
 future that might effect much, not only for its patients, but for
 generations of medical women.’

With Dr.Elsie one idea always started another, and ‘a felt want’ in
any department of life always meant an instantly conceived scheme of
supplying the need.Those who ‘came after’ sometimes felt a breathless
wonder how ways and means could be found to establish and settle the
new idea which had been evolved from the fertile brain.The Hospice
grew out of the establishment of a nursing home for working women,
where they could be cared for near their own homes.Barbour, a house was secured at a nominal rent in
George Square, and opened in 1901.That sphere of usefulness could be
extended if a maternity home could be started in a poorer district.Thus the Hospice in the High Street was opened in 1904.Inglis
devoted herself to the work.An operating theatre and eight beds
were provided.The midwifery department grew so rapidly that after a
few years the Hospice became a centre, one of five in Scotland, for
training nurses for the C.M.B.Inglis looked forward to a greater future for it in infant welfare
work, and she always justified the device of the site as being close
to where the people lived, and in air to which they were accustomed.Trained district nurses visited the people in their own homes, and
in 1910 there were more cases than nurses to overtake them.In that
year the Hospice was amalgamated with Bruntsfield Hospital; medical,
surgical, and gynecological cases were treated there, while the Hospice
was devoted entirely to maternity and infant welfare cases.Inglis’ ‘vision’ was nearly accomplished when she had a small ward
of five beds for malnutrition cases, a baby clinic, a milk depot,
health centres, and the knowledge that the Hospice has the distinction
of being the only maternity centre run by women in Scotland.This
affords women students opportunities denied to them in other maternity
hospitals.A probationer in that Hospice says:--

 ‘Dr.Inglis’ idea was that everything, as far as possible, should
 be made subservient to the comfort of the patients.This was always
 considered when planning the routine.She disapproved of the system
 prevalent in so many hospitals of rousing the patients out of sleep
 in the small hours of the morning in order to get through the work of
 the wards.She would not have them awakened before 6 A.M., and she
 instituted a cup of tea before anything else was done.To her nurses
 she was very just and appreciative of good work, and, if complaints
 were made against any one, the wrongdoing had to be absolutely proved
 before she would take action.She also insisted on the nurses having
 adequate time off, and that it should not be infringed upon.’

These, in outline, are the interests which filled the years after Dr.Of her work among the people living round
her Hospice, it is best told in the words of those who watched for
her coming, and blessed the sound of her feet on their thresholds.Freely she gave them of her best, and freely they gave her the love and
confidence of their loyal hearts.Inglis’ patient for twenty years, and she had
also attended her mother and grandmother.Of several children one
was called Elsie Maud Inglis, and the child was christened in the
Dean Church by Dr.The whole family seem to have been her charge, for when Mrs.B.’s husband returned from the South African War, Dr.Inglis fought
the War Office for nine months to secure him a set of teeth, and,
needless to say, after taking all the trouble entailed by a War Office
correspondence, she was successful.A son fought in the present war,
and when Dr.Inglis saw the death of a Private B., she sent a telegram
to the War Office to make sure it was not the son of Mrs.B. She would
never take any fees from this family.B. gave her
some feathers he had brought home from Africa.She had them put in a
new hat she had got for a wedding, and came round before she went to
the festival to show them to the donor.Her cheery ways ‘helped them
all,’ and when a child of the family broke its leg, and was not mending
all round in the Infirmary, Dr.Inglis was asked to go and see her, and
the child from then ‘went forrit.’

In another family there was some stomach weakness, and three infants
died.Inglis tried hard to save the life of the third, a little
boy, who was evidently getting no nourishment.So anxious was she,
that she asked a sister who had recently had a baby, to try if she
could nurse the child.This was done, the foster mother going every day
to the house, but they could not save the infant.When the next one
arrived, Dr.Inglis was so determined the child should live, she came
every day, whatever were her engagements, to sterilise the milk.The
child throve under her care, and grew up in health.Another of these patients of her care ‘could not control her feelings’
when speaking of the good physician.It was evident the family had
lost their best friend.Inglis’
kindness to them.She would come round, after she had finished her
other work at night, to bath the baby.When another child was ill, she
told the mother not to open the door even if the King himself wished
to come in.The husband said she was so bright one felt the better
for her visit, ‘though her orders had to be obeyed and no mistake,
and she would tell you off at once if you did not carry them out.’ If
they offered payment, she would say, ‘Now, go and buy a nice chop for
yourself.’

Another family had this story.G.: ‘That woman has done more
for the folk living between Morrison Street and the High Street than
all the ministers in Edinburgh and Scotland itself ever did for any
one.She gave her house, her
property, her practice, her money to help others.’ Mrs.G. fell ill
after the birth of one of her children.Elsie came in one night,
made her a cup of tea and some toast, and, as she failed to get well,
she raised money to keep her in a sanatorium for six months.After she
had been there one child, in charge of a friend, fell ill, and finally
died, Dr.Inglis doing all she could to spare the absent mother and
save the child.When it died, she wrote:--

 ‘MY DEAR MRS.G.,--You will have got the news by now.I cannot tell
 you how sorry I am for you, my dear.But you will believe, won’t you,
 that we all did everything we could for your dear little boy.H. and I saw him three times a day
 between us, and yesterday we saw him four times.When I sent you the
 card I hoped the high temperature was due to his teeth, because his
 pulse seemed good.H. telephoned that she was
 afraid that his pulse was flagging, and he died suddenly about one.G. has just been here; you must get well, my dear, for his sake,
 and for the sake of all the other little children.Poor little Johnnie
 has had a great many troubles in his little life has he not?But he
 is over them all now, dear little man.And the God in whose _safe_
 keeping he is, comfort you, dear Mrs.G.--Ever your sincere friend,

      ‘ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

The caretaker of the dispensary in St.Cuthbert’s Mission in Morrison
Street speaks of Dr.Inglis as the true friend of all who needed her.She gave an hour three mornings in the week, and if she could not
overtake all the cases in the time, she would occasionally come back
later in the day.Another of her patients was the mother of twelve children; six of
them were ‘brought home’ by Dr.She was a friend to them all,
and never minded what trouble she took.If they did not send for her,
wishing to spare her, she scolded them for thinking of herself and not
of their need for her services.All the children loved her, and they
would watch from the window on her dispensary days for her, and she
would wave to them across the street.She would often stop them in
the street to ask after their mother, and even after she had been to
Serbia and returned to Edinburgh, she remembered about them and their
home affairs.She always made them understand that her orders must be
carried out.The eldest girl was washing the floor, and Dr.Inglis told her to
go for some medicine.The girl continued to finish the work she was at.Inglis, ‘don’t you know that when I say a thing I
mean it?’ Another time she had told Mrs.C. to remain in her bed till
she came.C. rose to wash the
dishes.Do not touch another dish.’ And she herself helped Mrs.Later on two of the children got scarlet fever, and Dr.Inglis told the
mother she was proud of her, as, through her care, the infection did
not spread in the family or outside it.The people in Morrison Street showed their gratitude by collecting
a little sum of money to buy an electric lamp to light their doctor
friend up the dark staircase of the house.These were the true mourners
who stood round St.Giles’ with the bairns she had ‘brought home’ on
the day when her earthly presence passed from their sight.These were
they who had fitted her for her strenuous enterprises in the day when
the battle was set in array, and these were the people who knew her
best, and never doubted that when called from their midst she would go
forth strong in that spirit which is given to the weak things of the
earth, and that it would be her part to strengthen the peoples that had
no might.The Little Sisters of the Poor had a dispensary of St.Elsie had it in her charge from 1903 to 1913, and the Sister Superior
speaks of the affection of the people and the good work done among them.‘“How often,” writes one in charge of the servant department of the
 Y.W.C.A., “her deliberate tread has brought confidence to me when
 getting heartless over some of these poor creatures who would not
 rouse themselves, judging the world was against them.Many a time
 the patient fighting with circumstances needed a sisterly word of
 cheer which Dr.Inglis supplied, and sent the individual heartened
 and refreshed.The expression on her face, _I mean business_, had
 a wonderful uplift, while her acuteness in exactly describing the
 symptoms to those who were in constant contact gave a confidence which
 made her a power amongst us.”’

A patient has allowed some of her written prescriptions to be quoted.They were not of a kind to be made up by a chemist:--

 ‘I want you never to miss or delay meals.I want you to go to bed at
 a reasonable time and go to sleep early.I want you to do your work
 regularly, and to take an interest in outside things--such as your
 church and suffrage.’

 ‘We should not let these Things (with a capital T) affect us so much.Our cause is too righteous for it to be really affected by them--if we
 don’t weaken.’

 ‘My dear, the potter’s wheel isn’t a pleasant instrument.’

 ‘Go home and say your prayers.’

 ‘Realise what you are, a free born child of the Universe.Perfection
 your Polar Star.’

These stories of her healing of mind and body might be endlessly
multiplied.Sorrow and disease are much the same whether they come to
the rich or the poor, and poverty is not always the worst trial of
many a sad tale.Elsie’s power of sympathy and understanding was
as much called upon in her paying practice as among the very poor.She
made no distinction in what she gave; her friendship was as ready as
her trained skill.There was one patient whose sufferings were largely
due to her own lack of will power.Elsie, after prescribing, bent down
and kissed her.It awoke in the individual the sense that she was not
‘altogether bad,’ and from that day forward there was a newness of life.From what sources of inner strength did she increasingly minister
in that sphere in which she moved?‘Thy touch has still its ancient
power,’ and no one who knew this unresting, unhasting, well-balanced
life, but felt it had drawn its spiritual strength from the deep wells
of Salvation.In these years the kindred points of heaven and home were always
in the background of her life.Sandra moved to the hallway.Her sisters’ homes were near her in
Edinburgh, and when her brother Ernest died in India, in 1910, his
widow and her three daughters came back to her house.Her friendship
and understanding of all the large circle that called her aunt was a
very beautiful tie.The elder ones were near enough to her own age
to be companions to her from her girlhood.Miss Simson says that she
was more like an elder sister to them when she stayed with the family
on their arrival from Tasmania.‘The next thing I remember about her
was when she went to school in Paris, she promised to bring us home
Paris dolls.She asked us how we wanted them dressed, and when she
returned we each received a beautiful one dressed in the manner chosen.Aunt Elsie was always most careful in the choice of presents for each
individual.One always felt that she had thought of and got something
that she knew you wanted.While on her way to Russia she sent me a
cheque because she had not been able to see anything while at home.She
wrote, “This is to spend on something frivolous that you want, and not
on stockings or anything like that.”’

‘It is not her great gifts that I remember now,’ says another of that
young circle, ‘it is that she was always such a darling.’

These nieces were often the companions of Dr.She
had her own ideas as to how these should be spent.She always had
September as her month of recreation.She used to go away, first of
all, for a fortnight quite alone to some out-of-the-way place, when
not even her letters were sent after her.She would book to a station,
get out, and bicycle round the neighbourhood till she found a place
she liked.She wanted scenery and housing accommodation according to
her mind.Her first requirement was hot water for ‘baths.’ If that was
found in abundance she was suited; if it could not be requisitioned,
she went elsewhere.Her paintbox went with her, and when she returned
to rejoin or fetch away her family she brought many impressions of what
she had seen.The holidays were restful because always well planned.She loved enjoyment and happiness, and she sought them in the spirit
of real relaxation and recreation.If weather or circumstances turned
out adverse, she was amused in finding some way out, and if nothing
else could be done she had a power of seeing the ludicrous under all
conditions, which in itself turned the rain-clouds of life into bursts
of sunlight.Inglis gives a happy picture of the life in 8 Walker Street, when
she was the guest of Dr.Her love for the three nieces, the one
in particular who bore her name, and in whose medical education she
deeply interested herself, was great.She used to return from a long day’s work, often late, but with a mind
at leisure from itself for the talk of the young people.However late
she was, a hot bath preluded a dinner-party full of fun and laughter,
the account of all the day’s doings, and then a game of bridge or some
other amusement.Often she would be anxious over some case, but she
used to say, ‘I have done all I know, I can only sleep over it,’ and
to bed and to sleep she went, always using her will-power to do what
was best in the situation.Those who were with her in the ‘retreats’
in Serbia or Russia saw the same quality of self-command.If transport
broke down, then the interval had better be used for rest, in the best
fashion in which it could be obtained.Her Sundays, as far as her profession permitted, were days of rest and
social intercourse with her family and friends.After evening church
she went always to supper in the Simson family, often detained late by
pacings to and fro with her friends, Dr.Wallace Williamson,
engaged in some outpouring of the vital interests which were absorbing
her.One of the members of her household says:--

 ‘We all used to look forward to hearing all her doings in the past
 week, and of all that lay before her in the next.Sunday evening felt
 quite wrong and flat when she was called out to a case and could not
 come to us.Her visit in
 September was the best bit of the holidays to us.She laid herself out
 to be with us in our bathing and golfing and picnics.’

The house was ‘well run.’ Those who know what is the highest meaning
of service, have always good servants, and Dr.Her cooks were all engaged under one stipulation, ‘Hot
water for any number of baths at any time of the day or night,’ and
the hot water never failed under the most exacting conditions.Her
guests were made very comfortable, and there was only one rigid rule
in the house.However late she came downstairs after any night-work,
there was always family prayers before breakfast.The book she used
was _Euchologion_, and when in Russia asked that a copy should be
sent her.Her consulting-room was lined with bookshelves containing
all her father’s books, and of these she never lost sight.Any guest
might borrow anything else in her house and forget to return it, but if
ever one of those books were borrowed, it had to be returned, for the
quest after it was pertinacious.Daniel went to the office.In her dress she became increasingly
particular, but only as the adornment, not of herself, but of the cause
of women as citizens or as doctors.When a uniform became part of her
equipment for work, she must have welcomed it with great enthusiasm.It
is in the hodden grey with the tartan shoulder straps, and the thistles
of Scotland that she will be clothed upon, in the memory of most of
those who recall her presence.It is difficult to write of the things that belong to the Spirit,
and Dr.Elsie’s own reserve on these matters was not often broken.She had been reared in a God-fearing household, and surrounded from
her earliest years with the atmosphere of an intensely devout home.That she tried all things, and approved them to her own conscience,
was natural to her character.Certain doctrines and formulas found no
acceptance with her.Man was created in God’s image, and the Almighty
did not desire that His creatures should despise or underrate the work
of His Hand.The attitude of regarding the world as a desert, and human
beings as miserable sinners incapable of rendering the highest service,
never commended itself to her eminently just mind.Such difficulties of
belief as she may have experienced in early years lay in the relations
of the created to the Creator of all that is divine in man.Till she
had convinced herself that a reasonable service was asked for and would
be accepted, her mind was not completely at rest.In her correspondence
with her father, both in Glasgow and London, her interest was always
living and vital in the things which belonged to the kingdom of heaven
within.She wandered from church to church in both places.Oblivious
of all distinctions she would take her prayer book and go for ‘music’
to the Episcopal Church, or attend the undenominational meetings
connected with the Y.W.C.A.Often she found herself most interested
in the ministry of the Rev.Hunter, who subsequently left Glasgow
for London.There are many shrewd comments on other ministers, on the
‘Declaratory Acts,’ then agitating the Free Church.She thought the
Westminster Confession should either be accepted or rejected, and that
the position was made no simpler by ‘declarations.’ In London she
attended the English Church almost exclusively, listening to the many
remarkable teachers who in the Nineties occupied the pulpits of the
Anglican Church.It was not till after her father’s death that she came
to rest entirely in the ministry of the Church of Scotland, and found
in the teaching and friendship of Dr.Wallace Williamson that which
gave her the vital faith which inspired her life and work, and carried
her at last triumphantly through the swellings of Jordan.Giles’ lay in the centre of her healing mission, and her
alert active figure was a familiar sight, as the little congregation
gathered for the daily service.When the kirk skailed in the fading
light of the short days, the westering sun on the windows would often
fall on the fair hair and bright face of her whose day had been spent
in ministering work.On these occasions she never talked of her work.If she was joined by a friend, Dr.Elsie waited to see what was the
pressing thought in the mind of her companion, and into that she at
once poured her whole sympathy.Few ever walked west with her to
her home without feeling in an atmosphere of high and chivalrous
enterprise.Thus in an ordered round passed the days and years, drawing
ever nearer to the unknown destiny, when that which was to try the
reins and the hearts of many nations was to come upon the world.When
that storm burst, Elsie Inglis was among those whose lamp was burning,
and whose heart was steadfast and prepared for the things which were
coming on the earth.ELSIE INGLIS, 1916]




CHAPTER VIII

WAR AND THE SCOTTISH WOMEN

    ‘God the all-terrible King, Who ordainest
      Great winds Thy clarion, the lightnings Thy sword,
    Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,
      Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.God the All-wise, by the fire of Thy chastening
      Earth shall to freedom and truth be restored,
    Through the thick darkness Thy kingdom is hastening,
      Thou wilt give peace in Thy time, O Lord.’


The year of the war coincided with that period in the life of Dr.Inglis when she was fully qualified for the great part she was to play
among the armies of the Allied nations.It is now admitted that this country was unprepared for war, and
incredulous as to the German menace.The services of women have now
attained so high a value in the State that it is difficult to recast
their condition in 1914.In politics there had been a succession of efforts to obtain
their enfranchisement.Each effort had been marked by a stronger
manifestation in their favour in the country, and the growing force
of the movement, coupled with the unrest in Ireland, had kept all
political organisations in a high state of tension.It has been shown how fully organised were all the Women Suffrage
societies.Committees, organisers, adherents, and speakers were at
work, and in the highest state of efficiency.Women linked by a common
cause had learnt how to work together.The best brains in their midst
were put at the service of the Suffrage, and they had watched in the
political arena where to expect support, and who could be trusted among
the leaders of all parties.No shrewder or more experienced body of
politicians were to be found in the country than those women drawn from
all classes, in all social, professional, and industrial spheres, who
acknowledged Mrs.Fawcett as their leader, and trusted no one party,
sect, or politician in the year 1914.When the war caused a truce to be pronounced in all questions of acute
political difference, the unenfranchised people realised that this
might mean the failure of their hopes for an indefinite time.They
never foresaw that, for the second time within a century, emancipation
was to be bought by the life blood of a generation.The truce made no difference to any section of the Suffrage party.War found both men and women
unprepared, but the path of glory was clear for the men.A great army
must be formed in defence of national liberty.It would have been well had the strength of the women been mobilised in
the same hour.Their long claim for the rights of citizenship made them
keenly alive and responsive to the call of national service.War and its consequences had for many years been uppermost in their
thoughts.In the struggle for emancipation, the great argument they
had had to face among the rapidly decreasing anti-party, was the one
that women could take no part in war, and, as all Government rested
ultimately on brute force, women could not fight, and therefore must
not vote.In countering this outlook, women had watched what war meant all over
the world, wherever it took place.With the use of scientific weapons
of destruction, with the development of scientific methods of healing,
with all that went to the maintenance of armies in the field, and the
support of populations at home, women had some vision in what manner
they would be needed if war ever came to this country.The misfortune of such a controversy as that of the ‘Rights of Women’
is that it necessarily means the opposition has to prove a negative
proposition--a most sterilising process.Political parties were so
anxious to prove that women were incapable of citizenship, that the
whole community got into a pernicious habit of mind.Women were
underrated in every sphere of industry or scientific knowledge.Their
sense of incapacity and irresponsibility was encouraged, and when they
turned militant under such treatment, they were only voted a nuisance
which it was impossible to totally exterminate.Those who watched the gathering war clouds, and the decline of their
Parliamentary hopes, did not realise that, in the overruling providence
of God, the devastating war among nations was to open a new era for
women.They were no longer to be held cheap, as irresponsibles--mere
clogs on the machinery of the State.They were to be called on to
take the place of men who were dying by the thousand for their homes,
fighting against the doctrine that military force is the only true
Government in a Christian world.After mobilisation, military authorities had to make provision for the
wounded.We can remember the early sensation of seeing buildings raised
for other purposes taken over for hospitals.Since the Crimea, women as
nurses at the base were institutions understood of all men.In the vast
camps which sprang up at the commencement of the war, women modestly
thought they might be usefully employed as cooks.The idea shocked the
War Office till it rocked to its foundations.A few adventurous women
started laundries for officers, and others for the men.They did it on
their own, and in peril of their beneficent soap suds, being ordered to
a region where they would be out of sight, and out of any seasonable
service, to the vermin-ridden camps.The Suffrage organisations, staffed and equipped with able practical
women Jacks of all trades, in their midst, put themselves at the call
of national service, but were headed back from all enterprises.It
had been ordained that women could not fight, and therefore they were
of no use in war time.A few persisted in trying to find openings for
service.It is one thing to offer to be
useful without any particular qualification; it is another to have
professional knowledge to give, and the medical women were strong in
the conviction that they had their hard-won science and skill to offer.Those who have read the preceding pages will realise that Dr.Inglis
carried into this offer a perfect knowledge how women doctors were
regarded by the community, and she knew political departments too well
to believe that the War Office would have a more enlightened outlook.In the past she had said in choosing her profession that she liked
‘pioneer work,’ and she was to be the pioneer woman doctor who, with
the aid of Suffrage societies, founded and led the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals to the healing of many races.Inglis to this point, it is easy
to imagine the working of her fertile brain, and her sense of vital
energy, in the opening weeks of the war.What material for instant
action she had at hand, she used.She had helped to form a detachment
of the V.A.D.when the idea of this once despised and now greatly
desired body began to take shape.Before the war men spoke slightingly
of its object, and it was much depreciated.Inglis saw all the
possibilities which lay in the voluntary aid offer.Inglis was in
Edinburgh at the commencement of the war, and the 6th Edinburgh V.A.D.,
of which she was commandant, was at once mobilised.For several weeks
she worked hard at their training.She gave up the principal rooms in
her house for a depot for the outfit of Cargilfield as an auxiliary
hospital.Inglis
put in charge of it, the wider work of her life might never have had
its fulfilment.Inglis from the first advocated that the V.A.D.should be used as probationers in military hospitals, and the orderlies
who served in her units were chiefly drawn from this body.In September she went to London to put her views before the National
Union and the War Office, and to offer the services of herself
and women colleagues.Miss Mair expresses the thoughts which were
dominating her mind.‘To her it seemed wicked that women with power
to wield the surgeon’s knife in the mitigation of suffering and with
knowledge to diagnose and cure, should be withheld from serving the
sick and wounded.’

Her love for the wounded and suffering gave her a clear vision as
to what lay before the armies of the Allies.‘At the root of all her
strenuous work of the last three years,’ says her sister, ‘was the
impelling force of her sympathy with the wounded men.This feeling
amounted at times to almost agony.Only once did she allow herself to
show this innermost feeling.This was at the root of her passionate
yearning to get with her unit to Mesopotamia during the early months
of 1916.“I cannot bear to think of them, _our Boys_.” To the woman’s
heart within her the wounded men of all nations made the same
irresistible appeal.’

In that spirit she approached a departmental chief.Official reserve at
last gave way, and the historic sentence was uttered--‘My good lady, go
home and sit still.’ In that utterance lay the germ of that inspiration
which was to carry the Red Cross and the Scottish women among many
nations, kindreds, and tongues.The overworked red-tape-bound
official: the little figure of the woman with the smile, and the ready
answer, before him.There is a story that, while a town in Serbia was
under bombardment, Dr.Inglis was also in it with some of her hospital
work.She sought an official in his quarters, as she desired certain
things for her hospital.The noise of the firing was loud, and shells
were flying around.Inglis seemed oblivious of any sound save her
own voice, and she requested of an under officer an interview with his
chief.The official had at last to confess that his superior was hiding
in the cellar till the calamity of shell-fire was overpast.In much
the same condition was the local War Office official when confronted
with Dr.No doubt she saw it was
useless to continue her offers of service.Fawcett says:

 ‘Nearly all the memorial notices of her have recorded the fact that at
 the beginning of her work in 1914 the War Office refused her official
 recognition.The recognition so stupidly refused by her own country
 was joyfully and gratefully given by the French and later the Serbian
 A.M.S.and Red Cross.’

She went home to her family, who so often had inspired her to good
work, and as she sat and talked over the war and her plans with one of
her nieces, she suddenly said, ‘I know what we will do!We will have a
unit of our own.’

The ‘We’ referred to that close-knit body of women with whom she had
worked for a common cause, and she knew at once that ‘We’ would work
with her and in her for the accomplishment of this ideal which so
rapidly took shape in her teeming brain.She was never left alone in any part of her life’s work.Her
personality knit not only her family to her in the closest bonds of
love, but she had devoted friends among those who did not see eye
to eye with her in the common cause.She never loved them the less
for disagreeing with her, and though their indifference to her views
might at times obscure her belief in their mental calibre, it never
interfered with the mutual affections of all.She did not leave these
friends out of her scheme when it began to take shape.The Edinburgh Suffrage offices, no longer needed for propaganda and
organisation work, became the headquarters of the Scottish Women’s
Hospitals, and the enlarged committee, chiefly of Dr.Inglis’ personal
friends, began its work under the steam-hammer of her energy.‘Well do I recall the first suggestion that passed between us on the
 subject of directing the energies of our Suffrage Societies to the
 starting of a hospital.Let us gather a few hundred pounds, and then
 appeal to the public, was the decision of our ever courageous Dr.Elsie, and from that moment she never swerved in her purpose.Some of
 us gasped when she announced that the sum of £50,000 must speedily
 be advertised for.Some timid souls advised the naming of a smaller
 amount as our goal.With unerring perception, our leader refused to
 lower the standard, and abundantly has she been proved right!Not
 £50,000, but over £200,000 have rewarded her faith and her hope.‘This quick perception was one of the greatest of her gifts, and it
 was with perfect simplicity she stated to me once that when on rare
 occasions she had yielded her own conviction to pressure from others,
 the result had been unfortunate.There was not an ounce of vanity in
 her composition.She saw the object aimed at, and she marched
 straight on.If, on the road, some obstacles had to be not exactly
 ruthlessly, but very firmly brushed aside, her strength of purpose
 was in the end a blessing to all concerned.Strength combined with
 sweetness--with a wholesome dash of humour thrown in--in my mind sums
 up her character.What that strength did for agonised Serbia only the
 grateful Serbs can fully tell.’

A letter written in October of this year to Mrs.Fawcett tells of the
rapid formation of the hospital idea.‘8 WALKER STREET,
      ‘_Oct.FAWCETT,--I wrote to you from the office this morning,
 but I want to point out a little more fully what the Committee felt
 about the name of the hospitals.We felt that our original scheme
 was growing very quickly into something very big--much bigger than
 anything we had thought of at the beginning--and we felt that if the
 hospitals were called by a non-committal name it would be much easier
 to get all men and women to help.The scheme is _of course_ a National
 Union scheme, and that fact the Scottish Federation will never lose
 sight of, or attempt to disguise.The National Union will be at the
 head of all our appeals, and press notices, and paper.‘But--if you could reverse the position, and imagine for a moment
 that the Anti-Suffrage Society had thought of organising all these
 skilled women for service, you can quite see that many more neutrals,
 and a great many suffragists would have been ready to help if they
 sent their subscriptions to the “Scottish Women’s Hospital for Foreign
 Service,” than if they had to send to the Anti-Suffrage League
 Hospital.‘We were convinced that the more women we could get to help, the
 greater would be the gain to the woman’s movement.‘For we have hit upon a really splendid scheme.Laurie and
 I went to see Sir George Beatson--the head of the Scottish Red Cross,
 in Glasgow--he said at once: “Our War Office will have nothing to say
 to you,” and then he added, “yet there is no knowing what they may do
 before the end of the war.”

 ‘You see, we get these expert women doctors, nurses, and ambulance
 workers organised.Once
 these units are out, the work is bound to grow.The need is there,
 and too terrible to allow any haggling about who does the work.If
 we have a thoroughly good organisation here, we can send out more
 and more units, or strengthen those already out.We can add motor
 ambulances, organise rest stations on the lines of communication, and
 so on.It will all depend on how well we are supplied with funds and
 brains at our base.Each unit ought to be carefully chosen, and the
 very best women doctors must go out with them.I wrote this morning to
 the Registered Medical Women’s Association in London, and asked them
 to help us, and offered to address a meeting when I come up for your
 meeting.Next week a special meeting of the Scottish Medical Women’s
 Association is being called to discuss the question.‘From the very beginning we must make it clear that our hospitals are
 as well-equipped and well-manned as any in the field, more economical
 (easy!‘I cannot think of anything more calculated to bring home to men the
 fact that women _can help_ intelligently in any kind of work.So much
 of our work is done where they cannot see it.They’ll see every bit of
 this.‘The fates seem to be fighting for us!Sometimes schemes do float off
 with the most extraordinary ease.The Belgian Consul here is Professor
 Sarolea--the editor of _Everyman_.He grasped at the help we offered,
 and has written off to several influential people.And then yesterday
 morning he wrote saying that his brother Dr.Leon Sarolea, would come
 and “work under” us.He is an M.P., a man of considerable influence.So you can see the Belgian Hospital will have everything in its favour.Seton Watson, who has devoted his life to the Balkan States,
 has taken up the Servian Unit.He puts himself “entirely at our
 service.” He knows all the powers that be in Servia.‘Two people in the Press have offered to help.It must not be wasted, but we must have
 lots.‘And as the work grows do let’s keep it _together_, so that, however
 many hospitals we send out, they all shall be run on the same lines,
 and wherever people see the Union Jack with the red, white and green
 flag below it, they’ll know it means efficiency and kindness and
 intelligence.‘I wanted the Executive, for this reason, to call the hospitals
 “British Women’s Hospitals for Foreign Service,” but of course it was
 their own idea, and one understood the desire to call it “Scottish”;
 but if there is a splendid response from England and from other
 federations, that will have to be reconsidered, _I_ think.The great
 thing is to do the thing well, and do it as _one_ scheme.‘I do hope you’ll approve of all this.I am marking this letter
 “Private,” because it isn’t an official letter, but just what I
 think--to you, my Chief.But you can show it to anybody you like--as
 that.‘I can think of nothing except these “Units” just now!And when one
 hears of the awful need, one can hardly sit still till they are ready.Professor Sarolea simply made one’s heart bleed.He said, “You talk of distress from the war here.You simply
 know nothing about it.”--Ever yours sincerely,

      ‘ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

In October 1914 the scheme was finally adopted by the Scottish
Federation, and the name of Scottish Women’s Hospitals was chosen.At the same meeting the committee decided to send Dr.Inglis to London
to explain the plan to the National Union, and to speak at a meeting
in the Kingsway Hall, on ‘What women could do to help in the war.’ At
that meeting she was authorised to speak on the plans of the S.W.H.The N.U.W.S.S.adopted the plan of campaign on 15th October, and the
London society was soon taking up the work of procuring money to start
new units, and to send Dr.Inglis out on her last enterprise, with a
unit fully equipped to work with the Serbian army, then fighting on the
Bulgarian front.The use she made of individuals is well illustrated by Miss Burke.She
was ‘found’ by Dr.Inglis in the office of the London Society, and sent
forth to speak and fill the Treasury chest of the S.W.H.It is written
in the records of that work how wonderfully Miss Burke influenced her
countrymen in America, and how nobly, through her efforts, they have
aided ‘the great adventure.’

      ‘U.S.M.S.Paul_,
      ‘_Saturday, February 9th_.‘DEAR LADY FRANCES,--Certainly I am one of Dr.It
 was largely due to her intuition and clear judgment of character that
 my feet were placed in the path which led to my reaching my maximum
 efficiency as a hospital worker and a member of the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals.Elsie after I had been the Secretary of the
 London Committee for about a month.There was no question of meeting a
 “stranger”; her kindly eyes smiled straight into mine.Well, the best way to encourage me was to
 give me responsibility.‘“Do you speak French?”

 ‘“Yes.”

 ‘“Very well, go and write me a letter to General de Torcy, telling him
 we accept the building he has offered at Troyes.”

 ‘Some one hazarded the suggestion that the letter should be passed on.‘“Nonsense,” replied Dr.Elsie, “I know the type.If she says she speaks French, she does.”

 ‘She practically signed the letter I wrote her without reading it.Doubtless all the time I was with her I was under her keen scrutiny,
 and when finally, after arranging a meeting for her at Oxford, which
 she found impossible to take, owing to her sudden decision to leave
 for Serbia, she had already judged me, and without hesitation she told
 me to go to Oxford and speak myself.I have wondered often whether any
 one else would have sent a young and unknown speaker--it needed Dr.Elsie’s knowledge of human character and rapid energetic method of
 making decisions.‘It would be difficult for we young ones of the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals to analyse our feelings towards Dr.A wave of her
 hand in passing meant much to us.’

Space utterly forbids our following the fortunes of the Scottish
Women’s Hospitals as they went forth one by one to France, to Belgium,
to Serbia, to Corsica, and Russia.That history will have some day to
be written.It is only possible in this memoir to speak of their work
in relation to their founder and leader.‘Not I, but my unit,’ was
her dying watchword, and when the work of her unit is reviewed, it is
obvious how they carried with them, as an oriflamme, the inspiration of
unselfish devotion set them by Dr.Besides going into all the detailed work of the hospital equipment, Dr.Inglis found time to continue her work of speaking for the cause of the
hospitals.We find her addressing her old friends:

 ‘I have the happiest recollection of Dr.I. addressing a small meeting
 of the W. L. Association here.It was one of her first meetings to
 raise money.She told us how she wanted to go to Serbia.She was so
 convincing, but with all my faith in her, I never thought she _would_
 get there!That, and much more she did--a lesson in faith.‘She looked round the little gathering in the Good Templar Hall and
 said, “I suppose nobody here could lend me a yacht?” She did get her
 ship there.’

To one of her workers in this time, she said, ‘My dear, we shall live
all our lives in the shadow of war.’ The one to whom she spoke says, ‘A
cold chill struck my heart.Did she feel it, and know that never again
would things be as they were?’

At the close of 1914 Dr.Inglis went to France to see the Scottish
Women’s Hospital established and working under the French Red Cross at
Royaumont.It was probably on her way back that she went to Paris on
business connected with Royaumont.She went into Notre Dame, and chose
a seat in a part of the cathedral where she could feel alone.She there
had an experience which she afterwards told to Mrs.As she
sat there she had a strong feeling that some one was behind her.She
resisted the impulse to turn round, thinking it was some one who like
herself wanted to be quiet!The feeling grew so strong at last, that
she involuntarily turned round.There was no one near her, but for the
first time she realised she was sitting in front of a statue of Joan of
Arc.To her it appeared as if the statue was instinct with life.She
added: ‘Wasn’t it curious?’ Then later she said, ‘I would like to know
what Joan was wanting to say to me!’ I often think of the natural way
which she told me of the experience, and the _practical_ conclusion
of wishing to know what Joan wanted.Once again she referred to the
incident, before going to Russia.I see her expression now, just for a
moment forgetting everything else, keen, concentrated, and her humorous
smile, as she said, ‘You know I would like awfully to know what Joan
was trying to say to me.’

Elsie Inglis was not the first, nor will she be the last woman who has
found help in the story of the Maid of Orleans, when the causes dear to
the hearts of nations are at stake.It is easy to hear the words that
would pass between these two leaders in the time of their country’s
warfare.The graven figure of Joan was instinct with life, from the
undying love of race and country, which flowed back to her from the
woman who was as ready to dedicate to her country her self-forgetting
devotion, as Jeanne d’Arc had been in her day.Both, in their day and
generation, had heard--

    ‘The quick alarming drum--
    Saying, Come,
    Freemen, come,
    Ere your heritage be wasted, said the quick alarming drum.’

      ‘ABBAYE DE ROYAUMONT,
      ‘_Dec.‘DEAREST AMY,--Many, many happy Christmases to you, dear, and to
 all the others.Everything is splendid here now, and if the General
 from headquarters would only come and inspect us, we could begin.I only wish you could see them with their
 red bedcovers, and little tables.There are four wards, and we have
 called them Blanche of Castille (the woman who really started the
 building of this place, the mother of Louis IX., the Founder, as he
 is called), Queen Margaret of Scotland, Joan of Arc, and Millicent
 Fawcett.Now, don’t you think that is rather nice!The Abbaye itself
 is a wonderful place.It has beautiful architecture, and is placed in
 delightful woods.One wants to spend hours exploring it, instead of
 which we have all been working like galley slaves getting the hospital
 in order.There are
 no thermometers and no sandbags.Yesterday,
 I was told there were no tooth-brushes and no nail-brushes, but they
 appeared.After all the fuss, you can imagine our feelings when the
 “Director,” an official of the French Red Cross, who has to live here
 with us, told us French soldiers don’t want tooth-brushes!‘Our first visitors were three French officers, whom we took for the
 inspecting general, and treated with grovelling deference, till we
 found they knew nothing about it, and were much more interested in the
 tapestry in the proprietor’s house than in our instruments.However,
 they were very nice, and said we were _bien meublé_.‘Once we had all been on tenterhooks all day about the inspection.Suddenly, a man poked his head round the door of the doctor’s
 sitting-room and said, “The General.” In one flash every doctor was
 out of the room and into her bedroom for her uniform coat, and I was
 left sitting.I got up, and wandered downstairs, when an excited
 orderly dashed past, singing, “Nothing but two British officers!”
 Another time we were routed out from breakfast by the cry of “The
 General,” but this time it turned out to be a French regiment, whose
 officers had been moved by curiosity to come round by here.‘We have had to get a new boiler in the kitchen, new taps and
 lavatories, and electric light, an absolute necessity in this huge
 place, and all the theatre sinks.We certainly are no longer a
 _mobile_ hospital, but as we are twelve miles from the point from
 which the wounded are distributed (I am getting very discreet about
 names since a telegram of mine was censored), we shall probably be as
 useful here as anywhere.They even think we may get English Tommies.‘You have no idea of the conditions to which the units came out, and
 they have behaved like perfect bricks.The place was like an ice hole:
 there were no fires, no hot water, no furniture, not even blankets,
 and the equipment did not arrive for five days.They have scrubbed the
 whole place out themselves, as if they were born housemaids; put up
 the beds, stuffed the mattresses, and done everything.They stick at absolutely nothing, and when Madame came,
 she said, “What it is to belong to a practical nation!”

 ‘We had a service in the ward on Sunday.We are going to see if they
 will let us use the little St.There are two other
 chapels, one in use, that we hope the soldiers will go to, and a
 beautiful chapel the same style of architecture as the chapel at Mont
 St.It is a perfect joy to walk through it to meals.The
 village curé has been to tea with us.‘Will you believe it, that General hasn’t arrived _yet_!--Your loving

      ELSIE.’

Mr.Seton Watson has permitted his article in the December number of
the _New Europe_ (1917) to be reprinted here.His complete knowledge
of Serbia enables him to describe both the work and Dr.Inglis who
undertook the great task set before her.‘Elsie Inglis was one of the heroic figures of the war, one whose
 memory her many friends will cherish with pride and confidence--pride
 at having been privileged to work with her, confidence in the race
 which breeds such women.This is not the place to tell the full story
 of her devotion to many a good cause at home, but the _New Europe_
 owes her a debt of special interest and affection.For in her own
 person she stood for that spirit of sympathy and comprehension upon
 which intercourse between the nations must be founded, if the ideal of
 a New Europe is ever to become a reality.‘Though her lifework had hitherto lain in utterly different fields,
 she saw in a flash the needs of a tragic situation; and when war came
 offered all her indomitable spirit and tireless energy to a cause
 till recently unknown and even frowned upon in our country.Like
 the Douglas of old, she flung herself where the battle raged most
 fiercely--always claiming and at last obtaining permission to set up
 her hospitals where the obstacles were greatest and the dangers most
 acute.But absorbed as she was in her noble task of healing, she saw
 beyond it the high national ideal that inspired the Serbs to endure
 sufferings unexampled even in this war, and became an enthusiastic
 convert to the cause of Southern Slav unity.To her, as to all true
 Europeans, the principle of nationality is not, indeed, the end of
 all human wisdom, but the sure foundation upon which a new and saner
 internationalism is to be built, and an inalienable right to which
 great and small alike are entitled.Perhaps the fact that she herself
 came of a small nation which, like Serbia, has known how to celebrate
 its defeats, was not without its share in determining her sympathies.‘The full political meaning of her work has not yet been brought home
 to her countrymen, and yet what she has done will live after her.Her
 achievement in Serbia itself in 1915 was sufficiently remarkable, but
 even that was a mere prelude to her achievement on the Eastern front.The Serbian Division in Southern Russia, which the Scottish Women’s
 Hospitals went out to help, was not Serbian at all in the _ordinary_
 sense of the word.Its proper name is the Jugoslav Division, for
 it was composed entirely of volunteers drawn from among the Serbs,
 Croats, and Slovenes of Austria-Hungary who had been taken prisoners
 by the Russian army.Thousands of these men enrolled themselves on the
 side of the Entente and in the service of Serbia, in order to fight
 for the realisation of Southern Slav independence and unity under the
 national dynasty of Kara George.Beyond the ordinary risks of war
 they acted in full knowledge that capture by the enemy would mean the
 same fate as Austria meted out to the heroic Italian deputy, Cesare
 Battisti; and some of them, left wounded on the battle-field after
 a retreat, shot each other to avoid being taken alive.Throughout
 the Dobrudja campaign they fought with the most desperate gallantry
 against impossible odds, and, owing to inadequate support during the
 retreat, their main body was reduced from 15,000 to 4000.Latterly the
 other divisions had been withdrawn to recruit at Odessa, after sharing
 the defence of the Rumanian southern front.‘To these men in the summer of 1916 Serbia had sent a certain number
 of higher officers, but, for equipment and medical help, they were
 dependent upon what the Russians could spare from their own almost
 unlimited needs.Inglis and her unit came to the
 help of the Jugoslavs, shared their privations and misfortunes, and
 spared no effort in their cause.‘History will record the name of Elsie Inglis, like that of Lady
 Paget, as pre-eminent among that band of women who have redeemed for
 all time the honour of Britain in the Balkans.Among the Serbs it is
 already assuming an almost legendary quality.To us it will serve to
 remind us that Florence Nightingale will never be without successors
 among us.And in particular, every true Scotsman will cherish her
 memory, every believer in the cause for which she gave her life will
 gain fresh courage from her example.R. W. SETON-WATSON.CHAPTER IX

SERBIA

    ‘Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
    waters, from the hand of strange children.’

    ‘And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.For in those
    days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the
    creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.’

    ‘On either side of the river, was there the tree of life: And the
    leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.’


Dr.Inglis remained at home directing the many operations necessary
to ensure the proper equipment of the units, and the difficult task of
getting them conveyed overseas.From the beginning, till her return
with her unit serving with the Serbian army in Russia, she had the
sustaining co-operation both of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office.In the many complications surrounding the history of the hospitals
with the Allied armies, the Scottish women owed very much to both
Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, and very particularly to Lord
Robert Cecil in his department of the Foreign Office.It was not easy to get the scheme of hospitals staffed entirely by
women, serving abroad with armies fighting the common and unscrupulous
foe, accepted by those in authority.The Foreign Office was responsible
for the safety of these British outpost hospitals, and they knew well
the dangers and privations to which the devoted pioneer band of women
would be exposed.Inglis, which
she accepted, and abided by as long as her work was not hindered.No
care or diplomatic work was spared, and if at the end of their service
in Russia the safety of the unit was a matter of grave anxiety to
the Foreign Office, it had never cause to be ashamed of the way this
country’s honour and good faith was upheld by the hospitals under the
British flag, amid the chaotic sufferings of the Russian people.Eleanor Soltau, who was in charge of the
First Serbian Unit, became ill with diphtheria in the midst of the
typhus epidemic which was devastating the Serbian people.The Serbian
Minister writes of that time:--

 ‘They were the first to go to the help of Serbia when the Austrians,
 after they were defeated, besides 60,000 prisoners, also left behind
 them epidemics in all the districts which they had invaded.The
 Scottish women turned up their sleeves, so to speak, at the railways
 station itself, and went straight to typhus and typhoid-stricken
 patients, who were pitifully dying in the crowded hospitals.’

Colonel Hunter, A.M.S., wrote after her death: ‘It was my privilege
and happiness to see much of her work in Serbia when I was officer in
charge of the corps of R.A.M.C.officers sent out by the W.O.to deal
with the raging epidemic of typhus and famine fevers then devastating
the land.I have never met with any one who gave me so deep an
impression of singlemindedness, gentleheartedness, clear and purposeful
vision, wise judgment, and absolutely fearless disposition.... No more
lovable personality than hers, or more devoted and courageous body of
women, ever set out to help effectively a people in dire distress than
the S.W.H.,’ which she organised and sent out, and afterwards took
personal charge of in Serbia in 1915.Amidst the most trying conditions
she, or they, never faltered in courage or endurance.Under her wise
and gentle leadership difficulties seemed only to stir to further
endeavour, more extended work, and greater endurance of hardship.Captain Ralph Glyn writes from France:--

 ‘I see you went to the funeral of that wonderful person, Dr.I shall never forget arriving where that S.W.unit was in the
 midst of the typhus in Serbia, and finding her and all her people so
 “clean” and obviously ready for anything.’

The Serbian nation lost no time in commemorating her services to them.At Mladenovatz they built a beautiful fountain close to the camp
hospital.On 7th October 1915 it was formally opened with a religious
service according to the rites of the Greek Church.Inglis turned
on the water, which was to flow through the coming years in grateful
memory of the good work done by the Scottish Women’s Hospitals.ELSIE INGLIS

 (Obiit Nov.At Mladenovatz still the fountain sings
      Raised by the Serbs to you their angel friend,
      Who fought the hunger-typhus to its end;
    A nobler fountain from your memory springs,
    A fountain-head where Faith renews its wings
      --Faith in the powers of womanhood to bend
      War’s curse to blessing, and to make amend
    By Love, for Hate’s unutterable things.Wherefore, when cannon-voices cease to roar,
      A louder voice shall echo in our ears
        --Voice of three peoples joined in one accord,
    Telling that, gentle to your brave heart’s core,
      You faced unwavering all that woman fears,
        And clear of vision followed Christ the Lord.[NOTE.--Two years ago the Serbians dedicated a simple fountain in
 ‘Mladenovatz’ to the grateful memory of one they spoke of as ‘the
 angel of their people.’ The Rumanian and Russian refugees in the
 Dobrudja will never forget her.]_The Englishwoman_, April and June 1916, has two articles written by
Dr.Inglis, under the title ‘The Tragedy of Serbia.’ The literary power
of her narrative makes one regret that she did not live to give a
consecutive account of all she passed through in the countries in which
she suffered with the peoples:--

 ‘When we reached Serbia in May 1915, she was lying in sunshine.Two
 storms had raged over her during the preceding months--the Austrian
 invasion and the terrific typhus epidemic.In our safe little island
 we can hardly realise what either meant.At the end of 1914, the
 Austrian Empire hurled its “punitive expedition” across the Danube--a
 punitive expedition that ended in the condign punishment of the
 invader.They left behind them a worse foe than themselves, and the
 typhus, which began in the hospitals they left so scandalously filthy
 and overcrowded, swept over the land.’

Dr.Inglis describes ‘the long peaceful summer,’ with its hopes of
an advance to their aid on the part of the Allies.The Serbs were
conscious the ‘Great Powers’ owed them much, for how often we heard the
words, ‘We are the only one, as yet, who has beaten our enemy.’

‘Not till September did any real sense of danger trouble them.Then the
clouds rolled up black and threatening on the horizon--Bulgaria arming,
and a hundred thousand Germans massing on the northern frontier.They
began to draw off the main part of their army from the Danube towards
the east, to meet their old enemies.The Powers refused to let them
attack, and they waited till the Bulgarian mobilisation was complete.The Allies discounted the attack from the north; aeroplanes had been
out, and “there are no Germans there.” There are no signs whatever of
any military movements, so said the wiseacres.The only troops there
are untrained Austrian levies, which the Serbs ought to be able to deal
with themselves, if they are up to their form last year.The 100,000 Germans appeared on the northern
frontier.The Bulgars invaded from the east, the Greeks did not come
in, and the Austrians poured in from the west.The Serbian army
shortened the enormous line they had to defend, but they could not
stand against the long-distance German guns, and so began the retreat.‘“What is coming to Serbia?” said a Serb to me, “we cannot think.”
And then, hopefully, “But God is great and powerful, and our Allies
are great and powerful too.” Strong men could hardly speak of the
disaster without breaking down.“When
are your men coming up?They must come soon.” “We must give our people
two months,” the experts among us answered, “to bring up the heavy
artillery.We thought the Serbs would be able to hold the West Morava
Valley.” “It is too hilly for the German artillery to be of any use,”
they said.’

Dr.Inglis goes on to relate how all the calculations were wrong, how
the Austrian force came down that very valley.The Serbs were caught
in a trap, and that 160,000 of their gallant little army escaped was
a wonderful feat.‘That they are already keen to take the field again
is but one more proof of the extraordinary recuperative power of the
nation.’

Dr.Elsie gives an account of the typhus epidemic.Soltau, in 1914, was able at Kragujevatz to do excellent
work for the Serbian army after its victories, and it was only
evacuated owing to the retreat in October 1915.The unit had only
been a fortnight out when the committee got from it a telegram, ‘dire
necessity’ for more doctors and nurses.The word _dire_ was used,
hoping it would pass unnoticed by the censor, for the authorities did
not wish the state of Serbia from typhus to be generally known.We
shall never know what the death-rate was during the epidemic; but of
the 425 Serbian doctors, 125 died of the disease, and two-thirds of the
remainder had it.The Scottish Committee hastened out supplies and staff.‘For three months the epidemic raged, and all women may ever be proud
 of the way those women worked.It was like a long-drawn-out battle,
 and not one of them played the coward.Not one of them asked to come
 away.There were three deaths and nine cases of illness among the
 unit; and may we not truly claim that those three women who died gave
 their lives for the great cause for which our country stands to-day as
 much as any man in the trenches.’

Dr.Inglis speaks of the full share of work taken by other British
units--Lady Paget’s Hospital at Skopio, ‘magnificently organised’; The
Red Cross under Dr.Banks ‘took more than its share of the burden’; and
how Dr.Ryan of the American hospital asserted that Serbia would have
been wiped out but for the work of the Foreign Missions.Miss Holme tells of some of her experiences with her leader:--

      ‘KRAGUJEVATZ.Elsie Inglis took me out shopping with her, and we
 wanted a great many things for our hospital in the way of drugs, etc.,
 and we also wanted more than anything else some medical scales for
 weighing drugs.Inglis saw hanging up
 in it three pairs of these scales.So she asked the man, in her most
 persuasive manner, if he would sell her a pair of these scales for our
 hospital use.He explained at length that he used all the scales, and
 was sorry that he could not possibly sell them.Inglis bought
 some more things--in fact, we stayed in the shop for about an hour
 buying things to the amount of £10, and between each of the different
 articles purchased, she would again revert to the scales and say,
 “You know it is for _your_ men that we want them,” until at last the
 man--exhausted by his refusals--took down the scales and presented
 them to her.When she asked “How much are they?” he made a bow, and
 said it would be a pleasure to give them to her.‘When we were taken prisoners, and had been so for some time, and
 before we were liberated, the German Command came bringing a paper
 which they commanded Dr.The purport of the paper was
 a statement which declared that the British prisoners had been well
 treated in the hands of the Germans, and was already signed by two men
 who were heads of other British units.Inglis said, “Why should
 I sign this paper?I do not know if all the prisoners are being well
 treated by you, therefore I decline to sign it.” To which the German
 authorities replied, “You must sign it.” Dr.Inglis then said, “Well,
 make me,” and that was the end of that incident--she never did sign it.‘So convinced were some of the people belonging to the Scottish
 Women’s unit that the British forces were coming to the aid of their
 Serbian ally, that long after they were taken prisoners they thought,
 each time they heard a gun from a different quarter, that their
 liberators were close at hand.So much so indeed, that three of the
 members of the unit begged that in the event of the unit being sent
 home they might be allowed to stay behind in Serbia with the Serbs,
 to help the Serbian Red Cross.Inglis _unofficially_ consented to
 this, and with the help of the Serbian Red Cross these three people in
 question adjourned to a village hard by which was about a mile from
 the hospital, three days before the unit had orders to move.Inglis and three other people of the unit knew where these
 three members were living.However, the date of the departure was
 changed, and the unit was told they were to wait another twenty days.This made it impossible for these three people to appear again with
 the unit.They continued to live at the little house which sheltered
 them.Suddenly one afternoon one of the members of the unit went to
 ask at the German Command if there were any letters for the unit.At
 this interview, which took place about three o’clock in the afternoon,
 the person was informed that the whole unit was to leave that night
 at 7.30.Inglis sent the person who received this command to tell
 the three people in the cottage to get ready, and that they must go,
 she thought.But the messenger only said, “We have had orders that the
 unit is to go at 7.30 to-night,” but did not say that Dr.Inglis had
 sent an order for the three people to get ready, so they did nothing
 but simply went to bed at ten o’clock, thinking the unit had already
 started.It was a wintry night, snowing heavily, and not a night that
 one would have sent out a dog!‘At about half-past ten a knock came to the window, and Dr.Inglis’
 voice was heard saying, “You have to come at once to the train.I
 am here with an armed guard!” (All the rest of the unit had been at
 the station for some hours, but the train was not allowed to start
 until every one was there.)It was
 difficult to get her to enter the house, and naturally she seemed
 rather ruffled, having had to come more than a mile in the deep snow,
 as she was the only person who knew anything about us.One of the
 party said, “Are you really cross, or are you pretending because the
 armed guard understands English?” She gave her queer little smile, and
 said, “No, I am not pretending.” The whole party tramped through the
 snow to the station, and on the way she told them she was afraid that
 she had smashed somebody’s window, having knocked at another cottage
 before she found ours in the dark, thinking it was the one we lived
 in, for which she was very much chaffed by her companions, who knew
 well her views on the question of militant tactics!‘The first stages of this journey were made in horse-boxes with no
 accommodation whatsoever.Occasionally the train drew up in the middle
 of the country, and anybody who wished to get out had simply to ask
 the sentry who guarded the door, to allow them to get out for a moment.‘The next night was spent lying on the floor of the station at
 Belgrade, the eight sentries and all their charges all lying on the
 floor together; the only person who seemed to be awake was the officer
 who guarded the door himself all night.In the morning one was not
 allowed to go even to wash one’s hands without a sentry to come and
 stand at the door.The next two days were spent in an ordinary train
 rather too well heated with four a side in second-class compartments.At Vienna all the British units who were being sent away were formed
 into a group on the station at 6 A.M., where they awaited the arrival
 of the American Consul, guarded all the time by their sentries, who
 gave his parole that if the people were allowed to go out of the
 station they would return at eight o’clock, the time they had to leave
 that town.Inglis with a party adjourned to a
 hotel where baths, etc., were provided.Other members were allowed to
 do what they liked.‘The unit was detained for eight days at Bludenz, close to the
 frontier, for Switzerland.On their arrival at Zürich they were met
 by the British Consul-General, Vice-Consul, and many members of the
 British Colony, who gave Dr.Inglis and her unit a very warm-hearted
 welcome, bringing quantities of flowers, and doing all they could to
 show them kindness and pleasure at their safe arrival.‘It is difficult for people who have never been prisoners to know what
 the first day’s freedom means.Everybody had a different expression,
 and seemed to have a different outlook on life.But already we could
 see our leader was engrossed with plans and busy with schemes for the
 future work of the unit.‘The next day the Consul-General made a speech in which he told the
 unit all that had passed during the last four months, of which they
 knew nothing.’

_To her Sister._

      ‘BRINDISI, _en route_ for SERBIA,
      ‘_April 28, 1915_.‘The boat ought to have left last night, but it did not even come in
 till this morning.However, we have only lost twenty-four hours.‘It has been a most luxurious journey, except the bit from Naples
 here, and that was rather awful, with spitting men and shut windows,
 in first-class carriages, remember.When we got here we immediately
 ordered baths, but “the boiler was broken.” So, I said, “Well, then,
 we must go somewhere else”--with the result that we were promised
 baths in our rooms at once.That was a nice bath, and then I curled
 up on the sofa and went to sleep.Our windows look right on to the
 docks, and the blue Mediterranean beyond.It is so queer to see the
 red, white, and green flags, and to think they mean Italy, and not the
 N.U.W.S.S.!‘I went out before dinner last night, and strolled through the quaint
 streets.The whole population was out, and most whole-hearted and
 openly interested in my uniform.‘This is a most delightful window, with all the ships and the colours.There are three men-of-war in, and half a dozen of the quaintest
 little boats, which a soldier told me were “scouts.” I wished I had
 asked a sailor, for I had never heard of “scouts.” The soldier I asked
 is one of the bersaglieri with cock’s feathers, a huge mass of them,
 in his hat.They all say Italy is certainly coming into the war.One
 man on the train to Rome was coming from Cardiff to sell coal to the
 Italian Government.He told us weird stories about German tricks to
 get our coal through Spain and other countries.‘It was a pleasure seeing Royaumont.It is a _huge_ success, and I do
 think Dr.The wards and the theatre,
 and the X-Ray department, and the rooms for mending and cleaning the
 men’s clothes were all perfect.’

_To Mrs.Simson._

      ‘S.W.H., KRAGUJEVATZ,
      _May 30/15_.‘Well, this is a perfectly lovely place, and the Serbians are
 delightful.I am staying with a charming woman, Madame Milanovitz.She
 is a Vice-President of the Serbian Women’s League, formed to help the
 country in time of war.I think she wanted to help us because of all
 the hospital has done here.Any how, _I_ score--I have a beautiful
 room and everything.She gives me an early cup of coffee, and for the
 rest I live with the unit.Neither she nor I can speak six words of
 one another’s languages, but her husband can talk a little French.Now, she has asked the little Serbian lady who teaches the unit
 Serbian, to live with her to interpret.‘We have had a busy time since we arrived.The unit is nursing 550
 beds, in three hospitals, having been sent out to nurse 300 beds.There is first the surgical hospital, called Reserve No.It was a
 school, and is in two blocks with a long courtyard between.I think
 we have got it really quite well equipped, with a fine X-Ray room.The theatre, and the room opposite where the dressings are done, both
 very well arranged, and a great credit to Sister Bozket.The one thing
 that troubled me was the floor--old wood and holes in it, impossible
 to sterilise--but yesterday, Major Protitch, our Director, said he was
 going to get cement laid down in it and the theatre.Chesney, “This is the best surgical hospital
 in Serbia.” You must not believe that _quite_, for they are very good
 at saying pleasant things here!‘There are two other hospitals, the typhus one, No.6 Reserve, and
 one for relapsing fever and general diseases, No.We have put most of our strength in No.6, and it is in
 good working order, but No.7 has had only one doctor, and two day
 Sisters and one night, for over 200 beds.Still it is wonderful what
 those three women have done.We have Austrian prisoners as orderlies
 everywhere, in the hospitals and in the houses.The conglomeration of
 languages is too funny for words--Serbian, German, French, English.Sometimes, you have to get an orderly to translate Serbian into
 German, and another to translate the German into French before you can
 get at what is wanted.Two words we have all learnt, _dotra_, which
 means “good,” and which these grateful people use at once if they
 feel a little better, or are pleased about anything, and the other is
 _boli_, pain--poor men!‘So much for what we _have_ been doing; but the day before
 yesterday we got our orders for a new bit of work.They are forming a
 disinfecting centre at Mladanovatz, and Colonel Grustitch, who is the
 head of the Medical Service here, wants us to go up there at once,
 with our whole fever staff, under canvas.They are giving us the tents
 till ours come out.Typhus is decreasing so much, that No.6 is to be
 turned into a surgical hospital, and there will be only one infectious
 diseases hospital here.I am so pleased at being asked to do this,
 for it is part of a big and well thought out scheme.Alice Hutchison goes to Posheravatz also
 for infectious diseases.I hope she is at Salonika to-day.We really began to think the Governor was going to
 keep her altogether!Her equipment has all come, and yesterday I sent
 Mrs.Smith up to Posheravatz to choose the site and
 pitch the tent.‘They gave me an awfully exciting bit of news in Colonel G.’s office
 yesterday, and that was that five motor cars were in Serbia, north of
 Mladanovatz, for _me_.Of course, I had wired for six, but you have
 been prompt about them.How they got into the north of Serbia I cannot
 imagine, unless they were dropped out of aeroplanes.‘Really, it is wonderful the work this unit has done in the most awful
 stress all through March and April.We ought to be awfully proud of
 them.Soltau a decoration, and Patsy
 Hunter had two medals._To her Niece, Amy M‘Laren._

      ‘VALJEVO, _August 16, 1915_.‘DARLING AMY,--I wonder if you could find this place on the map.I have spelt it properly, but if you want to say it you must say
 _Valuvo_.One of the hospitals mother has been collecting so much
 money for is here.It is in tents,
 on a bit of sloping ground looking south.There are big tents for
 the patients, and little tents for the staff.I pull my bed out
 of the tent every night, and sleep outside under the stars.Such
 lovely starlight nights we have here.Alice Hutchison is head of
 this unit, and I am here on a visit to her.My own hospital is in
 a town--Kragujevatz.Now, I wonder if you can find that place?The
 hospital there is in a girls’ school.Now--I wonder what will happen
 to the lessons of all those little girls as long as the war lasts?Serbia has been at war for three years, four wars in three years, and
 the women of the country have kept the agriculture of the country
 going all that time.A Serbian officer told me the other day that
 the country is so grateful to them, that they are going to strike a
 special medal for the women to show their thanks, when this war is
 over.This is such a beautiful country, and such nice people.Some day
 when the war is over, we’ll come here, and have a holiday.How are you
 getting on, my precious?God bless you,
 dear little girlie.--Ever your loving Aunt

      ELSIE.’

As the fever died out, a worse enemy came in.Serbia was overrun by
the Austro-German forces, and she, with others of her units, was taken
prisoner, as they had decided it was their duty to remain at their work
among the sick and wounded.Again the Serbian Minister is quoted:--

 ‘When the typhus calamity was overcome, the Scottish women reorganised
 themselves as tent hospitals and offered to go as near as possible
 to the army at the front.Their camp in the town of Valjevo--which
 suffered most of all from the Austrian invasion--might have stood
 in the middle of England.In Lazarevatz, shortly before the new
 Austro-German offensive, they formed a surgical hospital almost out
 of nothing, in the devastated shops and the village inns, and they
 accomplished the nursing of hundreds of wounded who poured in from
 the battle-field.When it became obvious that the Serbian army could
 not resist the combined Austrians, Germans, Magyars, and Bulgarians,
 who were about four times their numbers, the main care of the Serbian
 military authorities was what to do with the hospitals full of
 wounded, and whom to leave with the wounded soldiers, who refused to
 be left to fall into the hands of the cruel enemy.Then the Scottish
 women declared that they were not going to leave their patients, and
 that they would stay with them, whatever the conditions, and whatever
 might be expected from the enemy.They remained with the Serbian
 wounded as long as they could be of use to them.Simson._

      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We are in the very centre of the storm, and it just feels exactly
 like having the rain pouring down, and the wind beating in gusts, and
 not being able to see for the water in one’s eyes, and just holding on
 and saying, “It cannot last, it is so bad.” These poor little people,
 you cannot imagine anything more miserable than they are.Remember,
 they have been fighting for years for their independence, and now it
 all seems to end.Germans, Austrians,
 Bulgars, and all that is left is this western Morava Valley, and
 the country a little south of it.And their big Allies--from here
 it looks as if they are never going to move.I went into Craijuvo
 yesterday, in the car, to see about Dr.The road
 was crowded with refugees pouring away, all their goods piled on
 their rickety ox-wagons, little children on the top, and then bands
 of soldiers, stragglers from the army.These men were forming up
 again, as we passed back later on.We decided we must stand by our hospitals; it was too awful
 leaving badly wounded men with no proper care.Sir Ralph eventually
 agreed, and we gave everybody in the units the choice of going or
 staying.We have about 115 people in the Scottish unit, and twenty
 have gone.Smith brings up the rear-guard to-day, with one or two
 laggards and a wounded English soldier we have had charge of.MacGregor has trekked for Novi Bazaar.It is
 the starting-place for Montenegro.We all managed wonderfully in our
 first “evacuations,” and saved practically everything, but now it is
 hopeless.The bridges are down, and the trucks standing anyhow on
 sidings, and, worst of all, the people have begun looting.There’ll be famine, as well as cold, in this corner of the
 world soon, and then the distant prospect of 150,000 British troops at
 Salonika won’t help much.‘The beloved British troops,--the thought of them always cheers.But
 not the thought of the idiots at the top who had not enough gumption
 to _know_ this must happen.Anybody, even us women, could have told
 them that the Germans must try and break through to the help of the
 Turks.‘We have got a nice building here for a hospital, and Dr.Holloway
 is helping in the military hospital.I believe there are about 1000
 wounded in the place.I can’t write a very interesting letter, Amy
 dear, because at the bottom of my heart I don’t believe it will ever
 reach you.I don’t see them managing the Montenegrin passes at this
 time of year!There is a persistent rumour that the French have
 retaken Skopiro, and if that is true perhaps the Salonika route will
 be open soon.‘Some day, I’ll tell you all the exciting things that have been
 happening, and all the funny things too!For there have been funny
 things, in the middle of all the sadness.The guns are booming away,
 and the country looking so lovely in the sunlight.I wonder if Serbia
 is a particularly beautiful country, or whether it looks so lovely
 because of the tragedy of this war, just as bed seems particularly
 delightful when the night bell goes!’

      ‘SERBIAN MILITARY HOSPITAL,
      ‘KRUSHIEEVATZ, _Nov.‘We have been here about a month.Mary went back to the kitchen.It was dreadfully sad work leaving
 our beautiful little hospital at Krushieevatz.Here, we are working in
 the Serbian military hospital, and living in it also.You can imagine
 that we have plenty to do, when you hear we have 900 wounded.The
 prisoners are brought in every day, sometimes thousands, and go on to
 the north, leaving the sick.The Director has put the sanitation and
 the laundry into our hands also.‘We have had a hard frost for four days now, and snowstorms.My
 warm things did not arrive--I suppose they are safe at Salonika.Fortunately last year’s uniform was still in existence, and I wear
 three pairs of stockings, with my high boots.We have all cut our
 skirts short, for Serbian mud is awful.It is a lovely land, and the
 views round here are very cheering.One sunset I shall never forget--a
 glorious sky, and the hills deep blue against it.In the foreground
 the camp fires, and the prisoners round them in the fading light.’

With the invasion came the question of evacuation.At one time it was
possible the whole of the British unit might escape _via_ Montenegro.Sir Ralph Paget, realising that the equipment could not be saved,
allowed any of the hospital unit who wished to remain with their
wounded.Two parties went with the retreating Serbs, and their story
and the extraordinary hardships they endured has been told elsewhere.Those left at Krushieevatz were in Dr.Inglis’ opinion the fortunate
units.For three months they tended the Serbian wounded under foreign
occupation.Inglis kept to their work, and when
necessary confronted the Austro-German officers with all the audacity
of their leader and the Scottish thistle combined.When we went up
there were 900 patients.During the greatest part of the pressure the
number rose to 1200.Patients were placed in the corridors--at first
one man to one bed, but later two beds together, and three men in them.Then there were no more bedsteads, and mattresses were placed on the
floor.The magazine in full blast was a
sight, once seen, never to be forgotten.There were three tiers,
the slightly wounded men in the highest tier.Inglis says the time to see the place at its
best or its worst was in the gloaming, when two or three feeble oil
lamps illuminated the gloom, and the tin bowls clattered and rattled as
the evening ration of beans was given out, and the men swarmed up and
down the poles of their shelves chattering as Serbs will chatter.The
Sisters called the place ‘the Zoo.’

The dread of the renewal of the typhus scourge, amid such conditions
of overcrowding, underfeeding, fatigue and depression, was great.Inglis details the appalling tasks the unit undertook in sanitation.There was no expert amongst them:--

 ‘When we arrived, the hospital compound was a truly terrible
 place--the sights and smells beyond description.We dug the rubbish
 into the ground, emptied the overflowing cesspool, built incinerators,
 and cleaned, and cleaned, and cleaned.That is an Englishman’s job all
 over the world.Our three untrained English girl orderlies took to it
 like ducks to water.It was not the pleasantest or easiest work in the
 world; but they did it, and did it magnificently.‘Laundry and bathing arrangements were installed and kept going.We
 had not a single case of typhus; we had a greater achievement than
 its prevention.Late of an evening, when men among the prisoners were
 put into the wards, straight from the march, unwashed and crawling
 with lice, there was great indignation among the patients already in.“Doktoritza,” they said, “if you put these dirty men in among us we
 shall all get typhus.” Our hearts rejoiced.If we have done nothing
 else, we thought, we have driven that fact home to the Serbian mind
 that dirt and typhus go together.’

Dr.Inglis describes the misery of the Serbian prisoners:--

 ‘They had seen men go out to battle, conscious of the good work they
 had done for the Allies in driving back the Austrians in their first
 punitive expedition.We are the only ones who, so far, have beaten
 our enemy.They came back to us broken and dispirited.They were
 turned into the hospital grounds, with a scanty ration of beans, with
 a little meat and half a loaf of bread for twenty-four hours.Their
 camp fires flickered fitfully through the long bitter cold nights.Every scrap of wood was torn up, the foot bridges over the drains, and
 the trees hacked down for firewood.We added to the rations of our
 sanitary workers, we gave away all the bread we could, but we could
 not feed that enclosure of hungry men.We used to hear them coughing
 and moaning all night.’

Dr.Inglis details the starving condition of the whole country, the
weakness of the famine-stricken men who worked for them, the starved
yoke oxen, and all the manifold miseries of a country overrun by the
enemy.‘There was,’ she says, ‘a curious exhilaration in working for those
 grateful patient men, and in helping the director, Major Nicolitch, so
 loyal to his country and so conscientious in his work, to bring order
 out of chaos, and yet the unhappiness in the Serbian houses, and the
 physical wretchedness of those cold hungry prisoners lay always like
 a dead weight on our spirit.Never shall we forget the beauty of the
 sunrises, or the glory of the sunsets, with clear, cold sunlit days
 between, and the wonderful starlit nights.But we shall never forget
 “the Zoo” either, or the groans outside the windows when we hid our
 heads under the blankets to shut out the sound.The unit got no news,
 and they made it a point of honour to believe nothing said in the
 German telegrams.We could not believe Serbia had been sacrificed for
 nothing.We were convinced it was some deep laid scheme for weakening
 other fronts, and so it was natural to believe rumours, such as that
 the English had taken Belgium, and the French were in Metz.‘The end of the five months of service in captivity, and to captive
 Serbs ended.On the 11th February 1916, they were sent north under an
 Austrian guard with fixed bayonets, thus to Vienna, and so by slow
 stages they came to Zürich.‘It was a great thing to be once more “home” and to realise how strong
 and straight and fearless a people inhabit these islands: to realise
 not so much that they mean to win the war, but rather that they
 consider any other issue impossible.’

So Dr.Inglis came back to plan new campaigns for the help of the
Serbian people, who lay night and day upon her heart.She knew she had
the backing of the Suffrage societies, and she intended to get the
ear of the English public for the cause of the Allies in the Balkans.‘We,’ who had sent her out, found her changed in many ways.Physically
she had altered much, and if we could ever have thought of the body
in the presence of that dauntless spirit, we might have seen that the
Angel of Shadows was not far away.The privations and sufferings she
described so well when she had to speak of her beloved Serbs had been
fully shared by the unit.Their comfort was always her thought; she
never would have anything that could not be shared and shared alike,
but there was little but hardship to share, and one and all scorned to
speak of privations which were a light affliction compared to those
of a whole nation groaning and waiting to be redeemed from its great
tribulation.There was a look in her face of one whose spirit had been pierced by
the sword.The brightness of her eyes was dimmed, for she had seen the
days when His judgments were abroad upon the earth:--

    ‘Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
    He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are
        stored;
    He has loosed the fatal lightning of His terrible swift sword:
    I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
    They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
    I have read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.’

She could never forget the tragedy of Serbia, and she came home, not
to rest, but vowed to yet greater endeavours for their welfare.The
attitude of the Allies she did not pretend to understand.She had
something of the spirit of Oliver Cromwell, when he threatened to
send his fleet across the Alps to help the Waldensians.In her public
speeches, when she set forth what in her outlook could have been done,
no censor cut out the sentences which were touched by the live coals
from off her altar of service.Elsie never recognised the word
‘impossible’ for herself, and for her work that was well.As to her
political and military outlook, the story of the nations will find it a
place in the history of the war.For a few months she worked from the bases of her two loyal
Committees in London and Edinburgh.She spoke at many a public meeting,
and filled many a drawing-room.The Church of Scotland knew her
presence in London.‘One of our most treasured memories will be that
keen, clever face of hers in St.Columba’s of a Sunday--with the far,
wistful melancholy in it, added to its firm determination.’ So writes
the minister.‘We’ knew what lay behind the wistful brave eyes, a yet
more complete dedication to the service of her Serbian brethren.CHAPTER X

RUSSIA

1917

    ‘Even so in our mortal journey,
      The bitter north winds blow,
    And thus upon life’s red river,
      Our hearts as oarsmen row.And when the Angel of Shadow
      Rests his feet on wave and shore,
    And our eyes grow dim with watching,
      And our hearts faint at the oar,

    Happy is he who heareth
      The signal of his release
    In the bells of the holy city
      The chimes of eternal peace.’


Dr.Inglis’ return to England was the signal for renewed efforts
on the part of the Committees managing the S.W.H.This memoir has
necessarily to follow the personality of the leader, but it must never
be forgotten that her strength and all her sinews of war lay in the
work of those who carried on at home, week by week.Strong committees
of women, ably organised and thoroughly staffed, took over the burden
of finance--a matter Dr.Inglis once amusingly said, ‘did not interest
her.’ They found and selected the _personnel_ on which success so much
depended, they contracted for and supervised the sending out of immense
consignments of equipment and motor transport.They dealt with the
Government department, and in loyal devotion smoothed every possible
obstacle out of the path of those flying squadrons, the units of the
S.W.H.It was inevitable the quick brain and tenacious energy of Dr.Inglis,
far away from the base of her operations, should at times have found
it hard to understand why the wheels occasionally seemed to drag, and
the new effort she desired to make did not move at the pace which to
her eager spirit seemed possible.Two enterprises filled her mind on
her return in 1916.One, by the help of the London Committee, she put
through.This was the celebration of Kossovo Day in Great Britain.The flag-day of the Serbian Patriot King was under her chairmanship
prepared for in six weeks.Hundreds of lectures on the history of
Serbia were arranged for and delivered throughout the country, and no
one failed to do her work, however remote they might think the prospect
of making the British people interested in a country and patriot so far
from the ken of their island isolation.Kossovo Day was a success, and through the rush of the work Dr.Inglis
was planning the last and most arduous of all the undertakings of the
S.W.H., that of the unit which was to serve with the Serbian Volunteers
on the Rumanian Russian front.Inglis knew from private sources the
lack of hospital arrangements in Mesopotamia, and she, with the backing
of the Committees, had approached the authorities for leave to take a
fully equipped unit to Basra.When the story of the Scottish Women’s
Hospital is written, the correspondence between the War Office, the
Foreign Office, and S.W.H.will throw a tragic light on this lamentable
episode, and, read with the report of the Committees, it will prove how
quick and foreseeing of trouble was her outlook.Inglis
brought her units back from Serbia, she again urged the War Office to
send her out.Of her treatment by the War Office, Mrs.Fawcett writes:
‘She was not only refused, but refused with contumely and insult.’

True to her instinct never to pause over a set-back, she lost no time
in pressing on her last enterprise for the Serbians.M. Curcin, in _The
Englishwoman_, says:--

 ‘She was already acquainted with one side of the Serbian
 problem--Serbia; she was told that in Russia there was the best
 opportunity to learn about the second half--the Serbs of Austria, the
 Jugoslavs.Inglis succeeded in raising a hospital
 unit and transport section staffed by eighty women heroes of the
 Scottish Women’s Hospitals to start with her on a most adventurous
 undertaking, _via_ Archangel, through Russia to Odessa and the
 Dobrudja.Inglis succeeded also--most difficult of all--in
 getting permission from the British authorities for the journey.Eye-witnesses--officers and soldiers--tell everybody to-day how those
 women descended, practically straight from the railway carriages,
 after forty days’ travelling, beside the stretchers with wounded,
 and helped to dress the wounds of those who had had to defend the
 centre and also a wing of the retreating army.For fifteen months she
 remained with those men, whose _rôle_ is not yet fully realised, but
 is certain to become one of the most wonderful and characteristic
 facts of the conflagration of nations.’

The Edinburgh Committee had already so many undertakings on behalf of
the S.W.H.that they gladly allowed the Committee formed by the London
Branch of the N.U.W.S.S.to undertake the whole work of organising this
last adventure for the Serbian Army.Inglis and her unit sailed the wintry main, and to them she sent
the voluminous and brilliant reports of her work.When the Russian
revolution imperilled the safety of the Serbian Army on the Rumanian
front, she sent home members of her unit, charged with important
verbal messages to her Government.Through the last anxious month,
when communications were cut off, short messages, unmistakably her
own, came back to the London Committee, that they might order her to
return.She would come with the Serbian Army and not without them.We
at home had to rest on the assurances of the Foreign Office, always
alive to the care and encouragement of the S.W.H., that Dr.Inglis and
her unit were safe, and that their return would be expedited at the
safest hour.In those assurances we learnt to rest, and the British
Government did not fail that allied force--the Serbian Army and the
Scottish women serving them.The following letters were those written
to her family with notes from her graphic report to her Committees.The
clear style and beautiful handwriting never changed even in those last
days, when those who were with her knew that nothing but the spirit
kept the wasted body at its work.‘The Serbian Division is superb; we
are proud to be attached to it.’ These were the last words in her last
letter from Odessa in June 1917.That pride of service runs through
all the correspondence.The spirit she inspired is noteworthy in a
book which covers the greater part of these fifteen months, _With the
Scottish Nurses in Rumania_, by Yvonne Fitzroy.In a daily diary a
searchlight is allowed to fall on some of the experiences borne with
such high-hearted nonchalance by the leader and her gallant disciples.Haverfield, who saw her work, writes:

 ‘It was perfectly incredible that one human being could do the work
 she accomplished.Her record piece of work perhaps was at Galatz,
 Rumania, at the end of the retreat.There were masses and masses of
 wounded, and she and her doctors and nurses performed operations and
 dressings for fifty-eight hours out of sixty-three.Scott, of the
 armoured cars, noted the time, and when he told her how long she had
 been working, she simply said, “Well, it was all due to Mrs.Milne,
 the cook, who kept us supplied with hot soup.” She had been very
 tired for a long time; undoubtedly the lack of food, the necessity of
 sleeping on the floor, and nursing her patients all the time told on
 her health.In Russia she was getting gradually more tired until she
 became ill.When she was the least bit better she was up again, and
 all the time she attended to the business of the unit.‘Just before getting home she had a relapse, and the last two or
 three days on board ship, we know now, she was dying.She made all the
 arrangements for the unit which she brought with her, however, and
 interviewed every member of it.To Miss Onslow, her transport officer,
 she said, when she arrived at Newcastle, “I shall be up in London in a
 few days’ time, and we will talk the matter of a new unit over.” Miss
 Onslow turned away with tears in her eyes.’

      ‘H.M.TRANSPORT ----,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are more than half way through our voyage.We
 got off eventually on Wednesday night, and lay all Thursday in the
 river.You never in your life saw such a filthy boat as this was when
 we came on board.The captain had been taken off an American liner the
 day before.The only officer who had been on this boat before was the
 engineer officer.The crew were drunk to a man,
 and, as the Transport officer said, “The only way to get this ship
 right, is to get her _out_.” So we got out.I must say we got into
 shape very quickly.We cleaned up, and now we are painting.They won’t
 know her when she gets back.She is an Austrian Lloyd captured at the
 beginning of the war, and she has been trooping in the Mediterranean
 since.She was up at Glasgow for this new start, but she struck the
 Glasgow Fair, and could therefore get nothing done, so she was brought
 down to the port we started from--as she was.The captain seems to be an awfully good man.He is Scotch,
 and was on the Anchor Line to Bombay.She has all our equipment, fourteen of our cars.For passengers,
 there are ourselves, seventy-five people, and three Serbian officers,
 and the mother and sister of one of them, and thirty-two Serbian
 non-commissioned officers.On the saloon deck there are
 twenty-two very small, single cabins.And on this deck larger cabins
 with either three or four berths.I am on this deck in the most
 luxurious quarters.It is called _The Commanding Officer’s Cabin_
 (ahem).There is a huge cabin with one berth; off it on one side
 another cabin with a writing-table and sofa, and off it on the other
 side a bathroom and dressing-room!Of course, if we had had rough
 weather, and the ports had had to be closed, it would not have been so
 nice, especially as the glass in all the portholes is blackened, but
 we have had perfectly glorious weather.At night every porthole and
 window is closed to shut in the light, but the whole ship is very well
 ventilated.A good many of them sleep up in the boats, or in one of
 the lorries.‘We sighted one submarine, but it took no notice of us, so we took
 no notice of it.We had all our boats allotted to us the very first
 day.We divided the unit among them, putting one responsible person
 in charge of each, and had boat drill several times.Then one day the
 captain sounded the alarm for practice, and everybody was at their
 station in three minutes in greatcoat and life-belt.The amusing
 thing was that some of them thought it was a real alarm, and were
 most annoyed and disappointed to find there was not a submarine
 really there!The unit as a whole seems very nice and capable, though
 there are one or two queer characters!But most of them are healthy,
 wholesome bricks of girls.Of course
 a field hospital is quite a new bit of work.‘We reach our port of disembarkation this afternoon.The voyage
 has been a most pleasant one in every way.As soon as sea-sickness
 was over the unit developed a tremendous amount of energy, and we
 have had games on deck, and concerts, and sports, and a fancy dress
 competition!All this in addition to drill every morning, which was
 compulsory.‘We began the day at 8.30--breakfast, the cabins were tidied.9.30--roll call and cabin inspection immediately after; then
 drill--ordinary drill, stretcher drill, and Swedish drill in sections.Lunch was at 12.30, and then there were lessons in Russian, Serbian,
 and French, to which they could go if they liked, and most of them
 took one, or even two, and lectures on motor construction, etc.Tea at
 4, and dinner 6.30.You would have thought there was not much time for
 anything else, but the superfluous energy of a British unit manages
 to put a good deal more in.(The head of a British unit in Serbia
 once said to me that the chief duty of the head of a British unit was
 to use up the superfluous energy of the unit in harmless ways.He
 said that the only time there was no superfluous energy was when the
 unit was overworking.That was the time I found that particular unit
 playing rounders!)I was standing next
 to a Serb officer during the obstacle race, and he suddenly turned to
 me and said, “C’est tout-à-fait nouveau pour nous, Madame.” I thought
 it must be, for at that moment they were getting under a sail which
 had been tied down to the deck--two of them hurled themselves on the
 sail and dived under it, you saw four legs kicking wildly, and then
 the sail heaved and fell, and two dishevelled creatures emerged at the
 other side, and tore at two life-belts which they went through, and so
 on.I should think it was indeed _tout-à-fait nouveau_.Some of the
 dresses at the fancy dress competition were most clever.There was
 Napoleon--the last phase, in the captain’s long coat and somebody’s
 epaulettes, and one of our grey hats, side to the front, excellent;
 and Tweedledum and Tweedledee, in saucepans and life-belts.One of
 them got herself up as a “greaser,” and went down to the engine-room
 to get properly dirty, with such successful result that, when she was
 coming up to the saloon, with her little oiling can in her hand, one
 of the officers stopped her with, “Now, where are you going to, my
 lad?”

 ‘We ended up with all the allied National Anthems, the Serbs leading
 their own.‘I do love to see them enjoying themselves, and to hear them
 chattering and laughing along the passages, for they’ll have plenty
 of hard work later.We had service on Sunday, which I took, as
 the captain could not come down.Could you get us some copies of
 the Archbishop of Canterbury’s war prayers?The captain declares he was snap-shotted six times
 one morning.I don’t know if the Russian Government will let us take
 all these cameras with us.We are flying the Union Jack for the first
 time to-day since we came out.It is good to know you are all thinking
 of us.--Ever your loving sister,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘ON THE TRAIN TO MOSCOW,
      ‘_Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--Here we are well on our way to Moscow, having got
 through Archangel in 2½ days--a feat, for we were told at home that it
 might be six weeks.They did not know that there is a party of our
 naval men there helping the Russians, and Archangel is magnificently
 organised now.‘When one realises that the population was 5000 before the war,
 and is now 20,000, it is quite clear there was bound to be some
 disorganisation at first.‘I never met a kinder set of people than are collected at Archangel
 just now.They simply did everything for us, and sent us off in a
 train with a berth for each person, and gave us a wonderful send off.The Russian Admiral gave us a letter which acts as a kind of magic
 ring whenever it is produced.The first time it was really quite
 startling.We were longing for Nyamdonia where we were to get dinner.We were told we should be there at four o’clock, then at five, and
 at six o’clock we pulled up at a place unknown, and rumours began
 to spread that our engine was off, and sure enough it was, and was
 shunting trucks.Miss Little, one of our Russian-speaking people,
 and I got out.We tried our united eloquence, she in fluent Russian,
 and I saying, _Shechaz_, which means “immediately” at intervals, and
 still they looked helpless and said, “Two hours and a half.” Then I
 produced my letter, and you never saw such a change.They said, “Five
 minutes,” and we were off in three.We tried it all along the line
 after that; my own belief is that we should still be at the unknown
 place, without that letter, shunting trucks.At one station, Miss
 Little heard the station-master saying, “There is a great row going
 on here, and there will be trouble to-morrow if this train isn’t got
 through.” Eventually, we reached Nyamdonia at 11.30, and found a
 delightful Russian officer, and an excellent dinner paid for by the
 Russian Government, waiting for us.We all thought the food very good,
 and I thought the sauce of hunger helped.The next day, profiting
 over our Nyamdonia experience, I said meals were to be had at regular
 times from our stores in the train, and we should take the restaurants
 as we found them, with the result that we arrived at Vorega, where
 _déjeuner_ had been ordered just as we finished a solid lunch of ham
 and eggs.I said they had better go out and have two more courses,
 which they did with great content, and found it quite as nice as the
 night before.‘This is a special train for us and the Serbian officers and
 non-coms.We broke a coupling after we left Nyamdonia, and they sent
 out another carriage from there, but it had not top berths, so they
 had another sleeper ready when we reached Vologda.They gave us
 another and stronger engine at Nyamdonia, because we asked for it, and
 have repaired cisterns, and given us chickens and eggs; and when we
 thank them, they say, “It is for our friends.” The crowd stand round
 three deep while we eat, and watch us all the time, quite silently in
 the stations.In Archangel one old man asked, “Who, on God’s earth,
 are you?”

 ‘They gave us such a send-off from Archangel!Russian soldiers were
 drawn up between the ship and the train, and cheered us the whole way,
 with a regular British cheer; our own crew turned out with a drum
 and a fife and various other instruments, and marched about singing.Then they made speeches, and cheered everybody, and then suddenly the
 Russian soldiers seized the Serbian officers and tossed them up and
 down, up and down, till they were stopped by a whistle.But they had
 got into the mood by then, and they rushed at me.You can imagine, I
 fled, and seized hold of the British Consul.I did think the British
 Empire would stand by me, but he would do nothing but laugh.And I
 found myself up in the air above the crowd, up and down, quite safe,
 hands under one and round one.They were so happy that I waved my hand
 to them, and they shouted and cheered.The unit is only annoyed that
 they had not their cameras, and that anyhow it was dark.Then they
 tossed Captain Bevan, who is in command there, because he was English,
 and the Consul for the same reason, and the captain of the transport
 because he had brought us out.We sang all the national anthems, and
 then they danced for us.It was a weird sight in the moonlight.Some
 of the dances were like Indian ones, and some reminded me of our
 Highland flings.We went on till one in the morning--all the British
 colony, there.I confess, I was tired--though I did enjoy it.Captain
 Bevan’s good-bye was the nicest and so unexpected--simply “God bless
 you.” Mrs.Young, the Consul’s wife, Mrs.Kerr, both Russians, simply
 gave up their whole time to us, took the girls about, and Mrs.Kerr
 had _the whole unit_ to tea.I had lunch one day at the British Mess,
 and another day at the Russian Admiral’s.They all came out to dinner
 with us.‘Of course a new face means a lot in an out-of-the-way place, and
 seventy-five new faces was a God-send.Well, as I said before, they
 are the kindest set of people I ever came across.They brought us our
 bread, and changed our money, and arranged with the bank, and got us
 this train with berths, and thought of every single thing for us.‘NEARING ODESSA,
      ‘_Sep.‘DARLING EVE,--We are nearing the second stage of our journey, and
 _they say_ we shall be in Odessa to-night.We have all come to the
 conclusion that a Russian minute is about ten times as long as ours.If we get in to-night we shall have taken nine days from Archangel;
 with all the lines blocked with military trains, that is not bad.All the same we have had some struggles, but it has been a very
 comfortable journey and very pleasant.The Russian officials all along
 the line have been most helpful and kind.A Serbian officer on board,
 or rather a Montenegrin, looked after us like a father.‘What we should have done without M. and Mme.Malinina at Moscow, I
 don’t know.They gave the whole afternoon up to us: took us to the
 Kremlin--he, the whole unit on special tramcars, and she, three of
 us in her motor.She has a beautiful
 hospital, a clearing one at the station, and he is a member of the
 Duma, and Commandant of all the Red Cross work in Moscow.We only had
 a glimpse of the Kremlin, yet enough to make one want to see more.I
 carried away one beautiful picture to remember--the view of Moscow in
 the sunset light, simply gorgeous.‘The unit are very very well, and exceedingly cheerful.I am not
 sorry to have had these three weeks since we left to get the unit in
 hand.When M. Malinina said it was
 time to leave the Kremlin, and the order was given to “Fall in,” I was
 quite proud of them, they did it so quickly.It is wonderful even now
 what they manage to do.Miss H. says they are like eels in a basket.They were told not to eat fruit without peeling it, so one of them
 peeled an apple with her teeth.They were told not to drink unboiled
 water, so they handed their water-bottles out at dead of night to
 Russian soldiers, to whom they could not explain, to fill for them,
 as of course they understood they were not to fill them from water on
 the train.I must say they are an awfully nice lot on the whole.We
 certainly shall not fail for want of energy.The Russian crowds are
 tremendously interested in them.--Ever your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘RENI, _Sep.‘DEAREST AMY,--We have left Odessa and are really off to our
 Division.We were told this is the important point in the war
 just now--“A Second Verdun.” The great General Mackensen is in command
 against us.He was in command at Krushinjevatz when we were taken
 prisoners.Every one says how anxiously they are looking out for us,
 and, indeed, we shall have our work cut out for us.We are two little
 field hospitals for a whole Division.Think if that was the provision
 for our own men.We saw the
 2nd Division preparing in Odessa.Only from the point of view of the
 war, they ought to be looked after, but when one remembers that they
 are men, every one of them with somebody who cares for them, it is
 dreadful.I wish we were each six women instead of one.I have wired
 home for another Base Hospital to take the place of the British Red
 Cross units when they move on with the 2nd Division.The Russians are
 splendid in taking the Serbs into their Base Hospitals, but you can
 imagine what the pressure is from their own huge armies.We had such
 a reception at Odessa.All the Russian officials, at the station, and
 our Consul, and a line drawn up of twenty Serbian officers.They had
 a motor car and forty droskies and a squad of Serbian soldiers to
 carry up our personal luggage, and most delightful quarters for us on
 the outskirts of the town in a sanatorium.We were the guests of the
 city while we were there.Odessa
 is immensely interested in us.We were told that the form of greeting
 while we were there was, “Have you seen _them_?” The two best things
 were the evening at the Serbian Mess, and the gala performance at the
 opera.The cheering of the Serbian mess when we went in was something
 to remember, but I can tell you I felt quite choking when the whole
 house last night turned round and cheered us after we tried to sing
 our National Anthem to them with the orchestra.‘DEAREST AMY,--Just a line to say I am all right.Four weeks to-morrow
 since we reached Medgidia, and began our hospital.We evacuated it in
 three weeks, and here we are all back on the frontier.Such a time it
 has been, Amy dear.You cannot imagine what war is just behind the
 lines, and in a retreat!--our second retreat, and almost to the same
 day.We evacuated Kragujevatz on the 25th of October last year.We
 evacuated Medgidia on the 22nd this year.On the 25th this year, we
 were working in a Russian dressing-station at Harshova, and were moved
 on in the evening.We arrived at Braila to find 11,000 wounded, and
 seven doctors--only one of them a surgeon.Am going back to Braila to do surgery.Have
 sent every trained person there.--Your loving sister,

      ELSIE.‘_P.S._--We have had lots of exciting things too, and amusing things,
 and _good_ things.’

      ‘ON THE DANUBE AT TULCEA,
      ‘_Nov.‘DEAREST AMY,--I am writing this on the boat between Tulcea and
 Ismail, where I am going to see our second hospital and the transport.Admiral Vesolskin has given me a special boat, and we motored over
 from Braila.The Étappen command had been expecting us all afternoon,
 and the boat was ready.They were very amused to find that “the
 doctor” they had been expecting was a _woman_!‘Our main hospital was at Medgidia, and our field hospital at
 Bulbulmic, only about seven miles from the front.They gave us a
 very nice building, a barrack, at Medgidia for the hospital, and the
 _personnel_ were in tents on the opposite hill.We arrived on the
 day of the offensive, and were ready for patients within forty-eight
 hours.We were there less than three weeks, and during that time we
 unpacked the equipment and repacked it.We made really a rather nice
 hospital at Medgidia, and the field hospital.We pitched and struck
 the camp--we were nursing and operating the whole time, and evacuating
 rapidly too, and our cars were on the road practically always.‘The first notice we got of the retreat was our field hospital being
 brought back five versts.Then we were told to
 send the equipment to Galatz, but to keep essential things and the
 _personnel_.The whole country was covered with
 groups of soldiers who had lost their regiments.Russians, Serbs, and
 Rumanians.The Rumanian guns were simply being rushed back, through
 the crowds of refugees.The whole country was moving: in some places
 the panic was awful.One part of our scattered unit came in for it.You would have thought the Bulgars were at the heels of the people.One man threw away a baby right in front of the cars.They were
 throwing everything off the carts to lighten them, and our people,
 being of a calmer disposition, picked up what they wanted in the way
 of vegetables, etc.Men, with their rifles and bayonets, climbed on
 to the Red Cross cars to save a few minutes.We simply went head
 over heels out of the country.I want to collect all the different
 stories of our groups.My special lot slept the first night on straw
 in Caromacat; the next night on the roadside round a lovely fire; the
 next (much reduced in numbers, for I had cleared the majority off in
 barges for Galatz), we slept in an empty room at Hershova, and spent
 the next day dressing at the wharf.And by the next night we were in
 Braila, involved in the avalanche of wounded that descended on that
 place, and there we have been ever since.‘We found some of our transport, and, while we were having tea, an
 officer came in and asked us to go round and help in a hospital.There, we were told, there were 11,000 wounded (I believe the official
 figures are 7000).They had been working thirty-six hours without
 stopping when we arrived.‘The wounded had overflowed into empty houses, and were lying about in
 their uniforms, and their wounds not dressed for four or five days.‘So we just turned up our sleeves and went in.I got back all the
 trained Sisters from Galatz, and now the pressure is over.One thing
 I am going up to Ismail for, is to get into touch with the Serbian H.2, and find out what they want us to do next.The Serb wounded were
 evacuated straight to Odessa.‘The unit as a whole has behaved splendidly, plucky and cheery through
 everything, and game for any amount of work.‘And we are prouder of our Serbs than ever.I do hope the papers at
 home have realised what the 1st Division did, and how they suffered in
 the fight in the middle of September.General Genlikoffsky said to me,
 “_C’était magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros_”;--and another
 Russian: “We did not quite believe in these Austrian Serbs, but no one
 will ever doubt them again.”

 ‘Personally, I have been awfully well, and prouder than ever of
 British women.I wish you could have seen trained Sisters scrubbing
 floors at Medgidia, and those strapping transport girls lifting the
 stretchers out of the ambulances so steadily and gently.I have told
 in the Report how Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown brought the equipments
 through to Galatz.We lost only one Ludgate boiler and one box of
 radiators.We lost two cars, but that was really the fault of a rather
 stupid Serbian officer.It is a comfort to feel you are all thinking
 of us.--Your loving sister,

      ‘E.I.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN BETWEEN
      ‘RENI AND ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING EVE,--Now we have got a hospital at Reni again, for badly
 wounded, working in connection with the evacuation station.We have
 got the dearest little house to live in ourselves, but, as we are
 getting far more people out from Odessa, we shall have to overflow
 into the Expedition houses.I
 remember thinking Reni a most uninteresting place--crowds of shipping
 and the wharf all crammed with sacks.It was just a big junction like
 Crewe!‘The hospital at Reni is a real building, but it is not finished.One
 unfinished bit is the windows, which have one layer of glass each,
 though they have double sashes.When this was pointed out, I thought
 it was a mere continental foible.When the cold came I realised
 that there is some sense in this foible after all!We _cannot_ get
 the wards warm, notwithstanding extra stoves and roaring fires.The
 poor Russians do mind cold so much.But they don’t want to leave the
 hospital.One man whom I told he must have an operation later on in
 another hospital, said he would rather wait for it in ours.The first
 time we had to evacuate, we simply could not get the men to go.‘We have got a Russian Secretary now, because we are using Russian
 Red Cross money, and he told us he had been told in Petrograd that
 the S.W.H.were beautifully organised, and the only drawback was
 the language.We have got a
 certain number of Austrian prisoners as orderlies, and most of them
 curiously can speak Russian, so we get on better.This is a most comfortable
 way of travelling, and the quickest.We have 500 wounded on board,
 twenty-three of them ours.I am going to Odessa to find out why we
 cannot get Serb patients.There are still thousands of them in Odessa,
 and yet Dr.The Serbs we meet seem
 to think it is somehow our fault!I tell them I have written and
 telegraphed, and planned and made two journeys to Ismail, to try and
 get a real Serbian Hospital going, and yet it doesn’t go.‘What did happen over the change of Government?I do hope we have got
 the right lot now, to put things straight at home, and carry through
 things abroad.Remember it all depends on you people at home._The
 whole thing depends on us._ I know we lose the perspective in this
 gloomy corner, but there is one thing quite clear, and that is that
 they are all trusting to our _sticking_ powers.They know we’ll hold
 on--of course--I only wish we would realise that it would be as well
 to use our intellects too, and have them clear of alcohol.’

      ‘IN AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘You don’t know what a comfort it is on this tumultuous front, to
 know that all you people at home have just settled down to it, and
 that you’ll put things right in the long run.It is curious to feel
 how everybody is trusting to that.The day we left Braila, a Rumanian
 said to me in the hall, “It is England we are trusting to.She has
 got hold now like a strong dog!” But it is a bigger job than any of
 you imagine, _I_ think.But there is not the slightest doubt we shall
 pull it off.I am glad to think the country has discovered that it is
 possible to have an alternative Government.If it does not do, we must
 find yet another._To her little Niece, Amy M‘Laren_

      ‘ON AN AMBULANCE TRAIN,
      ‘NEAR ODESSA, _Jan.‘DARLING AMY,--How are you all?We have been very busy since we came
 out here: first a hospital for the Serbs at Medgidia, then in a
 Rumanian hospital at Braila, and then for the Russians at Galatz and
 Reni.In the very middle, by some funny mistake, we were sent flying
 right on to the front line.However we nipped out again just in time,
 and the station was burnt to the ground just half an hour after we
 left.I’ll tell you the name of the place when the war is over, and
 show it to you on the map.We saw the petrol tanks on fire as we came
 away, and the ricks of grain too.‘Our hospital at Galatz was in a school.I don’t think the children
 in these parts are doing many lessons during the war, and that will
 be a great handicap for their countries afterwards.Perhaps, however,
 they are learning other lessons.When we left the Dobrudja we saw the
 crowds of refugees on their carts, with the things they had been able
 to save, and all the little children packed in among the furniture and
 pots and pans and pigs.‘In one cart I saw two fascinating babies about three years old,
 sitting in a kind of little nest made of pillows and rugs.They were
 little girls, one fair and one dark, and they sat there, as good as
 gold, watching everything with such interest.There were streams of
 carts along the roads, and all the villages deserted.That is what
 the war means out here.It is not quite so bad in our safe Scotland,
 is it?--thanks to the fleet.And that is why it seems to me we have
 got to help these people, because they are having the worst of it.I wonder if you can knit socks yet, for I can use any number, and
 bandages.Blessings on you, precious
 little girl.--Your loving aunt,

      ELSIE.’

 ‘I have had my meals with the Staff.Unfortunately, most of them
 speak only Russian, but one man speaks French, and another German.The man who speaks German is
 having English lessons from her.He picked up _Punch_ and showed _me_ YOU.So, I said “you.”
 He repeated it quite nicely, and then found another OU.“Though,”
 and when I said “though,” he flung up his hands, and said, “Why a
 practical nation like the English should do things like this!”’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      RENI, _March 5, 1917_.‘DARLING MARY,--We have been having such icy weather here, such
 snowstorms sweeping across the plain.One day I really thought the house would be cut off from the hospital.The unit going over to Roll was quite a sight, with the indiarubber
 boots, and peaked Russian caps, with the ends twisted round their
 throats.We should have thoroughly enjoyed it if it had not been for
 the shortage of fuel.However, we were never absolutely without wood,
 and now have plenty, as a Cossack regiment sent a squad of men across
 the Danube to cut for us, and we brought it back in our carts.The
 Danube is frozen right across--such a curious sight.The first time in
 seven years, they say--so nice of it to do it just when we are here!I
 would not have missed it for anything.The hospital has only had about
 forty patients for some time, as there has been no fighting, and it
 was just as well when we were so short of wood.We collected them all
 into one ward, and let the other fires out.‘The chief of the medical department held an inspection.Took off the
 men’s shirts and looked for lice, turned up the sheets, and beat the
 mattresses to look for dust, tasted the men’s food, and in the end
 stated we were _ochin chesté_ (very clean), and that the patients
 were well cared for medically and well nursed.All of which was
 very satisfactory, but he added that the condition of the orderlies
 was disgraceful, and so it was.I hadn’t realised they were my job.However, I told him next time he came he should not find one single
 louse.Laird and I have a nice snug little room together.That is one
 blessing here, we have plenty of sun.Very soon it will begin to get
 quite hot.I woke up on the 1st of March and thought of getting home
 last year that day, and two days after waking up in Eve’s dear little
 room, with the roses on the roof.Bless all you dear people.--Ever
 your loving aunt,

      ‘ELSIE.’

      ‘_March 23, 1917._

 ‘We have been awfully excited and interested in the news from
 Petrograd.We heard of it, probably long after you people at home
 knew all about it!It is most interesting to see how everybody is on
 the side of the change, from Russian officers, who come to tea and
 beam at us, and say, “Heresho” (good) to the men in the wards.In any
 case they say we shall find the difference all over the war area.One
 Russian officer, who was here before the news came, was talking about
 the Revolution in England two hundred years ago, and said it was the
 most interesting period of European history.“They say all these ideas
 began with the French Revolution, but they didn’t--they began long
 before in England,” he thought.He spoke English beautifully, and had
 had an English nurse.He had read Milton’s political pamphlets, and
 we wondered all the time whether he was thinking of changes in Russia
 after the war, but now I wonder if he knew the changes were coming
 sooner.‘Do you know we have all been given the St.Prince
 Dolgourokoff, who is in command on this front, arrived quite
 unexpectedly, just after roll call.The telegram saying he was coming
 arrived a quarter of an hour after he left!General Kropensky, the
 head of the Red Cross, rushed up, and the Prince arrived about two
 minutes after him.He went all over the hospital, and a member of
 his gilded staff told matron he was very pleased with everything.He decorated two men in the wards with St.George’s Medal, and then
 said he wanted to see us together, and shook hands with everybody and
 said, “Thank you,” and gave each of us a medal too; Dr.Laird’s was
 for service, as she had not been under fire.George’s Medal is a
 silver one with “For Bravery” on its back.Our patients were awfully
 pleased, and inpressed on us that it carried with it a pension of a
 rouble a month for life.We gave them all cigarettes to commemorate
 the occasion.‘It was rather satisfactory to see how the hospital looked in its
 ordinary, and even I was _fairly_ satisfied.I tell the unit that
 they must remember that they have an old maid as commandant, and must
 live up to it!I cannot stand dirt, and crooked charts and crumpled
 sheets.One Sister, I hear, put it delightfully in a letter home: “Our
 C.M.O.is an idealist!” I thought that was rather sweet; I believe she
 added, “but she does appreciate good work.” Certainly, I appreciate
 hers.She is in charge of the room for dressings, and it is one of the
 thoroughly satisfactory points in the hospital.‘The Greek priest came yesterday to bless the hospital.We put up
 “Icons” in each of the four wards.The Russians are a very religious
 people, and it seems to appeal to some mystic sense in them.The
 priest just put on a stole, green and gold, and came in his long grey
 cloak.The two wards open out of one another, so he held the service
 in one, the men all saying the responses and crossing themselves.The
 four icons lay on the table before him, with three lighted candles at
 the inner comers, and he blessed water and sprinkled them, and then he
 sprinkled everybody in the room.The icons were fixed up in the corner
 of the wards, and I bought little lamps to burn in front of them, as
 they always have them.We are going to have the evening hymn sung
 every evening at six o’clock.I heard that first in Serbia from those
 poor Russian prisoners, who sang it regularly every evening.The night nurses come up from the
 village literally wet through, having dragged one another out of mud
 holes all the way.Now, a cart goes down to fetch them each evening.We have twenty horses and nine carts belonging to us.I have made Vera
 Holme master of the horse.‘I have heard two delightful stories from the Sisters who have
 returned from Odessa.There is a great rivalry between the Armoured
 Car men and the British Red Cross men, about the capabilities of
 their Sisters.(We, it appears, are the Armoured Car Sisters!)man said their Sisters were so smart they got a man on to the
 operating-table five minutes after the other one went off.Said an
 Armoured Car man: “But that’s nothing.The Scottish Sisters get the
 second one on before the first one is off.” The other story runs that
 there was some idea of the men waiting all night on a quay, and the
 men said, “But you don’t think we are Scottish Sisters, sir, do you?”
 I have no doubt that refers to Galatz, where we made them work all
 night.’

      ‘RENI, _Easter Day, 1917_.‘We, all the patients, sick and wounded, belonging to the Army and
 Navy, and coming from different parts of the great, free Russia, who
 are at present in your hospital, are filled with feelings of the
 truest respect for you.We think it our duty as citizens on this
 beautiful day of Holy Easter to express to you, highly respected and
 much beloved Doctor, as well as to your whole Unit, our best thanks
 for all the care and attention you have bestowed upon us.We bow low
 and very respectfully before the constant and useful work which we
 have seen daily, and which we know to be for the well-being of our
 allied countries.‘We are quite sure that, thanks to the complete unity of action of
 all the allied countries, the hour of gladness and the triumph of the
 Allied arms in the cause of humanity and the honour of nations is near.‘_Vive l’Angleterre!_

      ‘Russian Soldiers, Citizens, and the Russian Sister,
      ’VERA V. DE KOLESNIKOFF.’

      ‘RENI, _March 2, 1917_.‘DARLING EVE,--Very many thanks for the war prayers.The Archbishop’s prayers that I wanted are the
 original ones at the beginning of the war.Just at present we are
 very lucky as regards the singing, as there are three or four capital
 voices in the unit.We have the service at 1.30 on Sunday.That lets
 all the morning work be finished.I do wonder what has become of Miss
 Henderson and the new orderlies!We want them all
 so badly, not to speak of my cool uniform.That will be needed very
 soon I think.We are having
 glorious weather, so sunny and warm.All the snow has gone, and the
 mud is appalling.I thought I knew the worst mud could do in Serbia,
 but it was nothing to this.We have made little tiled paths all about
 our domain, and keep comparatively clean there.I wish we could take
 over the lot of buildings.The other day I thought I had made a great
 score, and bought two thousand poud of wood at a very small price.It
 was thirty-five versts out.We got the Cossacks to lend us transport.But the transport stuck in the mud, and came back the next day, having
 had to haul the empty carts out of mud holes by harnessing four horses
 first to one cart and then to another.It was no wonder I got the wood
 so cheap.‘_April 18, 1918._

 ‘I am writing this sitting out in my little tent, with a glorious
 view over the Danube.We have pitched some of the tents to relieve
 the crowding in the house.They are no longer beautiful and white, as
 they were at Medgidia.We have had to stain them a dirty grey colour,
 so as to hide them from aeroplanes.Yesterday, we had an awful gale,
 and a downpour of rain, and the tents stood splendidly, and not a
 drop of water came through.Miss Pleister and the Austrian orderly
 who helped her to pitch them are triumphant.Do get our spy-incident,
 from the office.We had an awful
 two days, but it is quite a joke to look back on.The unit were most
 thoroughly and Britishly angry.But I very soon saw
 the other side, and managed to get them in hand once more.General
 Kropensky, our chief, was a perfect brick.The armoured car section
 sent a special despatch rider over to Galatz to fetch him, and he came
 off at once.He talks perfect English, and he has since written me a
 charming letter saying our _sang-froid_ and our _savoir-faire_ saved
 the situation.I am afraid there was not much _sang-froid_ among us,
 but some of us managed to keep hold of our common sense.As I told
 the girls, in common fairness they must look at the other side--spy
 fever raging, a foreign hospital right on the front, and a Revolution
 in progress.I told them, even if they did not care about Russia, I
 supposed they cared about the war and England, and I wondered what
 effect it would have on all these Russian soldiers if we went away
 with the thing not cleared up, and still under suspicion.After all,
 the ordinary Russian soldier knows nothing about England, except in
 the very concrete form of _us_.We should have played right into the
 devil’s hands if we had gone away.Of course, they saw it at once,
 and we stuck to our guns for England’s sake.The 6th Army, I think,
 understands that England, as represented by this small unit, is keen
 on the war, and does not spy!We have had a telegram from the General
 in command, apologising, and our patients have been perfectly angelic.And the men from all regiments round come up to the out-patients’
 department, and are most grateful and punctiliously polite.You know the Russian greeting
 on Easter morning, “Christ is risen,” and the answer, “He is risen
 indeed.” We learnt them both, and made our greetings in Russian
 fashion.On Easter Eve we went to the church in the village.The church was crowded with soldiers--very
 few women there.They were most reverent and absorbed outside in the
 courtyards.It was a very curious scene; little groups of people with
 lighted candles waiting to get in.Here, we had a very nice Easter
 service.My “choir” had three lovely Easter hymns, and we even sang
 the Magnificat.One of the armoured car men, on his way from Galatz
 to Belgrade, stayed for the service, and it was nice to have a man’s
 voice in the singing.Except that we are very idle, we are very happy here.Our patients are
 delightful, the hospital in good order.The Steppe is a fascinating
 place to wander over, the little valleys, and the villages hidden
 away in them, and the flowers!We have been riding our transport
 horses--rather rough, but quite nice and gentle.We all ride astride
 of course.‘_On Active Service._

      ‘To Mrs.FLINDERS PETRIE,
      Hon.Sec., Scottish Women’s Hospitals.‘RENI, _May 8, 1917_.PETRIE,--How perfectly splendid about the Egyptologists.Miss Henderson brought me your message, saying how splendidly they are
 subscribing.That is of course all due to you, you wonderful woman.It was such a tantalising thing to hear that you had actually thought
 of coming out as an Administrator, and that you found you could not.I cannot tell you how splendid it would have been if you could have
 come.... I want “a woman of the world”... and I want an adaptable
 person, who will talk to the innumerable officers who swarm about this
 place, and ride with the girls, and manage the officials!‘I do wish you could see our hospital now.Such a nice story:--Matron was in Reni the other day, seeing the
 Commandant of the town about some things for the hospital, and when
 she came out she found a crowd of Russian soldiers standing round her
 house.They asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the
 Commandant was going to see about it.Whereupon the men said, “The
 Commandant must be told that the Scottish Hospital (_Schottlandsche
 bolnitza_) is the best hospital on this front, and must have whatever
 it wants.That is the opinion of the Russian Soldier.” Do you
 recognise the echo of the big reverberation that has shaken Russia.We get on awfully well with the Russian soldier.Two of our patients
 were overheard talking the other day, and they said, “The Russian
 Sisters are pretty but not good, and the English Sisters are good
 and not pretty.” The story was brought up to the mess-room by quite
 a nice-looking girl who had overheard it.But we thought we’d let
 the judgment stand and be like Kingsley’s “maid”--though we _don’t_
 undertake to endorse the Russian part of it!‘We have got some of the _personnel_ tents pitched now, and it is
 delightful.It was rather close quarters in the little house.I am
 writing in my tent now, looking out over the Danube.Such a lovely
 place, Reni is--and the Steppe is fascinating with its wide plains and
 little unexpected valleys full of flowers.The other night our camp was the centre of a fight.They are drilling recruits here, and suddenly the other
 night we found ourselves being defended by one party while another
 attacked from the Steppe.The battle raged all night, and the camp was
 finally carried at four o’clock in the morning amid shouts and cheers
 and barking of dogs.It was even too much for me, and I have slept
 through bombardments.‘It has been so nice hearing about you all from Miss Henderson.How
 splendidly the money is coming in.Petrie,
 _do_ make them send the reliefs more quickly.I know all about boats,
 but, as you knew the orderlies had to leave on the 15th of January,
 the reliefs ought to have been off by the 1st.‘I wish you could hear the men singing their evening hymn in hospital.I am so glad we thought of putting up the
 icons for them.‘Good-bye for the present, dear Mrs.My kindest regards to
 Professor Flinders Petrie.--Ever yours affectionately,

      ELSIE MAUD INGLIS.’

      ‘_May 11, 1917._

 ‘It was delightful seeing Miss Henderson, and getting news of all you
 dear people.But she did arrive
 with all her equipment.The equipment I wired for in October, and
 which was sent out by itself, arrived in Petrograd, got through to
 Jassy, and has there stuck.We have not got a single thing, and the
 Consuls have done their best.French, one of the chaplains in Petrograd, came here.He said
 he would have some services here.We pitched a tent, and we had the
 Communion.I have sent down a notice to the armoured car
 yacht, and I hope some of the men will come up.We and they are the
 only English people here.‘The Serbs have sent me a message saying we may have to rejoin our
 Division soon.I don’t put too much weight on this, because I know
 my dearly beloved Serbs, and their habit of saying the thing they
 think you would like, but still we are preparing.I shall be very
 sorry to leave our dear little hospital here, and the Russians.They
 are a fascinating people, especially the common soldier.I hope that
 as we have done this work for the Russians and therefore have some
 little claim on them, it will help us to get things more easily for
 the Serbs.We have one little laddie in, about ten years old, the
 most amusing brat.He was wounded by an aeroplane bomb in a village
 seven versts out, and was sent into Reni to a hospital.But, when he
 got there he found the hospital was for sick only (a very inferior
 place!He wanders about with a Russian
 soldier’s cap on his head and wrapped round with a blanket, and we
 hear his pretty little voice singing to himself all over the place.‘Nicolai, the man who came in when the hospital was first opened,
 and has been so very ill, is really getting better.He had his
 dressing left for two days for the first time the other day, and his
 excitement and joy were quite pathetic.“_Ochin heroshe doktorutza,
 ochin herosho_” (Very good, dear doctor, very good), he kept saying,
 and then he added, “Now, I know I am not going to die!” Poor boy,
 he has nearly died several times, and would have died if he had not
 had English Sisters to nurse him.He has been awfully naughty--the
 wretch.He bit one of the Sisters one day when she tried to give him
 his medicine.Now, he kisses my hand to make up.The other day I
 ordered massage for his leg, and he made the most awful row, howled
 and whined, and declared it would hurt (really, he has had enough pain
 to destroy anybody’s nerve), and then suddenly pointed to a Sister who
 had come in, and said what she had done for him was the right thing.I asked what she had done for him; “Massaged his leg,” she said.I
 got that promptly translated into Russian, and the whole room roared
 with laughter.Poor Nicolai--after a minute, he joined in.His home
 is in Serbia, “a very nice home with a beautiful garden.” His mother
 is evidently the important person there.His father is a smith, and
 he had meant to be a smith too, but now he has got the St.George’s
 Cross, which carries with it a pension of six roubles a month, and he
 does not think he will do any work at all.He is the eldest of the
 family, twenty-four years old, and has three sisters, and a little
 brother of five.Can’t you imagine how he was spoilt!and how proud
 they are of him now, only twenty-four, and a _sous-officier_, and
 been awarded the St.George’s Cross which is better than the medal;
 and been wounded, four months in hospital, and had three operations!He has been so ill I am afraid the spoiling continued in the Scottish
 Women’s Hospital.Laird says she would not be his future wife for
 anything.‘We admitted such a nice-looking boy to-day, with thick, curly, yellow
 hair, which I had ruthlessly cropped, against his strong opposition.I
 doubt if I should have had the heart, if I had known how ill he was.I found him this evening with
 tears running silently over his cheeks, a Cossack, a great big man.He may have to go on to Odessa, as a severe
 operation and bombs and a nervous breakdown don’t go together.‘We have made friends with lots of the officers; there is one, also
 a Cossack, who spends a great part of his time here.His regiment is
 at the front, and he has been left for some special work, and he seems
 rather lonely.He is a nice boy, and brings nice horses for us to
 ride.We have been having quite a lot of riding, on our own transport
 horses too.It is heavenly riding here across the great plain.We all
 ride astride, and at first we found the Cossacks’ saddles most awfully
 uncomfortable, but now we are quite used to them.Our days fly past
 here, and in a sense are monotonous, but I don’t think we are any of
 us the worse for a little monotony as an interlude!quite fairly
 often there is a party at one of the regiments here!The girls enjoy
 them, and matron and I chaperone them alternately and reluctantly.It
 was quite a rest during Lent when there were no parties.‘The spy incident has quite ended, and we have won.Matron was in Reni
 the other day asking the Commandant about something, and when she came
 out she found a little crowd of Russian soldiers round her house.They
 asked her if she had got what she wanted, and she said the Commandant
 had said he would see about it.They answered, “The Commandant must
 be told that the S.W.H.is the best hospital on this front, and that
 it must have everything it wants.” That is the opinion of the Russian
 soldier!If you were here you would recognise the new tone of the
 Russian soldier in these days,--but I am glad he approves of our
 hospital.’

      ‘ODESSA, _June 24, 1917_.‘I wish you could realise how the little nations, Serbs and Rumanians
 and Poles, count on us.What a comfort it is to them to think we are
 “the most tenacious” nation in Europe.In their eyes it all hangs on
 us.I don’t believe we can disentangle
 it all in our minds just now.The only thing is just to go on doing
 one’s bit.Because, one thing is quite clear, Europe won’t be a
 habitable place if Germany wins--for anybody.‘I think there are going to be a lot of changes here.’

      ‘_July 15, 1917._

 ‘I have had German measles!The Consul asked me what I meant by that
 at my time of life!The majority of people say how unpatriotic and
 Hunnish of you!Well, a few days off did not do me any harm.I had
 a very luxurious time lying in my tent.The last lot of orderlies
 brought it out.’

      ‘ODESSA, _Aug.‘The work at Reni is coming to an end, and we are to go to the front
 with the Serbian Division.I cannot write about it owing to censors
 and people.But I am going to risk this: the Serbs ought to be most
 awfully proud.The Russian General on the front is going to insist on
 having them “to stiffen up his Russian troops.” I think you people at
 home ought to know what magnificent fighting men these Serbs are, and
 so splendidly disciplined, simply worth their weight in gold.There
 are only two divisions of them after all.We have about thirty-five of
 them in hospital just now as sanitaries, and they are such a comfort;
 their quickness and their devotion is wonderful.The hospital was full
 and overflowing when I left--still Russians.Most of the cases were
 slight; a great many left hands, if you know what that _means_.I
 don’t think the British Army does know!‘We had a Red Cross inspecting officer down from Petrograd.He was
 very pleased with everything, and kissed my hand on departing, and
 said we were doing great things for the Alliance.I wanted to say many
 things, but thought I had better leave it alone.‘We are operating at 5 A.M.now, because the afternoons are so hot.The other day we began at 5, and had to go till 4 P.M.‘Matron and I had a delightful ride the other evening.Just as we
 had turned for home, an aeroplane appeared, and the first shot from
 the anti-aircraft guns close beside us was too much for our horses,
 who promptly bolted.However, there was nothing but the clear Steppe
 before us, so we just sat tight and went.After a little they
 recovered themselves, and really behaved very well.’

      ‘_Aug.28._

 ‘You dear, dear people, how sweet of you to send me a telegram for
 my birthday.You don’t know how nice it was to get it and to feel you
 were thinking of me.Miss G. brought it
 me with a very puzzled face, and said, “I cannot quite make out this
 telegram.” It was written in Russian characters.She evidently was not
 used to people doing such mad things as telegraphing the “Many happy
 returns of the day” half across the world.I understood it at once,
 and it nearly made me cry.It was good to get it, though I think the
 Food Controller or somebody ought to come down on you for wasting
 money in the middle of a war.‘I am finishing this letter in Reni.We closed the hospital yesterday,
 and joined our Division somewhere on Friday.The rush that had begun
 before I got to Odessa got much worse.They had an awfully busy time,
 a faint reminiscence of Galatz, though, as they were operating twelve
 hours on end, I don’t know it was so very faint.We had no more left
 hands, but all the bad cases.Everybody worked magnificently, but they
 always do in a push.The time a British unit goes to pieces is when
 there is nothing to do!‘So this bit of work ends, eight months.I am quite sorry to leave it,
 but quite quite glad to get back to our Division.‘Well, Amy dearest, good-bye for the present.Love to all you dear people.’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      ‘HADJI ABDUL, _Oct.‘I wonder if this is my last letter from Russia!We hope to be off
 in a very few days now.We have had a very pleasant time in this
 place with its Turkish name.We are with the Division, and were given this perfectly beautiful
 camping-ground, with trees, and a <DW72> towards the east.The question
 was whether we were going to Rumania or elsewhere.It is nice being
 back with these nice people.They have been most kind and friendly,
 and we have picnics and rides and _dances_, and dinners, and till this
 turmoil of the move began we had an afternoon reception every day
 under the walnut trees!Now, we are packed up and ready to go, and I
 mean to walk in on you one morning.‘We shall have about two months to refit, but one of those is my due
 as a holiday, _which I am going to take_.I’ll see you all soon.--Your
 loving aunt,

CHAPTER XI

THE MOORINGS CUT

    ‘Not I, but my Unit.’

    ‘My dear Unit, good-bye.’--Nov.‘Into the wide deep seas which we call God
    You plunged.This is not death,
    You seemed to say, but fuller life.’

The reports of Dr.Inglis as chief medical officer to the London
Committee were as detailed and foreseeing in the very last one that
she wrote as in the first from on board the transport that took her
and her unit out.She writes:--‘In view of the fact that we are in the
middle of big happenings I should like Dr.Laird to bring ½ ton cotton
wool, six bales moss dressings, 100 lb.ether, 20
gallons rectified spirits.I wonder what news of the river boat for
Mesopotamia?’ After they had landed and were at work:--‘I have wired
asking for another hospital for the base.I know you have your hands
full, but I also know that if the people at home realise what their
help would mean out here just now, we would not have to ask twice.And
again:--’Keep the home fires burning and let us feel their warmth.’ She
soon encountered the usual obstacles:--‘I saw that there was no good in
the world talking about regular field hospitals to them until they had
tried our mettle.The ordinary male disbelief in our capacity cannot
be argued away.It can only be worked away.’ So she acted.Russia
created disbelief, but the men at arms of all nations saw and believed.In November she wrote back incredulously:--‘Rumours of falling back.Anxious about the equipment.’ In bombardments, in
retreat, and evacuations the equipment was her one thought.‘Stand by
the equipment’ became a joke in her unit.On one occasion one of the
orderlies had a heavy fall from a lorry on which she was in charge of
the precious stuff.Dusty and shaken, she was gathering herself up,
when the voice of the chief rang out imperatively urgent, ‘Stand by the
equipment.’ On the rail certain trucks, bearing all the equipment, got
on a wrong line, and were carried away:--‘The blue ribbon belongs to
Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown.They saw our wagons disappearing with
a refugee train, whereupon these two ran after it and jumped on, and
finally brought the equipment safely to Galatz.They invented a General
Popovitch who would be very angry if it did not get through.Without
those two girls and their ingenuity, the equipment would not have got
through.’

She details all the difficulties of packing up and evacuating after
the despatch rider came with the order that the hospitals were to
fall back to Galatz.The only method their own, all else chaotic and
helpless, working night and day, the unit accomplished everything.At
the station, packed with a country and army in flight, Dr.Inglis had a
talk with a Rumanian officer.He told her that he had been in Glasgow,
and had there been invited out to dinner, and had seen ‘English
customs.’ ‘It was good to feel those English customs were still going
on quietly, whatever was happening here, breakfast coming regularly and
hot water for baths, and everything as it should be.It was probably
absurd, but it came like a great wave of comfort to feel that England
was there quiet and strong and invincible behind everything and
everybody.’

As we read these natural vivid diary reports, we too can feel it was
good of England that Dr.Inglis was to the last on that front--

    ‘Ambassador from Britain’s Crown,
      And type of all her race.’

Dr.Inglis never lost sight of the Army she went out to serve.She
refused to return unless they were brought away from the Russian front
with her.‘I wonder if a proper account of what happened then went home to
 the English papers?The Serbian Division went into the fight 15,000
 strong.They were in the centre--the Rumanians on their left, and the
 Russians on their right.The Rumanians broke, and they fought for
 twenty-four hours on two fronts.They came out of the fight, having
 lost 11,000 men.It is almost incredible, and that is when we ought to
 have been out, and could have been out if we had not taken so long to
 get under way.’

In the last Report, dated October 29, 1917, she tells her Committee she
has been ‘tied by the leg to bed.’ There are notes on coming events:--

 ‘There really seems a prospect of getting away soon.The Foreign
 Office knows us only too well.Only 6000 of the Division go in this
 lot, the rest (15,000) to follow.’

There is a characteristic last touch.‘I have asked Miss Onslow to get English paper-back novels for the
 unit on their journey.At a certain shop, they can be got for a rouble
 each, and good ones.’

To members of that unit, doctors, sisters, orderlies, we are indebted
for many personal details, and for the story of the voyage west,
when for her the sun was setting.Her work was accomplished when on
the transport with her and her unit were the representatives of that
Serbian Army with whom she served, faithful unto death.Miss Arbuthnot, the granddaughter of Sir William Muir, the friend of
John Inglis, was one of those who helped to nurse Dr.Inglis:--

 ‘I sometimes looked after her when the Sister attending her was
 off duty.Her consideration and kindness were quite extraordinary,
 while her will and courage were quite indomitable.To die as she did
 in harness, having completed her great work in getting the Serbs away
 from Russia, is what she would have chosen.Inglis at Hadji Abdul, a small mud village about ten
 miles from Galatz.She was looking very ill, but was always busy.For
 some time she had been ill with dysentery, but she never even stayed
 in bed for breakfast till it was impossible for her to move from bed.‘During our time at Hadji we had about forty Serbian patients, a few
 wounded, but mostly sick.Inglis did a few minor operations, but
 her last major one was a gastro-enterotomy performed on one of our own
 chauffeurs, a Serb, Joe, by name.The operation took three hours and
 was entirely satisfactory, although Dr.Inglis did not consider him
 strong enough to travel back to England.She was particularly fond of
 this man, and took no end of trouble with him.Even after she became
 so very ill she used constantly to visit him.‘The Serbs entertained us to several picnics, which we duly returned.Inglis was always an excellent hostess, so charming and genial
 to every one, and so eager that both entertainers and entertained
 should equally enjoy themselves.Provided her permission was asked
 first, and duty hours or regular meals not neglected, she was always
 keen every one should enjoy themselves riding, walking, or going for
 picnics.If any one was ill, she never insisted on their getting up
 in spite of everything, as most doctors, and certainly all matrons,
 wish us to do.She was strict during duty hours, and always required
 implicit obedience to her orders--whatever they were.She was always
 so well groomed--never a hair out of place.One felt so proud of her among the dirty and generally
 unsuitably dressed women in other hospitals.She was very independent,
 and would never allow any of us to wait on her.The cooks were not
 allowed to make her any special dishes that the whole unit could not
 share.As long as she could, she messed with the unit, and there was
 no possibility of avoiding her quick eye; anything which was reserved
 for her special comfort was rejected.Once, a portion of chicken was
 kept as a surprise for her.She asked whether there had been enough
 for all, and when the cooks reluctantly confessed there was only the
 one portion she sent it away.‘During one of the evacuations, an order had been given that there
 were only two blankets allowed in each valise.Some one, mindful of
 her weakness, stuffed an extra one into Dr.Inglis’ bag, because in
 her emaciated condition she suffered much from the cold.It stirred
 her to impetuous anger, and with something of the spirit of David, as
 he poured out the water brought him at the peril of the lives of his
 followers, she flung the blanket out of the railway carriage, as a
 lesson to those of her unit who had disobeyed an order.Inglis read the Church service with great dignity
 and simplicity.On the weekday evenings, before she became so ill,
 she would join us in a game of bridge, and played nearly every night.During the retreats when nothing more could be done, and she felt
 anxious, she would sit down and play a game of patience.During the
 weeks of uncertainty, when the future of the Serbs was doubtful, and
 she was unable to take any active part, she fretted very much.‘After endless conflicting rumours and days of waiting, the
 news arrived that they were to go to England.Her delight was
 extraordinary, for she had lain in her bed day after day planning how
 she could help them, and sending endless wires to those in authority
 in England, but feeling herself very impotent.Once the good news
 arrived, her marvellous courage and tenacity helped her to recover
 sufficiently, and prepare all the details for the journey with the
 Serbs.We left on the 29th October, with the H.G.Staff and two
 thousand Serbian soldiers, in a special train going to Archangel.Inglis spent fifteen days on the train, in a second-class
 compartment, with no proper bed.Her strength varied, but she was
 compelled to lie down a great deal, although she insisted on dressing
 every morning.On two occasions she walked for five minutes on the
 station platform; each time it absolutely exhausted her.Though she
 suffered much pain and discomfort, she never complained.She could
 only have benger, chicken broth and condensed milk, and she often
 found it impossible to take even these.If one happened to bring her
 tea, or her food, she thanked one so charmingly.‘At Archangel there was no means of carrying her on to the boat, so
 with help (one orderly in front, and one lifting her behind), she
 climbed a ladder twenty feet high, from the platform to the deck of
 the transport.She was a good sailor, and had a comfortable cabin on
 the ship.She improved on board slightly, and used to sit in the small
 cabin allotted to us on the upper deck.She played patience, and was
 interested in our sea-sick symptoms.There was a young naval officer
 very seriously ill on the boat.Our people were nursing him, and she
 constantly went to prescribe; she feared he would not live, and he
 died before we reached our port.Inglis had a relapse; violent pain set
 in, and she had to return to bed.Even then, a few days before we
 reached England, she insisted on going through all the accounts,
 and prepared fresh plans to take the unit on to join the Serbs at
 Salonika.In six weeks she expected to be ready to start.She sent for
 each of us in turn, and asked if we would go with her.Needless to
 say, only those who could not again leave home, refused, and then with
 the deepest regret.Inglis
 had a violent attack of pain, and had no sleep all night.Next morning
 she insisted on getting up to say good-bye to the Serbian staff.‘It was a wonderful example of her courage and fortitude, to see her
 standing unsupported--a splendid figure of quiet dignity.Her face
 ashen and drawn like a mask, dressed in her worn uniform coat, with
 the faded ribbons that had seen such good service.As the officers
 kissed her hand, and thanked her for all she had done for them, she
 said to each of them a few words accompanied with her wonderful smile.’

As they looked on her, they also must have understood, ‘sorrowing most
of all, that they should see her face no more.’

 ‘After that parting was over, Dr.She left the boat Sunday afternoon, 25th November, and
 arrived quite exhausted at the hotel.I was allowed to see her for
 a minute before the unit left for London that night.She could only
 whisper, but was as sweet and patient as she ever was.She said we
 should meet soon in London.’

After her death, many who had watched her through these strenuous
years, regretted that she did not take more care of herself.Symptoms
of the disease appeared so soon, she must have known what overwork and
war rations meant in her state.This may be said of every follower of
the One who saved others, but could not save Himself.The life story
of Saint and Pioneer is always the same.To continue to ill-treat
‘brother body’ meant death to St.Francis; to remain in the fever
swamps of Africa meant death to Livingstone.The poor, and the freedom
of the slave, were the common cause for which both these laid down
their lives.Of the same spirit was this daughter of our race.Had she
remained at home on her return from Serbia she might have been with us
to-day, but we should not have the woman we now know, and for whom we
give thanks on every remembrance of her.Miss Arbuthnot makes no allusion to
its dangers.Everything written by the ‘unit’ is instinct with the
high courage of their leader.We know now how great were the perils
surrounding the transports on the North seas.Old, and unseaworthy, the
menace below, the storm above, through the night of the Arctic Circle,
she was safely brought to the haven where all would be.More than once
death in open boats was a possibility to be faced; there were seven
feet of water in the engine-room, and only the stout hearts of her
captain and crew knew all the dangers of their long watch and ward.As the transport entered the Tyne a blizzard swept over the country.We who waited for news on shore wondered where on the cold grey seas
laboured the ship bringing home ‘Dr.Elsie and her unit.’

In her last hours she told her own people of the closing days on
board:--

 ‘When we left Orkney we had a dreadful passage, and even after we got
 into the river it was very rough.We were moored lower down, and,
 owing to the high wind and storm, a big liner suddenly bore down upon
 us, and came within a foot of cutting us in two, when our moorings
 broke, we swung round, and were saved.I said to the one who told
 me--“Who cut our moorings?” She answered, “No one cut them, they
 broke.”’

There was a pause, and then to her own she broke the knowledge that she
had heard the call and was about to obey the summons.‘The same hand who cut our moorings then is cutting mine now, and I am
 going forth.’

Her niece Evelyn Simson notes how they heard of the arrival:--

 ‘A wire came on Friday from Aunt Elsie, saying they had arrived in
 Newcastle.We tried all Saturday to get news by wire and ’phone,
 but got none.We think now this was because the first news came by
 wireless, and they did not land till Sunday.‘Aunt Elsie answered our prepaid wire, simply saying, “I am in bed, do
 not telephone for a few days.” I was free to start off by the night
 train, and arrived about 2 A.M.were
 at the Station Hotel, and I saw Aunt Elsie’s name in the book.I did
 not like to disturb her at that hour, and went to my room till 7.30.I
 found her alone; the night nurse was next door.She was surprised to
 see me, as she thought it would be noon before any one could arrive.She looked terribly wasted, but she gave me such a strong embrace that
 I never thought the illness was more than what might easily be cured
 on land, with suitable diet.‘I felt her pulse, and she said.“It is not very good, Eve dear, I
 know, for I have a pulse that beats in my head, and I know it has been
 dropping beats all night.” She wanted to know all about every one, and
 we had a long talk before any one came in.Ward had been to her, always, and we arranged that Dr.Aunt Elsie then packed me off to get some breakfast, and
 Dr.Ward told me she was much worse than she had been the night before.‘I telephoned to Edinburgh saying she was “very ill.” When Dr.Williams came, I learnt that there was practically no hope of her
 living.They started injections and oxygen, and Aunt Elsie said, “Now
 don’t think we didn’t think of all these things before, but on board
 ship nothing was possible.”

 ‘It was not till Dr.Williams’ second visit that she asked me if the
 doctor thought “this was the end.” When she saw that it was so, she
 at once said, without pause or hesitation, “Eve, it will be grand
 starting a new job over there,”--then, with a smile, “although there
 are two or three jobs here I would like to have finished.” After this
 her whole mind seemed taken up with the sending of last messages to
 her committees, units, friends, and relations.It simply amazed me how
 she remembered every one down to her grand-nieces and nephews.When I
 knew mother and Aunt Eva were on their way, I told her, and she was
 overjoyed.Early in the morning she told me wonderful things about
 bringing back the Serbs.I found it very hard to follow, as it was an
 unknown story to me.I clearly remember she went one day to the Consul
 in Odessa, and said she must wire certain things.She was told she
 could only wire straight to the War Office--“and so I got into touch
 straight with the War Office.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren at one moment commented--“You have done magnificent
 work.” Back swiftly came her answer, “Not I, but my unit.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren says: ‘Mrs.Simson and I arrived at Newcastle on Monday
 evening.It was a glorious experience to be with her those last two
 hours.She was emaciated almost beyond recognition, but all sense
 of her bodily weakness was lost in the grip one felt of the strong
 alert spirit, which dominated every one in the room.She was clear
 in her mind, and most loving to the end.The words she greeted us
 with were--“So, I am going over to the other side.” When she saw we
 could not believe it, she said, with a smile, “For a long time I
 _meant_ to live, but now I _know_ I am going.” She spoke naturally
 and expectantly of going over.Certainly she met the unknown with a
 cheer!As the minutes passed she seemed to be entering into some great
 experience, for she kept repeating, “This is wonderful--but this is
 wonderful.” Then, she would notice that some one of us was standing,
 and she would order us to sit down--another chair must be brought if
 there were not enough.To the end, she would revert to small details
 for our comfort.As flesh and heart failed, she seemed to be breasting
 some difficulty, and in her own strong way, without distress or fear,
 she asked for help, “You must all of you help me through this.” We
 repeated to her many words of comfort.Again and again she answered
 back, “I know.” One, standing at the foot of the bed, said to her,
 “You will give my love to father”; instantly the humorous smile lit
 her face, and she answered, “Of course I will.”

 ‘At her own request her sister read to her words of the life
 beyond--“Let not your heart be troubled--In my Father’s house are many
 mansions; if it were not so I would have told you,” and, even as they
 watched her, she fell on sleep.‘After she had left us, there remained with those that loved her only
 a great sense of triumph and perfect peace.The room seemed full of a
 glorious presence.One of us said, “This is not death; it makes one
 wish to follow after.”’

As ‘We’ waited those anxious weeks for the news of the arrival of Dr.Inglis and her Army, there were questionings, how we should welcome
and show her all love and service.The news quickly spread she was not
well--might be delayed in reaching London; the manner of greeting her
must be to ensure rest.The storm had spent itself, and the moon was riding high in a cloudless
heaven, when others waiting in Edinburgh on the 26th learnt the news
that she too had passed through the storm and shadows, and had crossed
the bar.That her work here was to end with her life had not entered the minds
of those who watched for her return, overjoyed to think of seeing her
face once more.She had concealed her mortal weakness so completely,
that even to her own the first note of warning had come with the words
that she had landed, but was in bed:--‘then we thought it was time one
of us should go to her.’

Her people brought her back to the city of her fathers, and to the
hearts who had sent her forth, and carried her on the wings of their
strong confidence.There was to be no more going forth of her active
feet in the service of man, and all that was mortal was carried for
the last time into the church she had loved so well.Then we knew and
understood that she had been called where His servants shall serve Him.The Madonna lilies, the lilies of France and of the fields, were placed
around her.Over her hung the torn banners of Scotland’s history.The
Scottish women had wrapped their country’s flag around them in one of
their hard-pressed flights.On her coffin, as she lay looking to the
East in high St.Giles’, were placed the flags of Great Britain and
Serbia.She had worn ‘the faded ribbons’ of the orders bestowed on her by
France, Russia, and Serbia.It has often been asked at home and abroad
why she had received no decorations at the hands of her Sovereign.It
is not an easy question to answer.Inglis was buried, amid marks of respect
and recognition which make that passing stand alone in the history of
the last rites of any of her fellow-citizens.Great was the company
gathered within the church.The chancel was filled by her family and
relatives--her Suffrage colleagues, representatives from all the
societies, the officials of the hospitals and hostels she had founded
at home, the units whom she had led and by whose aid she had done great
things abroad.Last and first of all true-hearted mourners the people
of Serbia represented by their Minister and members of the Legation.The chief of the Scottish Command was present, and by his orders
military honours were paid to this happy warrior of the Red Cross.The service had for its keynote the Hallelujah Chorus, which was played
as the procession left St.It was a thanksgiving instinct with
triumph and hope.The Resurrection and the Life was in prayer and
praise.The Dean of the Order of the Thistle revealed the thoughts of
many hearts in his farewell words:--

 ‘We are assembled this day with sad but proud and grateful hearts to
 remember before God a very dear and noble lady, our beloved sister,
 Elsie Inglis, who has been called to her rest.We mourn only for
 ourselves, not for her.She has died as she lived, in the clear light
 of faith and self-forgetfulness, and now her name is linked for ever
 with the great souls who have led the van of womanly service for God
 and man.A wondrous union of strength and tenderness, of courage
 and sweetness, she remains for us a bright and noble memory of high
 devotion and stainless honour.Especially to-day, in the presence of
 representatives of the land for which she died, we think of her as an
 immortal link between Serbia and Scotland, and as a symbol of that
 high courage which will sustain us, please God, till that stricken
 land is once again restored, and till the tragedy of war is eradicated
 and crowned with God’s great gifts of peace and of righteousness.’

The buglers of the Royal Scots sounded ‘the Reveille to the waking
morn,’ and the coffin with the Allied flags was placed on the gun
carriage.Women were in the majority of the massed crowd that awaited
the last passing.‘Why did they no gie her the V.C.?’ asked the
shawl-draped women holding the bairns of her care: these and many
another of her fellow-citizens lined the route and followed on foot
the long road across the city.As the procession was being formed,
Dr.Inglis’ last message was put into the hands of the members of the
London Committee for S.W.H.It ran:--

      ‘_November 26, 1917._

 ‘So sorry I cannot come to London.Will send Gwynn in a day or two with
 explanations and suggestions.Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel
 Tcholah Antitch were to make appointment this week or next from
 Winchester; do see them, and also as many of the committee as possible
 and show them every hospitality.They have been very kind to us, and
 whatever happens, dear Miss Palliser, do beg the Committee to make
 sure that they (the Serbs) have their hospitals and transport, for
 they do need them.‘Many thanks to the Committee for their kindness to me and their
 support of me.‘Dictated to Miss Evelyn Simson.’

How the people loved her!was the thought, as she passed through the
grief-stricken crowds.These, who knew her best, smiled as they said
one to another, ‘How all this would surprise her!’

Edinburgh is a city of spires and of God’s acres, the graves cut in
the living rock, within gardens and beside running waters.Across the
Water of Leith the long procession wound its way.Within sight of the
grave, it was granted to her grateful brethren, the representatives
of the Serbian nation, to carry her coffin, and lower it to the place
where the mortal in her was to lie in its last rest.Her life’s story
was grouped around her--the Serbian officers, the military of her own
nation at war, the women comrades of the common cause, the poor and
suffering--to one and all she had been the inspiring succourer.November mists had drifted all day across the city, veiling the
fortress strength of Scotland, and the wild wastes of seas over which
she had returned home to our island strength.Even as we turned and
left her, the grey clouds at eventide were transfused and glorified by
the crimson glow of the sunset on the hills of Time.Printed in Great Britain by T. and A. CONSTABLE, Printers to His

have fresh wafers and ginger cakes all laid in for my birthday--set it
all ready, Jo.Saart is coming soon, and the boys may take a dram, too.A sweet young Miss
    And a glass of Anis--
    I shall surely come in for this.[Hides it in his red handkerchief.]No--now--you
know what I want to say.I don't need to ask if----[Pours the dram.]No--no--go ahead--just a little more.No matter, I shan't spill a drop.Lips to the glass, sucks up the liquor.]When you have my years!--Hardly slept a wink last night--and
no nap this afternoon.That's what he would like to do----

MARIETJE.Now, if I had my choice----

KNEIR.The Matron at the Home has to
help dress him.the Englishman says: "The old man misses the kisses, and
the young man kisses the misses."Yes, that means, "Woman, take your cat inside, its beginning to
rain."Good day, Daantje; day, Cobus; and day, Marietje; and day,
Jo.No, I'm not going to do it--my door is ajar--and the cat may
tip over the oil stove.No, just give it to me this way--so--so--many
happy returns, and may your boys--Where are the boys?Geert has gone to say good bye, and Barend has gone with Mees
to take the mattresses and chests in the yawl.They'll soon be here,
for they must be on board by three o'clock.There was a lot of everything and more too.The bride was
full,--three glasses "roses without thorns," two of "perfect love,"
and surely four glasses of "love in a mist."Where she stowed
it all I don't know.Give me the old fashioned dram, brandy and syrup--eh!He's come here to sleep--you look as if you hadn't been to
bed at all.In his bed--he, he, he!No, I say, don't take out your chew.No, you'd never guess how I got it.Less than ten
minutes ago I met Bos the ship-owner, and he gave me--he gave me a
little white roll--of--of tissue paper with tobacco inside.Yes, catch me smoking a thing like that in--in paper--that's a
chew with a shirt on.And you're a crosspatch without a shirt.No, I'm not going to
sit down.Day, Simon--shove in, room for you here.Give him just one, for a parting cup.Is there much work in the dry dock, Simon?No, if I sit down I stay too long.Well then, half a
glass--no--no cookies.It looks like all hands on deck
here!Uh--ja----

MARIETJE.The deuce, but you're touchy!We've got a quarter of an hour,
boys!Fallen asleep with a ginger nut in his hand.Sick in the night--afraid to call the matron; walked about
in his bare feet; got chilled.It's easy for you to talk, but if you disturb her, she keeps
you in for two weeks.Poor devils--I don't want to live to be so old.We're not even married
yet--and he's a widower already!I don't need a belaying pin----[Sings.]"Sailing, sailing, don't wait to be called;
    Starboard watch, spring from your bunk;
    Let the man at the wheel go to his rest;
    The rain is good and the wind is down.It's sailing, it's sailing,
    It's sailing for the starboard watch."[The others join him in beating time on the table with their fists.]You'll do the same when you're as old
as I am.You might have said that a while back when you
looked like a wet dish rag.Now we can make up a song about you, pasting paper
bags--just as Domela--he he he!My nevvy Geert pastes paper bags,
    Hi-ha, ho!My nevvy Geert----

SAART.DAAN., JO., MARIETJE AND COBUS.I'm blest if I see----

MARIETJE.They must--they must--not--not--that's fast.You must--you must----

MARIETJE.The ribs--and--and----[Firmly.]That's fast!----

GEERT, JO., COBUS, DAANTJE AND SAART.You went together to take the mattresses and chests----

MEES.Can't repeat a word of it--afraid--afraid--always afraid----[To
Marietje, who has induced her father to rise.]Now--now--Kneir, many happy returns.Perhaps he's saying good-bye to his girl.[Sound of Jelle's
fiddle outside.]Do sit still--one would think you'd eaten horse flesh.Poor old fellow, gets blinder every day.Yes, play that tune of--of--what do you call 'em?You know, Jelle, the one--that one that goes [Sings.]"I know
a song that charms the heart."Give us----[Jelle begins the Marseillaise.]"Alloose--vodela--bedeije--deboe--debie--de boolebie."That's the French of a dead codfish!I've laid in a French port--and say, it
was first rate!When I said pain they gave me bread--and when I said
"open the port," they opened the door.Let's use the
Dutch words we've got for it."Arise men, brothers, all united!Your wrongs, your sorrows be avenged"--

BOS.[Who has stood at the open window listening during the singing,
yells angrily.]It's high time you were all on board!Oh--Oh--how he scared me--he!I couldn't think where the voice came from.How stupid of you to roar like a weaned pig, when you know
Meneer Bos lives only two doors away.You'll never eat a sack of salt with him.What business had you to sing those low songs, anyway?If he
hadn't taken me by surprise!An old frog like that before your eyes
of a sudden.Ach, please don't, Geert.I'm afraid that if Meneer
Bos----[Motions to Jelle to stop.]This one is afraid to sail, this one of the Matron of the Old
Men's Home, this one of a little ship owner!Forbids me in my own
house!Commands me as though I were a servant!Fun is fun, but if you were a ship owner, you wouldn't want
your sailors singing like socialists either.When he knows how dependent I am, too.Is it an
honor to do his cleaning!For mopping the office floor and
licking his muddy boots you get fifty cents twice a week and the
scraps off their plates.Oh, what a row I'll get Saturday!If you hadn't all your
life allowed this braggart who began with nothing to walk over you
and treat you as a slave, while father and my brothers lost their
lives on the sea making money for him, you'd give him a scolding and
damn his hide for his insolence in opening his jaw.Next
year Mother will give you pennies to play."Arise men, brothers,
all unite-e-ed"----

KNEIR.Stop tormenting your old mother on her birthday.[Jelle
holds out his hand.]Here, you can't stand on one leg.I'll wait a few minutes for Barend.The
boys will come by here any way.Don't you catch on that those two are--A good voyage.Have I staid so long--and my door ajar![Brusquely coming through the kitchen door.]Skipper Hengst has my orders.[Cobus
and Daantje slink away, stopping outside to listen at the window.]Yes, Meneer, he is all ready to go.That other boy of yours that Hengst engaged--refuses to go.[They bow in a
scared way and hastily go on.]This looks like a dive--drunkenness
and rioting.Mother's birthday or not, we do as we please here.You change your tone or----

GEERT.Ach--dear Geert--Don't take offense, Meneer--he's
quick tempered, and in anger one says----

BOS.Dirt is all the thanks you get for
being good to you people.If you're not on board in
ten minutes, I'll send the police for you!You send--what do you take me for, any way!What I take him for--he asks that--dares to ask----[To
Kneirtje.]You'll come to me again recommending a trouble-maker kicked
out by the Navy.You
pay wages and I do the work.You're just a big overgrown boy, that's all!If it wasn't for Mother--I'd----

KNEIR.Kneir, Kneir,
consider well what you do--I gave you an advance in good faith----

KNEIR.Ach, yes, Meneer--Ach, yes----

BOS.Yes, Meneer--you and the priest----

BOS.One of your sons refuses to go, the other--you'll come to a bad
end, my little friend.On board I'm a sailor--I'm the skipper
here.A ship owner layin' down the law; don't do
this and don't do that!Boring his nose through the window when you
don't sing to suit him.For my part, sing, but a sensible sailor expecting to marry ought
to appreciate it when his employer is looking out for his good.You
young fellows have no respect for grey hairs.for grey hairs that
have become grey in want and misery----

BOS.Your mother's seen me, as child,
standing before the bait trays.I also have stood in an East wind
that froze your ears, biting off bait heads----

GEERT.We don't care for your stories, Meneer.You have
become a rich man, and a tyrant.Good!--you are perhaps no worse than
the rest, but don't interfere with me in my own house.We may all become different, and perhaps my son may
live to see the day when he will come, as I did, twelve years ago,
crying to the office, to ask if there's any news of his father and
his two brothers!and not find their employer sitting by his warm fire
and his strong box, drinking grog.He may not be damned for coming so
often to ask the same thing, nor be turned from the door with snubs
and the message, "When there's anything to tell you'll hear of it."You lie--I never did anything of the sort.I won't soil any more words over it.My father's hair was grey, my mother's hair is grey, Jelle,
the poor devil who can't find a place in the Old Men's Home because
on one occasion in his life he was light-fingered--Jelle has also
grey hairs.If you hear him or crooked
Jacob, it's the same cuckoo song.But
now I'll give another word of advice, my friend, before you go under
sail.You have an old mother, you expect to marry, good; you've been
in prison six months--I won't talk of that; you have barked out your
insolence to me in your own house, but if you attempt any of this
talk on board the Hope you'll find out there is a muster roll.When you've become older--and wiser--you'll be ashamed of your
insolence--"the ship owner by his warm stove, and his grog"----

GEERT.And his strong box----

BOS.And his cares, you haven't the wits to understand!Who hauls the fish out of the sea?Who
risks his life every hour of the day?Who doesn't take off his
clothes in five or six weeks?Who walks with hands covered with salt
sores,--without water to wash face or hands?Who sleep like beasts
two in a bunk?Who leave wives and mothers behind to beg alms?Twelve
head of us are presently going to sea--we get twenty-five per cent
of the catch, you seventy-five.We do the work, you sit safely at
home.Your ship is insured, and we--we can go to the bottom in case
of accident--we are not worth insuring----

KNEIR.You should be a clown in a
circus!Twenty-seven per cent isn't enough for him----

GEERT.I'll never eat salted codfish from your generosity!Our whole
share is in "profit and loss."When luck is with us we each make eight
guilders a week, one guilder a day when we're lucky.One guilder a
day at sea, to prepare salt fish, cod with livers for the people in
the cities--hahaha!--a guilder a day--when you're lucky and don't go
to the bottom.You fellows know what you're about when you engage us
on shares.[Old and young heads of fishermen appear at the window.]And say to the skipper--no, never mind--I'll
be there myself----[A pause.]Now I'll
take two minutes more, blockhead, to rub under your nose something
I tried three times to say, but you gave me no chance to get in a
word.When you lie in your bunk tonight--as a beast, of course!--try
and think of my risks, by a poor catch--lost nets and cordage--by
damages and lightning in the mast, by running aground, and God knows
what else.The Jacoba's just had her hatches torn off, the Queen
Wilhelmina half her bulwarks washed away.You don't count that,
for you don't have to pay for it!Three months ago the Expectation
collided with a steamer.Without a thought of the catch or the nets,
the men sprang overboard, leaving the ship to drift!You laugh, boy, because you don't realize what cares I
have.On the Mathilde last week the men smuggled gin and tobacco in
their mattresses to sell to the English.If you were talking about conditions in Middelharnis or Pernis,
you'd have reason for it.My men don't pay the harbor costs, don't
pay for bait, towing, provisions, barrels, salt.I don't expect you
to pay the loss of the cordage, if a gaff or a boom breaks.I go into
my own pocket for it.I gave your mother an advance, your brother
Barend deserts.No, Meneer, I can't believe that.Hengst telephoned me from the harbor, else I wouldn't have
been here to be insulted by your oldest son, who's disturbing the
whole neighborhood roaring his scandalous songs!If you're not on board on time I'll apply "Article
Sixteen" and fine you twenty-five guilders.As for you, my wife doesn't need you at
present, you're all a bad lot here.Ach, Meneer, it isn't my fault!After this voyage you can look for
another employer, who enjoys throwing pearls before swine better than
I do!Don't hang your head so soon, Aunt!Geert was in the right----

KNEIR.Great God, if he should desert--if he
deserts--he also goes to prison--two sons who----

GEERT.Aren't you going to wish me a good voyage--or don't you think
that necessary?Yes, I'm coming----

JO.I'm sorry for her, the poor thing.You gave him a
talking to, didn't you?[Picks a geranium from a flower
pot.]And you will
think of me every night, will you?Truus saw him hanging around the house.If that coward refuses to go,
your sitting at home won't help a damn.Don't forget your chewing tobacco
and your cigars----

GEERT.If you're too late--I'll never look at you again!I'll shout the whole village together if you don't
immediately run and follow Geert and Jo.If you can keep Geert from going--call him back!Have you gone crazy with fear, you big coward?The Good Hope is no good, no good--her ribs are
rotten--the planking is rotten!----

KNEIR.Don't stand there telling stories to excuse yourself.Simon, the ship carpenter--that drunken sot who can't speak
two words.First you sign, then you
run away!Me--you may beat me to death!--but I won't go on an unseaworthy
ship!Hasn't the ship been lying in the
dry docks?There was no caulking her any more--Simon----

KNEIR.March, take your package of
chewing tobacco.I'm not going--I'm not going.You don't know--you
didn't see it!The last voyage she had a foot of water in her hold!A ship that has just returned from her fourth
voyage to the herring catch and that has brought fourteen loads!Has
it suddenly become unseaworthy, because you, you miserable coward,
are going along?I looked in the hold--the barrels were
floating.You can see death that is hiding down there.Bilge water, as in every ship!Tell that
to your grandmother, not to an old sailor's wife.Skipper Hengst
is a child, eh!Isn't Hengst going and Mees and Gerrit and Jacob
and Nellis--your own brother and Truus' little Peter?Do you claim
to know more than old seamen?I'm not going to
stand it to see you taken aboard by the police----

BAR.Oh, Mother dear, Mother dear, don't make me go!Oh, God; how you have punished me in my children--my children
are driving me to beggary.I've taken an advance--Bos has refused to
give me any more cleaning to do--and--and----[Firmly.]Well, then,
let them come for you--you'd better be taken than run away.Oh, oh,
that this should happen in my family----

BAR.You'll not get out----

BAR.I don't know what I'm doing--I might hurt----

KNEIR.Now he is brave, against his sixty year old mother----Raise
your hand if you dare![Falls on a chair shaking his head between his hands.]Oh, oh,
oh--If they take me aboard, you'll never see me again--you'll never
see Geert again----

KNEIR.It's tempting God to rave this
way with fear----[Friendlier tone.]Come, a man of your age must
not cry like a child--come!I wanted to surprise you with Father's
earrings--come!Mother dear--I don't dare--I don't dare--I shall drown--hide
me--hide me----

KNEIR.If I believed a word of your talk,
would I let Geert go?There's a
package of tobacco, and one of cigars.Now sit still, and I'll put
in your earrings--look--[Talking as to a child.]--real silver--ships
on them with sails--sit still, now--there's one--there's two--walk
to the looking glass----

BAR.No--no!----

KNEIR.Come now, you're making me weak for nothing--please,
dear boy--I do love you and your brother--you're all I have on
earth.Every night I will pray to the good God to bring you
home safely.You must get used to it, then you will become a brave
seaman--and--and----[Cries.][Holds the
mirror before him.]Look at your earrings--what?----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Coming in through door at left, good-natured
manner.]Skipper Hengst has requested the Police----If you please,
my little man, we have no time to lose.The ship--is rotten----

2ND POLICEMAN.Then you should not have
mustered in.[Taps him kindly
on the shoulder.][Clings desperately to the
bedstead and door jamb.]I shall
drown in the dirty, stinking sea!Oh God, Oh
God, Oh God![Crawls up against the wall, beside himself with terror.]The boy is afraid----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Sobbing as she seizes Barend's hands.]Come now, boy--come
now--God will not forsake you----

BAR.[Moaning as he loosens his hold, sobs despairingly.]You'll
never see me again, never again----

1ST POLICEMAN.[They exeunt, dragging Barend.]Oh, oh----

TRUUS.What was the matter,
Kneir?Barend had to be taken by the police.Oh, and now
I'm ashamed to go walk through the village, to tell them good bye--the
disgrace--the disgrace----

                                CURTAIN.A lighted lamp--the illuminated
chimney gives a red glow.Kneirtje lying on bed, dressed, Jo reading
to her from prayerbook.]in piteousness,
      To your poor children of the sea,
    Reach down your arms in their distress;
      With God their intercessor be.Unto the Heart Divine your prayer
    Will make an end to all their care."[A
knock--she tiptoes to cook-shed door, puts her finger to her lips in
warning to Clementine and Kaps, who enter.]She's not herself yet,
feverish and coughing.I've brought her a plate of soup, and a half dozen
eggs.I've brought you some veal soup, Kneir.I'd like to see you carry a full pan with the sand blowing in
your eyes.There's five--and--[Looking at his hand, which drips with egg
yolk.][Bringing out his handkerchief and purse covered with egg.]He calls that putting them away
carefully.My purse, my handkerchief, my cork screw.I don't know why Father keeps that bookkeeper, deaf,
and cross.They haven't
forgotten the row with your sons yet.Mouth shut, or I'll get a
scolding.May Jo go to the beach with me to look at the sea?Go on the beach in such a
storm!I got a tap aft that struck the spot.The tree beside the pig stye was broken in two like a pipe stem.Did it come down on the pig stye?Uncle Cobus,
how do you come to be out, after eight o'clock, in this beastly
weather?The beans and pork gravy he ate----

CLEMENTINE.Beans and pork gravy for a sick old man?The matron broils him a chicken or a beefsteak--Eh?She's
even cross because she's got to beat an egg for his breakfast.This
afternoon he was delirious, talking of setting out the nets, and paying
out the buoy line.I sez to the matron, "His time's come.""Look out or
yours'll come," sez she.I sez, "The doctor should be sent for.""Mind
your own business," sez she, "am I the Matron or are you?"Then I
sez, "You're the matron."Just now, she sez,
"You'd better go for the doctor."As if it couldn't a been done this
afternoon.I go to the doctor and the doctor's out of town.Now I've
been to Simon to take me to town in his dog car.If drunken Simon drives, you're likely to roll off
the <DW18>.Must the doctor ride in the dog
car?Go on, now, tell us the rest.What I want to say is, that it's a blessing for Daantje he's
out of his head, 'fraid as he's always been of death.That's all in the way you look at it.If my time
should come tomorrow, then, I think, we must all!The waters of the sea
will not wash away that fact.On the fifth
day He created the Sea, great whales and the moving creatures that
abound therein, and said: "Be fruitful," and He blessed them.That
was evening and that was morning, that was the fifth day.And on the
sixth day He created man and said also: "Be fruitful," and blessed
them.That was again evening and again morning, that was the sixth
day.When I was on the herring
catch, or on the salting voyage, there were times when I didn't dare
use the cleaning knife.Because when you shove a herring's head
to the left with your thumb, and you lift out the gullet with the
blade, the creature looks at you with such knowing eyes, and yet
you clean two hundred in an hour.And when you cut throats out of
fourteen hundred cod, that makes twenty-eight hundred eyes that look
at you!I had few
equals in boning and cutting livers.Tja, tja, and how afraid they all
were!They looked up at the clouds as if they were saying:
"How about this now.I say:
we take the fish and God takes us.We must all, the beasts must,
and the men must, and because we all must, none of us should--now,
that's just as if you'd pour a full barrel into an empty one.I'd
be afraid to be left alone in the empty barrel, with every one else
in the other barrel.No, being afraid is no good; being afraid is
standing on your toes and looking over the edge.You act as if you'd had
a dram.Am I right about the pig
stye or not?Hear how the poor animal is going on out there.I'm sure
the wall has fallen in.You pour yourself out a bowl, Uncle Cobus!I'll give her a
helping hand.Cobus, I'll thank God when the Good Hope is safely in.But the Hope is an old ship,
and old ships are the last to go down.No, that's what every old sailor says.All the same, I shall pray
God tonight.But the Jacoba is out and the
Mathilda is out and the Expectation is out.The Good Hope is rotten--so--so----[Stops anxiously.]That's what----Why--that's what----I thought----It just
occurred to me.If the Good Hope was rotten, then your father would----

CLEMENTINE.Oh, shut your fool mouth, you'll make Kneir anxious.Quick,
Kneir, shut the door, for the lamp.How scared Barend will be, and just as
they're homeward bound.The evening is still so long and
so gloomy--Yes?[Enter Simon and Marietje, who is crying.]Stop your damn
howling----

KNEIRTJE.Her lover is also--be a good seaman's
wife.You girls haven't had any trouble
yet!If it wasn't for Daan----

JO.Here, this will warm you up, Simon.It's happened to me before
with the dog car, in a tempest like this.And when the
doctor came, Katrien was dead and the child was dead, but if you ask
me, I'd rather sit in my dog car tonight than to be on the sea.No, don't let us waste our time.Let's talk, then we won't
think of anything.Last night was stormy, too, and I had such a bad dream.I can't rightly say it was a dream.There was a rap on the
window, once.Soon as I lay down there came another rap, so.[Raps on
the table with her knuckles.]And then I saw Mees, his face was pale,
pale as--God!Each time--like that, so----[Raps.]You stupid, you, to scare the old woman into a fit with your
raps.My ears and neck full of sand, and it's
cold.Just throw a couple of blocks on the fire.I couldn't stand it at home either, children asleep, no one
to talk to, and the howling of the wind.Two mooring posts were
washed away.What's that to us----Milk and sugar?Your little son was a brave boy, Truus.I can see him
now as he stood waving good-bye.Yes, that boy's a treasure, barely twelve.You
should have seen him two and a half months ago.The child behaved like an angel, just like a grown
man.He would sit up evenings to chat with me, the child knows more
than I do.The lamb, hope he's not been awfully sea sick.Now, you may not believe it, but red spectacles
keep you from being sea sick.You're like the doctors, they let others swallow their doses.Many's the night I've slept on board; when my husband was
alive I went along on many a voyage.Should like to have seen you in oil skins.Hear, now, the young lady is flattering me.I'm not so bad
looking as that, Miss.Now and then, when things
didn't go to suit him, without speaking ill of the dead, I may say,
he couldn't keep his paws at home; then he'd smash things.I still
have a coffee pot without a handle I keep as a remembrance.--I wouldn't
part with it for a rix dollar.I won't even offer you a guilder!Say, you're such a funny story teller, tell us about the Harlemmer
oil, Saart.Yes, if it hadn't been for Harlemmer oil I might not have been
a widow.Now, then, my man was a comical chap.I'd bought him a knife in a leather sheath, paid a good price
for it too, and when he'd come back in five weeks and I'd ask him:
"Jacob, have you lost your knife?"he'd say, "I don't know about my
knife--you never gave me a knife."But
when he'd undress himself for the first time in five weeks, and pulled
off his rubber boots, bang, the knife would fall on the floor.He
hadn't felt it in all that time.Didn't take off his rubber boots in five weeks?Then I had to scrub 'im with soap and soda; he hadn't seen
water, and covered with vermin.Wish I could get a cent a dozen for all the lice on board;
they get them thrown in with their share of the cargo.Now
then, his last voyage a sheet of water threw him against the bulwarks
just as they pulled the mizzen staysail to larboard, and his leg was
broke.Then they were in a fix--The skipper could poultice and cut a
corn, but he couldn't mend a broken leg.Then they wanted to shove a
plank under it, but Jacob wanted Harlemmer oil rubbed on his leg.Every
day he had them rub it with Harlemmer oil, and again Harlemmer oil,
and some more Harlemmer oil.When they came in
his leg was a sight.You shouldn't have asked me to tell it.Now, yes; you can't bring the dead back to life.And when you
think of it, it's a dirty shame I can't marry again.A year later
the Changeable went down with man and mouse.Then, bless me, you'd
suppose, as your husband was dead, for he'd gone along with his leg
and a half, you could marry another man.First you must
advertise for him in the newspapers three times, and then if in three
times he don't turn up, you may go and get a new license.I don't think I'll ever marry again.That's not surprisin' when you've been married twice already;
if you don't know the men by this time.I wish I could talk about things the way you do.With my first it was a horror; with my second you know
yourselves.I could sit up all night hearing tales of
the sea.Don't tell stories of suffering and death----

SAART.[Quietly knitting and speaking in a toneless voice.]Ach,
it couldn't have happened here, Kneir.We lived in Vlaardingen then,
and I'd been married a year without any children.No, Pietje was Ari's
child--and he went away on the Magnet.And you understand what happened;
else I wouldn't have got acquainted with Ari and be living next door
to you now.The Magnet stayed on the sands or some other place.But
I didn't know that then, and so didn't think of it.Now in Vlaardingen they have a tower and on the tower a lookout.And this lookout hoists a red ball when he sees a lugger or
a trawler or other boat in the distance.And when he sees who it
is, he lets down the ball, runs to the ship owner and the families
to warn them; that's to say: the Albert Koster or the Good Hope is
coming.Now mostly he's no need to warn the family.For, as soon as
the ball is hoisted in the tower, the children run in the streets
shouting, I did it, too, as a child: "The ball is up!Then the women run, and wait below for the lookout to come down,
and when it's their ship they give him pennies.And--and--the Magnet with my first
husband, didn't I say I'd been married a year?The Magnet stayed out
seven weeks--with provisions for six--and each time the children
shouted: "The ball is up, Truus!Then I
ran like mad to the tower.They all knew why
I ran, and when the lookout came down I could have torn the words
out of his mouth.But I would say: "Have you tidings--tidings of
the Magnet?"Then he'd say: "No, it's the Maria," or the Alert,
or the Concordia, and then I'd drag myself away slowly, so slowly,
crying and thinking of my husband.And each day, when
the children shouted, I got a shock through my brain, and each day I
stood by the tower, praying that God--but the Magnet did not come--did
not come.At the last I didn't dare to go to the tower any more when
the ball was hoisted.No longer dared to stand at the door waiting,
if perhaps the lookout himself would bring the message.That lasted
two months--two months--and then--well, then I believed it.Now, that's so short a time since.Ach, child, I'd love to talk about it to every
one, all day long.When you've been left with six children--a good
man--never gave me a harsh word--never.Had it happened six
days later they would have brought him in.They smell when there's
a corpse aboard.Yes, that's true, you never see them otherwise.You'll never marry a fisherman, Miss; but it's sad,
sad; God, so sad!when they lash your dear one to a plank, wrapped in
a piece of sail with a stone in it, three times around the big mast,
and then, one, two, three, in God's name.No, I wasn't thinking of Mees, I was thinking of my little
brother, who was also drowned.Wasn't that on the herring catch?His second voyage, a blow
from the fore sail, and he lay overboard.The
skipper reached him the herring shovel, but it was smooth and it
slipped from his hands.Then Jerusalem, the mate, held out the broom
to him--again he grabbed hold.The three of them pulled him up; then
the broom gave way, he fell back into the waves, and for the third
time the skipper threw him a line.God wanted my little brother, the
line broke, and the end went down with him to the bottom of the sea.frightful!--Grabbed it three times, and lost
it three times.As if the child knew what was coming in the morning, he had
lain crying all night.Crying for Mother, who was
sick.When the skipper tried to console him, he said: "No, skipper,
even if Mother does get well, I eat my last herring today."No, truly, Miss, when he came back from Pieterse's with the
money, Toontje's share of the cargo as rope caster, eighteen guilders
and thirty-five cents for five and a half weeks.Then he simply acted
insane, he threw the money on the ground, then he cursed at--I won't
repeat what--at everything.Mother's sickness and burial
had cost a lot.Eighteen guilders is a heap of money, a big heap.Eighteen guilders for your child, eighteen--[Listening in alarm
to the blasts of the wind.]No, say, Hahaha!----

KNEIRTJE.Sandra travelled to the office.Yes, yes, if the water could
only speak.Come now, you tell a tale of the sea.Ach, Miss, life on the sea is no tale.Nothing
between yourself and eternity but the thickness of a one-inch
plank.It's hard on the men, and hard on the women.Yesterday I passed
by the garden of the Burgomaster.They sat at table and ate cod from
which the steam was rising, and the children sat with folded hands
saying grace.Then, thought I, in my ignorance--if it was wrong, may
God forgive me--that it wasn't right of the Burgomaster--not right
of him--and not right of the others.For the wind blew so hard out
of the East, and those fish came out of the same water in which our
dead--how shall I say it?--in which our dead--you understand me.It is our living,
and we must not rebel against our living.When the lead was dropped he could tell by the taste of the
sand where they were.Often in the night he'd say we are on the 56th
and on the 56th they'd be.Once
he drifted about two days and nights in a boat with two others.That
was the time they were taking in the net and a fog came up so thick
they couldn't see the buoys, let alone find the lugger.Later when the boat went to pieces--you should
have heard him tell it--how he and old Dirk swam to an overturned
rowboat; he climbed on top."I'll never forget that night," said
he.Dirk was too old or tired to get a hold.Then my husband stuck
his knife into the boat.Dirk tried to grasp it as he was sinking,
and he clutched in such a way that three of his fingers hung
down.Then at the risk of his own life,
my husband pulled Dirk up onto the overturned boat.So the two of
them drifted in the night, and Dirk--old Dirk--from loss of blood
or from fear, went insane.He sat and glared at my husband with the
eyes of a cat.He raved of the devil that was in him.Of Satan, and
the blood, my husband said, ran all over the boat--the waves were
kept busy washing it away.Just at dawn Dirk slipped off, insane
as he was.My man was picked up by a freighter that sailed by.But
it was no use, three years later--that's twelve years ago now--the
Clementine--named after you by your father--stranded on the Doggerbanks
with him and my two oldest.Of what happened to them, I know nothing,
nothing at all.Never a buoy, or a hatch, washed ashore.You can't realize it at first, but after so many years one
can't recall their faces any more, and that's a blessing.For hard it
would be if one remembered.Every sailor's
wife has something like this in her family, it's not new.Truus is
right: "The fish are dearly paid for."We are all in God's hands, and God is great and good.[Beating her
head with her fists.]You're all driving me mad, mad, mad!Her husband and her little brother--and my poor
uncle--those horrible stories--instead of cheering us up!My father was drowned, drowned, drowned,
drowned!There are others--all--drowned, drowned!--and--you are all
miserable wretches--you are![Violently bangs the door shut as she
runs out.]No, child, she will quiet down by herself.Nervous strain
of the last two days.It has grown late, Kneir, and your niece--your niece was a
little unmannerly.Thank you again, Miss, for the soup and eggs.Are you coming to drink a bowl with me tomorrow night?If you see Jo send her in at once.[All go out except
Kneirtje.A fierce wind howls, shrieking
about the house.She listens anxiously at the window, shoves her
chair close to the chimney, stares into the fire.Her lips move in
a muttered prayer while she fingers a rosary.Jo enters, drops into
a chair by the window and nervously unpins her shawl.]And that dear child that came out in the storm to bring me
soup and eggs.Your sons are out in the storm for her and her father.Half the guard
rail is washed away, the pier is under water.You never went on like this
when Geert sailed with the Navy.In a month or two
it will storm again; each time again.And there are many fishermen on
the sea besides our boys.[Her speech sinks into a soft murmur.Her
old fingers handle the rosary.]Barend, we almost drove him away![Seeing that Kneirtje prays, she walks to the window wringing
her hands, pulls up the curtain uncertainly, stares through the window
panes.The wind blows the
curtain on high, the lamp dances, the light puffs out.oh!----

KNEIRTJE.[Jo
lights the lamp, shivering with fear.][To Jo,
who crouches sobbing by the chimney.]If anything happens--then--then----

KNEIRTJE.Now, I ask you, how will it be when you're married?You don't know
what you say, Aunt Kneir!If Geert--[Stops, panting.]That was not
good of you--not good--to have secrets.Your lover--your husband--is
my son.Don't stare that way into the
fire.Even if
it was wrong of you and of him.Come and sit opposite to me, then
together we will--[Lays her prayerbook on the table.]If anything happens----

KNEIRTJE.If anything--anything--anything--then I'll never pray
again, never again.No Mother Mary--then there
is nothing--nothing----

KNEIRTJE.[Opens the prayerbook, touches Jo's arm.Jo looks up, sobbing
passionately, sees the prayerbook, shakes her head fiercely.Again
wailing, drops to the floor, which she beats with her hands.Kneirtje's
trembling voice sounds.][The wind races with wild lashings about the house.]Left, office door, separated from the
main office by a wooden railing.Between this door and railing are
two benches; an old cupboard.In the background; three windows with
view of the sunlit sea.In front of the middle window a standing
desk and high stool.Right, writing table with telephone--a safe,
an inside door.On the walls, notices of wreckage, insurance, maps,
etc.[Kaps, Bos and Mathilde discovered.]Clemens!----

KAPS.: 2,447 ribs, marked Kusta; ten sail sheets, marked 'M."Four deck beams, two spars, five"----

MATHILDE.I have written the circular for the tower
bell.Connect me with the
Burgomaster!Up to my ears
in--[Sweetly.]My little wife asks----

MATHILDE.If Mevrouw will come to the telephone about the circular.If Mevrouw
will come to the telephone a moment?Just so, Burgomaster,--the
ladies--hahaha!Then it can go to the
printers.Do you think I
haven't anything on my mind!That damned----

MATHILDE.No,
she can't come to the telephone herself, she doesn't know
how.My wife has written the circular for
the tower bell."You are no doubt acquainted with the new church."--She
says, "No," the stupid!I am reading, Mevrouw, again."You are no
doubt acquainted with the new church.The church has, as you know,
a high tower; that high tower points upward, and that is good, that is
fortunate, and truly necessary for many children of our generation"----

MATHILDE.Pardon, I was speaking to
my bookkeeper.Yes--yes--ha, ha, ha--[Reads again
from paper.]"But that tower could do something else that also is
good.It can mark the time for us children of the
times.It stands there since 1882 and has never
answered to the question, 'What time is it?'It
was indeed built for it, there are four places visible for faces;
for years in all sorts of ways"--Did you say anything?No?--"for years
the wish has been expressed by the surrounding inhabitants that they
might have a clock--About three hundred guilders are needed.The Committee, Mevrouw"--What did you say?Yes, you know the
names, of course.Yes--Yes--All the ladies of
the Committee naturally sign for the same amount, a hundred guilders
each?Yes--Yes--Very well--My wife will be at home, Mevrouw.Damned nonsense!--a hundred guilders gone to the devil!What
is it to you if there's a clock on the damn thing or not?I'll let you fry in your own fat.She'll be here in her carriage in quarter of an hour.If you drank less grog in the evenings
you wouldn't have such a bad temper in the mornings.You took five guilders out of my purse this morning
while I was asleep.I can keep no----

MATHILDE.Bah, what a man, who counts his money before he goes to bed!Very well, don't give it--Then I can treat the Burgomaster's
wife to a glass of gin presently--three jugs of old gin and not a
single bottle of port or sherry![Bos angrily throws down two rix
dollars.]If it wasn't for me you wouldn't
be throwing rix dollars around!--Bah!IJmuiden, 24 December--Today there were four sloops
in the market with 500 to 800 live and 1,500 to 2,100 dead haddock
and some--live cod--The live cod brought 7 1/4--the dead----

BOS.The dead haddock brought thirteen and a half guilders a basket.Take
your book--turn to the credit page of the Expectation----

KAPS.no--the Good Hope?--We can whistle for her.Fourteen hundred and forty-three guilders and forty-seven cents.How could you be so ungodly stupid, to deduct four
guilders, 88, for the widows and orphans' fund?--1,443--3 per cent off--that's
1,400--that's gross three hundred and 87 guilders--yes, it should be
three guilders, 88, instead of four, 88.If you're going into your dotage, Jackass!There might be something to say against
that, Meneer--you didn't go after me when, when----

BOS.Now, that'll do, that'll do!----

KAPS.And that was an error with a couple of big ciphers after it.[Bos
goes off impatiently at right.]It all depends on what side----

[Looks around, sees Bos is gone, pokes up the fire; fills his pipe from
Bos's tobacco jar, carefully steals a couple of cigars from his box.]Mynheer Bos, eh?--no.Meneer said
that when he got news, he----

SIMON.The Jacoba came in after fifty-nine days' lost time.You are--You know more than you let on.Then it's time--I know more, eh?I'm holding off the ships by
ropes, eh?I warned you folks when that ship lay in the docks.What were
the words I spoke then, eh?All tales on your part for a glass
of gin!You was there, and the Miss was there.I says,
"The ship is rotten, that caulking was damn useless.That a floating
coffin like that"----

KAPS.Are
you so clever that when you're half drunk----

SIMON.Not drunk then, are you such an authority, you a shipmaster's
assistant, that when you say "no," and the owner and the Insurance
Company say "yes," my employer must put his ship in the dry docks?And now, I say--now, I say--that
if Mees, my daughter's betrothed, not to speak of the others, if
Mees--there will be murder.I'll be back in ten
minutes.[Goes back to his desk; the telephone rings.Mynheer
will be back in ten minutes.Mynheer Bos just went round the
corner.How lucky that outside of the children there were three
unmarried men on board.Or you'll break Meneer's
cigars.Kaps, do you want to make a guilder?I'm engaged to Bol, the skipper.He's lying here, with a load of peat for the city.I can't; because they don't know if my husband's dead.The legal limit is----

SAART.You must summons him, 'pro Deo,' three times in the papers and
if he doesn't come then, and that he'll not do, for there aren't any
more ghosts in the world, then you can----

SAART.Now, if you'd attend to this little matter, Bol and I would
always be grateful to you.When your common sense tells you
I haven't seen Jacob in three years and the----

[Cobus enters, trembling with agitation.]There must be tidings of the boys--of--of--the
Hope.Now, there is no use in your coming
to this office day after day.I haven't any good news to give you,
the bad you already know.Sixty-two days----

COB.Ach, ach, ach; Meneer Kaps,
help us out of this uncertainty.My sister--and my niece--are simply
insane with grief.My niece is sitting alone at home--my sister is at the Priest's,
cleaning house.There must be something--there must be something.The water bailiff's clerk said--said--Ach, dear God----[Off.]after that storm--all things
are possible.No, I wouldn't give a cent for it.If they had run into an English harbor, we would have
had tidings.[Laying her sketch book on Kaps's desk.]That's the way he was three months ago,
hale and jolly.No, Miss, I haven't the time.Daantje's death was a blow to him--you always saw them together,
always discussing.Now he hasn't a friend in the "Home"; that makes
a big difference.Well, that's Kneir, that's Barend with the basket on his back,
and that's--[The telephone bell rings.How long
will he be, Kaps?A hatch marked
47--and--[Trembling.][Screams and lets the
receiver fall.]I don't dare listen--Oh, oh!Barend?----Barend?----

CLEMENTINE.A telegram from Nieuwediep.A hatch--and a corpse----

[Enter Bos.]The water bailiff is on the 'phone.The water bailiff?--Step aside--Go along, you!I--I--[Goes timidly off.]A
telegram from Nieuwediep?47?--Well,
that's damned--miserable--that!the corpse--advanced stage of
decomposition!Barend--mustered in as oldest boy!by--oh!--The Expectation has come into Nieuwediep disabled?And
did Skipper Maatsuiker recognize him?So it isn't necessary to send any
one from here for the identification?Yes, damned sad--yes--yes--we
are in God's hand--Yes--yes--I no longer had any doubts--thank
you--yes--I'd like to get the official report as soon as possible.I
will inform the underwriters, bejour!I
never expected to hear of the ship again.Yes--yes--yes--yes--[To Clementine.]What stupidity to repeat what you heard in that woman's
presence.It won't be five minutes now till half the village is
here!You sit there, God save me, and take
on as if your lover was aboard----

CLEMENTINE.When Simon, the shipbuilder's assistant----

BOS.And if he hadn't been, what right have you to stick
your nose into matters you don't understand?Dear God, now I am also guilty----

BOS.Have the novels you read gone to
your head?Are you possessed, to use those words after such
an accident?He said that the ship was a floating coffin.Then I heard
you say that in any case it would be the last voyage for the Hope.That damned boarding school; those damned
boarding school fads!Walk if you like through the village like a fool,
sketching the first rascal or beggar you meet!But don't blab out
things you can be held to account for.Say, rather,

it murders so many people.[To Jo and Cobus, who sit alone in a dazed way.]We have just run from home--for Saart just as I

BOS.You're not worth an answer, you sot!My employer--doesn't do the caulking himself.[To Kaps, who
has advanced to the gate.]Didn't I warn him?--wasn't you there?No, I wasn't there, and even if I
was, I didn't hear anything.Did that drunken sot----

SIMON.That's low--that's low--damned low!I said, the ship was
rotten--rotten----

BOS.You're trying to drag in my bookkeeper

COB.Yes, but--yes, but--now I remember also----

BOS.But your daughter--your daughter
says now that she hadn't heard the ship was rotten.And on the second
night of the storm, when she was alone with me at my sister Kneirtje's,
she did say that--that----

CLEMENTINE.Did I--say----

COB.These are my own words
to you: "Now you are fibbing, Miss; for if your father knew the Good
Hope was rotten"----

JO.[Springing up wildly, speaking with piercing distinctness.]I
was there, and Truus was there, and----Oh, you adders!Who
gives you your feed, year in, year out?Haven't you decency enough to
believe us instead of that drunken beggar who reels as he stands there?You had Barend dragged on board by the police; Geert was too
proud to be taken!No,
no, you needn't point to your door!If I staid here
any longer I would spit in your face--spit in your face!For your Aunt's sake I will consider that you
are overwrought; otherwise--otherwise----The Good Hope was seaworthy,
was seaworthy!And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating
coffin like that.Geert and Barend and Mees and the

your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't

mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your

he places on desk--Bos motions to her to go.]Let her wait a while,

for a moment, and returns with a dish and an enamelled pan.]If you will return the dish when it's convenient,
and if you'll come again Saturday, to do the cleaning.He closes her nerveless hands about the dish and pan;
shuffles back to his stool.Kneirtje sits motionless,

stumbles out of the office.]Appeal, for the

on Bos's desk, he reads.]"Benevolent Fellow Countrymen: Again we
urge upon your generosity an appeal in behalf of a number of destitute

pretends that the lower classes adored fishes, snakes, tigers and other
abject animals, "even the devil himself, which appeared to them in
horrible forms" ("Historia de Yucatan," book IV., chap.Judging from the sculptures and mural paintings, the higher classes in
_Mayab_ wore, in very remote ages, dresses of quite an elaborate
character.Their under garment consisted of short trowsers, reaching the
middle of the thighs.At times these trowsers were highly ornamented
with embroideries and fringes, as they formed their only article of
clothing when at home; over these they wore a kind of kilt, very similar
to that used by the inhabitants of the Highlands in Scotland.It was
fastened to the waist with wide ribbons, tied behind in a knot forming a
large bow, the ends of which reached to the ankles.Their shoulders
were covered with a tippet falling to the elbows, and fastened on the
chest by means of a brooch.Their feet were protected by sandals, kept
in place by ropes or ribbons, passing between the big toe and the next,
and between the third and fourth, then brought up so as to encircle the
ankles.They were tied in front, forming a bow on the instep.Some wore
leggings, others garters and anklets made of feathers, generally yellow;
sometimes, however, they may have been of gold.Their head gears were of
different kinds, according to their rank and dignity.Warriors seem to
have used wide bands, tied behind the head with two knots, as we see in
the statue of Chaacmol, and in the bas-reliefs that adorn the queen's
chamber at Chichen.The king's coiffure was a peaked cap, that seems to
have served as model for the _pschent_, that symbol of domination over
the lower Egypt; with this difference, however, that in Mayab the point
formed the front, and in Egypt the back.The common people in Mayab, as in Egypt, were indeed little troubled by
their garments.These consisted merely of a simple girdle tied round the
loins, the ends falling before and behind to the middle of the thighs.Sometimes they also used the short trowsers; and, when at work, wrapped
a piece of cloth round their loins, long enough to cover their legs to
the knees.This costume was completed by wearing a square cloth, tied on
one of the shoulders by two of its corners.To-day
the natives of Yucatan wear the same dress, with but slight
modifications.While the aborigines of the _Tierra de Guerra_, who still
preserve the customs of their forefathers, untainted by foreign
admixture, use the same garments, of their own manufacture, that we see
represented in the bas-reliefs of Chichen and Uxmal, and in the mural
paintings of _Mayab_ and Egypt.Divination by the inspection of the entrails of victims, and the study
of omens were considered by the Egyptians as important branches of
learning.The soothsayers formed a respected order of the priesthood.From the mural paintings at Chichen, and from the works of the
chroniclers, we learn that the Mayas also had several manners of
consulting fate.One of the modes was by the inspection of the entrails
of victims; another by the manner of the cracking of the shell of a
turtle or armadillo by the action of fire, as among the Chinese.(In the
_Hong-fan_ or "the great and sublime doctrine," one of the books of the
_Chou-king_, the ceremonies of _Pou_ and _Chi_ are described at length).The Mayas had also their astrologers and prophets.Several prophecies,
purporting to have been made by their priests, concerning the preaching
of the Gospel among the people of Mayab, have reached us, preserved in
the works of Landa, Lizana, and Cogolludo.There we also read that, even
at the time of the Spanish conquest, they came from all parts of the
country, and congregated at the shrine of _Kinich-kakmo_, the deified
daughter of CAN, to listen to the oracles delivered by her through the
mouths of her priests and consult her on future events.By the
examination of the mural paintings, we know that _animal magnetism_ was
understood and practiced by the priests, who, themselves, seem to have
consulted clairvoyants.The learned priests of Egypt are said to have made considerable progress
in astronomical sciences.The _gnomon_, discovered by me in December, last year, in the ruined
city of Mayapan, would tend to prove that the learned men of Mayab were
not only close observers of the march of the celestial bodies and good
mathematicians; but that their attainments in astronomy were not
inferior to those of their brethren of Chaldea.Effectively the
construction of the gnomon shows that they had found the means of
calculating the latitude of places, that they knew the distance of the
solsticeal points from the equator; they had found that the greatest
angle of declination of the sun, 23 deg.27', occurred when that
luminary reached the tropics where, during nearly three days, said angle
of declination does not vary, for which reason they said that the _sun_
had arrived at his resting place.The Egyptians, it is said, in very remote ages, divided the year by
lunations, as the Mayas, who divided their civil year into eighteen
months, of twenty days, that they called U--moon--to which they added
five supplementary days, that they considered unlucky.From an epoch so
ancient that it is referred to the fabulous time of their history, the
Egyptians adopted the solar year, dividing it into twelve months, of
thirty days, to which they added, at the end of the last month, called
_Mesore_, five days, named _Epact_.By a most remarkable coincidence, the Egyptians, as the Mayas,
considered these additive five days _unlucky_.Besides this solar year they had a sideral or sothic year, composed of
365 days and 6 hours, which corresponds exactly to the Mayas[TN-25]
sacred year, that Landa tells us was also composed of 365 days and 6
hours; which they represented in the gnomon of Mayapan by the line that
joins the centers of the stela that forms it.The Egyptians, in their computations, calculated by a system of _fives_
and _tens_; the Mayas by a system of _fives_ and _twenties_, to four
hundred.Their sacred number appears to have been 13 from the remotest
antiquity, but SEVEN seems to have been a _mystic number_ among them as
among the Hindoos, Aryans, Chaldeans, Egyptians, and other nations.The Egyptians made use of a septenary system in the arrangement of the
grand gallery in the center of the great pyramid.Each side of the wall
is made of seven courses of finely polished stones, the one above
overlapping that below, thus forming the triangular ceiling common to
all the edifices in Yucatan.This gallery is said to be seven times the
height of the other passages, and, as all the rooms in Uxmal, Chichen
and other places in Mayab, it is seven-sided.Some authors pretend to
assume that this well marked septenary system has reference to the
_Pleiades_ or _Seven stars_._Alcyone_, the central star of the group,
being, it is said, on the same meridian as the pyramid, when it was
constructed, and _Alpha_ of Draconis, the then pole star, at its lower
culmination.Joseph A. Seiss and others pretend, the scientific
attainments required for the construction of such enduring monument
surpassed those of the learned men of Egypt, we must, of necessity,
believe that the architect who conceived the plan and carried out its
designs must have acquired his knowledge from an older people,
possessing greater learning than the priests of Memphis; unless we try
to persuade ourselves, as the reverend gentleman wishes us to, that the
great pyramid was built under the direct inspiration of the Almighty.Nearly all the monuments of Yucatan bear evidence that the Mayas had a
predilection for number SEVEN.Since we find that their artificial
mounds were composed of seven superposed platforms; that the city of
Uxmal contained seven of these mounds; that the north side of the palace
of King CAN was adorned with seven turrets; that the entwined serpents,
his totem, which adorn the east facade of the west wing of this
building, have seven rattles; that the head-dress of kings and queens
were adorned with seven blue feathers; in a word, that the number SEVEN
prevails in all places and in everything where Maya influence has
predominated.It is a FACT, and one that may not be altogether devoid of significance,
that this number SEVEN seems to have been the mystic number of many of
the nations of antiquity.It has even reached our times as such, being
used as symbol[TN-26] by several of the secret societies existing among
us.If we look back through the vista of ages to the dawn of civilized life
in the countries known as the _old world_, we find this number SEVEN
among the Asiatic nations as well as in Egypt and Mayab.Effectively, in
Babylon, the celebrated temple of _the seven lights_ was made of _seven_
stages or platforms.In the hierarchy of Mazdeism, the _seven marouts_,
or genii of the winds, the _seven amschaspands_; then among the Aryans
and their descendants, the _seven horses_ that drew the chariot of the
sun, the _seven apris_ or shape of the flame, the _seven rays_ of Agni,
the _seven manons_ or criators of the Vedas; among the Hebrews, the
_seven days_ of the creation, the _seven lamps_ of the ark and of
Zacharias's vision, the _seven branches_ of the golden candlestick, the
_seven days_ of the feast of the dedication of the temple of Solomon,
the _seven years_ of plenty, the _seven years_ of famine; in the
Christian dispensation, the _seven_ churches with the _seven_ angels at
their head, the _seven_ golden candlesticks, the _seven seals_ of the
book, the _seven_ trumpets of the angels, the _seven heads_ of the beast
that rose from the sea, the _seven vials_ full of the wrath of God, the
_seven_ last plagues of the Apocalypse; in the Greek mythology, the
_seven_ heads of the hydra, killed by Hercules, etc.The origin of the prevalence of that number SEVEN amongst all the
nations of earth, even the most remote from each other, has never been
satisfactorily explained, each separate people giving it a different
interpretation, according to their belief and to the tenets of their
religious creeds.As far as the Mayas are concerned, I think to have
found that it originated with the _seven_ members of CAN'S family, who
were the founders of the principal cities of _Mayab_, and to each of
whom was dedicated a mound in Uxmal and a turret in their palace.Their
names, according to the inscriptions carved on the monuments raised by
them at Uxmal and Chichen, were--CAN (serpent) and [C]OZ (bat), his
wife, from whom were born CAY (fish), the pontiff; AAK (turtle), who
became the governor of Uxmal; CHAACMOL (leopard), the warrior, who
became the husband of his sister MOO (macaw), the Queen of _Chichen_,
worshiped after her death at Izamal; and NICTE (flower), the priestess
who, under the name of _Zuhuy-Kuk_, became the goddess of the maidens.The Egyptians, in expressing their ideas in writing, used three
different kinds of characters--phonetic, ideographic and
symbolic--placed either in vertical columns or in horizontal lines, to
be read from right to left, from left to right, as indicated by the
position of the figures of men or animals.So, also, the Mayas in their
writings employed phonetic, symbolic and ideographic signs, combining
these often, forming monograms as we do to-day, placing them in such a
manner as best suited the arrangement of the ornamentation of the facade
of the edifices.At present we can only speak with certainty of the
monumental inscriptions, the books that fell in the hands of the
ecclesiastics at the time of the conquest having been destroyed.No
truly genuine written monuments of the Mayas are known to exist, except
those inclosed within the sealed apartments, where the priests and
learned men of MAYAB hid them from the _Nahualt_ or _Toltec_ invaders.As the Egyptians, they wrote in vertical columns and horizontal lines,
to be read generally from right to left.The space of this small essay
does not allow me to enter in more details; they belong naturally to a
work of different nature.Let it therefore suffice, for the present
purpose, to state that the comparative study of the language of the
Mayas led us to suspect that, as it contains words belonging to nearly
all the known languages of antiquity, and with exactly the same meaning,
in their mode of writing might be found letters or characters or signs
used in those tongues.Studying with attention the photographs made by
us of the inscriptions of Uxmal and Chichen, we were not long in
discovering that our surmises were indeed correct.The inscriptions,
written in squares or parallelograms, that might well have served as
models for the ancient hieratic Chaldeans, of the time of King Uruck,
seem to contain ancient Chaldee, Egyptian and Etruscan characters,
together with others that seem to be purely Mayab.Applying these known characters to the decipherment of the inscriptions,
giving them their accepted value, we soon found that the language in
which they are written is, in the main, the vernacular of the aborigines
of Yucatan and other parts of Central America to-day.Of course, the
original mother tongue having suffered some alterations, in consequence
of changes in customs induced by time, invasions, intercourse with other
nations, and the many other natural causes that are known to affect
man's speech.The Mayas and the Egyptians had many signs and characters identical;
possessing the same alphabetical and symbolical value in both nations.Among the symbolical, I may cite a few: _water_, _country or region_,
_king_, _Lord_, _offerings_, _splendor_, the _various emblems of the
sun_ and many others.Among the alphabetical, a very large number of the
so-called Demotic, by Egyptologists, are found even in the inscription
of the _Akab[c]ib_ at Chichen; and not a few of the most ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the mural inscriptions at Uxmal.In these I have
been able to discover the Egyptian characters corresponding to our own.A a, B, C, CH or K, D, T, I, L, M, N, H, P, TZ, PP, U, OO, X, having the
same sound and value as in the Spanish language, with the exception of
the K, TZ, PP and X, which are pronounced in a way peculiar to the
Mayas.The inscriptions also contain these letters, A, I, X and PP
identical to the corresponding in the Etruscan alphabet.The finding of
the value of these characters has enabled me to decipher, among other
things, the names of the founders of the city of UXMAL; as that of the
city itself.This is written apparently in two different ways: whilst,
in fact, the sculptors have simply made use of two homophone signs,
notwithstanding dissimilar, of the letter M. As to the name of the
founders, not only are they written in alphabetical characters, but also
in ideographic, since they are accompanied in many instances by the
totems of the personages: e. g[TN-27] for AAK, which means turtle, is the
image of a turtle; for CAY (fish), the image of a fish; for Chaacmol
(leopard) the image of a leopard; and so on, precluding the possibility
of misinterpretation.Having found that the language of the inscriptions was Maya, of course
I had no difficulty in giving to each letter its proper phonetic value,
since, as I have already said, Maya is still the vernacular of the
people.I consider that the few facts brought together will suffice at present
to show, if nothing else, a strange similarity in the workings of the
mind in these two nations.But if these remarkable coincidences are not
merely freaks of hazard, we will be compelled to admit that one people
must have learned it from the other.Then will naturally arise the
questions, Which the teacher?The answer will not only
solve an ethnological problem, but decide the question of priority.I will now briefly refer to the myth of Osiris, the son of _Seb and
Nut_, the brother of _Aroeris_, the elder _Horus_, of _Typho_, of
_Isis_, and of _Nephthis_, named also NIKE.The authors have given
numerous explanations, result of fancy; of the mythological history of
that god, famous throughout Egypt.They made him a personification of
the inundations of the NILE; ISIS, his wife and sister, that of the
irrigated portion of the land of Egypt; their sister, _Nephthis_, that
of the barren edge of the desert occasionally fertilized by the waters
of the Nile; his brother and murderer _Tipho_, that of the sea which
swallows up the _Nile_.Leaving aside the mythical lores, with which the priests of all times
and all countries cajole the credulity of ignorant and superstitious
people, we find that among the traditions of the past, treasured in the
mysterious recesses of the temples, is a history of the life of Osiris
on Earth.Many wise men of our days have looked upon it as fabulous.I
am not ready to say whether it is or it is not; but this I can assert,
that, in many parts, it tallies marvelously with that of the culture
hero of the Mayas.It will be said, no doubt, that this remarkable similarity is a mere
coincidence.But how are we to dispose of so many coincidences?What
conclusion, if any, are we to draw from this concourse of so many
strange similes?In this case, I cannot do better than to quote, verbatim, from Sir
Gardner Wilkinson's work, chap.xiii:

     "_Osiris_, having become King of Egypt, applied himself towards
     civilizing his countrymen, by turning them from their former
     barbarous course of life, teaching them, moreover, to cultivate and
     improve the fruits of the earth.* * * * * With the same good
     disposition, he afterwards traveled over the rest of the world,
     inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline, by the
     mildest persuasion."The rest of the story relates to the manner of his killing by his
brother Typho, the disposal of his remains, the search instituted by his
wife to recover the body, how it was stolen again from her by _Typho_,
who cut him to pieces, scattering them over the earth, of the final
defeat of Typho by Osiris's son, Horus.Reading the description, above quoted, of the endeavors of Osiris to
civilize the world, who would not imagine to be perusing the traditions
of the deeds of the culture heroes _Kukulean_[TN-28] and Quetzalcoatl of
the Mayas and of the Aztecs?Osiris was particularly worshiped at Philo,
where the history of his life is curiously illustrated in the sculptures
of a small retired chamber, lying nearly over the western adytum of the
temple, just as that of Chaacmol in the mural paintings of his funeral
chamber, the bas-reliefs of what once was his mausoleum, in those of the
queen's chamber and of her box in the tennis court at Chichen."The mysteries of Osiris were divided into the greater and less
     mysteries.Before admission into the former, it was necessary that
     the initiated should have passed through all the gradations of the
     latter.But to merit this great honor, much was expected of the
     candidate, and many even of the priesthood were unable to obtain
     it.Besides the proofs of a virtuous life, other recommendations
     were required, and to be admitted to all the grades of the higher
     mysteries was the greatest honor to which any one could aspire.It
     was from these that the mysteries of Eleusis were borrowed."In Mayab there also existed mysteries, as proved by symbols discovered
in the month of June last by myself in the monument generally called the
_Dwarf's House_, at Uxmal.It seemed that the initiated had to pass
through different gradations to reach the highest or third; if we are to
judge by the number of rooms dedicated to their performance, and the
disposition of said rooms.The strangest part, perhaps, of this
discovery is the information it gives us that certain signs and symbols
were used by the affiliated, that are perfectly identical to those used
among the masons in their symbolical lodges.I have lately published in
_Harper's Weekly_, a full description of the building, with plans of the
same, and drawings of the signs and symbols existing in it.These secret
societies exist still among the _Zunis_ and other Pueblo Indians of New
Mexico, according to the relations of Mr.Frank H. Cushing, a gentleman
sent by the Smithsonian Institution to investigate their customs and
history.In order to comply with the mission intrusted to him, Mr.Cushing has caused his adoption in the tribe of the Zunis, whose
language he has learned, whose habits he has adopted.Among the other
remarkable things he has discovered is "the existence of twelve sacred
orders, with their priests and their secret rites as carefully guarded
as the secrets of freemasonry, an institution to which these orders have
a strange resemblance."If from Egypt we pass to Nubia, we find that the peculiar battle ax of
the Mayas was also used by the warriors of that country; whilst many of
the customs of the inhabitants of equatorial Africa, as described by Mr.DuChaillu[TN-29] in the relation of his voyage to the "Land of Ashango,"
so closely resemble those of the aborigines of Yucatan as to suggest
that intimate relations must have existed, in very remote ages, between
their ancestors; if the admixture of African blood, clearly discernible
still, among the natives of certain districts of the peninsula, did not
place that _fact_ without the peradventure of a doubt.We also see
figures in the mural paintings, at Chichen, with strongly marked African
features.We learned by the discovery of the statue of Chaacmol, and that of the
priestess found by me at the foot of the altar in front of the shrine
of _Ix-cuina_, the Maya Venus, situated at the south end of _Isla
Mugeres_, it was customary with persons of high rank to file their teeth
in sharp points like a saw.We read in the chronicles that this fashion
still prevailed after the Spanish conquest; and then by little and
little fell into disuse.Travelers tells us that it is yet in vogue
among many of the tribes in the interior of South America; particularly
those whose names seem to connect with the ancient Caribs or Carians.Du Chaillu asserts that the Ashangos, those of Otamo, the Apossos, the
Fans, and many other tribes of equatorial Africa, consider it a mark of
beauty to file their front teeth in a sharp point.He presents the Fans
as confirmed cannibals.We are told, and the bas-reliefs on Chaacmol's
mausoleum prove it, that the Mayas devoured the hearts of their fallen
enemies.It is said that, on certain grand occasions, after offering the
hearts of their victims to the idols, they abandoned the bodies to the
people, who feasted upon them.But it must be noticed that these
last-mentioned customs seemed to have been introduced in the country by
the Nahualts and Aztecs; since, as yet, we have found nothing in the
mural paintings to cause us to believe that the Mayas indulged in such
barbaric repasts, beyond the eating of their enemies' hearts.The Mayas were, and their descendants are still, confirmed believers in
witchcraft.In December, last year, being at the hacienda of
X-Kanchacan, where are situated the ruins of the ancient city of
Mayapan, a sick man was brought to me.He came most reluctantly, stating
that he knew what was the matter with him: that he was doomed to die
unless the spell was removed.He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from
malarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of
tapeworm.I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my
advice.The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,
probably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched
him.He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial
distinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an
incredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he
simply replied: "No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me."Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of
Equatorial Africa, says: "The greatest curse of the whole country is the
belief in sorcery or witchcraft.If the African is once possessed with
the belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change.He
becomes suspicious of his dearest friends.He fancies himself sick, and
really often becomes sick through his fears.At least seventy-five per
cent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery."In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards
because of their supposed supernatural powers.From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the
chroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious
libations with _Balche_.To-day the aborigines still use it in the
celebrations of their ancient rites._Balche_ is a liquor made from the
bark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left
to ferment.The nectar drank by
the God of Greek Mythology.Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,
a city in which he resided for some time, says: "Next day he was so much
elated with the improvement in his health that he got tipsy on a
fermented beverage which he had prepared two days before he had fallen
ill, and which he made by _mixing honey and water, and adding to it
pieces of bark of a certain tree_."(Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.)I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find
that the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with
the MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to
be a corruption of MAYAB.The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,
where they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,
men and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief
that their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been
sacrificed.I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the
tombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade
or profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered
round the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend
to suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral.The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died.Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for
they believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it.The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their
villages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is
no longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased.Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of
drums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_.They are still used by the
aborigines in their religious festivals and dances.The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to
leave it about one inch in thickness all round.It is generally about
four feet in length.On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave
between them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches
from the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to
form, as it were, tongues.It is by striking on those tongues with two
balls of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the
instrument is played.The volume of sound produced is so great that it
can be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm
weather.The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the
trunk of a tree.On one end a piece of
skin is tightly stretched.It is by beating on the skin with the hand,
the instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a
slanting position, that it is played.Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case
of danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,
and is heard many miles around.Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of
these _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and
describes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas
as follows: "The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in
diameter at one end, but only seven at the other.The wood was hollowed
out quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly.To beat it the
drummer held it slantingly between his legs, and with two sticks
beats[TN-32] furiously upon the upper, which was the larger end of the
cylinder."We have the counterpart of the fetish houses, containing the skulls of
the ancestors and some idol or other, seen by Du Chaillu, in African
towns, in the small huts constructed at the entrance of all the villages
in Yucatan.These huts or shrines contain invariably a crucifix; at
times the image of some saint, often a skull.The last probably to cause
the wayfarer to remember he has to die; and that, as he cannot carry
with him his worldly treasures on the other side of the grave, he had
better deposit some in the alms box firmly fastened at the foot of the
cross.Cogolludo informs us these little shrines were anciently
dedicated to the god of lovers, of histrions, of dancers, and an
infinity of small idols that were placed at the entrance of the
villages, roads and staircases of the temples and other parts.Even the breed of African dogs seems to be the same as that of the
native dogs of Yucatan.Were I to describe these I could not make use of
more appropriate words than the following of Du Chaillu: "The pure bred
native dog is small, has long straight ears, long muzzle and long curly
tail; the hair is short and the color yellowish; the pure breed being
known by the clearness of his color.They are always lean, and are kept
very short of food by their owners.* * * Although they have quick ears;
I don't think highly of their scent.I could continue this list of similes, but methinks those already
mentioned as sufficient for the present purpose.I will therefore close
it by mentioning this strange belief that Du Chaillu asserts exists
among the African warriors: "_The charmed leopard's skin worn about the
warrior's middle is supposed to render that worthy spear-proof._"

Let us now take a brief retrospective glance at the FACTS mentioned in
the foregoing pages.They seem to teach us that, in ages so remote as to
be well nigh lost in the abyss of the past, the _Mayas_ were a great and
powerful nation, whose people had reached a high degree of civilization.That it is impossible for us to form a correct idea of their
attainments, since only the most enduring monuments, built by them, have
reached us, resisting the disintegrating action of time and atmosphere.That, as the English of to-day, they had colonies all over the earth;
for we find their name, their traditions, their customs and their
language scattered in many distant countries, among whose inhabitants
they apparently exercised considerable civilizing influence, since they
gave names to their gods, to their tribes, to their cities.We cannot doubt that the colonists carried with them the old traditions
of the mother country, and the history of the founders of their
nationality; since we find them in the countries where they seem to have
established large settlements soon after leaving the land of their
birth.In course of time these traditions have become disfigured,
wrapped, as it were, in myths, creations of fanciful and untutored
imaginations, as in Hindostan: or devises of crafty priests, striving to
hide the truth from the ignorant mass of the people, fostering their
superstitions, in order to preserve unbounded and undisputed sway over
them, as in Egypt.In Hindostan, for example, we find the Maya custom of carrying the
children astride on the hips of the nurses.That of recording the vow of
the devotees, or of imploring the blessings of deity by the imprint of
the hand, dipped in red liquid, stamped on the walls of the shrines and
palaces.The worship of the mastodon, still extant in India, Siam,
Burmah, as in the worship of _Ganeza_, the god of knowledge, with an
elephant head, degenerated in that of the elephant itself.Still extant we find likewise the innate propensity of the Mayas to
exclude all foreigners from their country; even to put to death those
who enter their territories (as do, even to-day, those of Santa Cruz and
the inhabitants of the Tierra de Guerra) as the emissaries of Rama were
informed by the friend of the owner of the country, the widow of the
_great architect_, MAYA, whose name HEMA means in the Maya language "she
who places ropes across the roads to impede the passage."Even the
history of the death of her husband MAYA, killed with a thunderbolt, by
the god _Pourandara_, whose jealousy was aroused by his love for her and
their marriage, recalls that of _Chaacmol_, the husband of _Moo_, killed
by their brother Aac, by being stabbed by him three times in the back
with a spear, through jealousy--for he also loved _Moo_.Some Maya tribes, after a time, probably left their home at the South of
Hindostan and emigrated to Afghanistan, where their descendants still
live and have villages on the North banks of the river _Kabul_.They
left behind old traditions, that they may have considered as mere
fantasies of their poets, and other customs of their forefathers.Yet we
know so little about the ancient Afghans, or the Maya tribes living
among them, that it is impossible at present to say how much, if any,
they have preserved of the traditions of their race.All we know for a
certainty is that many of the names of their villages and tribes are
pure American-Maya words: that their types are very similar to the
features of the bearded men carved on the pillars of the castle, and on
the walls of other edifices at Chichen-Itza: while their warlike habits
recall those of the Mayas, who fought so bravely and tenaciously the
Spanish invaders.Some of the Maya tribes, traveling towards the west and northwest,
reached probably the shores of Ethiopia; while others, entering the
Persian Gulf, landed near the embouchure of the Euphrates, and founded
their primitive capital at a short distance from it.They called it _Hur
(Hula) city of guests just arrived_--and according to Berosus gave
themselves the name of _Khaldi_; probably because they intrenched their
city: _Kal_ meaning intrenchment in the American-Maya language.We have
seen that the names of all the principal deities of the primitive
Chaldeans had a natural etymology in that tongue.Such strange
coincidences cannot be said to be altogether accidental.Particularly
when we consider that their learned men were designated as MAGI, (Mayas)
and their Chief _Rab-Mag_, meaning, in Maya, the _old man_; and were
great architects, mathematicians and astronomers.As again we know of
them but imperfectly, we cannot tell what traditions they had preserved
of the birthplace of their forefathers.But by the inscriptions on the
tablets or bricks, found at Mugheir and Warka, we know for a certainty
that, in the archaic writings, they formed their characters of straight
lines of uniform thickness; and inclosed their sentences in squares or
parallelograms, as did the founders of the ruined cities of Yucatan.And
from the signet cylinder of King Urukh, that their mode of dressing was
identical with that of many personages represented in the mural
paintings at Chichen-Itza.We have traced the MAYAS again on the shores of Asia Minor, where the
CARIANS at last established themselves, after having spread terror among
the populations bordering on the Mediterranean.Their origin is unknown:
but their customs were so similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan
at the time even of the Spanish conquest--and their names CAR, _Carib_
or _Carians_, so extensively spread over the western continent, that we
might well surmise, that, navigators as they were, they came from those
parts of the world; particularly when we are told by the Greek poets and
historians, that the goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_.We
have seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of
Tyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya.Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more
I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas
and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned
men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of
their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had
emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the
Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the
rising sun, establish themselves in America.In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of
CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests
in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its
details.It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their
sister ISIS.Some of the names only have been changed when the members
of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching
apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL
and MOO, from all the circumstances connected with it, according to the
relations of the priests of Egypt that tally so closely with what we
learn in Chichen-Itza from the bas-reliefs, it seems impossible to
doubt.Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the
Amenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the
ancestors.Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a
_fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted
skin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: "That the skin is
usually represented without the head; but some instances where this is
introduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_."Again, the
name of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in
hieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye
above it.It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a
_leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress.Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in
the land of the West for Egypt.The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a
_Spotted_ tiger, a _leopard_; and he is represented as such in all his
totems in the sculptures on the monuments; his shield being made of the
skin of leopard, as seen in the mural paintings.Osiris, in Egypt, is a myth.Chaacmol, in Mayab, a reality.A warrior
whose mausoleum I have opened; whose weapons and ornaments of jade are
in Mrs.Le Plongeon's possession; whose heart I have found, and sent a
piece of it to be analysed by professor Thompson of Worcester, Mass.;
whose effigy, with his name inscribed on the tablets occupying the place
of the ears, forms now one of the most precious relics in the National
Museum of Mexico.As to the etymology of her name
the Maya affords it in I[C]IN--_the younger sister_.As Queen of the
Amenti, of the West, she also is represented in hieroglyphs by the same
characters as her husband--a _leopard, with an eye above_, and the sign
of the feminine gender an oval or egg.But as a goddess she is always
portrayed with wings; the vulture being dedicated to her; and, as it
were, her totem.MOO the wife and sister of _Chaacmol_ was the Queen of Chichen.She is
represented on the Mausoleum of Chaacmol as a _Macaw_ (Moo in the Maya
language); also on the monuments at Uxmal: and the chroniclers tell us
that she was worshiped in Izamal under the name of _Kinich-Kakmo_;
reading from right to left the _fiery macaw with eyes like the sun_.Their protecting spirit is a _Serpent_, the totem of their father CAN.Another Egyptian divinity, _Apap_ or _Apop_, is represented under the
form of a gigantic serpent covered with wounds.Plutarch in his
treatise, _De Iside et Osiride_, tells us that he was enemy to the sun.TYPHO was the brother of Osiris and Isis; for jealousy, and to usurp the
throne, he formed a conspiration and killed his brother.He is said to
represent in the Egyptian mythology, the sea, by some; by others, _the
sun_.AAK (turtle) was also the brother of Chaacmol and _Moo_.For jealousy,
and to usurp the throne, he killed his brother at treason with three
thrusts of his _spear_ in the back.Around the belt of his statue at
Uxmal used to be seen hanging the heads of his brothers CAY and
CHAACMOL, together with that of MOO; whilst his feet rested on their
flayed bodies.In the sculpture he is pictured surrounded by the _Sun_
as his protecting spirit.The escutcheon of Uxmal shows that he called
the place he governed the land of the Sun.In the bas-reliefs of the
Queen's chamber at Chichen his followers are seen to render homage to
the _Sun_; others, the friends of MOO, to the _Serpent_.So, in Mayab as
in Egypt, the _Sun_ and _Serpent_ were inimical.In Egypt again this
enmity was a myth, in Mayab a reality.AROERIS was the brother of Osiris, Isis and Typho.His business seems to
have been that of a peace-maker.CAY was also the brother of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_ and _Aac_.He was the high
pontiff, and sided with Chaacmol and Moo in their troubles, as we learn
from the mural paintings, from his head and flayed body serving as
trophy to Aac as I have just said.In June last, among the ruins of _Uxmal_, I discovered a magnificent
bust of this personage; and I believe I know the place where his remains
are concealed.NEPHTHIS was the sister of Isis, Osiris, Typho, and Aroeris, and the
wife of Typho; but being in love with Osiris she managed to be taken to
his embraces, and she became pregnant.That intrigue having been
discovered by Isis, she adopted the child that Nephthis, fearing the
anger of her husband, had hidden, brought him up as her own under the
name of Anubis.Nephthis was also called NIKE by some.NIC or NICTE was the sister of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_, _Aac_, and _Cay_, with
whose name I find always her name associated in the sculptures on the
monuments.Here the analogy between these personages would seem to
differ, still further study of the inscriptions may yet prove the
Egyptian version to contain some truth._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means
flower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,
exists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,
Macedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of
Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is
represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the
extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,
his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the
preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of
reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs
under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient
divinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the
lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the
dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of
writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,
reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,
since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,
to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to
scatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at
the foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of
which I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a
sitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were
placed three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a
platform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the
cynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the
principal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the
kneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient
city was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon
(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her
home, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen
the royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is
symbolical of her domestic happiness.Before
her is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness
of his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral
qualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood
phrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to
seduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her
extended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest
read her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the
man, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and
threatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen
at a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is
another serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded
about the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue
protruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing
from its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the
myth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the
woman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render
them invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which
Chaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known
to their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had
imagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being
wounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not
laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still
prevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed
during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of
paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic
words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be
possessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by
wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the
Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and
other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did
not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational
conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing
but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its
etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told
that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established
himself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book
where mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise
magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura
(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the
Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call
themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are
words belonging to the American Maya language.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst
the Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in
Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,
where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a
goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that
she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to
the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a
country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a
sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its
inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called
themselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their
hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a
_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to
indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,
were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual
character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with
the sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent
men and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they
undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they
emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their
inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it
in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was
considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and
Greece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization
from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores
and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them
at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and
beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This
appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures
sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly
discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the
celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced
by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their
civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that
I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians
were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites
and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed
towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as
gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still
in MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective
antiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by
the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.
Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists
still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of
these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the
life of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened
between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of
the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the
structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the
thirty-sixth column.How long did that event occur before the Spanish
conquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take
place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years
since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being
finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the
nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will
remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third
person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his
finger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the
word is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which
they computed time, says:

"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books
every twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these
lustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,
which means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In certain sacred
buildings and in the houses of the priests every twenty years they place
a hewn stone upon those already there.When seven of these stones have
thus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after
the first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of
the big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more
they placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the
north; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they
put a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus
finished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years."There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the
monuments of Mayab:

1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that
their builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices
fronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,
since _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol
of deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been
contemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became
separated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and
their colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what
Psenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon
"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian
legislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the
lands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night," then we may
be able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America
and their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,
that after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of
_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the
stones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,
the full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,
the possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the
_sine qua non_ to form an uncontrovertible one, free from the
speculations which invalidate all books published on the subject
heretofore.If by reading these pages you have learned something new, your time has
not been lost; nor mine in writing them.Transcriber's Note

isn't any end to the times you can have cod-liver oil.""I'm with you there," said the major, emphasizing his remark by slapping
Jimmieboy on the back."In fact, sir, on page 29 of my book called
'Musings on Medicines' you will find--if it is ever published--these
lines:

          "The oils of cod!They make me feel tremendous odd,
           Nor hesitate
           I here to state
     I wildly hate the oils of cod.""When I start my autograph album I want you
to write those lines on the first page.""Never, I hope," replied the sprite, with a chuckle."And now suppose
you don't interrupt my story again."Clouds began to gather on the major's face again.The sprite's rebuke
had evidently made him very angry."Sir," said he, as soon as his feelings permitted him to speak."If you
make any more such remarks as that, another duel may be necessary after
this one is fought--which I should very much regret, for duels of this
sort consume a great deal of time, and unless I am much mistaken it will
shortly rain cats and dogs.""It looks that way," said the sprite, "and it is for that very reason
that I do not wish to be interrupted again.Of course ruin stared father
in the face."whispered the major to Jimmieboy, who immediately
silenced him."Trade having fallen away," continued the sprite, "we had to draw upon
our savings for our bread and butter, and finally, when the last penny
was spent, we made up our minds to leave the moon district entirely and
try life on the dog-star, where, we were informed, people only had one
eye apiece, and every man had so much to do that it took all of his one
eye's time looking after his own business so that there wasn't any left
for him to spend on other people's business.It seemed to my father that
in a place like this there was a splendid opening for him.""Renting out his extra eye to blind men," roared the sprite.Jimmieboy fell off the rock with laughter, and the major, angry at being
so neatly caught, rose up and walked away but immediately returned."If this wasn't a duel I wouldn't stay here another minute," he said."But you can't put me to flight that way."The question now came up as to how we should get to the dog-star,"
resumed the sprite."I should think they'd have been so glad you were leaving they'd have
paid your fare," said the major, but the sprite paid no attention."There was no regular stage line between the moon and the dog-star,"
said he, "and we had only two chances of really getting there, and they
were both so slim you could count their ribs.One was by getting aboard
the first comet that was going that way, and the other was by jumping.The trouble with the first chance was that as far as any one knew there
wasn't a comet expected to go in the direction of the dog-star for eight
million years--which was rather a long time for a starving family to
wait, and besides we had read of so many accidents in the moon papers
about people being injured while trying to board comets in motion that
we were a little timid about it.My father and I could have managed
very well; but mother might not have--ladies can't even get on horse
cars in motion without getting hurt, you know.It's a pretty big jump
from the moon to the dog-star, and if you don't aim yourself right you
are apt to miss it, and either fall into space or land somewhere else
where you don't want to go.For instance, a cousin of mine
who lived on Mars wanted to visit us when we lived at Twinkleville, but
he was too mean to pay his fare, thinking he could jump it cheaper.Well, he jumped and where do you suppose he landed?"He didn't come
anywhere near Twinkleville, although he supposed that he was aimed in
the right direction.""Will you tell me how you know he's falling yet?"asked the major, who
didn't seem to believe this part of the sprite's story.I saw him yesterday through a telescope," replied the
sprite."And he looked very tired, too," said the sprite."Though as a matter of
fact he doesn't have to exert himself any.All he has to do is fall,
and, once you get started, falling is the easiest thing in the world.But of course with the remembrance of my cousin's mistake in our minds,
we didn't care so much about making the jump, and we kept putting it off
and putting it off until finally some wretched people had a law made
abolishing us from the moon entirely, which meant that we had to leave
inside of twenty-four hours; so we packed up our trunks with the few
possessions we had left and threw them off toward the dog-star; then
mother and father took hold of hands and jumped and I was to come along
after them with some of the baggage that we hadn't got ready in time."According to my father's instructions I watched him carefully as he
sped through space to see whether he had started right, and to my great
joy I observed that he had--that very shortly both he and mother would
arrive safely on the dog-star--but alas!My joy was soon turned to
grief, for a terrible thing happened.Our great heavy family trunk that
had been dispatched first, and with truest aim, landed on the head of
the King of the dog-star, stove his crown in and nearly killed him.Hardly had the king risen up from the ground when he was again knocked
down by my poor father, who, utterly powerless to slow up or switch
himself to one side, landed precisely as the trunk had landed on the
monarch's head, doing quite as much more damage as the trunk had done in
the beginning.When added to these mishaps a shower of hat-boxes and
hand-bags, marked with our family name, fell upon the Lord Chief
Justice, the Prime Minister and the Heir Apparent, my parents were
arrested and thrown into prison and I decided that the dog-star was no
place for me.Wild with grief, and without looking to see where I was
going, nor in fact caring much, I gave a running leap out into space and
finally through some good fortune landed here on this earth which I have
found quite good enough for me ever since."Here the sprite paused and looked at Jimmieboy as much as to say, "How
is that for a tale of adventure?"cried the major, "Isn't it enough?"I don't see how he could have jumped
so many years before the world was made and yet land on the world.""I was five thousand years on the jump," explained the sprite."It was leap-year when you started, wasn't it?"asked the major, with a
sarcastic smile.asked Jimmieboy,
signaling the major to be quiet.I am afraid they got into serious
trouble.It's a very serious thing to knock a king down with a trunk and
land on his head yourself the minute he gets up again," sighed the
sprite."But didn't you tell me your parents were unfairies?"put in Jimmieboy,
eying the sprite distrustfully."Yes; but they were only my adopted parents," explained the sprite."They were a very rich old couple with lots of money and no children, so
I adopted them not knowing that they were unfairies.When they died they
left me all their bad habits, and their money went to found a storeroom
for worn out lawn-mowers."Well that's a pretty good story," said Jimmieboy."Yes," said the sprite, with a pleased smile."And the best part of it
is it's all true."CHAPTER X.

THE MAJOR'S TALE."A great many years ago when I was a souvenir spoon," said the major, "I
belonged to a very handsome and very powerful potentate.""I didn't quite understand what it was you said you were," said the
sprite, bending forward as if to hear better."At the beginning of my story I was a souvenir spoon," returned the
major."Did you begin your career as a spoon?""I did not, sir," replied the major."I began my career as a nugget in a
lead mine where I was found by the king of whom I have just spoken, and
on his return home with me he gave me to his wife who sent me out to a
lead smith's and had me made over into a souvenir spoon--and a mighty
handsome spoon I was too.I had a poem engraved on me that said:

    'Aka majo te roo li sah,
     Pe mink y rali mis tebah.'Rather pretty thought, don't you think so?"added the major as he
completed the couplet.said the sprite, with a knowing shake of his head."Well, I don't understand it at all," said Jimmieboy."Ask this native of Twinkleville what it means," observed the major with
a snicker."He says it's a pretty thought, so of course he understands
it--though I assure you I don't, for it doesn't mean anything.I made it
up, this very minute."It was quite evident that he had fallen into
the trap the major had set for him."I was only fooling," he said, with a sickly attempt at a smile."I think perhaps the happiest time of my life was during the hundreds of
years that I existed in the royal museum as a spoon," resumed the major."I was brought into use only on state occasions.When the King of
Mangapore gave a state banquet to other kings in the neighborhood I was
the spoon that was used to ladle out the royal broth."Here the major paused to smack his lips, and then a small tear appeared
in one corner of his eye and trickled slowly down the side of his nose."I always weep," he said, as soon as he could speak, "when I think of
that broth.Here is what it was made of:

    'Seven pies of sweetest mince,
     Then a ripe and mellow quince,
         Then a quart of tea.Then a pint of cinnamon,
     Next a roasted apple, done
         Brown as brown can be.Add of orange juice, a gill,
     And a sugared daffodil,
         Then a yellow yam.Sixty-seven strawberries
     Should be added then to these,
         And a pot of jam.Mix with maple syrup and
     Let it in the ice-box stand
         Till it's good and cold--
     Throw a box of raisins in,
     Stir it well--just make it spin--
         Till it looks like gold.'"What a dish it was, and I, I used to be
dipped into a tureen full of it sixteen times at every royal feast,
and before the war we had royal feasts on an average of three times
a day."cried Jimmieboy, his mouth watering to
think of it."Three a day until the unhappy war broke out
which destroyed all my happiness, and resulted in the downfall of
sixty-four kings.""How on earth did such a war as that ever happen to be fought?""I am sorry to say," replied the major, sadly, "that I was the innocent
cause of it all.It was on the king's birthday that war was declared.He
used to have magnificent birthday parties, quite like those that boys
like Jimmieboy here have, only instead of having a cake with a candle in
it for each year, King Fuzzywuz used to have one guest for each year,
and one whole cake for each guest.On his twenty-first birthday he had
twenty-one guests; on his thirtieth, thirty, and so on; and at every one
of these parties I used to be passed around to be admired, I was so very
handsome and valuable."said the sprite, with a sneering laugh."The idea of a lead
spoon being valuable!""If you had ever been able to get into the society of kings," the major
answered, with a great deal of dignity, "you would know that on the
table of a monarch lead is much more rare than silver and gold.It was
this fact that made me so overpoweringly valuable, and it is not
surprising that a great many of the kings who used to come to these
birthday parties should become envious of Fuzzywuz and wish they owned a
treasure like myself.One very old king died of envy because of me, and
his heir-apparent inherited his father's desire to possess me to such a
degree that he too pined away and finally disappeared entirely.Didn't die, you know, as you would, but
vanished."So it went on for years, and finally on his sixty-fourth birthday King
Fuzzywuz gave his usual party, and sixty-four of the choicest kings in
the world were invited.They every one came, the feast was made ready,
and just as the guests took their places around the table, the broth
with me lying at the side of the tureen was brought in.The kings all
took their crowns off in honor of my arrival, when suddenly pouf!a gust
of wind came along and blew out every light in the hall.All was
darkness, and in the midst of it I felt myself grabbed by the handle and
shoved hastily into an entirely strange pocket.'Turn off the wind and bring
a light.'"The slaves hastened to do as they were told, and in less time than it
takes to tell it, light and order were restored.I could see it very plainly through a button-hole in the
cloak of the potentate who had seized me and hidden me in his pocket.Fuzzywuz immediately discovered that I was missing.he roared to the head-waiter,
who, though he was an African of the blackest hue, turned white as a
sheet with fear."'It was in the broth, oh, Nepotic Fuzzywuz, King of the Desert and most
noble Potentate of the Sand Dunes, when I, thy miserable servant,
brought it into the gorgeous banqueting hall and set it here before
thee, who art ever my most Serene and Egotistic Master,' returned the
slave, trembling with fear and throwing himself flat upon the
dining-hall floor.Do
spoons take wings unto themselves and fly away?Are they tadpoles that
they develop legs and hop as frogs from our royal presence?Do spoons
evapidate----'

"'Evaporate, my dear,' suggested the queen in a whisper.'Do spoons evaporate like water in the
sun?Do they raise sails like sloops of war and thunder noiselessly out
of sight?Thou hast stolen it and thou must bear the penalty of
thy predilection----'

"'Dereliction,' whispered the queen, impatiently."'He knows what I mean,' roared the king, 'or if he doesn't he will when
his head is cut off.'""Is that what all those big words meant?""As I remember the occurrence, it is," returned the major."What the
king really meant was always uncertain; he always used such big words
and rarely got them right.Reprehensibility and tremulousness were great
favorites of his, though I don't believe he ever knew what they meant.But, to continue my story, at this point the king rose and sharpening
the carving knife was about to behead the slave's head off when the
potentate who had me in his pocket cried out:

"'Hold, oh Fuzzywuz!I saw the spoon myself at the
side of yon tureen when it was brought hither.'"'Then,' returned the king, 'it has been percolated----'

"'Peculated,' whispered the queen."'That's what I said,' retorted Fuzzywuz, angrily.'The spoon has been
speculated by some one of our royal brethren at this board.The point to
be liquidated now is, who has done this deed.A
guard about the palace gates--and lock the doors and bar the windows.I am sorry to say, that every king in this room
save only myself and my friend Prince Bigaroo, who at the risk of his
kingly dignity deigned to come to the rescue of my slave, must repeal--I
should say reveal--the contents of his pockets.Prince Bigaroo must be
innocent or he would not have ejaculated as he hath.'"You see," said the major, in explanation, "Bigaroo having stolen me was
smart enough to see how it would be if he spoke.A guilty person in nine
cases out of ten would have kept silent and let the slave suffer.So
Bigaroo escaped; but all the others were searched and of course I was
not found.Fuzzywuz was wild with sorrow and anger, and declared that
unless I was returned within ten minutes he would wage war upon, and
utterly destroy, every king in the place.The kings all turned
pale--even Bigaroo's cheek grew white, but having me he was determined
to keep me and so the war began.""Why didn't you speak and save the innocent kings?""Did you ever see a spoon with a
tongue?"He evidently had never seen a spoon with a
tongue."The war was a terrible one," said the major, resuming his story."One
by one the kings were destroyed, and finally only Bigaroo remained, and
Fuzzywuz not having found me in the treasures of the others, finally
came to see that it was Bigaroo who had stolen me.So he turned his
forces toward the wicked monarch, defeated his army, and set fire to his
palace.In that fire I was destroyed as a souvenir spoon and became a
lump of lead once more, lying in the ruins for nearly a thousand years,
when I was sold along with a lot of iron and other things to a junk
dealer.He in turn sold me to a ship-maker, who worked me over into a
sounding lead for a steamer he had built.On my first trip out I was
sent overboard to see how deep the ocean was.I fell in between two
huge rocks down on the ocean's bed and was caught, the rope connecting
me with the ship snapped, and there I was, twenty thousand fathoms under
the sea, lost, as I supposed, forever.The effect of the salt water upon
me was very much like that of hair restorer on some people's heads.I
began to grow a head of green hair--seaweed some people call it--and to
this fact, strangely enough, I owed my escape from the water.A sea-cow
who used to graze about where I lay, thinking that I was only a tuft of
grass gathered me in one afternoon and swallowed me without blinking,
and some time after, the cow having been caught and killed by some giant
fishermen, I was found by the wife of one of the men when the great cow
was about to be cooked.These giants were very strange people who
inhabited an island out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which was
gradually sinking into the water with the weight of the people on it,
and which has now entirely disappeared.There wasn't one of the
inhabitants that was less than one hundred feet tall, and in those days
they used to act as light-houses for each other at night.They had but
one eye apiece, and when that was open it used to flash just like a
great electric light, and they'd take turns at standing up in the
middle of the island all night long and turning round and round and
round until you'd think they'd drop with dizziness.I staid with these
people, I should say, about forty years, when one morning two of the
giants got disputing as to which of them could throw a stone the
farthest.One of them said he could throw a pebble two thousand miles,
and the other said he could throw one all the way round the world.At
this the first one laughed and jeered, and to prove that he had told the
truth the second grabbed up what he thought was a pebble, but which
happened to be me and threw me from him with all his force."And sad to say I
killed the giant who threw me," returned the major."I went around the
world so swiftly that when I got back to the island the poor fellow
hadn't had time to get out of my way, and as I came whizzing along I
struck him in the back, went right through him, and leaving him dead on
the island went on again and finally fell into a great gun manufactory
in Massachusetts where I was smelted over into a bullet, and sent to the
war.I think I must have
killed off half a dozen regiments of his enemies, and between you and
me, General Washington said I was his favorite bullet, and added that as
long as he had me with him he wasn't afraid of anybody."Here the major paused a minute to smile at the sprite who was beginning
to look a little blue.It was rather plain, the sprite thought, that the
major was getting the best of the duel.How long did you stay with George
Washington?""I'd never have left him if he hadn't
ordered me to do work that I wasn't made for.When a bullet goes to war
he doesn't want to waste himself on ducks.I wanted to go after hostile
generals and majors and cornet players, and if Mr.Washington had used
me for them I'd have hit home every time, but instead of that he took me
off duck shooting one day and actually asked me to knock over a
miserable wild bird he happened to want.He
insisted, and I said,'very well, General, fire away.'He fired, the
duck laughed, and I simply flew off into the woods on the border of the
bay and rested there for nearly a hundred years.The rest of my story
is soon told.I lay where I had fallen until six years ago when I was
picked up by a small boy who used me for a sinker to go fishing with,
after which I found my way into the smelting pot once more, and on the
Fifteenth of November, 1892, I became what I am, Major Blueface, the
handsomest soldier, the bravest warrior, the most talented tin poet that
ever breathed."A long silence followed the completion of the major's story.Which of
the two he liked the better Jimmieboy could not make up his mind, and he
hoped his two companions would be considerate enough not to ask him to
decide between them."I thought they had to be true stories," said the sprite, gloomily."I
don't think it's fair to tell stories like yours--the idea of your being
thrown one and a half times around the world!""It's just as true as yours, anyhow," retorted the major, "but if you
want to begin all over again and tell another I'm ready for you.""We'll leave it to Jimmieboy as it is.""I don't know about that, major," said Jimmieboy."I think you are just
about even."asked the sprite, his face beaming with
pleasure."We'll settle it this way: we'll give five points
to the one who told the best, five points to the one who told the
longest, and five points to the one who told the shortest story.As the
stories are equally good you both get five points for that.The major's
was the longest, I think, so he gets five more, but so does the sprite
because his was the shortest.That makes you both ten, so you both win.""Yes," said the sprite, squeezing Jimmieboy's hand affectionately, "and
so do I."Which after all, I think, was the best way to decide a duel of that
sort."Well, now that that is settled," said the major with a sigh of relief,
"I suppose we had better start off and see whether Fortyforefoot will
attend to this business of getting the provisions for us.""The major is right there, Jimmieboy.You have
delayed so long on the way that it is about time you did something, and
the only way I know of for you to do it is by getting hold of
Fortyforefoot.If you wanted an apple pie and there was nothing in sight
but a cart-wheel he would change it into an apple pie for you.""That's all very well," replied Jimmieboy, "but I'm not going to call on
any giant who'd want to eat me.You might just as well understand that
right off.I'll try on your invisible coat and if that makes me
invisible I'll go.If it doesn't we'll have to try some other plan.""That is the prudent thing to do," said the major, nodding his approval
to the little general."As my poem tries to teach, it is always wise to
use your eyes--or look before you leap.The way it goes is this:

    'If you are asked to make a jump,
     Be careful lest you prove a gump--
         Awake or e'en in sleep--
     Don't hesitate the slightest bit
     To show that you've at least the wit
         To look before you leap.Why, in a dream one night, I thought
     A fellow told me that I ought
         To jump to Labrador.I did not look but blindly hopped,
     And where do you suppose I stopped?I do not say, had I been wise
     Enough that time to use my eyes--
         As I've already said--
     To Labrador I would have got:
     But this _is_ certain, I would not
         Have tumbled out of bed.'"The moral of which is, be careful how you go into things, and if you
are not certain that you are coming out all right don't go into them,"
added the major."Why, when I was a mouse----"

"Oh, come, major--you couldn't have been a mouse," interrupted the
sprite."You've just told us all about what you've been in the past, and
you couldn't have been all that and a mouse too.""So I have," said the major, with a smile."I'd forgotten that, and you
are right, too.I should have put what I
was going to say differently.If I had ever been a mouse--that's the way
it should be--if I had ever been a mouse and had been foolish enough to
stick my head into a mouse-trap after a piece of cheese without knowing
that I should get it out again, I should not have been here to-day, in
all likelihood.Try on the invisible
coat, Jimmieboy, and let's see how it works before you risk calling on
Fortyforefoot.""Here it is," said the sprite, holding out his hands with apparently
nothing in them.Jimmieboy laughed a little, it seemed so odd to have a person say "here
it is" and yet not be able to see the object referred to.He reached out
his hand, however, to take the coat, relying upon the sprite's statement
that it was there, and was very much surprised to find that his hand did
actually touch something that felt like a coat, and in fact was a coat,
though entirely invisible."Shall I help you on with it?""Perhaps you'd better," said Jimmieboy."It feels a little small for
me.""That's what I was afraid of," said the sprite."You see it covers me
all over from head to foot--that is the coat covers all but my head and
the hood covers that--but you are very much taller than I am."Here Jimmieboy, having at last got into the coat and buttoned it about
him, had the strange sensation of seeing all of himself disappear
excepting his head and legs.These remaining uncovered were of course
still in sight.laughed the major, merrily, as Jimmieboy walked around."That is the most ridiculous thing I ever saw.You're nothing but a head
and pair of legs."Jimmieboy smiled and placed the hood over his head and the major roared
louder than ever.That's funnier still--now
you're nothing but a pair of legs.Take it off quick or
I'll die with laughter.""I'm afraid it won't do, Spritey," he said."Fortyforefoot would see my
legs and if he caught them I'd be lost.""That's a fact," said the sprite, thoughtfully."The coat is almost two
feet too short for you.""It's more than two feet too short," laughed the major."It's two whole
legs too short.""This is no time for joking," said the sprite."We've too much to talk
about to use our mouths for laughing.""I won't get off any more, or if I do they
won't be the kind to make you laugh.But I say, boys," he added, "I have a scheme.It is of course the scheme
of a soldier and may be attended by danger, but if it is successful all
the more credit to the one who succeeds.We three people can attack
Fortyforefoot openly, capture him, and not let him go until he provides
us with the provisions.""That sounds lovely," sneered the sprite."But I'd like to know some of
the details of this scheme.It is easy enough to say attack him, capture
him and not let him go, but the question is, how shall we do all this?""It ought to be easy," returned the major."There are only three things
to be done.A kitten can attack an elephant if it wants to.The second is to capture
him, which, while it seems hard, is not really so if the attack is
properly made."Clear as a fog," put in the sprite."Now there are three of us--Jimmieboy, Spriteyboy and Yourstrulyboy,"
continued the major, "so what could be more natural than that we should
divide up these three operations among us?Therefore I propose
that Jimmieboy here shall attack Fortyforefoot; the sprite shall capture
him and throw him into a dungeon cell and I will crown the work by not
letting him go.""Jimmieboy and I take all the danger I
notice.""I am utterly unselfish about
it.I am willing to put myself in the background and let you have all
the danger and most of the glory.I only come in at the very end--but I
don't mind that.I have had glory enough for ten life-times, so why
should I grudge you this one little bit of it?My feelings in regard to
glory will be found on the fortieth page of Leaden Lyrics or the Ballads
of Ben Bullet--otherwise myself.The verses read as follows:

    'Though glory, it must be confessed,
       Is satisfying stuff,
     Upon my laurels let me rest
       For I have had enough.Ne'er was a glorier man than I,
       Ne'er shall a glorier be,
     Than, trembling reader, you'll espy--
       When haply you spy me.So bring no more--for while 'tis good
       To have, 'tis also plain
     A bit of added glory would
       Be apt to make me vain.'And I don't want to be vain," concluded the major."Well, I don't want any of your glory," said the sprite, "and if I know
Jimmieboy I don't think he does either.If you want to reverse your
order of things and do the dangerous part of the work yourself, we will
do all in our power to make your last hours comfortable, and I will see
to it that the newspapers tell how bravely you died, but we can't go
into the scheme any other way.""You talk as if you were the general's prime minister, or his nurse,"
retorted the major, "whereas in reality I, being his chief of staff, am
they if anybody are."Here the major blushed a little because he was not quite sure of his
grammar.Neither of his companions seemed to notice the mixture,
however, and so he continued:

"General, it is for you to say.Shall my plan go or shall she stay?""Well, I think myself, major, that it is a little too dangerous for me,
and if any other plan could be made I'd like it better," answered
Jimmieboy, anxious to soothe the major's feelings which were evidently
getting hurt again."Suppose I go back and order the soldiers to attack
Fortyforefoot and bring him in chains to me?""Couldn't be done," said the sprite."The minute the chains were clapped
on him he would change them into doughnuts and eat them all up.""Yes," put in the major, "and the chances are he would turn the soldiers
into a lot of toy balloons on a string and then cut the string.""He couldn't do that," said the sprite, "because he can't turn people or
animals into anything."Well, I think the best thing to do would be for me to change myself
into a giant bigger than he is," said the sprite."Then I could put you
and the major in my pockets and call upon Fortyforefoot and ask him, in
a polite way, to turn some pebbles and sticks and other articles into
the things we want, and, if he won't do it except he is paid, we'll pay
him if we can.""What do you propose to pay him with?""I suppose
you'll hand him half a dozen checkerberries and tell him if he'll turn
them into ten one dollar bills he'll have ten dollars."You can't tempt Fortyforefoot with
money.It is only by offering him something to eat that we can hope to
get his assistance."And you'll request him to turn a handful of pine cones into a dozen
turkeys on toast, I presume?"I shall simply offer to let him have
you for dinner--you will serve up well in croquettes--Blueface
croquettes--eh, Jimmieboy?"The poor major turned white with fear and rage.At first he felt
inclined to slay the sprite on the spot, and then it suddenly flashed
across his mind that before he could do it the sprite might really turn
himself into a giant and do with him as he had said.So he contented
himself with turning pale and giving a sickly smile."That would be a good joke on me," he said.Sprite, I don't think I would enjoy it, and after all I have a sort of
notion that I would disagree with Fortyforefoot--which would be
extremely unfortunate.I know I should rest like lead on his
digestion--and that would make him angry with you and I should be
sacrificed for nothing.""Well, I wouldn't consent to that anyhow," said Jimmieboy."I love the
major too much to----"

"So do we all," interrupted the sprite."Why even I love the major and I
wouldn't let anybody eat him for anything--no, sir!--not if I were
offered a whole vanilla eclaire would I permit the major to be eaten.I will turn myself into a giant
twice as big as Fortyforefoot; I will place you and the major in my
pockets and then I will call upon him.He will be so afraid of me that
he will do almost anything I ask him to, but to make him give us the
very best things he can make I would rather deal gently with him, and
instead of forcing him to make the peaches and cherries I'll offer to
trade you two fellows off for the things we need.He will be pleased
enough at the chance to get anything so good to eat as you look, and
he'll prepare everything for us, and he will put you down stairs in the
pantry.Then I will tell him stories, and some of the major's jokes, to
make him sleepy, and when finally he dozes off I will steal the pantry
key and set you free."It's a very good plan unless Fortyforefoot should find us so toothsome
looking that he would want to eat us raw.We may be nothing more than
fruit for him, you know, and truly I don't want to be anybody's apple,"
said Jimmieboy."You are quite correct there, general," said the major, with a chuckle."In fact, I'm quite sure he'd think you and I were fruit because being
two we are necessarily a pear.""It won't happen," said the sprite."He isn't likely to think you are
fruit and even if he does I won't let him eat you.I'll keep him from
doing it if I have to eat you myself.""Oh, of course, then, with a kind promise like that there is nothing
left for us to do but accept your proposition," said the
major."As Ben Bullet says:

    'When only one thing can be done--
       If people only knew it--
     The wisest course beneath the sun
       Is just to go and do it.'""I'm willing to take my chances," said Jimmieboy, "if after I see what
kind of a giant you can turn yourself into I think you are terrible
enough to frighten another giant.""Well, just watch me," said the sprite, taking off his coat."And mind,
however terrifying I may become, don't you get frightened, because I
won't hurt you.""Go ahead," said the major, valiantly."Wait until we get scared before
talking like that to us."'Bazam, bazam,
     A sprite I am,
     Bazoo, bazee,
     A giant I'd be.'"Then there came a terrific noise; the trees about the little group shook
to the very last end of their roots, all grew dark as night, and as
quickly grew light again.In the returning light Jimmieboy saw looming
up before him a fearful creature, eighty feet high, clad in a
magnificent suit embroidered with gold and silver, a fierce mustache
upon his lip, and dangling at his side was a heavy sword.It was the sprite now transformed into a giant--a terrible-looking
fellow, though to Jimmieboy he was not terrible because the boy knew
that the dreadful creature was only his little friend in disguise.came a bellowing voice from above the trees.I'm sure you'll do, and I am ready,"
said Jimmieboy, with a laugh.But there came no answer, and Jimmieboy, looking about him to see why
the major made no reply, was just in time to see that worthy soldier's
coat-tails disappearing down the road.The major was running away as fast as he could go."You've frightened him pretty well, Spritey," said Jimmieboy, with a
laugh, as the major passed out of sight."But you don't seem a bit afraid.""I'm not--though I think I should be if I didn't know who you are,"
returned Jimmieboy."Well, I need to be if I am to get the best of Fortyforefoot, but, I
say, you mustn't call me Spritey now that I am a giant.It won't do to
call me by any name that would show Fortyforefoot who I really am," said
the sprite, with a warning shake of his head."Bludgeonhead is my name now," replied the sprite."Benjamin B.
Bludgeonhead is my full name, but you know me well enough to call me
plain Bludgeonhead.""All right, plain Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, "I'll do as you
say--and now don't you think we'd better be starting along?""Yes," said Bludgeonhead, reaching down and grabbing hold of Jimmieboy
with his huge hand."We'll start right away, and until we come in sight
of Fortyforefoot's house I think perhaps you'll be more comfortable if
you ride on my shoulder instead of in my coat-pocket.""Thank you very much," said Jimmieboy, as Bludgeonhead lifted him up
from the ground and set him lightly as a feather on his shoulder."I think I'd like to be
as tall as this all the time, Bludgeonhead.What a great thing it would
be on parade days to be as tall as this.Why I can see miles and miles
of country from here.""Yes, it's pretty fine--but I don't think I'd care to be so tall
always," returned Bludgeonhead, as he stepped over a great broad river
that lay in his path."It makes one very uppish to be as high in the air
as this; and you'd be all the time looking down on your friends, too,
which would be so unpleasant for your friends that they wouldn't have
anything to do with you after a while.I'm going to
jump over this mountain in front of us."Here Bludgeonhead drew back a little and then took a short run, after
which he leaped high in the air, and he and Jimmieboy sailed easily over
the great hills before them, and then alighted safe and sound on the
other side.cried Jimmieboy, clapping his hands with glee."I hope there are lots more hills like that to be jumped over.""No, there aren't," said Bludgeonhead, "but if you like it so much I'll
go back and do it again."Bludgeonhead turned back and jumped over the mountain half a dozen times
until Jimmieboy was satisfied and then he resumed his journey."This," he said, after trudging along in silence for some time, "this is
Fortyforefoot Valley, and in a short time we shall come to the giant's
castle; but meanwhile I want you to see what a wonderful place this is.The valley itself will give you a better idea of Fortyforefoot's great
power as a magician than anything else that I know of.Do you know what
this place was before he came here?""It was a great big hole in the ground," returned Bludgeonhead.Fortyforefoot liked the situation because it was
surrounded by mountains and nobody ever wanted to come here because sand
pits aren't worth visiting.There wasn't a tree or a speck of a green
thing anywhere in sight--nothing but yellow sand glaring in the sun all
day and sulking in the moon all night."It's all covered with beautiful trees and
gardens and brooks now," said Jimmieboy, which was quite true, for the
Fortyforefoot Valley was a perfect paradise to look at, filled with
everything that was beautiful in the way of birds and trees and flowers
and water courses."How could he make the trees and flowers grow in dry
hot sand like that?""By his magic power, of course," answered Bludgeonhead."He filled up a
good part of the sand pit with stones that he found about here, and then
he changed one part of the desert into a pond so that he could get all
the water he wanted.Then he took a square mile of sand and changed
every grain of it into blades of grass.Other portions he transformed
into forests until finally simply by the wonderful power he has to
change one thing into another he got the place into its present shape.""But the birds, how did he make them?""He didn't," said Bludgeonhead.They saw
what a beautiful place this was and they simply moved in."Bludgeonhead paused a moment in his walk and set Jimmieboy down on the
ground again."I think I'll take a rest here before going on.We are very near to
Fortyforefoot's castle now," he said."I'll sit down here for a few
moments and sharpen my sword and get in good shape for a fight if one
becomes necessary.This place is full of
traps for just such fellows as you who come in here.That's the way
Fortyforefoot catches them for dinner."So Jimmieboy staid close by Bludgeonhead's side and was very much
entertained by all that went on around him.He saw the most wonderful
birds imaginable, and great bumble-bees buzzed about in the flowers
gathering honey by the quart.Once a great jack-rabbit, three times as
large as he was, came rushing out of the woods toward him, and Jimmieboy
on stooping to pick up a stone to throw at Mr.Bunny to frighten him
away, found that all the stones in that enchanted valley were precious.He couldn't help laughing outright when he discovered that the stone he
had thrown at the rabbit was a huge diamond as big as his fist, and that
even had he stopped to choose a less expensive missile he would have had
to confine his choice to pearls, rubies, emeralds, and other gems of the
rarest sort.And then he noticed that what he thought was a rock upon
which he and Bludgeonhead were sitting was a massive nugget of pure
yellow gold.This lead him on to inspect the trees about him and then he
discovered a most absurd thing.Fortyforefoot's extravagance had
prompted him to make all his pine trees of the most beautifully polished
and richly inlaid mahogany; every one of the weeping willows was made of
solid oak, ornamented and carved until the eye wearied of its beauty,
and as for the birds in the trees, their nests were made not of stray
wisps of straw and hay stolen from the barns and fields, but of the
softest silk, rich in color and lined throughout with eiderdown, the
mere sight of which could hardly help being restful to a tired bird--or
boy either, for that matter, Jimmieboy thought."Did he make all this out of sand?All these jewels and magnificent
carvings?""Simply took up a handful of sand and tossed
it up in the air and whatever he commanded it to be it became.But the
most wonderful thing in this place is his spring.He made what you might
call a 'Wish Dipper' out of an old tin cup.Then he dug a hole and
filled it with sand which he commanded to become liquid, and, when the
sand heard him say that, it turned to liquid, but the singular thing
about it is that as Fortyforefoot didn't say what kind of liquid it
should be, it became any kind.So now if any one is thirsty and wants a
glass of cider all he has to do is to dip the wish dipper into the
spring and up comes cider.If he wants lemonade up comes lemonade.If he
wants milk up comes milk.As Bludgeonhead spoke these words Jimmieboy was startled to hear
something very much like an approaching footstep far down the road.he asked, seizing Bludgeonhead by the hand."Yes, I did," replied Bludgeonhead, in a whisper."It sounded to me like
Fortyforefoot's step, too.""I'd better hide, hadn't I?"Climb inside
my coat and snuggle down out of sight in my pocket.We musn't let him
see you yet awhile."Jimmieboy did as he was commanded, and found the pocket a very
comfortable place, only it was a little stuffy."It's pretty hot in here," he whispered."Well, look up on the left hand corner of the outer side of the pocket
and you'll find two flaps that are buttoned up," replied Bludgeonhead,
softly.One will let in all the air you want, and the
other will enable you to peep out and see Fortyforefoot without his
seeing you."In a minute the buttons were found and the flaps opened.Everything
happened as Bludgeonhead said it would, and in a minute Jimmieboy,
peering out through the hole in the cloak, saw Fortyforefoot
approaching.The owner of the beautiful valley seemed very angry when he caught sight
of Bludgeonhead sitting on his property, and hastening up to him, he
cried:

"What business have you here in the Valley of Fortyforefoot?"Jimmieboy shrank back into one corner of the pocket, a little overcome
with fear.Fortyforefoot was larger and more terrible than he thought."I am not good at riddles," said Bludgeonhead, calmly."That is at
riddles of that sort.If you had asked me the difference between a duck
and a garden rake I should have told you that a duck has no teeth and
can eat, while a rake has plenty of teeth and can't eat.But when you
ask me what business I have here I am forced to say that I can't say.""You are a very bright sort of a giant," sneered Fortyforefoot."The fact is I can't help being bright.My
mother polishes me every morning with a damp chamois.""Do you know to whom you are speaking?"asked Fortyforefoot,
threateningly."No; not having been introduced to you, I can't say I know you,"
returned Bludgeonhead.You are Anklehigh, the
Dwarf."At this Fortyforefoot turned purple with rage."I'll right quickly teach thee a
lesson thou rash fellow."Fortyforefoot strode up close to Bludgeonhead, whose size he could not
have guessed because Bludgeonhead had been sitting down all this time
and was pretty well covered over by his cloak.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD SHOWS JIMMIEBOY TO FORTYFOREFOOT.[Blank Page]

"I'll take thee by thine ear and toss thee to the moon," he cried,
reaching out his hand to make good his word."Nonsense, Anklehigh," returned Bludgeonhead, calmly.No dwarf can fight with a giant of my size.""But I am not the dwarf Anklehigh," shrieked Fortyforefoot."And I am Bludgeonhead," returned the other, rising and towering way
above the owner of the valley.cried Fortyforefoot, falling on his knees in abject
terror.Pardon, O, Bludgeonhead.I did not know
you when I was so hasty as to offer to throw you to the moon.I thought
you were--er--that you were--er----"

"More easily thrown," suggested Bludgeonhead."Yes--yes--that was it," stammered Fortyforefoot."And now, to show that
you have forgiven me, I want you to come to my castle and have dinner
with me.""I'll be very glad to," replied Bludgeonhead."What are you going to
have for dinner?""Anything you wish," said Fortyforefoot."I was going to have a very
plain dinner to-night because for to-morrow's dinner I have invited my
brother Fortythreefoot and his wife Fortytwoinch to have a little
special dish I have been so fortunate as to secure.""Oh, only a sniveling creature I caught in one of my traps this
afternoon.He was a soldier, and he wasn't very brave about being
caught, but I judge from looking at him that he will make good eating,"
said Fortyforefoot."I couldn't gather from him who he was.He had on a
military uniform, but he behaved less like a warrior than ever I
supposed a man could.It seems from his story that he was engaged upon
some secret mission, and on his way back to his army, he stumbled over
and into one of my game traps where I found him.He begged me to let him
go, but that was out of the question.I haven't had a soldier to eat for
four years, so I took him to the castle, had him locked up in the
ice-box, and to-morrow we shall eat him."asked Bludgeonhead, thoughtfully.He told me so many names that I didn't
believe he really owned any of them," said Fortyforefoot."All I could
really learn about him was that he was as brave as a lion, and that if I
would spare him he would write me a poem a mile long every day of my
life.""Very attractive offer, that," said Bludgeonhead, with a smile."Yes; but I couldn't do it.I wouldn't miss eating him for anything,"
replied Fortyforefoot, smacking his lips, hungrily."I'd give anything
anybody'd ask, too, if I could find another as good.""Well, now, I thought you
would, and that is really what I have come here for.I have in my pocket
here a real live general that I have captured.Now between you and me, I
don't eat generals.I don't care for them--they fight so.I prefer
preserved cherries and pickled peaches and--er--strawberry jam and
powdered sugar and almonds, and other things like that, you know, and it
occurred to me that if I let you have the general you would supply me
with what I needed of the others.""You have come to the right place, Bludgeonhead," said Fortyforefoot,
eagerly."I'll give you a million cans of jam, all the pickled peaches
and other things you can carry if this general you speak about is a fine
specimen.""Well, here he is," said Bludgeonhead, hauling Jimmieboy out of his
pocket--whispering to Jimmieboy at the same time not to be afraid
because he wouldn't let anything happen to him, and so of course
Jimmieboy felt perfectly safe, though a little excited."No," answered Bludgeonhead, putting Jimmieboy back into his pocket
again."If I ever do find another, though, you shall have him."This of course put Fortyforefoot in a tremendously good humor, and
before an hour had passed he had not only transformed pebbles and twigs
and leaves of trees and other small things into the provisions that the
tin soldiers needed, but he had also furnished horses and wagons enough
to carry them back to headquarters, and then Fortyforefoot accompanied
by Bludgeonhead entered the castle, where the proprietor demanded that
Jimmieboy should be given up to him.Bludgeonhead handed him over at once, and ten minutes later Jimmieboy
found himself locked up in the pantry.Hardly had he time to think over the strange events of the afternoon
when he heard a noise in the ice-box over in one corner of the pantry,
and on going there to see what was the cause of it he heard a familiar
voice repeating over and over again these mournful lines:

    "From Giant number one I ran--
       But O the sequel dire!I truly left a frying-pan
       And jumped into a fire.""Hullo in there," whispered Jimmieboy."The bravest man of my time," replied the voice in the ice-box."Major
Mortimer Carraway Blueface of the 'Jimmieboy Guards.'""Oh, I am so glad to find you again," cried Jimmieboy, throwing open the
ice-box door."I thought it was you the minute I heard your poetry.""You recognized the beauty of
the poem?""But you said you were in the fire when I
knew you were in the ice-box, and so of course----"

"Of course," said the major, with a frown."You remembered that when I
say one thing I mean another.Well, I'm glad to see you again, but why
did you desert me so cruelly?"For a moment Jimmieboy could say nothing, so surprised was he at the
major's question.Then he simply repeated it, his amazement very evident
in the tone of his voice."Why did we desert you so cruelly?"When two of my companions
in arms leave me, the way you and old Spriteyboy did, I think you ought
to make some explanation."But we didn't desert you," said Jimmieboy."No such idea ever entered
our minds.The minute Spritey turned into
Bludgeonhead you ran away just about as fast as your tin legs could
carry you--frightened to death evidently.""Jimmieboy," said the major, his voice husky with emotion, "any other
person than yourself would have had to fight a duel with me for casting
such a doubt as you have just cast upon my courage.The idea of me, of
I, of myself, Major Mortimer Carraway Blueface, the hero of a hundred
and eighty-seven real sham fights, the most poetic as well as the
handsomest man in the 'Jimmieboy Guards' being accused of running away!"I've been accused of dreadful things,
     Of wearing copper finger-rings,
     Of eating green peas with a spoon,
     Of wishing that I owned the moon,
     Of telling things that weren't the truth,
     Of having cut no wisdom tooth,
     In times of war of stealing buns,
     And fainting at the sound of guns,
     Yet never dreamed I'd see the day
     When it was thought I'd run away.Alack--O--well-a-day--alas!Alas--O--well-a-day--alack!Alas--alack--O--well-a-day!Aday--alas--O--lack-a-well--"

"Are you going to keep that up forever?""If you are
I'm going to get out.I've heard stupid poetry in this campaign, but
that's the worst yet.""I only wanted to show you what I could do in the way of a lamentation,"
said the major."If you've had enough I'll stop of course; but tell me,"
he added, sitting down upon a cake of ice, and crossing his legs, "how
on earth did you ever get hold of the ridiculous notion that I ran away
frightened?"The minute
the sprite was changed into Bludgeonhead I turned to speak to you, and
all I could see of you was your coat-tails disappearing around the
corner way down the road.""And just because my coat-tails behaved like that you put me down as a
coward?"I hurried
off; but not because I was afraid.I was simply going down the road to
see if I couldn't find a looking-glass so that Spriteyboy could see how
he looked as a giant.""That's a magnificent excuse," he said."I thought you'd think it was," said the major, with a pleased smile."And when I finally found that there weren't any mirrors to be had
along the road I went back, and you two had gone and left me."It's a great thing, sleep is, and I wrote the
lines off in two tenths of a fifth of a second.As I remember it, this
is the way they went:

    "SLEEP.Deserted by my friends I sit,
       And silently I weep,
     Until I'm wearied so by it,
     I lose my little store of wit;
       I nod and fall asleep.Then in my dreams my friends I spy--
       Once more are they my own.I cease to murmur and to cry,
     For then 'tis sure to be that I
       Forget I am alone.'Tis hence I think that sleep's the best
       Of friends that man has got--
      Not only does it bring him rest
     But makes him feel that he is blest
       With blessings he has not.""Why didn't you go to sleep if you felt that way?""I wanted to find you and I hadn't time.There was only time for me to
scratch that poem off on my mind and start to find you and Bludgeyboy,"
replied the major."His name isn't Bludgeyboy," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."Oh, yes, I forgot," said the major."It's a good name, too,
Bludgeonpate is.""How did you come to be captured by Fortyforefoot?"asked Jimmieboy,
after he had decided not to try to correct the major any more as to
Bludgeonhead's name."The idea of a miserable
ogre like Fortyforefoot capturing me, the most sagacitacious soldier of
modern times.I suppose you think I fell into one of his game traps?""That's what he said," said Jimmieboy."He said you acted in a very
curious way, too--promised him all sorts of things if he'd let you go.""That's just like those big, bragging giants," said the major.I came here of my own free will
and accord."Down here into this pantry and into the ice-chest?You can't fool me," said Jimmieboy."To meet you, of course," retorted the major.I knew it
was part of your scheme to come here.You and I were to be put into the
pantry and then old Bludgeyhat was to come and rescue us.I was the one
to make the scheme, wasn't I?"It was Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, who didn't know whether to
believe the major or not."That's just the way," said the major, indignantly, "he gets all the
credit just because he's big and I don't get any, and yet if you knew of
all the wild animals I've killed to get here to you, how I met
Fortyforefoot and bound him hand and foot and refused to let him go
unless he would permit me to spend a week in his ice-chest, for the sole
and only purpose that I wished to meet you again, you'd change your mind
mighty quick about me.""Did you ever see me in a real sham battle?""No, I never did," said Jimmieboy."Well, you'd better never," returned the major, "unless you want to be
frightened out of your wits.I have been called the living telescope,
sir, because when I begin to fight, in the fiercest manner possible, I
sort of lengthen out and sprout up into the air until I am taller than
any foe within my reach."queried Jimmieboy, with a puzzled air about him."Well, I should like to see it once," said Jimmieboy."Then you will never believe it," returned the major, "because you will
never see it.I never fight in the presence of others, sir."As the major spoke these words a heavy footstep was heard on the stairs.cried the major, springing to his feet."I do not ask you for your gold,
       Nor for an old straw hat--
     I simply ask that I be told
       Oh what, oh what is that?""It is a footstep on the stairs," said Jimmieboy.moaned the major "If it is Fortyforefoot all is
over for us."I was afraid he could not wait,
       The miserable sinner,
     To serve me up in proper state
       At his to-morrow's dinner.Alas, he comes I greatly fear
       In search of Major Me, sir,
     And that he'll wash me down with beer
       This very night at tea, sir.""Oh, why did I come here--why----"

"I shall!"roared a voice out in the passage-way."You shall not," roared another voice, which Jimmieboy was delighted to
recognize as Bludgeonhead's."I am hungry," said the first voice, "and what is mine is my own to do
with as I please."I will toss you into the air, my dear Fortyforefoot," returned
Bludgeonhead's voice, "if you advance another step; and with such force,
sir, that you will never come down again."Stand aside," roared the voice of
Fortyforefoot.The two prisoners in the pantry heard a tremendous scuffling, a crash,
and a loud laugh.Then Bludgeonhead's voice was heard again."Good-by, Fortyforefoot," it cried."I hope he is not going to leave us," whispered Jimmieboy, but the major
was too frightened to speak, and he trembled so that half a dozen times
he fell off the ice-cake that he had been sitting on."Give my love to the moon when you pass her, and when you get up into
the milky way turn half a million of the stars there into baked apples
and throw 'em down to me," called Bludgeonhead's voice."If you'll only lasso me and pull me back I'll do anything you want me
to," came the voice of Fortyforefoot from some tremendous height, it
seemed to Jimmieboy."Not if I know it," replied Bludgeonhead, with a laugh."I think I'd
like to settle down here myself as the owner of Fortyforefoot Valley.Whatever answer was made to this it was too indistinct for Jimmieboy to
hear, and in a minute the key of the pantry door was turned, the door
thrown open, and Bludgeonhead stood before them."You are free," he said, grasping Jimmieboy's hand and squeezing it
affectionately."But I had to get rid of him.It was the only way to do
it."And did you really throw him off into the air?"asked Jimmieboy, as he
walked out into the hall.ejaculated Jimmieboy, as he glanced upward and saw a huge rent in
the ceiling, through which, gradually rising and getting smaller and
smaller the further he rose, was to be seen the unfortunate
Fortyforefoot."I simply picked him up and tossed him over
my head.I shall turn myself into Fortyforefoot
and settle down here forever, only instead of being a bad giant I shall
be a good one--but hallo!The major had crawled out of the ice-chest and was now trying to appear
calm, although his terrible fright still left him trembling so that he
could hardly speak."It is Major Blueface," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."He was Fortyforefoot's other prisoner.""N--nun--not at--t--at--at all," stammered the major."I
def--fuf--feated him in sus--single combat.""But what are you trembling so for now?""I--I am--m not tut--trembling," retorted the major."I--I am o--only
sh--shivering with--th--the--c--c--c--cold.I--I--I've bub--been in
th--that i--i--i--ice bu--box sus--so long."Jimmieboy and Bludgeonhead roared with laughter at this.Then giving the
major a warm coat to put on they sent him up stairs to lie down and
recover his nerves.After the major had been attended to, Bludgeonhead changed himself back
into the sprite again, and he and Jimmieboy sauntered in and out among
the gardens for an hour or more and were about returning to the castle
for supper when they heard sounds of music.There was evidently a brass
band coming up the road.In an instant they hid themselves behind a
tree, from which place of concealment they were delighted two or three
minutes later to perceive that the band was none other than that of the
"Jimmieboy Guards," and that behind it, in splendid military form,
appeared Colonel Zinc followed by the tin soldiers themselves.cried Jimmieboy, throwing his cap into the air.shrieked the colonel, waving his sword with delight, and
commanding his regiment to halt, as he caught sight of Jimmieboy.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD COMES TO THE RESCUE.[Blank Page]

"Us likewise!"cheered the soldiers: following which came a trembling
voice from one of the castle windows which said:

    "I also wish to add my cheer
       Upon this happy day;
     And if you'll kindly come up here
       You'll hear me cry 'Hooray.'""No," said the sprite, motioning to Jimmieboy not to betray the major."Only a little worn-out by the fight we have had with Fortyforefoot.""Yes," said the sprite, modestly."We three have got rid of him at
last.""Do you know who
Fortyforefoot really was?"asked Jimmieboy, his curiosity aroused."The Parallelopipedon himself," said the colonel."We found that out
last night, and fearing that he might have captured our general and our
major we came here to besiege him in his castle and rescue our
officers.""But I don't see how Fortyforefoot could have been the
Parallelopipedon," said Jimmieboy."What would he want to be him for,
when, all he had to do to get anything he wanted was to take sand and
turn it into it?""Ah, but don't you see," explained the colonel, "there was one thing he
never could do as Fortyforefoot.The law prevented him from leaving this
valley here in any other form than that of the Parallelopipedon.He
didn't mind his confinement to the valley very much at first, but after
a while he began to feel cooped up here, and then he took an old packing
box and made it look as much like a living Parallelopipedon as he could.Then he got into it whenever he wanted to roam about the world.Probably
if you will search the castle you will find the cast-off shell he used
to wear, and if you do I hope you will destroy it, because it is said to
be a most horrible spectacle--frightening animals to death and causing
every flower within a mile to wither and shrink up at the mere sight of
it.""It's all true, Jimmieboy," said the sprite.Why,
he only gave us those cherries and peaches there in exchange for
yourself because he expected to get them all back again, you know.""It was a glorious victory," said the colonel."I will now announce it
to the soldiers."This he did and the soldiers were wild with joy when they heard the
news, and the band played a hymn of victory in which the soldiers
joined, singing so vigorously that they nearly cracked their voices.When they had quite finished the colonel said he guessed it was time to
return to the barracks in the nursery."Not before the feast," said the sprite."We have here all the
provisions the general set out to get, and before you return home,
colonel, you and your men should divide them among you."So the table was spread and all went happily.In the midst of the feast
the major appeared, determination written upon every line of his face.The soldiers cheered him loudly as he walked down the length of the
table, which he acknowledged as gracefully as he could with a stiff bow,
and then he spoke:

"Gentlemen," he said, "I have always been a good deal of a favorite with
you, and I know that what I am about to do will fill you with deep
grief.I am going to stop being a man of war.The tremendous victory we
have won to-day is the result entirely of the efforts of myself, General
Jimmieboy and Major Sprite--for to the latter I now give the title I
have borne so honorably for so many years.Our present victory is one of
such brilliantly brilliant brilliance that I feel that I may now retire
with lustre enough attached to my name to last for millions and millions
of years.I need rest, and here I shall take it, in this beautiful
valley, which by virtue of our victory belongs wholly and in equal parts
to General Jimmieboy, Major Sprite and myself.Hereafter I shall be
known only as Mortimer Carraway Blueface, Poet Laureate of Fortyforefoot
Hall, Fortyforefoot Valley, Pictureland.As Governor-General of the
country we have decided to appoint our illustrious friend, Major
Benjamin Bludgeonhead Sprite.General Jimmieboy will remain commander of
the forces, and the rest of you may divide amongst yourselves, as a
reward for your gallant services, all the provisions that may now be
left upon this table.That
is that you do not take the table.It is of solid mahogany and must be
worth a very considerable sum.Now let the saddest word be said,
    Now bend in sorrow deep the head.Let tears flow forth and drench the dell:
    Farewell, brave soldier boys, farewell."Here the major wiped his eyes sadly and sat down by the sprite who shook
his hand kindly and thanked him for giving him his title of major."We'll have fine times living here together," said the sprite."I'm going to see if I can't have
myself made over again, too, Spritey.I'll be pleasanter for you to look
at.What's the use of being a tin soldier in a place where even the
cobblestones are of gold and silver.""You can be plated any how," said Jimmieboy."Yes, and maybe I can have a platinum sword put in, and a real solid
gold head--but just at present that isn't what I want," said the major."What I am after now is a piece of birthday cake with real fruit raisins
in it and strips of citron two inches long, the whole concealed beneath
a one inch frosting."I don't think we have any here," said Jimmieboy, who was much pleased
to see the sprite and the major, both of whom he dearly loved, on such
good terms."But I'll run home and see if I can get some.""Well, we'll all go with you," said the colonel, starting up and
ordering the trumpeters to sound the call to arms."All except Blueface and myself," said the sprite."We will stay here
and put everything in readiness for your return.""That is a good idea," said Jimmieboy."And you'll have to hurry for we
shall be back very soon."This, as it turned out, was a very rash promise for Jimmieboy to make,
for after he and the tin soldiers had got the birthday cake and were
ready to enter Pictureland once more, they found that not one of them
could do it, the frame was so high up and the picture itself so hard
and impenetrable.Jimmieboy felt so badly to be unable to return to his
friends, that, following the major's hint about sleep bringing
forgetfulness of trouble, he threw himself down on the nursery couch,
and closing his brimming eyes dozed off into a dreamless sleep.It was quite dark when he opened them again and found himself still on
the couch with a piece of his papa's birthday cake in his hand, his
sorrows all gone and contentment in their place.His papa was sitting at
his side, and his mamma was standing over by the window smiling."You've had a good long nap, Jimmieboy," said she, "and I rather think,
from several things I've heard you say in your sleep, you've been
dreaming about your tin soldiers.""I don't believe it was a dream, mamma," he said, "it was all too real."And then he told his papa all that had happened.John went to the hallway."Well, it is very singular," said his papa, when Jimmieboy had finished,
"and if you want to believe it all happened you may; but you say all the
soldiers came back with you except Major Blueface?""Yes, every one," said Jimmieboy."Then we can tell whether it was true or not by looking in the tin
soldier's box.If the major isn't there he may be up in Fortyforefoot
castle as you say."Jimmieboy climbed eagerly down from the couch and rushing to the toy
closet got out the box of soldiers and searched it from top to bottom.The major was not to be seen anywhere, nor to this day has Jimmieboy
ever again set eyes upon him.Transcriber's Note:

    ejaculated the Parallelopipedon?He was abstemious, and had none of those temptations to sensual
excess which fill up a man's time first with indulgence and then with
the process of getting well from its effects.He had not, indeed,
exhausted the sources of knowledge, but here again his notions of human
pleasure were narrowed by his want of appetite; for though he seemed
rather surprised at the consideration that Alfred the Great was a
Catholic, or that apart from the Ten Commandments any conception of
moral conduct had occurred to mankind, he was not stimulated to further
inquiries on these remote matters.Yet he aspired to what he regarded as
intellectual society, willingly entertained beneficed clergymen, and
bought the books he heard spoken of, arranging them carefully on the
shelves of what he called his library, and occasionally sitting alone in
the same room with them.But some minds seem well glazed by nature
against the admission of knowledge, and Spike's was one of them.It was
not, however, entirely so with regard to politics.He had had a strong
opinion about the Reform Bill, and saw clearly that the large trading
towns ought to send members.Portraits of the Reform heroes hung framed
and glazed in his library: he prided himself on being a Liberal.In this
last particular, as well as in not giving benefactions and not making
loans without interest, he showed unquestionable firmness.On the Repeal
of the Corn Laws, again, he was thoroughly convinced.His mind was
expansive towards foreign markets, and his imagination could see that
the people from whom we took corn might be able to take the cotton goods
which they had hitherto dispensed with.On his conduct in these
political concerns, his wife, otherwise influential as a woman who
belonged to a family with a title in it, and who had condescended in
marrying him, could gain no hold: she had to blush a little at what was
called her husband's "radicalism"--an epithet which was a very unfair
impeachment of Spike, who never went to the root of anything.But he
understood his own trading affairs, and in this way became a genuine,
constant political element.If he had been born a little later he could
have been accepted as an eligible member of Parliament, and if he had
belonged to a high family he might have done for a member of the
Government.Perhaps his indifference to "views" would have passed for
administrative judiciousness, and he would have been so generally silent
that he must often have been silent in the right place.But this is
empty speculation: there is no warrant for saying what Spike would have
been and known so as to have made a calculable political element, if he
had not been educated by having to manage his trade.A small mind
trained to useful occupation for the satisfying of private need becomes
a representative of genuine class-needs.John went back to the garden.Spike objected to certain items
of legislation because they hampered his own trade, but his neighbours'
trade was hampered by the same causes; and though he would have been
simply selfish in a question of light or water between himself and a
fellow-townsman, his need for a change in legislation, being shared by
all his neighbours in trade, ceased to be simply selfish, and raised him
to a sense of common injury and common benefit.True, if the law could
have been changed for the benefit of his particular business, leaving
the cotton trade in general in a sorry condition while he prospered,
Spike might not have thought that result intolerably unjust; but the
nature of things did not allow of such a result being contemplated as
possible; it allowed of an enlarged market for Spike only through the
enlargement of his neighbours' market, and the Possible is always the
ultimate master of our efforts and desires.Spike was obliged to
contemplate a general benefit, and thus became public-spirited in spite
of himself.Or rather, the nature of things transmuted his active egoism
into a demand for a public benefit.Certainly if Spike had been born a
marquis he could not have had the same chance of being useful as a
political element.But he might have had the same appearance, have been
equally null in conversation, sceptical as to the reality of pleasure,
and destitute of historical knowledge; perhaps even dimly disliking
Jesuitism as a quality in Catholic minds, or regarding Bacon as the
inventor of physical science.The depths of middle-aged gentlemen's
ignorance will never be known, for want of public examinations in this
branch.THE WATCH-DOG OF KNOWLEDGE

Mordax is an admirable man, ardent in intellectual work,
public-spirited, affectionate, and able to find the right words in
conveying ingenious ideas or elevated feeling.Pity that to all these
graces he cannot add what would give them the utmost finish--the
occasional admission that he has been in the wrong, the occasional frank
welcome of a new idea as something not before present to his mind!But
no: Mordax's self-respect seems to be of that fiery quality which
demands that none but the monarchs of thought shall have an advantage
over him, and in the presence of contradiction or the threat of having
his notions corrected, he becomes astonishingly unscrupulous and cruel
for so kindly and conscientious a man."You are fond of attributing those fine qualities to Mordax," said
Acer, the other day, "but I have not much belief in virtues that are
always requiring to be asserted in spite of appearances against them.True fairness and goodwill show themselves precisely where his are
conspicuously absent.I mean, in recognising claims which the rest of
the world are not likely to stand up for.It does not need much love of
truth and justice in me to say that Aldebaran is a bright star, or Isaac
Newton the greatest of discoverers; nor much kindliness in me to want my
notes to be heard above the rest in a chorus of hallelujahs to one
already crowned.Does the man who has the
ear of the public use his advantage tenderly towards poor fellows who
may be hindered of their due if he treats their pretensions with scorn?That is my test of his justice and benevolence."My answer was, that his system of moral tests might be as delusive as
what ignorant people take to be tests of intellect and learning.If the
scholar or _savant_ cannot answer their haphazard questions on the
shortest notice, their belief in his capacity is shaken.But the
better-informed have given up the Johnsonian theory of mind as a pair of
legs able to walk east or west according to choice.Intellect is no
longer taken to be a ready-made dose of ability to attain eminence (or
mediocrity) in all departments; it is even admitted that application in
one line of study or practice has often a laming effect in other
directions, and that an intellectual quality or special facility which
is a furtherance in one medium of effort is a drag in another.We have
convinced ourselves by this time that a man may be a sage in celestial
physics and a poor creature in the purchase of seed-corn, or even in
theorising about the affections; that he may be a mere fumbler in
physiology and yet show a keen insight into human motives; that he may
seem the "poor Poll" of the company in conversation and yet write with
some humorous vigour.It is not true that a man's intellectual power is
like the strength of a timber beam, to be measured by its weakest point.Why should we any more apply that fallacious standard of what is called
consistency to a man's moral nature, and argue against the existence of
fine impulses or habits of feeling in relation to his actions
generally, because those better movements are absent in a class of cases
which act peculiarly on an irritable form of his egoism?The mistake
might be corrected by our taking notice that the ungenerous words or
acts which seem to us the most utterly incompatible with good
dispositions in the offender, are those which offend ourselves.All
other persons are able to draw a milder conclusion.Laniger, who has a
temper but no talent for repartee, having been run down in a fierce way
by Mordax, is inwardly persuaded that the highly-lauded man is a wolf at
heart: he is much tried by perceiving that his own friends seem to think
no worse of the reckless assailant than they did before; and Corvus, who
has lately been flattered by some kindness from Mordax, is unmindful
enough of Laniger's feeling to dwell on this instance of good-nature
with admiring gratitude.There is a fable that when the badger had been
stung all over by bees, a bear consoled him by a rhapsodic account of
how he himself had just breakfasted on their honey.The badger replied,
peevishly, "The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your
muzzle."The bear, it is said, was surprised at the badger's want of
altruism.But this difference of sensibility between Laniger and his friends only
mirrors in a faint way the difference between his own point of view and
that of the man who has injured him.If those neutral, perhaps even
affectionate persons, form no lively conception of what Laniger suffers,
how should Mordax have any such sympathetic imagination to check him in
what he persuades himself is a scourging administered by the qualified
man to the unqualified?Depend upon it, his conscience, though active
enough in some relations, has never given him a twinge because of his
polemical rudeness and even brutality.He would go from the room where
he has been tiring himself through the watches of the night in lifting
and turning a sick friend, and straightway write a reply or rejoinder in
which he mercilessly pilloried a Laniger who had supposed that he could
tell the world something else or more than had been sanctioned by the
eminent Mordax--and what was worse, had sometimes really done so.Does
this nullify the genuineness of motive which made him tender to his
suffering friend?It only proves that his arrogant egoism,
set on fire, sends up smoke and flame where just before there had been
the dews of fellowship and pity.He is angry and equips himself
accordingly--with a penknife to give the offender a _comprachico_
countenance, a mirror to show him the effect, and a pair of nailed boots
to give him his dismissal.All this to teach him who the Romans really
were, and to purge Inquiry of incompetent intrusion, so rendering an
important service to mankind.When a man is in a rage and wants to hurt another in consequence, he can
always regard himself as the civil arm of a spiritual power, and all the
more easily because there is real need to assert the righteous efficacy
of indignation.I for my part feel with the Lanigers, and should object
all the more to their or my being lacerated and dressed with salt, if
the administrator of such torture alleged as a motive his care for Truth
and posterity, and got himself pictured with a halo in consequence.In
transactions between fellow-men it is well to consider a little, in the
first place, what is fair and kind towards the person immediately
concerned, before we spit and roast him on behalf of the next century
but one.Wide-reaching motives, blessed and glorious as they are, and of
the highest sacramental virtue, have their dangers, like all else that
touches the mixed life of the earth.They are archangels with awful brow
and flaming sword, summoning and encouraging us to do the right and the
divinely heroic, and we feel a beneficent tremor in their presence; but
to learn what it is they thus summon us to do, we have to consider the
mortals we are elbowing, who are of our own stature and our own
appetites.I cannot feel sure how my voting will affect the condition of
Central Asia in the coming ages, but I have good reason to believe that
the future populations there will be none the worse off because I
abstain from conjectural vilification of my opponents during the present
parliamentary session, and I am very sure that I shall be less injurious
to my contemporaries.On the whole, and in the vast majority of
instances, the action by which we can do the best for future ages is of
the sort which has a certain beneficence and grace for contemporaries.A
sour father may reform prisons, but considered in his sourness he does
harm.The deed of Judas has been attributed to far-reaching views, and
the wish to hasten his Master's declaration of himself as the Messiah.Perhaps--I will not maintain the contrary--Judas represented his motive
in this way, and felt justified in his traitorous kiss; but my belief
that he deserved, metaphorically speaking, to be where Dante saw him, at
the bottom of the Malebolge, would not be the less strong because he was
not convinced that his action was detestable.I refuse to accept a man
who has the stomach for such treachery, as a hero impatient for the
redemption of mankind and for the beginning of a reign when the kisses
shall be those of peace and righteousness.All this is by the way, to show that my apology for Mordax was not
founded on his persuasion of superiority in his own motives, but on the
compatibility of unfair, equivocal, and even cruel actions with a nature
which, apart from special temptations, is kindly and generous; and also
to enforce the need of checks from a fellow-feeling with those whom our
acts immediately (not distantly) concern.Will any one be so hardy as to
maintain that an otherwise worthy man cannot be vain and arrogant?I
think most of us have some interest in arguing the contrary.And it is
of the nature of vanity and arrogance, if unchecked, to become cruel and
self-justifying.There are fierce beasts within: chain them, chain them,
and let them learn to cower before the creature with wider reason.This
is what one wishes for Mordax--that his heart and brain should restrain
the outleap of roar and talons.As to his unwillingness to admit that an idea which he has not
discovered is novel to him, one is surprised that quick intellect and
shrewd observation do not early gather reasons for being ashamed of a
mental trick which makes one among the comic parts of that various actor
Conceited Ignorance.I have a sort of valet and factotum, an excellent, respectable servant,
whose spelling is so unvitiated by non-phonetic superfluities that he
writes _night_ as _nit_.One day, looking over his accounts, I said to
him jocosely, "You are in the latest fashion with your spelling, Pummel:
most people spell "night" with a _gh_ between the _i_ and the _t_, but
the greatest scholars now spell it as you do.""So I suppose, sir,"
says Pummel; "I've see it with a _gh_, but I've noways give into that
myself."You would never catch Pummel in an interjection of surprise.I
have sometimes laid traps for his astonishment, but he has escaped them
all, either by a respectful neutrality, as of one who would not appear
to notice that his master had been taking too much wine, or else by that
strong persuasion of his all-knowingness which makes it simply
impossible for him to feel himself newly informed.If I tell him that
the world is spinning round and along like a top, and that he is
spinning with it, he says, "Yes, I've heard a deal of that in my time,
sir," and lifts the horizontal lines of his brow a little higher,
balancing his head from side to side as if it were too painfully full.Whether I tell him that they cook puppies in China, that there are ducks
with fur coats in Australia, or that in some parts of the world it is
the pink of politeness to put your tongue out on introduction to a
respectable stranger, Pummel replies, "So I suppose, sir," with an air
of resignation to hearing my poor version of well-known things, such as
elders use in listening to lively boys lately presented with an
anecdote book.His utmost concession is, that what you state is what he
would have supplied if you had given him _carte blanche_ instead of your
needless instruction, and in this sense his favourite answer is, "I
should say.""Pummel," I observed, a little irritated at not getting my coffee, "if
you were to carry your kettle and spirits of wine up a mountain of a
morning, your water would boil there sooner.""Or,
there are boiling springs in Iceland."That's
what I've been thinking, sir."I have taken to asking him hard questions, and as I expected, he never
admits his own inability to answer them without representing it as
common to the human race."What is the cause of the tides, Pummel?"Many gives their opinion, but if I
was to give mine, it 'ud be different."But while he is never surprised himself, he is constantly imagining
situations of surprise for others.His own consciousness is that of one
so thoroughly soaked in knowledge that further absorption is
impossible, but his neighbours appear to him to be in the state of
thirsty sponges which it is a charity to besprinkle.His great
interest in thinking of foreigners is that they must be surprised at
what they see in England, and especially at the beef.He is often
occupied with the surprise Adam must have felt at the sight of the
assembled animals--"for he was not like us, sir, used from a b'y to
Wombwell's shows."He is fond of discoursing to the lad who acts as
shoe-black and general subaltern, and I have overheard him saying to
that small upstart, with some severity, "Now don't you pretend to know,
because the more you pretend the more I see your ignirance"--a lucidity
on his part which has confirmed my impression that the thoroughly
self-satisfied person is the only one fully to appreciate the charm of
humility in others.Your diffident self-suspecting mortal is not very angry that others
should feel more comfortable about themselves, provided they are not
otherwise offensive: he is rather like the chilly person, glad to sit
next a warmer neighbour; or the timid, glad to have a courageous
fellow-traveller.It cheers him to observe the store of small comforts
that his fellow-creatures may find in their self-complacency, just as
one is pleased to see poor old souls soothed by the tobacco and snuff
for which one has neither nose nor stomach oneself.But your arrogant man will not tolerate a presumption which he sees to
be ill-founded.The service he regards society as most in need of is to
put down the conceit which is so particularly rife around him that he is
inclined to believe it the growing characteristic of the present age.In
the schools of Magna Graecia, or in the sixth century of our era, or
even under Kublai Khan, he finds a comparative freedom from that
presumption by which his contemporaries are stirring his able gall.The
way people will now flaunt notions which are not his without appearing
to mind that they are not his, strikes him as especially disgusting.It
might seem surprising to us that one strongly convinced of his own value
should prefer to exalt an age in which _he_ did not flourish, if it were
not for the reflection that the present age is the only one in which
anybody has appeared to undervalue him.A HALF-BREED

An early deep-seated love to which we become faithless has its unfailing
Nemesis, if only in that division of soul which narrows all newer joys
by the intrusion of regret and the established presentiment of change.I
refer not merely to the love of a person, but to the love of ideas,
practical beliefs, and social habits.And faithlessness here means not a
gradual conversion dependent on enlarged knowledge, but a yielding to
seductive circumstance; not a conviction that the original choice was a
mistake, but a subjection to incidents that flatter a growing desire.In
this sort of love it is the forsaker who has the melancholy lot; for an
abandoned belief may be more effectively vengeful than Dido.The child
of a wandering tribe caught young and trained to polite life, if he
feels an hereditary yearning can run away to the old wilds and get his
nature into tune.But there is no such recovery possible to the man who
remembers what he once believed without being convinced that he was in
error, who feels within him unsatisfied stirrings towards old beloved
habits and intimacies from which he has far receded without conscious
justification or unwavering sense of superior attractiveness in the new.This involuntary renegade has his character hopelessly jangled and out
of tune.He is like an organ with its stops in the lawless condition of
obtruding themselves without method, so that hearers are amazed by the
most unexpected transitions--the trumpet breaking in on the flute, and
the oboee confounding both.Hence the lot of Mixtus affects me pathetically, notwithstanding that he
spends his growing wealth with liberality and manifest enjoyment.To
most observers he appears to be simply one of the fortunate and also
sharp commercial men who began with meaning to be rich and have become
what they meant to be: a man never taken to be well-born, but
surprisingly better informed than the well-born usually are, and
distinguished among ordinary commercial magnates by a personal kindness
which prompts him not only to help the suffering in a material way
through his wealth, but also by direct ministration of his own; yet with
all this, diffusing, as it were, the odour of a man delightedly
conscious of his wealth as an equivalent for the other social
distinctions of rank and intellect which he can thus admire without
envying.Hardly one among those superficial observers can suspect that
he aims or has ever aimed at being a writer; still less can they imagine
that his mind is often moved by strong currents of regret and of the
most unworldly sympathies from the memories of a youthful time when his
chosen associates were men and women whose only distinction was a
religious, a philanthropic, or an intellectual enthusiasm, when the lady
on whose words his attention most hung was a writer of minor religious
literature, when he was a visitor and exhorter of the poor in the alleys
of a great provincial town, and when he attended the lectures given
specially to young men by Mr Apollos, the eloquent congregational
preacher, who had studied in Germany and had liberal advanced views then
far beyond the ordinary teaching of his sect.At that time Mixtus
thought himself a young man of socially reforming ideas, of religious
principles and religious yearnings.It was within his prospects also to
be rich, but he looked forward to a use of his riches chiefly for
reforming and religious purposes.His opinions were of a strongly
democratic stamp, except that even then, belonging to the class of
employers, he was opposed to all demands in the employed that would
restrict the expansiveness of trade.He was the most democratic in
relation to the unreasonable privileges of the aristocracy and landed
interest; and he had also a religious sense of brotherhood with the
poor.Altogether, he was a sincerely benevolent young man, interested in
ideas, and renouncing personal ease for the sake of study, religious
communion, and good works.If you had known him then you would have
expected him to marry a highly serious and perhaps literary woman,
sharing his benevolent and religious habits, and likely to encourage
his studies--a woman who along with himself would play a distinguished
part in one of the most enlightened religious circles of a great
provincial capital.How is it that Mixtus finds himself in a London mansion, and in society
totally unlike that which made the ideal of his younger years?Why, he married Scintilla, who fascinated him as she had fascinated
others, by her prettiness, her liveliness, and her music.It is a common
enough case, that of a man being suddenly captivated by a woman nearly
the opposite of his ideal; or if not wholly captivated, at least
effectively captured by a combination of circumstances along with an
unwarily manifested inclination which might otherwise have been
transient.Mixtus was captivated and then captured on the worldly side
of his disposition, which had been always growing and flourishing side
by side with his philanthropic and religious tastes.He had ability in
business, and he had early meant to be rich; also, he was getting rich,
and the taste for such success was naturally growing with the pleasure
of rewarded exertion.It was during a business sojourn in London that he
met Scintilla, who, though without fortune, associated with families of
Greek merchants living in a style of splendour, and with artists
patronised by such wealthy entertainers.Mixtus on this occasion became
familiar with a world in which wealth seemed the key to a more brilliant
sort of dominance than that of a religious patron in the provincial
circles of X. Would it not be possible to unite the two kinds of sway?A
man bent on the most useful ends might, _with a fortune large enough_,
make morality magnificent, and recommend religious principle by showing
it in combination with the best kind of house and the most liberal of
tables; also with a wife whose graces, wit, and accomplishments gave a
finish sometimes lacking even to establishments got up with that
unhesitating worldliness to which high cost is a sufficient reason.Now this lively lady knew nothing of
Nonconformists, except that they were unfashionable: she did not
distinguish one conventicle from another, and Mr Apollos with his
enlightened interpretations seemed to her as heavy a bore, if not quite
so ridiculous, as Mr Johns could have been with his solemn twang at the
Baptist chapel in the lowest suburbs, or as a local preacher among the
Methodists.In general, people who appeared seriously to believe in any
sort of doctrine, whether religious, social, or philosophical, seemed
rather absurd to Scintilla.Ten to one these theoretic people pronounced
oddly, had some reason or other for saying that the most agreeable
things were wrong, wore objectionable clothes, and wanted you to
subscribe to something.They were probably ignorant of art and music,
did not understand _badinage_, and, in fact, could talk of nothing
amusing.In Scintilla's eyes the majority of persons were ridiculous and
deplorably wanting in that keen perception of what was good taste, with
which she herself was blest by nature and education; but the people
understood to be religious or otherwise theoretic, were the most
ridiculous of all, without being proportionately amusing and invitable.Did Mixtus not discover this view of Scintilla's before their marriage?Or did he allow her to remain in ignorance of habits and opinions which
had made half the occupation of his youth?When a man is inclined to marry a particular woman, and has made any
committal of himself, this woman's opinions, however different from his
own, are readily regarded as part of her pretty ways, especially if they
are merely negative; as, for example, that she does not insist on the
Trinity or on the rightfulness or expediency of church rates, but simply
regards her lover's troubling himself in disputation on these heads as
stuff and nonsense.The man feels his own superior strength, and is sure
that marriage will make no difference to him on the subjects about which
he is in earnest.And to laugh at men's affairs is a woman's privilege,
tending to enliven the domestic hearth.If Scintilla had no liking for
the best sort of nonconformity, she was without any troublesome bias
towards Episcopacy, Anglicanism, and early sacraments, and was quite
contented not to go to church.As to Scintilla's acquaintance with her lover's tastes on these
subjects, she was equally convinced on her side that a husband's queer
ways while he was a bachelor would be easily laughed out of him when he
had married an adroit woman.Mixtus, she felt, was an excellent
creature, quite likable, who was getting rich; and Scintilla meant to
have all the advantages of a rich man's wife.She was not in the least a
wicked woman; she was simply a pretty animal of the ape kind, with an
aptitude for certain accomplishments which education had made the most
of.But we have seen what has been the result to poor Mixtus.He has become
richer even than he dreamed of being, has a little palace in London, and
entertains with splendour the half-aristocratic, professional, and
artistic society which he is proud to think select.This society regards
him as a clever fellow in his particular branch, seeing that he has
become a considerable capitalist, and as a man desirable to have on the
list of one's acquaintance.But from every other point of view Mixtus
finds himself personally submerged: what he happens to think is not felt
by his esteemed guests to be of any consequence, and what he used to
think with the ardour of conviction he now hardly ever expresses.He is
transplanted, and the sap within him has long been diverted into other
than the old lines of vigorous growth.How could he speak to the artist
Crespi or to Sir Hong Kong Bantam about the enlarged doctrine of Mr
Apollos?How could he mention to them his former efforts towards
evangelising the inhabitants of the X. alleys?And his references to his
historical and geographical studies towards a survey of possible markets
for English products are received with an air of ironical suspicion by
many of his political friends, who take his pretension to give advice
concerning the Amazon, the Euphrates, and the Niger as equivalent to the
currier's wide views on the applicability of leather.He can only make a
figure through his genial hospitality.It is in vain that he buys the
best pictures and statues of the best artists.Nobody will call him a
judge in art.If his pictures and statues are well chosen it is
generally thought that Scintilla told him what to buy; and yet Scintilla
in other connections is spoken of as having only a superficial and
often questionable taste.Mixtus, it is decided, is a good fellow, not
ignorant--no, really having a good deal of knowledge as well as sense,
but not easy to classify otherwise than as a rich man.He has
consequently become a little uncertain as to his own point of view, and
in his most unreserved moments of friendly intercourse, even when
speaking to listeners whom he thinks likely to sympathise with the
earlier part of his career, he presents himself in all his various
aspects and feels himself in turn what he has been, what he is, and what
others take him to be (for this last status is what we must all more or
less accept).He will recover with some glow of enthusiasm the vision of
his old associates, the particular limit he was once accustomed to trace
of freedom in religious speculation, and his old ideal of a worthy life;
but he will presently pass to the argument that money is the only means
by which you can get what is best worth having in the world, and will
arrive at the exclamation "Give me money!"with the tone and gesture of
a man who both feels and knows.Then if one of his audience, not having
money, remarks that a man may have made up his mind to do without money
because he prefers something else, Mixtus is with him immediately,
cordially concurring in the supreme value of mind and genius, which
indeed make his own chief delight, in that he is able to entertain the
admirable possessors of these attributes at his own table, though not
himself reckoned among them.Yet, he will proceed to observe, there was
a time when he sacrificed his sleep to study, and even now amid the
press of business he from time to time thinks of taking up the
manuscripts which he hopes some day to complete, and is always
increasing his collection of valuable works bearing on his favourite
topics.And it is true that he has read much in certain directions, and
can remember what he has read; he knows the history and theories of
colonisation and the social condition of countries that do not at
present consume a sufficiently large share of our products and
manufactures.He continues his early habit of regarding the spread of
Christianity as a great result of our commercial intercourse with black,
brown, and yellow populations; but this is an idea not spoken of in the
sort of fashionable society that Scintilla collects round her husband's
table, and Mixtus now philosophically reflects that the cause must come
before the effect, and that the thing to be directly striven for is the
commercial intercourse, not excluding a little war if that also should
prove needful as a pioneer of Christianity.He has long been wont to
feel bashful about his former religion; as if it were an old attachment
having consequences which he did not abandon but kept in decent privacy,
his avowed objects and actual position being incompatible with their
public acknowledgment.There is the same kind of fluctuation in his aspect towards social
questions and duties.He has not lost the kindness that used to make him
a benefactor and succourer of the needy, and he is still liberal in
helping forward the clever and industrious; but in his active
superintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and
more of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be
a reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries.Hence many who this
is an idea not spoken of in the sort of fashionable society that
Scintilla collects round her husband's table, and Mixtus now
philosophically reflects that the cause must come before the effect, and
that the thing to be directly striven for is the commercial intercourse,
not excluding a little war if that also should prove needful as a
pioneer of Christianity.He has long been wont to feel bashful about his

superintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and
more of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be
a reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries.Hence many who have
occasionally met him when trade questions were being discussed, conclude
him to be indistinguishable from the ordinary run of moneyed and
money-getting men.Indeed, hardly any of his acquaintances know what
Mixtus really is, considered as a whole--nor does Mixtus himself know
it.X.


DEBASING THE MORAL CURRENCY."Il ne faut pas mettre un ridicule ou il n'y en a point: c'est se gater
le gout, c'est corrompre son jugement et celui des autres.Mais le
ridicule qui est quelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grace
et d'une maniere qui plaise et qui instruise."I am fond of quoting this passage from La Bruyere, because the subject
is one where I like to show a Frenchman on my side, to save my
sentiments from being set down to my peculiar dulness and deficient
sense of the ludicrous, and also that they may profit by that
enhancement of ideas when presented in a foreign tongue, that glamour of
unfamiliarity conferring a dignity on the foreign names of very common
things, of which even a philosopher like Dugald Stewart confesses the
influence.I remember hearing a fervid woman attempt to recite in
English the narrative of a begging Frenchman who described the violent
death of his father in the July days.The narrative had impressed her,
through the mists of her flushed anxiety to understand it, as something
quite grandly pathetic; but finding the facts turn out meagre, and her
audience cold, she broke off, saying, "It sounded so much finer in
French--_j'ai vu le sang de mon pere_, and so on--I wish I could repeat
it in French."This was a pardonable illusion in an old-fashioned lady
who had not received the polyglot education of the present day; but I
observe that even now much nonsense and bad taste win admiring
acceptance solely by virtue of the French language, and one may fairly
desire that what seems a just discrimination should profit by the
fashionable prejudice in favour of La Bruyere's idiom.But I wish he had
added that the habit of dragging the ludicrous into topics where the
chief interest is of a different or even opposite kind is a sign not of
endowment, but of deficiency.The art of spoiling is within reach of the
dullest faculty: the coarsest clown with a hammer in his hand might
chip the nose off every statue and bust in the Vatican, and stand
grinning at the effect of his work.Because wit is an exquisite product
of high powers, we are not therefore forced to admit the sadly confused
inference of the monotonous jester that he is establishing his
superiority over every less facetious person, and over every topic on
which he is ignorant or insensible, by being uneasy until he has
distorted it in the small cracked mirror which he carries about with him
as a joking apparatus.Some high authority is needed to give many worthy
and timid persons the freedom of muscular repose under the growing
demand on them to laugh when they have no other reason than the peril of
being taken for dullards; still more to inspire them with the courage to
say that they object to the theatrical spoiling for themselves and their
children of all affecting themes, all the grander deeds and aims of men,
by burlesque associations adapted to the taste of rich fishmongers in
the stalls and their assistants in the gallery.The English people in
the present generation are falsely reputed to know Shakspere (as, by
some innocent persons, the Florentine mule-drivers are believed to have
known the _Divina Commedia_, not, perhaps, excluding all the subtle
discourses in the _Purgatorio_ and _Paradiso_); but there seems a clear
prospect that in the coming generation he will be known to them through
burlesques, and that his plays will find a new life as pantomimes.A
bottle-nosed Lear will come on with a monstrous corpulence from which he
will frantically dance himself free during the midnight storm; Rosalind
and Celia will join in a grotesque ballet with shepherds and
shepherdesses; Ophelia in fleshings and a voluminous brevity of
grenadine will dance through the mad scene, finishing with the famous
"attitude of the scissors" in the arms of Laertes; and all the speeches
in "Hamlet" will be so ingeniously parodied that the originals will be
reduced to a mere _memoria technica_ of the improver's puns--premonitory
signs of a hideous millennium, in which the lion will have to lie down
with the lascivious monkeys whom (if we may trust Pliny) his soul
naturally abhors.I have been amazed to find that some artists whose own works have the
ideal stamp, are quite insensible to the damaging tendency of the
burlesquing spirit which ranges to and fro and up and down on the earth,
seeing no reason (except a precarious censorship) why it should not
appropriate every sacred, heroic, and pathetic theme which serves to
make up the treasure of human admiration, hope, and love.One would have
thought that their own half-despairing efforts to invest in worthy
outward shape the vague inward impressions of sublimity, and the
consciousness of an implicit ideal in the commonest scenes, might have
made them susceptible of some disgust or alarm at a species of burlesque
which is likely to render their compositions no better than a dissolving
view, where every noble form is seen melting into its preposterous
caricature.It used to be imagined of the unhappy medieval Jews that
they parodied Calvary by crucifying dogs; if they had been guilty they
would at least have had the excuse of the hatred and rage begotten by
persecution.Are we on the way to a parody which shall have no other
excuse than the reckless search after fodder for degraded
appetites--after the pay to be earned by pasturing Circe's herd where
they may defile every monument of that growing life which should have
kept them human?The world seems to me well supplied with what is genuinely ridiculous:
wit and humour may play as harmlessly or beneficently round the changing
facets of egoism, absurdity, and vice, as the sunshine over the rippling
sea or the dewy meadows.Why should we make our delicious sense of the
ludicrous, with its invigorating shocks of laughter and its
irrepressible smiles which are the outglow of an inward radiation as
gentle and cheering as the warmth of morning, flourish like a brigand on
the robbery of our mental wealth?--or let it take its exercise as a
madman might, if allowed a free nightly promenade, by drawing the
populace with bonfires which leave some venerable structure a blackened
ruin or send a scorching smoke across the portraits of the past, at
which we once looked with a loving recognition of fellowship, and
disfigure them into butts of mockery?--nay, worse--use it to degrade the
healthy appetites and affections of our nature as they are seen to be
degraded in insane patients whose system, all out of joint, finds
matter for screaming laughter in mere topsy-turvy, makes every passion
preposterous or obscene, and turns the hard-won order of life into a
second chaos hideous enough to make one wail that the first was ever
thrilled with light?This is what I call debasing the moral currency: lowering the value of
every inspiring fact and tradition so that it will command less and less
of the spiritual products, the generous motives which sustain the charm
and elevation of our social existence--the something besides bread by
which man saves his soul alive.The bread-winner of the family may
demand more and more coppery shillings, or assignats, or greenbacks for
his day's work, and so get the needful quantum of food; but let that
moral currency be emptied of its value--let a greedy buffoonery debase
all historic beauty, majesty, and pathos, and the more you heap up the
desecrated symbols the greater will be the lack of the ennobling
emotions which subdue the tyranny of suffering, and make ambition one
with social virtue.And yet, it seems, parents will put into the hands of their children
ridiculous parodies (perhaps with more ridiculous "illustrations") of
the poems which stirred their own tenderness or filial piety, and carry
them to make their first acquaintance with great men, great works, or
solemn crises through the medium of some miscellaneous burlesque which,
with its idiotic puns and farcical attitudes, will remain among their
primary associations, and reduce them throughout their time of studious
preparation for life to the moral imbecility of an inward giggle at what
might have stimulated their high emulation or fed the fountains of
compassion, trust, and constancy.One wonders where these parents have
deposited that stock of morally educating stimuli which is to be
independent of poetic tradition, and to subsist in spite of the finest
images being degraded and the finest words of genius being poisoned as
with some befooling drug.Will fine wit, will exquisite humour prosper the more through this
turning of all things indiscriminately into food for a gluttonous
laughter, an idle craving without sense of flavours?That delightful power which La Bruyere points to--"le ridicule qui est
quelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grace et d'une maniere
qui plaise et qui instruise"--depends on a discrimination only
compatible with the varied sensibilities which give sympathetic insight,
and with the justice of perception which is another name for grave
knowledge.Such a result is no more to be expected from faculties on the
strain to find some small hook by which they may attach the lowest
incongruity to the most momentous subject, than it is to be expected of
a sharper, watching for gulls in a great political assemblage, that he
will notice the blundering logic of partisan speakers, or season his
observation with the salt of historical parallels.But after all our
psychological teaching, and in the midst of our zeal for education, we
are still, most of us, at the stage of believing that mental powers and
habits have somehow, not perhaps in the general statement, but in any
particular case, a kind of spiritual glaze against conditions which we
are continually applying to them.We soak our children in habits of
contempt and exultant gibing, and yet are confident that--as Clarissa
one day said to me--"We can always teach them to be reverent in the
right place, you know."And doubtless if she were to take her boys to
see a burlesque Socrates, with swollen legs, dying in the utterance of
cockney puns, and were to hang up a sketch of this comic scene among
their bedroom prints, she would think this preparation not at all to the
prejudice of their emotions on hearing their tutor read that narrative
of the _Apology_ which has been consecrated by the reverent gratitude of
ages.This is the impoverishment that threatens our posterity:--a new
Famine, a meagre fiend with lewd grin and clumsy hoof, is breathing a
moral mildew over the harvest of our human sentiments.These are the
most delicate elements of our too easily perishable civilisation.And
here again I like to quote a French testimony.Sainte Beuve, referring
to a time of insurrectionary disturbance, says: "Rien de plus prompt a
baisser que la civilisation dans des crises comme celle-ci; on perd en
trois semaines le resultat de plusieurs siecles.La civilisation, la
_vie_ est une chose apprise et inventee, qu'on le sache bien: '_Inventas
aut qui vitam excoluere per artes_.'Les hommes apres quelques annees de
paix oublient trop cette verite: ils arrivent a croire que la _culture_
est chose innee, qu'elle est la meme chose que la _nature_.La
sauvagerie est toujours la a deux pas, et, des qu'on lache pied, elle
recommence."We have been severely enough taught (if we were willing to
learn) that our civilisation, considered as a splendid material fabric,
is helplessly in peril without the spiritual police of sentiments or
ideal feelings.And it is this invisible police which we had need, as a
community, strive to maintain in efficient force.How if a dangerous
"Swing" were sometimes disguised in a versatile entertainer devoted to
the amusement of mixed audiences?And I confess that sometimes when I
see a certain style of young lady, who checks our tender admiration with
rouge and henna and all the blazonry of an extravagant expenditure, with
slang and bold _brusquerie_ intended to signify her emancipated view of
things, and with cynical mockery which she mistakes for penetration, I
am sorely tempted to hiss out "_Petroleuse!_" It is a small matter to
have our palaces set aflame compared with the misery of having our sense
of a noble womanhood, which is the inspiration of a purifying shame, the
promise of life--penetrating affection, stained and blotted out by
images of repulsiveness.These things come--not of higher education,
but--of dull ignorance fostered into pertness by the greedy vulgarity
which reverses Peter's visionary lesson and learns to call all things
common and unclean.The Tirynthians, according to an ancient story reported by Athenaeus,
becoming conscious that their trick of laughter at everything and
nothing was making them unfit for the conduct of serious affairs,
appealed to the Delphic oracle for some means of cure.The god
prescribed a peculiar form of sacrifice, which would be effective if
they could carry it through without laughing.They did their best; but
the flimsy joke of a boy upset their unaccustomed gravity, and in this
way the oracle taught them that even the gods could not prescribe a
quick cure for a long vitiation, or give power and dignity to a people
who in a crisis of the public wellbeing were at the mercy of a poor
jest.THE WASP CREDITED WITH THE HONEYCOMB

No man, I imagine, would object more strongly than Euphorion to
communistic principles in relation to material property, but with regard
to property in ideas he entertains such principles willingly, and is
disposed to treat the distinction between Mine and Thine in original
authorship as egoistic, narrowing, and low.I have known him, indeed,
insist at some expense of erudition on the prior right of an ancient, a
medieval, or an eighteenth century writer to be credited with a view or
statement lately advanced with some show of originality; and this
championship seems to imply a nicety of conscience towards the dead.He
is evidently unwilling that his neighbours should get more credit than
is due to them, and in this way he appears to recognise a certain
proprietorship even in spiritual production.But perhaps it is no real
inconsistency that, with regard to many instances of modern origination,
it is his habit to talk with a Gallic largeness and refer to the
universe: he expatiates on the diffusive nature of intellectual
products, free and all-embracing as the liberal air; on the
infinitesimal smallness of individual origination compared with the
massive inheritance of thought on which every new generation enters; on
that growing preparation for every epoch through which certain ideas or
modes of view are said to be in the air, and, still more metaphorically
speaking, to be inevitably absorbed, so that every one may be excused
for not knowing how he got them.Above all, he insists on the proper
subordination of the irritable self, the mere vehicle of an idea or
combination which, being produced by the sum total of the human race,
must belong to that multiple entity, from the accomplished lecturer or
populariser who transmits it, to the remotest generation of Fuegians or
Hottentots, however indifferent these may be to the superiority of their
right above that of the eminently perishable dyspeptic author.One may admit that such considerations carry a profound truth to be
even religiously contemplated, and yet object all the more to the mode
in which Euphorion seems to apply them.I protest against the use of
these majestic conceptions to do the dirty work of unscrupulosity and
justify the non-payment of conscious debts which cannot be defined or
enforced by the law.Especially since it is observable that the large
views as to intellectual property which can apparently reconcile an
able person to the use of lately borrowed ideas as if they were his
own, when this spoliation is favoured by the public darkness, never
hinder him from joining in the zealous tribute of recognition and
applause to those warriors of Truth whose triumphal arches are seen in
the public ways, those conquerors whose battles and "annexations" even
the carpenters and bricklayers know by name.Surely the acknowledgment
of a mental debt which will not be immediately detected, and may never
be asserted, is a case to which the traditional susceptibility to
"debts of honour" would be suitably transferred.There is no massive
public opinion that can be expected to tell on these relations of
thinkers and investigators&mdash;relations to be thoroughly understood
and felt only by those who are interested in the life of ideas and
acquainted with their history.To lay false claim to an invention or
discovery which has an immediate market value; to vamp up a
professedly new book of reference by stealing from the pages of one
already produced at the cost of much labour and material; to copy
somebody else's poem and send the manuscript to a magazine, or hand it
about among; friends as an original "effusion;" to deliver an elegant
extract from a known writer as a piece of improvised
eloquence:&mdash;these are the limits within which the dishonest
pretence of originality is likely to get hissed or hooted and bring
more or less shame on the culprit.It is not necessary to understand
the merit of a performance, or even to spell with any comfortable
confidence, in order to perceive at once that such pretences are not
respectable.But the difference between these vulgar frauds, these
devices of ridiculous jays whose ill-secured plumes are seen falling
off them as they run, and the quiet appropriation of other people's
philosophic or scientific ideas, can hardly be held to lie in their
moral quality unless we take impunity as our criterion.The pitiable
jays had no presumption in their favour and foolishly fronted an alert
incredulity; but Euphorion, the accomplished theorist, has an audience
who expect much of him, and take it as the most natural thing in the
world that every unusual view which he presents anonymously should be
due solely to his ingenuity.His borrowings are no incongruous
feathers awkwardly stuck on; they have an appropriateness which makes
them seem an answer to anticipation, like the return phrases of a
melody.Certainly one cannot help the ignorant conclusions of polite
society, and there are perhaps fashionable persons who, if a speaker
has occasion to explain what the occipat is, will consider that he has
lately discovered that curiously named portion of the animal frame:
one cannot give a genealogical introduction to every long-stored item
of fact or conjecture that may happen to be a revelation for the large
class of persons who are understood to judge soundly on a small basis
of knowledge.But Euphorion would be very sorry to have it supposed
that he is unacquainted with the history of ideas, and sometimes
carries even into minutiae the evidence of his exact registration of
names in connection with quotable phrases or suggestions: I can
therefore only explain the apparent infirmity of his memory in cases
of larger "conveyance" by supposing that he is accustomed by the very
association of largeness to range them at once under those grand laws
of the universe in the light of which Mine and Thine disappear and are
resolved into Everybody's or Nobody's, and one man's particular
obligations to another melt untraceably into the obligations of the
earth to the solar system in general.Euphorion himself, if a particular omission of acknowledgment were
brought home to him, would probably take a narrower ground of
explanation.It was a lapse of memory; or it did not occur to him as
necessary in this case to mention a name, the source being well
known--or (since this seems usually to act as a strong reason for
mention) he rather abstained from adducing the name because it might
injure the excellent matter advanced, just as an obscure trade-mark
casts discredit on a good commodity, and even on the retailer who has
furnished himself from a quarter not likely to be esteemed first-rate.No doubt this last is a genuine and frequent reason for the
non-acknowledgment of indebtedness to what one may call impersonal as
well as personal sources: even an American editor of school classics
whose own English could not pass for more than a syntactical shoddy of
the cheapest sort, felt it unfavourable to his reputation for sound
learning that he should be obliged to the Penny Cyclopaedia, and
disguised his references to it under contractions in which _Us.took the place of the low word _Penny_.Works of this convenient stamp,
easily obtained and well nourished with matter, are felt to be like rich
but unfashionable relations who are visited and received in privacy, and
whose capital is used or inherited without any ostentatious insistance
on their names and places of abode.As to memory, it is known that this
frail faculty naturally lets drop the facts which are less flattering to
our self-love--when it does not retain them carefully as subjects not to
be approached, marshy spots with a warning flag over them.But it is
always interesting to bring forward eminent names, such as Patricius or
Scaliger, Euler or Lagrange, Bopp or Humboldt.To know exactly what has
been drawn from them is erudition and heightens our own influence, which
seems advantageous to mankind; whereas to cite an author whose ideas may
pass as higher currency under our own signature can have no object
except the contradictory one of throwing the illumination over his
figure when it is important to be seen oneself.All these reasons must
weigh considerably with those speculative persons who have to ask
themselves whether or not Universal Utilitarianism requires that in the
particular instance before them they should injure a man who has been of
service to them, and rob a fellow-workman of the credit which is due to
him.After all, however, it must be admitted that hardly any accusation is
more difficult to prove, and more liable to be false, than that of a
plagiarism which is the conscious theft of ideas and deliberate
reproduction of them as original.The arguments on the side of acquittal
are obvious and strong:--the inevitable coincidences of contemporary
thinking; and our continual experience of finding notions turning up in
our minds without any label on them to tell us whence they came; so that
if we are in the habit of expecting much from our own capacity we accept
them at once as a new inspiration.Then, in relation to the elder
authors, there is the difficulty first of learning and then of
remembering exactly what has been wrought into the backward tapestry of
the world's history, together with the fact that ideas acquired long ago
reappear as the sequence of an awakened interest or a line of inquiry
which is really new in us, whence it is conceivable that if we were
ancients some of us might be offering grateful hecatombs by mistake, and
proving our honesty in a ruinously expensive manner.On the other hand,
the evidence on which plagiarism is concluded is often of a kind which,
though much trusted in questions of erudition and historical criticism,
is apt to lead us injuriously astray in our daily judgments, especially
of the resentful, condemnatory sort.How Pythagoras came by his ideas,
whether St Paul was acquainted with all the Greek poets, what Tacitus
must have known by hearsay and systematically ignored, are points on
which a false persuasion of knowledge is less damaging to justice and
charity than an erroneous confidence, supported by reasoning
fundamentally similar, of my neighbour's blameworthy behaviour in a case
where I am personally concerned.No premisses require closer scrutiny
than those which lead to the constantly echoed conclusion, "He must have
known," or "He must have read."I marvel that this facility of belief on
the side of knowledge can subsist under the daily demonstration that the
easiest of all things to the human mind is _not_ to know and _not_ to
read.To praise, to blame, to shout, grin, or hiss, where others shout,
grin, or hiss--these are native tendencies; but to know and to read are
artificial, hard accomplishments, concerning which the only safe
supposition is, that as little of them has been done as the case admits.An author, keenly conscious of having written, can hardly help imagining
his condition of lively interest to be shared by others, just as we are
all apt to suppose that the chill or heat we are conscious of must be
general, or even to think that our sons and daughters, our pet schemes,
and our quarrelling correspondence, are themes to which intelligent
persons will listen long without weariness.But if the ardent author
happen to be alive to practical teaching he will soon learn to divide
the larger part of the enlightened public into those who have not read
him and think it necessary to tell him so when they meet him in polite
society, and those who have equally abstained from reading him, but wish
to conceal this negation and speak of his "incomparable works" with that
trust in testimony which always has its cheering side.Hence it is worse than foolish to entertain silent suspicions of
plagiarism, still more to give them voice, when they are founded on a
construction of probabilities which a little more attention to everyday
occurrences as a guide in reasoning would show us to be really
worthless, considered as proof.The length to which one man's memory can
go in letting drop associations that are vital to another can hardly
find a limit.It is not to be supposed that a person desirous to make an
agreeable impression on you would deliberately choose to insist to you,
with some rhetorical sharpness, on an argument which you were the first
to elaborate in public; yet any one who listens may overhear such
instances of obliviousness.You naturally remember your peculiar
connection with your acquaintance's judicious views; but why should
_he_?Your fatherhood, which is an intense feeling to you, is only an
additional fact of meagre interest for him to remember; and a sense of
obligation to the particular living fellow-struggler who has helped us
in our thinking, is not yet a form of memory the want of which is felt
to be disgraceful or derogatory, unless it is taken to be a want of
polite instruction, or causes the missing of a cockade on a day of
celebration.In our suspicions of plagiarism we must recognise as the
first weighty probability, that what we who feel injured remember best
is precisely what is least likely to enter lastingly into the memory of
our neighbours.But it is fair to maintain that the neighbour who
borrows your property, loses it for a while, and when it turns up again
forgets your connection with it and counts it his own, shows himself so
much the feebler in grasp and rectitude of mind.Some absent persons
cannot remember the state of wear in their own hats and umbrellas, and
have no mental check to tell them that they have carried home a
fellow-visitor's more recent purchase: they may be excellent
householders, far removed from the suspicion of low devices, but one
wishes them a more correct perception, and a more wary sense that a
neighbours umbrella may be newer than their own.True, some persons are so constituted that the very excellence of an
idea seems to them a convincing reason that it must be, if not solely,
yet especially theirs.It fits in so beautifully with their general
wisdom, it lies implicitly in so many of their manifested opinions, that
if they have not yet expressed it (because of preoccupation) it is
clearly a part of their indigenous produce, and is proved by their
immediate eloquent promulgation of it to belong more naturally and
appropriately to them than to the person who seemed first to have
alighted on it, and who sinks in their all-originating consciousness to
that low kind of entity, a second cause.This is not lunacy, nor
pretence, but a genuine state of mind very effective in practice, and
often carrying the public with it, so that the poor Columbus is found to
be a very faulty adventurer, and the continent is named after Amerigo.Lighter examples of this instinctive appropriation are constantly met
with among brilliant talkers.Aquila is too agreeable and amusing for
any one who is not himself bent on display to be angry at his
conversational rapine--his habit of darting down on every morsel of
booty that other birds may hold in their beaks, with an innocent air, as
if it were all intended for his use, and honestly counted on by him as a
tribute in kind.Hardly any man, I imagine, can have had less trouble in
gathering a showy stock of information than Aquila.On close inquiry you
would probably find that he had not read one epoch-making book of modern
times, for he has a career which obliges him to much correspondence and
other official work, and he is too fond of being in company to spend his
leisure moments in study; but to his quick eye, ear, and tongue, a few
predatory excursions in conversation where there are instructed persons,
gradually furnish surprisingly clever modes of statement and allusion on
the dominant topic.When he first adopts a subject he necessarily falls
into mistakes, and it is interesting to watch his gradual progress into
fuller information and better nourished irony, without his ever needing
to admit that he has made a blunder or to appear conscious of
correction.Suppose, for example, he had incautiously founded some
ingenious remarks on a hasty reckoning that nine thirteens made a
hundred and two, and the insignificant Bantam, hitherto silent, seemed
to spoil the flow of ideas by stating that the product could not be
taken as less than a hundred and seventeen, Aquila would glide on in the
most graceful manner from a repetition of his previous remark to the
continuation--"All this is on the supposition that a hundred and two
were all that could be got out of nine thirteens; but as all the world
knows that nine thirteens will yield," &c.--proceeding straightway into
a new train of ingenious consequences, and causing Bantam to be regarded
by all present as one of those slow persons who take irony for
ignorance, and who would warn the weasel to keep awake.How should a
small-eyed, feebly crowing mortal like him be quicker in arithmetic than
the keen-faced forcible Aquila, in whom universal knowledge is easily
credible?Looked into closely, the conclusion from a man's profile,
voice, and fluency to his certainty in multiplication beyond the
twelves, seems to show a confused notion of the way in which very common
things are connected; but it is on such false correlations that men
found half their inferences about each other, and high places of trust
may sometimes be held on no better foundation.It is a commonplace that words, writings, measures, and performances in
general, have qualities assigned them not by a direct judgment on the
performances themselves, but by a presumption of what they are likely to
be, considering who is the performer.We all notice in our neighbours
this reference to names as guides in criticism, and all furnish
illustrations of it in our own practice; for, check ourselves as we
will, the first impression from any sort of work must depend on a
previous attitude of mind, and this will constantly be determined by the
influences of a name.But that our prior confidence or want of
confidence in given names is made up of judgments just as hollow as the
consequent praise or blame they are taken to warrant, is less commonly
perceived, though there is a conspicuous indication of it in the
surprise or disappointment often manifested in the disclosure of an
authorship about which everybody has been making wrong guesses.No doubt
if it had been discovered who wrote the 'Vestiges,' many an ingenious
structure of probabilities would have been spoiled, and some disgust
might have been felt for a real author who made comparatively so shabby
an appearance of likelihood.It is this foolish trust in prepossessions,
founded on spurious evidence, which makes a medium of encouragement for
those who, happening to have the ear of the public, give other people's
ideas the advantage of appearing under their own well-received name,
while any remonstrance from the real producer becomes an each person who
has paid complimentary tributes in the wrong place.Hardly any kind of false reasoning is more ludicrous than this on the
probabilities of origination.It would be amusing to catechise the
guessers as to their exact reasons for thinking their guess "likely:"
why Hoopoe of John's has fixed on Toucan of Magdalen; why Shrike
attributes its peculiar style to Buzzard, who has not hitherto been
known as a writer; why the fair Columba thinks it must belong to the
reverend Merula; and why they are all alike disturbed in their previous
judgment of its value by finding that it really came from Skunk, whom
they had either not thought of at all, or thought of as belonging to a
species excluded by the nature of the case.Clearly they were all wrong
in their notion of the specific conditions, which lay unexpectedly in
the small Skunk, and in him alone--in spite of his education nobody
knows where, in spite of somebody's knowing his uncles and cousins, and
in spite of nobody's knowing that he was cleverer than they thought him.Such guesses remind one of a fabulist's imaginary council of animals
assembled to consider what sort of creature had constructed a honeycomb
found and much tasted by Bruin and other epicures.The speakers all
started from the probability that the maker was a bird, because this was
the quarter from which a wondrous nest might be expected; for the
animals at that time, knowing little of their own history, would have
rejected as inconceivable the notion that a nest could be made by a
fish; and as to the insects, they were not willingly received in society
and their ways were little known.Several complimentary presumptions
were expressed that the honeycomb was due to one or the other admired
and popular bird, and there was much fluttering on the part of the
Nightingale and Swallow, neither of whom gave a positive denial, their
confusion perhaps extending to their sense of identity; but the Owl
hissed at this folly, arguing from his particular knowledge that the
animal which produced honey must be the Musk-rat, the wondrous nature of
whose secretions required no proof; and, in the powerful logical
procedure of the Owl, from musk to honey was but a step.Some
disturbance arose hereupon, for the Musk-rat began to make himself
obtrusive, believing in the Owl's opinion of his powers, and feeling
that he could have produced the honey if he had thought of it; until an
experimental Butcher-bird proposed to anatomise him as a help to
decision.The hubbub increased, the opponents of the Musk-rat inquiring
who his ancestors were; until a diversion was created by an able
discourse of the Macaw on structures generally, which he classified so
as to include the honeycomb, entering into so much admirable exposition
that there was a prevalent sense of the honeycomb having probably been
produced by one who understood it so well.But Bruin, who had probably
eaten too much to listen with edification, grumbled in his low kind of
language, that "Fine words butter no parsnips," by which he meant to say
that there was no new honey forthcoming.Perhaps the audience generally was beginning to tire, when the Fox
entered with his snout dreadfully swollen, and reported that the
beneficent originator in question was the Wasp, which he had found much
smeared with undoubted honey, having applied his nose to it--whence
indeed the able insect, perhaps justifiably irritated at what might seem
a sign of scepticism, had stung him with some severity, an infliction
Reynard could hardly regret, since the swelling of a snout normally so
delicate would corroborate his statement and satisfy the assembly that
he had really found the honey-creating genius.The Fox's admitted acuteness, combined with the visible swelling, were
taken as undeniable evidence, and the revelation undoubtedly met a
general desire for information on a point of interest.Nevertheless,
there was a murmur the reverse of delighted, and the feelings of some
eminent animals were too strong for them: the Orang-outang's jaw dropped
so as seriously to impair the vigour of his expression, the edifying
Pelican screamed and flapped her wings, the Owl hissed again, the Macaw
became loudly incoherent, and the Gibbon gave his hysterical laugh;
while the Hyaena, after indulging in a more splenetic guffaw, agitated
the question whether it would not be better to hush up the whole affair,
instead of giving public recognition to an insect whose produce, it was
now plain, had been much overestimated.But this narrow-spirited motion
was negatived by the sweet-toothed majority.A complimentary deputation
to the Wasp was resolved on, and there was a confident hope that this
diplomatic measure would tell on the production of honey.Ganymede was once a girlishly handsome precocious youth.That one cannot
for any considerable number of years go on being youthful, girlishly
handsome, and precocious, seems on consideration to be a statement as
worthy of credit as the famous syllogistic conclusion, "Socrates was
mortal."But many circumstances have conspired to keep up in Ganymede
the illusion that he is surprisingly young.He was the last born of his
family, and from his earliest memory was accustomed to be commended as
such to the care of his elder brothers and sisters: he heard his mother
speak of him as her youngest darling with a loving pathos in her tone,
which naturally suffused his own view of himself, and gave him the
habitual consciousness of being at once very young and very interesting.Then, the disclosure of his tender years was a constant matter of
astonishment to strangers who had had proof of his precocious talents,
and the astonishment extended to what is called the world at large when
he produced 'A Comparative Estimate of European Nations' before he was
well out of his teens.All comers, on a first interview, told him that
he was marvellously young, and some repeated the statement each time
they saw him; all critics who wrote about him called attention to the
same ground for wonder: his deficiencies and excesses were alike to be
accounted for by the flattering fact of his youth, and his youth was the
golden background which set off his many-hued endowments.Here was
already enough to establish a strong association between his sense of
identity and his sense of being unusually young.But after this he
devised and founded an ingenious organisation for consolidating the
literary interests of all the four continents (subsequently including
Australasia and Polynesia), he himself presiding in the central office,
which thus became a new theatre for the constantly repeated situation of
an astonished stranger in the presence of a boldly scheming
administrator found to be remarkably young.If we imagine with due
charity the effect on Ganymede, we shall think it greatly to his credit
that he continued to feel the necessity of being something more than
young, and did not sink by rapid degrees into a parallel of that
melancholy object, a superannuated youthful phenomenon.Happily he had
enough of valid, active faculty to save him from that tragic fate.He
had not exhausted his fountain of eloquent opinion in his 'Comparative
Estimate,' so as to feel himself, like some other juvenile celebrities,
the sad survivor of his own manifest destiny, or like one who has risen
too early in the morning, and finds all the solid day turned into a
fatigued afternoon.He has continued to be productive both of schemes
and writings, being perhaps helped by the fact that his 'Comparative
Estimate' did not greatly affect the currents of European thought, and
left him with the stimulating hope that he had not done his best, but
might yet produce what would make his youth more surprising than ever.I saw something of him through his Antinoues period, the time of rich
chesnut locks, parted not by a visible white line, but by a shadowed
furrow from which they fell in massive ripples to right and left.In
these slim days he looked the younger for being rather below the middle
size, and though at last one perceived him contracting an indefinable
air of self-consciousness, a slight exaggeration of the facial
movements, the attitudes, the little tricks, and the romance in
shirt-collars, which must be expected from one who, in spite of his
knowledge, was so exceedingly young, it was impossible to say that he
was making any great mistake about himself.He was only undergoing one
form of a common moral disease: being strongly mirrored for himself in
the remark of others, he was getting to see his real characteristics as
a dramatic part, a type to which his doings were always in
correspondence.Owing to my absence on travel and to other causes I had
lost sight of him for several years, but such a separation between two
who have not missed each other seems in this busy century only a
pleasant reason, when they happen to meet again in some old accustomed
haunt, for the one who has stayed at home to be more communicative about
himself than he can well be to those who have all along been in his
neighbourhood.He had married in the interval, and as if to keep up his
surprising youthfulness in all relations, he had taken a wife
considerably older than himself.It would probably have seemed to him a
disturbing inversion of the natural order that any one very near to him
should have been younger than he, except his own children who, however
young, would not necessarily hinder the normal surprise at the
youthfulness of their father.And if my glance had revealed my
impression on first seeing him again, he might have received a rather
disagreeable shock, which was far from my intention.My mind, having
retained a very exact image of his former appearance, took note of
unmistakeable changes such as a painter would certainly not have made by
way of flattering his subject.He had lost his slimness, and that curved
solidity which might have adorned a taller man was a rather sarcastic
threat to his short figure.The English branch of the Teutonic race does
not produce many fat youths, and I have even heard an American lady say
that she was much "disappointed" at the moderate number and size of our
fat men, considering their reputation in the United States; hence a
stranger would now have been apt to remark that Ganymede was unusually
plump for a distinguished writer, rather than unusually young.Many long-standing prepossessions are as hard to be
corrected as a long-standing mispronunciation, against which the direct
experience of eye and ear is often powerless.And I could perceive that
Ganymede's inwrought sense of his surprising youthfulness had been
stronger than the superficial reckoning of his years and the merely
optical phenomena of the looking-glass.He now held a post under
Government, and not only saw, like most subordinate functionaries, how
ill everything was managed, but also what were the changes that a high
constructive ability would dictate; and in mentioning to me his own
speeches and other efforts towards propagating reformatory views in his
department, he concluded by changing his tone to a sentimental head
voice and saying--

"But I am so young; people object to any prominence on my part; I can
only get myself heard anonymously, and when some attention has been
drawn the name is sure to creep out.The writer is known to be young,
and things are none the forwarder.""Well," said I, "youth seems the only drawback that is sure to diminish.You and I have seven years less of it than when we last met."returned Ganymede, as lightly as possible, at the same time
casting an observant glance over me, as if he were marking the effect of
seven years on a person who had probably begun life with an old look,
and even as an infant had given his countenance to that significant
doctrine, the transmigration of ancient souls into modern bodies.I left him on that occasion without any melancholy forecast that his
illusion would be suddenly or painfully broken up.I saw that he was
well victualled and defended against a ten years' siege from ruthless
facts; and in the course of time observation convinced me that his
resistance received considerable aid from without.Each of his written
productions, as it came out, was still commented on as the work of a
very young man.One critic, finding that he wanted solidity, charitably
referred to his youth as an excuse.Another, dazzled by his brilliancy,
seemed to regard his youth as so wondrous that all other authors
appeared decrepit by comparison, and their style such as might be looked
for from gentlemen of the old school.Able pens (according to a familiar
metaphor) appeared to shake their heads good-humouredly, implying that
Ganymede's crudities were pardonable in one so exceedingly young.Such
unanimity amid diversity, which a distant posterity might take for
evidence that on the point of age at least there could have been no
mistake, was not really more difficult to account for than the
prevalence of cotton in our fabrics.Ganymede had been first introduced
into the writing world as remarkably young, and it was no exceptional
consequence that the first deposit of information about him held its
ground against facts which, however open to observation, were not
necessarily thought of.It is not so easy, with our rates and taxes and
need for economy in all directions, to cast away an epithet or remark
that turns up cheaply, and to go in expensive search after more genuine
substitutes.There is high Homeric precedent for keeping fast hold of an
epithet under all changes of circumstance, and so the precocious author
of the 'Comparative Estimate' heard the echoes repeating "Young
Ganymede" when an illiterate beholder at a railway station would have
given him forty years at least.Besides, important elders, sachems of
the clubs and public meetings, had a genuine opinion of him as young
enough to be checked for speech on subjects which they had spoken
mistakenly about when he was in his cradle; and then, the midway parting
of his crisp hair, not common among English committee-men, formed a
presumption against the ripeness of his judgment which nothing but a
speedy baldness could have removed.It is but fair to mention all these outward confirmations of Ganymede's
illusion, which shows no signs of leaving him.It is true that he no
longer hears expressions of surprise at his youthfulness, on a first
introduction to an admiring reader; but this sort of external evidence
has become an unnecessary crutch to his habitual inward persuasion.His
manners, his costume, his suppositions of the impression he makes on
others, have all their former correspondence with the dramatic part of
the young genius.As to the incongruity of his contour and other little
accidents of physique, he is probably no more aware that they will
affect others as incongruities than Armida is conscious how much her
rouge provokes our notice of her wrinkles, and causes us to mention
sarcastically that motherly age which we should otherwise regard with
affectionate reverence.But let us be just enough to admit that there may be old-young coxcombs
as well as old-young coquettes.HOW WE COME TO GIVE OURSELVES FALSE TESTIMONIALS, AND BELIEVE IN THEM.It is my way when I observe any instance of folly, any queer habit, any
absurd illusion, straightway to look for something of the same type in
myself, feeling sure that amid all differences there will be a certain
correspondence; just as there is more or less correspondence in the
natural history even of continents widely apart, and of islands in
opposite zones.No doubt men's minds differ in what we may call their
climate or share of solar energy, and a feeling or tendency which is
comparable to a panther in one may have no more imposing aspect than
that of a weasel in another: some are like a tropical habitat in which
the very ferns cast a mighty shadow, and the grasses are a dry ocean in
which a hunter may be submerged; others like the chilly latitudes in
which your forest-tree, fit elsewhere to prop a mine, is a pretty
miniature suitable for fancy potting.The eccentric man might be
typified by the Australian fauna, refuting half our judicious
assumptions of what nature allows.Still, whether fate commanded us to
thatch our persons among the Eskimos or to choose the latest thing in
tattooing among the Polynesian isles, our precious guide Comparison
would teach us in the first place by likeness, and our clue to further
knowledge would be resemblance to what we already know.Hence, having a
keen interest in the natural history of my inward self, I pursue this
plan I have mentioned of using my observation as a clue or lantern by
which I detect small herbage or lurking life; or I take my neighbour in
his least becoming tricks or efforts as an opportunity for luminous
deduction concerning the figure the human genus makes in the specimen
which I myself furnish.Introspection which starts with the purpose of finding out one's own
absurdities is not likely to be very mischievous, yet of course it is
not free from dangers any more than breathing is, or the other functions
that keep us alive and active.To judge of others by oneself is in its
most innocent meaning the briefest expression for our only method of
knowing mankind; yet, we perceive, it has come to mean in many cases
either the vulgar mistake which reduces every man's value to the very
low figure at which the valuer himself happens to stand; or else, the
amiable illusion of the higher nature misled by a too generous
construction of the lower.One cannot give a recipe for wise judgment:
it resembles appropriate muscular action, which is attained by the
myriad lessons in nicety of balance and of aim that only practice can
give.The danger of the inverse procedure, judging of self by what one
observes in others, if it is carried on with much impartiality and
keenness of discernment, is that it has a laming effect, enfeebling the
energies of indignation and scorn, which are the proper scourges of
wrong-doing and meanness, and which should continually feed the
wholesome restraining power of public opinion.I respect the horsewhip
when applied to the back of Cruelty, and think that he who applies it is
a more perfect human being because his outleap of indignation is not
checked by a too curious reflection on the nature of guilt--a more
perfect human being because he more completely incorporates the best
social life of the race, which can never be constituted by ideas that
nullify action.This is the essence of Dante's sentiment (it is painful
to think that he applies it very cruelly)--

  "E cortesia fu, lui esser villano"[1]--

and it is undeniable that a too intense consciousness of one's kinship
with all frailties and vices undermines the active heroism which battles
against wrong.But certainly nature has taken care that this danger should not at
present be very threatening.One could not fairly describe the
generality of one's neighbours as too lucidly aware of manifesting in
their own persons the weaknesses which they observe in the rest of her
Majesty's subjects; on the contrary, a hasty conclusion as to schemes of
Providence might lead to the supposition that one man was intended to
correct another by being most intolerant of the ugly quality or trick
which he himself possesses.Doubtless philosophers will be able to
explain how it must necessarily be so, but pending the full extension of
the _a priori_ method, which will show that only blockheads could expect
anything to be otherwise, it does seem surprising that Heloisa should be
disgusted at Laura's attempts to disguise her age, attempts which she
recognises so thoroughly because they enter into her own practice; that
Semper, who often responds at public dinners and proposes resolutions on
platforms, though he has a trying gestation of every speech and a bad
time for himself and others at every delivery, should yet remark
pitilessly on the folly of precisely the same course of action in
Ubique; that Aliquis, who lets no attack on himself pass unnoticed, and
for every handful of gravel against his windows sends a stone in reply,
should deplore the ill-advised retorts of Quispiam, who does not
perceive that to show oneself angry with an adversary is to gratify him.To be unaware of our own little tricks of manner or our own mental
blemishes and excesses is a comprehensible unconsciousness; the puzzling
fact is that people should apparently take no account of their
deliberate actions, and should expect them to be equally ignored by
others.It is an inversion of the accepted order: _there_ it is the
phrases that are official and the conduct or privately manifested
sentiment that is taken to be real; _here_ it seems that the practice is
taken to be official and entirely nullified by the verbal representation
which contradicts it.The thief making a vow to heaven of full
restitution and whispering some reservations, expecting to cheat
Omniscience by an "aside," is hardly more ludicrous than the many ladies
and gentlemen who have more belief, and expect others to have it, in
their own statement about their habitual doings than in the
contradictory fact which is patent in the daylight.One reason of the
absurdity is that we are led by a tradition about ourselves, so that
long after a man has practically departed from a rule or principle, he
continues innocently to state it as a true description of his
practice--just as he has a long tradition that he is not an old
gentleman, and is startled when he is seventy at overhearing himself
called by an epithet which he has only applied to others.[Footnote 1: Inferno, xxxii."A person with your tendency
