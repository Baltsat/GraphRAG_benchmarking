No person ever went to the
front in whom the citizens of St.Paul had more hope for a brilliant
future.He was born in New York State in 1833, and was twenty-eight
years of age at the time of his death.Paul in 1854 and
commenced the study of law in the office of his brother-in-law, Hon.He did not remain long in the law business, however, but
soon changed to a position in the Bank of Minnesota, which had just
been established by ex-Gov.For some time he was captain of
the Pioneer Guards, a company which he was instrumental in forming,
and which was the finest military organization in the West at
that time.In 1860 he was chosen commander of the Wide-Awakes, a
marching-club, devoted to the promotion of the candidacy of Abraham
Lincoln, and many of the men he so patiently drilled during that
exciting campaign became officers in the volunteer service in that
great struggle that soon followed.Little did the captain imagine at
that time that the success of the man whose cause he espoused would so
soon be the means of his untimely death.At the breaking out of the
war Capt.Acker was adjutant general of the State of Minnesota, but he
thought he would be of more use to his country in active service and
resigned that position and organized a company for the First Minnesota
regiment, of which he was made captain.At the first battle of Bull
Run he was wounded, and for his gallant action was made captain in
the Seventeenth United States Regulars, an organization that had
been recently created by act of congress.The Sixteenth regiment was
attached to Buell's army, and participated in the second day's battle,
and Cat.Acker was one of the first to fall on that terrible day,
being shot in the identical spot in the forehead where he was wounded
at the first battle of Bull Run.As soon as the news was received in
St.Paul of the captain's death his father, Hon.Henry Acker, left for
Pittsburg Landing, hoping to be able to recover the remains of his
martyred son and bring the body back to St.His body was easily
found, his burial place having been carefully marked by members of the
Second Minnesota who arrived on the battleground a short time after
the battle.Paul they were met at
the steamboat landing by a large number of citizens and escorted to
Masonic hall, where they rested till the time of the funeral.The
funeral obsequies were held at St.Paul's church on Sunday, May 4,
1862, and were attended by the largest concourse of citizens that
had ever attended a funeral in St.Paul, many being present from
Minneapolis, St.The respect shown to the
memory of Capt.Acker was universal, and of a character which fully
demonstrated the high esteem in which he was held by the people of St.When the first Grand Army post was formed in St.Paul a name
commemorative of one of Minnesota's fallen heroes was desired for the
organization.Out of the long list of martyrs Minnesota gave to the
cause of the Union no name seemed more appropriate than that of the
heroic Capt.Acker, and it was unanimously decided that the first
association of Civil war veterans in this city should be known as
Acker post.*       *       *       *       *

The terrible and sensational news that Abraham Lincoln had been
assassinated, which was flashed over the wires on the morning of
April 15, 1865 (forty years ago yesterday), was the most appalling
announcement that had been made during the long crisis through which
the country had just passed.No tongue
could find language sufficiently strong to express condemnation of the
fiendish act.It was not
safe for any one to utter a word against the character of the martyred
president.At no place in the entire country was the terrible calamity
more deeply felt than in St.All public and private buildings
were draped in mourning.The
services at the little House of Hope church on Walnut street will long
be remembered by all those who were there.The church was heavily
draped in mourning.It had been suddenly transformed from a house of
hope to a house of sorrow, a house of woe.The pastor of the church
was the Rev.He was one of the most eloquent and
learned divines in the city--fearless, forcible and aggressive--the
Henry Ward Beecher of the Northwest.The members of the House of Hope were intensely patriotic.Many of
their number were at the front defending their imperiled country.Scores and scores of times during the desperate conflict had the
eloquent pastor of this church delivered stirring addresses favoring
a vigorous prosecution of the war.During the darkest days of the
Rebellion, when the prospect of the final triumph of the cause of the
Union seemed furthest off, Mr.Noble never faltered; he believed that
the cause was just and that right would finally triumph.When the
terrible and heart-rending news was received that an assassin's bullet
had ended the life of the greatest of all presidents the effect was
so paralyzing that hearts almost ceased beating.Every member of the
congregation felt as if one of their own household had been suddenly
taken from them.The services at the church on the Sunday morning
following the assassination were most solemn and impressive.The
little edifice was crowded almost to suffication, and when the pastor
was seen slowly ascending the pulpit, breathless silence prevailed.He
was pale and haggard, and appeared to be suffering great mental agony.With bowed head and uplifted hands, and with a voice trembling with
almost uncontrollable emotion, he delivered one of the most fervent
and impressive invocations ever heard by the audience.Had the dead
body of the president been placed in front of the altar, the solemnity
of the occasion could not have been greater.In the discourse that
followed, Mr.Noble briefly sketched the early history of the
president, and then devoted some time to the many grand deeds he had
accomplished during the time he had been in the presidential chair.For more than four years he had patiently and anxiously watched the
progress of the terrible struggle, and now, when victory was in sight,
when it was apparent to all that the fall of Richmond, the surrender
of Lee and the probable surrender of Johnston would end the long war,
he was cruelly stricken down by the hand of an assassin."With malice
towards none and with charity to all, and with firmness for the right,
as God gives us to see the right," were utterances then fresh from the
president's lips.To strike down such a man at such a time was indeed
a crime most horrible.There was scarcely a dry eye in the audience.It was supposed at the time that Secretary
of State Seward had also fallen a victim of the assassin's dagger.It was the purpose of the conspirators to murder the president, vice
president and entire cabinet, but in only one instance did the attempt
prove fatal.Secretary Seward was the foremost statesmen of the
time.His diplomatic skill had kept the country free from foreign
entanglements during the long and bitter struggle.He, too, was
eulogized by the minister, and it rendered the occasion doubly
mournful.Since that time two other presidents have been mercilessly slain by
the hand of an assassin, and although the shock to the country was
terrible, it never seemed as if the grief was as deep and universal
as when the bullet fired by John Wilkes Booth pierced the temple of
Abraham Lincoln.AN ALLEGORICAL HOROSCOPE

       *       *       *       *       *

IN TWO CHAPTERS.*       *       *       *       *

CHAPTER I.--AN OPTIMISTIC FORECAST.As the sun was gently receding in the western horizon on a beautiful
summer evening nearly a century ago, a solitary voyageur might have
been seen slowly ascending the sinuous stream that stretches from the
North Star State to the Gulf of Mexico.He was on a mission of peace
and good will to the red men of the distant forest.On nearing the
shore of what is now a great city the lonely voyageur was amazed
on discovering that the pale face of the white man had many years
preceded him.he muttered to himself; "methinks I see a
paleface toying with a dusky maiden.On
approaching near where the two were engaged in some weird incantation
the voyageur overheard the dusky maiden impart a strange message to
the paleface by her side."From the stars I see in the firmament, the
fixed stars that predominate in the configuration, I deduce the future
destiny of man.This elixer
which I now do administer to thee has been known to our people for
countless generations.The possession of it will enable thee to
conquer all thine enemies.Thou now beholdest, O Robert, the ground
upon which some day a great city will be erected.Thou art destined to
become the mighty chief of this great metropolis.Thy reign will be
long and uninterrupted.Thou wert born when the conjunction of the
planets did augur a life of perfect beatitude.As the years roll
away the inhabitants of the city will multiply with great rapidity.Questions of great import regarding the welfare of the people will
often come before thee for adjustment.To be successful In thy calling
thou must never be guilty of having decided convictions on any
subject, as thy friends will sometimes be pitted against each other in
the advocacy of their various schemes.Thou must not antagonize either
side by espousing the other's cause, but must always keep the rod and
the gun close by thy side, so that when these emergencies arise and
thou doth scent danger in the air thou canst quietly withdraw from the
scene of action and chase the festive bison over the distant prairies
or revel in piscatorial pleasure on the placid waters of a secluded
lake until the working majority hath discovered some method of
relieving thee of the necessity of committing thyself, and then, O
Robert.thou canst return and complacently inform the disappointed
party that the result would have been far different had not thou been
called suddenly away.Thou canst thus preserve the friendship of all
parties, and their votes are more essential to thee than the mere
adoption of measures affecting the prosperity of thy people.When the
requirements of the people of thy city become too great for thee alone
to administer to all their wants, the great family of Okons, the
lineal descendants of the sea kings from the bogs of Tipperary, will
come to thy aid.Take friendly counsel with them, as to incur their
displeasure will mean thy downfall.Let all the ends thou aimest at be
to so dispose of the offices within thy gift that the Okons, and the
followers of the Okons, will be as fixed in their positions as are the
stars in their orbits."After delivering this strange astrological exhortation the dusky
maiden slowly retreated toward the entrance of a nearby cavern, the
paleface meandered forth to survey the ground of his future greatness
and the voyageur resumed his lonely journey toward the setting sun.*       *       *       *       *

CHAPTER II.--A TERRIBLE REALITY.After the lapse of more than four score of years the voyageur from the
frigid North returned from his philanthropic visit to the red man.A
wonderful change met the eye.A transformation as magnificent as it
was bewildering had occurred.The same grand old bluffs looked proudly
down upon the Father of Water.The same magnificent river pursued
its unmolested course toward the boundless ocean.The hostile warrior no longer impeded the onward march of
civilization, and cultivated fields abounded on every side.Steamers were hourly traversing the translucent waters of the great
Mississippi; steam and electricity were carrying people with the
rapidity of lightning in every direction; gigantic buildings appeared
on the earth's surface, visible in either direction as far as the
eye could reach; on every corner was a proud descendant of Erin's
nobility, clad in gorgeous raiment, who had been branded "St.Paul's
finest" before leaving the shores of his native land.In the midst of
this great city was a magnificent building, erected by the generosity
of its people, in which the paleface, supported on either side by the
Okons, was the high and mighty ruler.The Okons and the followers of
the Okons were in possession of every office within the gift of the
paleface.Floating proudly from the top of this great building was an
immense banner, on which was painted in monster letters the talismanic
words: "For mayor, 1902, Robert A. Smith," Verily the prophecy of the
dusky maiden had been fulfilled.The paleface had become impregnably
intrenched.The Okons could never be dislodged.With feelings of unutterable anguish at the omnipresence of the Okons,
the aged voyageur quietly retraced his footsteps and was never more
seen by the helpless and overburdened subjects of the paleface.*       *       *       *       *

When I was about twelve years of age I resided in a small village in
one of the mountainous and sparsely settled sections of the northern
part of Pennsylvania.It was before the advent of the railroad and telegraph in that
locality.The people were not blessed with prosperity as it is known
to-day.Neither were they gifted with the intellectual attainments
possessed by the inhabitants of the same locality at the present time.Many of the old men served in the war of 1812, and they were looked up
to with about the same veneration as are the heroes of the Civil War
to-day.It was at a time when the younger generation was beginning to
acquire a thirst for knowledge, but it was not easily obtained under
the peculiar conditions existing at that period.A school district
that was able to support a school for six months in each year was
indeed considered fortunate, but even in these the older children were
not permitted to attend during the summer months, as their services
were considered indispensable in the cultivation of the soil.Reading, writing and arithmetic were about all the studies pursued in
those rural school districts, although occasionally some of the better
class of the country maidens could be seen listlessly glancing over a
geography or grammar, but they were regarded as "stuck up," and the
other pupils thought they were endeavoring to master something far
beyond their capacity.Our winter school term generally commenced the first week in December
and lasted until the first week in March, with one evening set apart
each week for a spelling-match and recitation.We had our spelling
match on Saturday nights, and every four weeks we would meet with
schools in other districts in a grand spelling contest.I was
considered too young to participate in any of the joint spelling
matches, and my heart was heavy within me every time I saw a great
four-horse sleigh loaded with joyful boys and girls on their way to
one of the great contests.One Saturday night there was to be a grand spelling match at a country
crossroad about four miles from our village, and four schools were to
participate.As I saw the great sleigh loaded for the coming struggle
the thought occurred to me that if I only managed to secure a ride
without being observed I might in some way be able to demonstrate to
the older scholars that in spelling at least I was their equal.While
the driver was making a final inspection of the team preparatory to
starting I managed to crawl under his seat, where I remained as quiet
as mouse until the team arrived at the point of destination.I had not
considered the question of getting back--I left that to chance.As
soon as the different schools had arrived two of the best spellers
were selected to choose sides, and it happened that neither of them
was from our school.I stood in front of the old-fashioned fire-place
and eagerly watched the pupils as they took their places in the line.They were drawn in the order of their reputation as spellers.When
they had finished calling the names I was still standing by the
fireplace, and I thought my chance was hopeless.The school-master
from our district noticed my woebegone appearance, and he arose from
his seat and said:

"That boy standing by the fireplace is one of the best spellers in our
school."My name was then reluctantly called, and I took my place at the
foot of the column.I felt very grateful towards our master for his
compliment and I thought I would be able to hold my position in the
line long enough to demonstrate that our master was correct.The
school-master from our district was selected to pronounce the words,
and I inwardly rejoiced.After going down the line several times and a number of scholars had
fallen on some simple word the school-master pronounced the word
"phthisic."My heart leaped as the word fell from the school-master's
lips.It was one of my favorite hard words and was not in the spelling
book.It had been selected so as to floor the entire line in order to
make way for the exercises to follow.As I looked over the long line of overgrown country boys and girls I
felt sure that none of them would be able to correctly spell the word.said the school-master, and my pulse beat
faster and faster as the older scholars ahead of me were relegated to
their seats.As the school-master stood directly in front of me and said "Next," I
could see by the twinkle in his eye that he thought I could correctly
spell the word.With a clear and
distinct voice loud enough to be heard by every one in the room
I spelled out "ph-th-is-ic--phthisic.""Correct," said the
school-master, and all the scholars looked aghast at my promptness.I shall never forget the kindly smile of the old school-master, as he
laid the spelling book upon the teacher's desk, with the quiet remark:
"I told you he could spell."I had spelled down four schools, and my
reputation as a speller was established.Our school was declared to
have furnished the champion speller of the four districts, and ever
after my name was not the last one to be called.On my return home I was not compelled to ride under the driver's seat.HALF A CENTURY WITH THE PIONEER PRESS.Pioneer Press, April 18, 1908:--Frank Moore, superintendent of the
composing room if the Pioneer Press, celebrated yesterday the fiftieth
anniversary of his connection with the paper.A dozen of the old
employes of the Pioneer Press entertained Mr.Moore at an informal
dinner at Magee's to celebrate the unusual event.Moore's service
on the Pioneer Press, in fact, has been longer than the Pioneer
Press itself, for he began his work on one of the newspapers which
eventually was merged into the present Pioneer Press.He has held his
present position as the head of the composing room for about forty
years.Frank Moore was fifteen years old when he came to St.Paul from Tioga
county, Pa., where he was born.He came with his brother, George W.
Moore, who was one of the owners and managers of the Minnesotian.His
brother had been East and brought the boy West with him.Moore's
first view of newspaper work was on the trip up the river to St.There had been a special election on a bond issue and on the way his
brother stopped at the various towns to got the election returns.Moore went to work for the Minnesotian on April 17, 1858, as a
printer's "devil."It is interesting in these days of water works and
telegraph to recall that among his duties was to carry water for the
office.He got it from a spring below where the Merchants hotel now
stands.Another of his jobs was to meet the boats.Whenever a steamer
whistled Mr.Moore ran to the dock to get the bundle of newspapers the
boat brought, and hurry with it back to the office.It was from these
papers that the editors got the telegraph news of the world.He also
was half the carrier staff of the paper.His territory covered all
the city above Wabasha street, but as far as he went up the hill
was College avenue and Ramsey street was his limit out West Seventh
street.When the Press absorbed the Minnesotian in 1861, Mr.Moore went with
it, and when in 1874 the Press and Pioneer were united Mr.His service has been continuous,
excepting during his service as a volunteer in the Civil war.The
Pioneer Press, with its antecedents, has been his only interest.Moore's service is notable for its length, it is still more
notable for the fact that he has grown with the paper, so that
to-day at sixty-five he is still filling his important position as
efficiently on a large modern newspaper as he filled it as a young man
when things in the Northwest, including its newspapers, were in the
beginning.Successive managements found that his services always gave
full value and recognized in him an employe of unusual loyalty and
devotion to the interests of the paper.Successive generations of
employes have found him always just the kind of man it is a pleasure
to have as a fellow workman.Her "picture diary" she called the big scrap-book in
which was mounted her record of the summer's doings.Those doings were proving both numerous and delightful.Shaw, as
an honorary member, had invited the club to a fishing party, which had
been an immense success.The doctor had followed it by a moonlight
drive along the lake and across on the old sail ferry to the New York
side, keeping strictly within that ten-mile-from-home limit, though
covering considerably more than ten miles in the coming and going.There had been picnics of every description, to all the points of
interest and charm in and about the village; an old-time supper at the
Wards', at which the club members had appeared in old-fashioned
costumes; a strawberry supper on the church lawn, to which all the
church were invited, and which went off rather better than some of the
sociables had in times past.As the Winton _Weekly News_ declared proudly, it was the gayest summer
the village had known in years.Paul Shaw's theory about
developing home resources was proving a sound one in this instance at
least.Hilary had long since forgotten that she had ever been an invalid, had
indeed, sometimes, to be reminded of that fact.She had quite
discarded the little "company" fiction, except now and then, by way of
a joke."I'd rather be one
of the family these days.""That's all very well," Patience retorted, "when you're getting all the
good of being both.Patience had not
found her summer quite as cloudless as some of her elders; being an
honorary member had not meant _all_ of the fun in her case.She wished
very much that it were possible to grow up in a single night, thus
wiping out forever that drawback of being "a little girl."Still, on the whole, she managed to get a fair share of the fun going
on and quite agreed with the editor of the _Weekly News_, going so far
as to tell him so when she met him down street.She had a very kindly
feeling in her heart for the pleasant spoken little editor; had he not
given her her full honors every time she had had the joy of being
"among those present"?There had been three of those checks from Uncle Paul; it was wonderful
how far each had been made to go.It was possible nowadays to send for
a new book, when the reviews were more than especially tempting.There
had also been a tea-table added to the other attractions of the side
porch, not an expensive affair, but the little Japanese cups and
saucers were both pretty and delicate, as was the rest of the service;
while Miranda's cream cookies and sponge cakes were, as Shirley
declared, good enough to be framed.Even the minister appeared now and
then of an afternoon, during tea hour, and the young people, gathered
on the porch, began to find him a very pleasant addition to their
little company, he and they getting acquainted, as they had never
gotten acquainted before.Sextoness Jane came every week now to help with the ironing, which
meant greater freedom in the matter of wash dresses; and also, to
Sextoness Jane herself, the certainty of a day's outing every week.To
Sextoness Jane, those Tuesdays at the parsonage were little short of a
dissipation.Miranda, unbending in the face of such sincere and humble
admiration, was truly gracious.The glimpses the little bent, old
sextoness got of the young folks, the sense of life going on about her,
were as good as a play, to quote her own simile, confided of an evening
to Tobias, her great black cat, the only other inmate of the old
cottage."I reckon Uncle Paul would be rather surprised," Pauline said one
evening, "if he could know all the queer sorts of ways in which we use
his money.But the little easings-up do count for so much.""Indeed they do," Hilary agreed warmly, "though it hasn't all gone for
easings-ups, as you call them, either."She had sat down right in the
middle of getting ready for bed, to revel in her ribbon box; she so
loved pretty ribbons!The committee on finances, as Pauline called her mother, Hilary, and
herself, held frequent meetings."And there's always one thing," the
girl would declare proudly, "the treasury is never entirely empty."She kept faithful account of all money received and spent; each month a
certain amount was laid away for the "rainy day"--which meant, really,
the time when the checks should cease to come---"for, you know, Uncle
Paul only promised them for the _summer_," Pauline reminded the others,
and herself, rather frequently.Nor was all of the remainder ever
quite used up before the coming of the next check."You're quite a business woman, my dear," Mr.Shaw said once, smiling
over the carefully recorded entries in the little account-book she
showed him.She wrote regularly to her uncle; her letters unconsciously growing
more friendly and informal from week to week.They were bright, vivid
letters, more so than Pauline had any idea of.Paul
Shaw felt himself becoming very well acquainted with these young
relatives whom he had never seen, and in whom, as the weeks went by, he
felt himself growing more and more interested.Without realizing it, he got into the habit of looking forward to that
weekly letter; the girl wrote a nice clear hand, there didn't seem to
be any nonsense about her, and she had a way of going right to her
point that was most satisfactory.It seemed sometimes as if he could
see the old white parsonage and ivy-covered church; the broad
tree-shaded lawns; the outdoor parlor, with the young people gathered
about the tea-table; Bedelia, picking her way along the quiet country
roads; the great lake in all its moods; the manor house.Sometimes Pauline would enclose one or two of Hilary's snap-shots of
places, or persons.At one of these, taken the day of the fishing
picnic, and under which Hilary had written "The best catch of the
season," Mr.Somehow he had never
pictured Phil to himself as middle-aged.If anyone had told him, when
the lad was a boy, that the time would come when they would be like
strangers to each other--Mr.Paul Shaw slipped the snap-shot and letter
back into their envelope.It was that afternoon that he spent considerable time over a catalogue
devoted entirely to sporting goods; and it was a fortnight later that
Patience came flying down the garden path to where Pauline and Hilary
were leaning over the fence, paying a morning call to Bedelia, sunning
herself in the back pasture."You'll never guess what's come _this_ time!And Jed says he reckons
he can haul it out this afternoon if you're set on it!And it's
addressed to the 'Misses Shaw,' so that means it's _mine, too_!"Patience dropped on the grass, quite out of breath.The "it" proved to be a row-boat with a double set of oar-locks, a
perfect boat for the lake, strong and safe, but trig and neat of
outline.Hilary named it the "Surprise" at first sight, and Tom was sent for at
once to paint the name in red letters to look well against the white
background and to match the boat's red trimmings.Some of the young people had boats over at
the lake, rather weather-beaten, tubby affairs, Bell declared them,
after the coming of the "Surprise."A general overhauling took place
immediately, the girls adopted simple boating dresses--red and white,
which were their boating colors.A new zest was given to the water
picnics, Bedelia learning to know the lake road very well.August had come before they fairly realized that their summer was more
than well under way.In little more than a month the long vacation
would be over.Tom and Josie were to go to Boston to school; Bell to
Vergennes."There'll never be another summer quite like it!""I can't bear to think of its being over.""It isn't--yet," Pauline answered."Tom's coming," Patience heralded from the gate, and Hilary ran indoors
for hat and camera.Pauline asked, as her sister came
out again."Out by the Cross-roads' Meeting-House," Tom answered."Hilary has
designs on it, I believe.""You'd better come, too, Paul," Hilary urged."It's a glorious morning
for a walk.""I'm going to help mother cut out; perhaps I'll come to meet you with
Bedelia 'long towards noon."_I'm_ not going to be busy this morning," Patience insinuated."Oh, yes you are, young lady," Pauline told her."Mother said you were
to weed the aster bed."Patience looked longingly after the two starting gayly off down the
path, their cameras swung over their shoulders, then she looked
disgustedly at the aster bed.It was quite the biggest of the smaller
beds.--She didn't see what people wanted to plant so many asters for;
she had never cared much for asters, she felt she should care even less
about them in the future.By the time Tom and Hilary reached the old Cross-Roads' Meeting-House
that morning, after a long roundabout ramble, Hilary, for one, was
quite willing to sit down and wait for Pauline and the trap, and eat
the great, juicy blackberries Tom gathered for her from the bushes
along the road.It had rained during the night and the air was crisp and fresh, with a
hint of the coming fall."Summer's surely on the down grade," Tom
said, throwing himself on the bank beside Hilary."So Paul and I were lamenting this morning.I don't suppose it matters
as much to you folks who are going off to school.""Still it means another summer over," Tom said soberly.He was rather
sorry that it was so--there could never be another summer quite so
jolly and carefree."And the breaking up of the club, I suppose?""I don't see why we need call it a break--just a discontinuance, for a
time."There'll be a lot of you left, to keep it going.""Y-yes, but with three, or perhaps more, out, I reckon we'll have to
postpone the next installment until another summer."Tom went off then for more berries, and Hilary sat leaning back against
the trunk of the big tree crowning the top of Meeting-House Hill, her
eyes rather thoughtful.From where she sat, she had a full view of
both roads for some distance and, just beyond, the little hamlet
scattered about the old meeting-house.Before the gate of one of the houses stood a familiar gig, and
presently, as she sat watching, Dr.Brice came down the narrow
flower-bordered path, followed by a woman.At the gate both stopped;
the woman was saying something, her anxious, drawn face seeming out of
keeping with the cheery freshness of the morning and the flowers
nodding their bright heads about her.As the doctor stood listening, his old shabby medicine case in his
hand, with face bent to the troubled one raised to his, and bearing
indicating grave sympathy and understanding, Hilary reached for her
camera."I want it for the book Josie and I are making for you to take away
with you, 'Winton Snap-shots.'Tom looked at the gig, moving slowly off down the road now.He hated
to say so, but he wished Hilary would not put that particular snap-shot
in.He had a foreboding that it was going to make him a bit
uncomfortable--later--when the time for decision came; though, as for
that, he had already decided--beyond thought of change.He wished that
the pater hadn't set his heart on his coming back here to practice--and
he wished, too, that Hilary hadn't taken that photo."It's past twelve," Tom glanced at the sun."Maybe we'd better walk on
a bit."But they had walked a considerable bit, all the way to the parsonage,
in fact, before they saw anything of Pauline.There, she met them at
the gate."Have you seen any trace of Patience--and Bedelia?""They're both missing, and it's pretty safe guessing they're together.""But Patience would never dare--"

"Wouldn't she!""Jim brought Bedelia 'round about
eleven and when I came out a few moments later, she was gone and so was
Patience.We traced them as far as the
Lake road.""I'll go hunt, too," Tom offered."Don't you worry, Paul; she'll turn
up all right--couldn't down the Imp, if you tried.""But she's never driven Bedelia alone; and Bedelia's not Fanny."However, half an hour later, Patience drove calmly into the yard,
Towser on the seat beside her, and if there was something very like
anxiety in her glance, there was distinct triumph in the way she
carried her small, bare head.she announced, smiling pleasantly from
her high seat, at the worried, indignant group on the porch."I tell
you, there isn't any need to 'hi-yi' this horse!""Did you ever hear the beat of that!"Shaw said, and Patience climbed obediently
down.She bore the prompt banishment to her own room which followed,
with seeming indifference.Certainly, it was not unexpected; but when
Hilary brought her dinner up to her presently, she found her sitting on
the floor, her head on the bed.It was only a few days now to
Shirley's turn and it was going to be such a nice turn.Patience felt
that for once Patience Shaw had certainly acted most unwisely.Hilary put the tray on the table and sitting
down on the bed, took the tumbled head on her knee."We've been so
worried!You see, Bedelia isn't like Fanny!""That's why I wanted to get a chance to drive her by myself for once!out on the Lake road I just let her loose!"For
the moment, pride in her recent performance routed all contrition from
Patience's voice--"I tell you, folks I passed just stared!""Patience, how--"

"I wasn't scared the least bit; and, of course, Bedelia knew it.Uncle
Jerry says they always know when you're scared, and if Mr.Allen is the
most up in history of any man in Vermont, Uncle Jerry is the most in
horses."Hilary felt that the conversation was hardly proceeding upon the lines
her mother would have approved of, especially under present
circumstances."That has nothing to do with it, you know, Patience,"
she said, striving to be properly severe.I think it's nice not being scared of
things.You're sort of timid 'bout things, aren't you, Hilary?""It's going to be such a dreadful long
afternoon--all alone.""But I can't stay, mother would not want--"

"Just for a minute.I--coming back,
I met Jane, and I gave her a lift home--and she did love it so--she
says she's never ridden before behind a horse that really went as if it
enjoyed it as much as she did.That was some good out of being bad,
wasn't it?And--I told you--ever'n' ever so long ago, that I was
mighty sure Jane'd just be tickled to death to belong to our club.I
think you might ask her--I don't see why she shouldn't like Seeing
Winton, same's we do--she doesn't ever have fun--and she'll be dead
pretty soon.She's getting along, Jane is--it'd make me mad's anything
to have to die 'fore I'd had any fun to speak of.Jane's really very
good company--when you draw her out--she just needs drawing out--Jane
does.Seems to me, she remembers every funeral and wedding and
everything--that's ever taken place in Winton."Patience stopped,
sheer out of breath, but there was an oddly serious look on her little
eager face.Hilary stroked back the tangled red curls."Maybe you're right, Patty;
maybe we have been selfish with our good times.I'll have to go now,
dear.You--I may tell mother--that you are sorry--truly, Patty?""But I reckon, it's a good deal on account of
Shirley's turn," she explained."You don't suppose you could fix that up with mother?You're pretty
good at fixing things up with mother, Hilary."Hilary laughed, but when she had closed the door, she
opened it again to stick her head in."I'll try, Patty, at any rate,"
she promised.Shaw was busy in the
study and Pauline had gone out on an errand.Hilary went up-stairs
again, going to sit by one of the side windows in the "new room."Over at the church, Sextoness Jane was making ready for the regular
weekly prayer meeting; never a service was held in the church that she
did not set all in order.Through one of the open windows, Hilary
caught sight of the bunch of flowers on the reading-desk.Jane had
brought them with her from home.Presently, the old woman herself came
to the window to shake her dust-cloth, standing there a moment, leaning
a little out, her eyes turned to the parsonage.Pauline was coming up
the path, Shirley and Bell were with her.They were laughing and
talking, the bright young voices making a pleasant break in the quiet
of the garden.It seemed to Hilary, as if she could catch the wistful
look in Jane's faded eyes, a look only half consciously so, as if the
old woman reached out vaguely for something that her own youth had been
without and that only lately she had come to feel the lack of.A quick lump came into the girl's throat.Life had seemed so bright
and full of untried possibilities only that very morning, up there on
Meeting-House Hill, with the wind in one's face; and then had come that
woman, following the doctor down from the path.Life was surely
anything but bright for her this crisp August day--and now here was
Jane.And presently--at the moment it seemed very near indeed to
Hilary--she and Paul and all of them would be old and, perhaps,
unhappy.And then it would be good to remember--that they had tried to
share the fun and laughter of this summer of theirs with others.Hilary thought of the piece of old tapestry hanging on the studio wall
over at the manor--of the interwoven threads--the dark as necessary to
the pattern as the bright.Perhaps they had need of Sextoness Jane, of
the interweaving of her life into theirs--of the interweaving of all
the village lives going on about them--quite as much as those more
sober lives needed the brightening touch of theirs."I'm coming," Hilary answered, and went slowly down to where the others
were waiting on the porch."I've been having a think--and I've come to the conclusion that we're a
selfish, self-absorbed set."Pauline went to the study window, "please come out here.Hilary's calling us names, and that isn't polite.""I hope not very bad names," she said.Hilary swung slowly back and forth in the hammock."I didn't mean it
that way--it's only--"  She told what Patience had said about Jane's
joining the club, and then, rather reluctantly, a little of what she
had been thinking."I think Hilary's right," Shirley declared."Let's form a deputation
and go right over and ask the poor old soul to join here and now.""I would never've thought of it," Bell said."But I don't suppose I've
ever given Jane a thought, anyway.""Patty's mighty cute--for all she's such a terror at times," Pauline
admitted."She knows a lot about the people here--and it's just
because she's interested in them.""Come on," Shirley said, jumping up."We're going to have another
honorary member.""I think it would be kind, girls," Mrs."Jane will
feel herself immensely flattered, and I know of no one who upholds the
honor of Winton more honestly or persistently."Shaw," Shirley coaxed, "when we come back, mayn't
Patience Shaw, H. M., come down and have tea with us?""I hardly think--"

"Please, Mother Shaw," Hilary broke in; "after all--she started this,
you know.That sort of counterbalances the other, doesn't it?""Well, we'll see," her mother laughed.Pauline ran to get one of the extra badges with which Shirley had
provided her, and then the four girls went across to the church.Sextoness Jane was just locking the back door--not the least important
part of the afternoon's duties with her--as they came through the
opening in the hedge."Good afternoon," she said cheerily, "was you
wanting to go inside?""No," Pauline answered, "we came over to invite you to join our club.We thought, maybe, you'd like to?""And wear one of
them blue-ribbon affairs?""See, here it is," and she pointed to
the one in Pauline's hand.Sextoness Jane came down the steps."Me, I ain't never wore a badge!Oncet, when I was a little youngster,'most
like Patience, teacher, she got up some sort of May doings.We was all
to wear white dresses and red, white and blue ribbons--very night
before, I come down with the mumps.Looks like I always come down when
I ought to've stayed up!""But you won't come down with anything this time," Pauline pinned the
blue badge on the waist of Jane's black and white calico."Now you're
an honorary member of 'The S. W. F.She was still stroking it softly as she walked slowly away towards
home.CHAPTER IX

AT THE MANOR

  "'All the names I know from nurse:
    Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,
    Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,
    And the Lady Hollyhock,'"

Patience chanted, moving slowly about the parsonage garden, hands full
of flowers, and the big basket, lying on the grass beyond, almost full.Behind her, now running at full speed, now stopping suddenly, back
lifted, tail erect, came Lucky, the black kitten from The Maples.Lucky had been an inmate of the parsonage for some weeks now and was
thriving famously in her adopted home.Towser tolerated her with the
indifference due such a small, insignificant creature, and she
alternately bullied and patronized Towser."We haven't shepherd's purse, nor lady's smock, that I know of, Lucky,"
Patience said, glancing back at the kitten, at that moment threatening
battle at a polite nodding Sweet William, "but you can see for yourself
that we have hollyhocks, while as for bachelor's buttons!Just look at
that big, blue bunch in one corner of the basket."It was the morning of the day of Shirley's turn and Pauline was
hurrying to get ready to go over and help decorate the manor.She was
singing, too; from the open windows of the "new room" came the words--

  "'A cheerful world?--It surely is
    And if you understand your biz
    You'll taboo the worry worm,
    And cultivate the happy germ.'"To which piece of good advice, Patience promptly whistled back the gay
refrain.On the back porch, Sextoness Jane--called in for an extra half-day--was
ironing the white dresses to be worn that afternoon.And presently,
Patience, her basket quite full and stowed away in the trap waiting
before the side door, strolled around to interview her."Well, I was sort of calculating
on going over for a bit; Miss Shirley having laid particular stress on
my coming and this being the first reg'lar doings since I joined the
club.I told her and Pauline they mustn't look for me to go junketing
'round with them all the while, seeing I'm in office--so to speak--and
my time pretty well taken up with my work."I--"  Patience edged nearer the porch.Behind Jane stood the tall
clothes-horse, with its burden of freshly ironed white things.At
sight of a short, white frock, very crisp and immaculate, the blood
rushed to the child's face, then as quickly receded.--After all, it
would have had to be ironed for Sunday and--well, mother certainly had
been very non-committal the past few days--ever since that escapade
with Bedelia, in fact--regarding her youngest daughter's hopes and
fears for this all-important afternoon.And Patience had been wise
enough not to press the matter."But, oh, I do wonder if Hilary has--"  Patience went back to the side
porch.Hilary was there talking to Bedelia."You--you have fixed it
up?"Patience repressed a sudden desire to stamp her foot, and Hilary,
seeing the real doubt and longing in her face, relented."Mother wants
to see you, Patty.From the doorway, she looked back--"I just knew
you wouldn't go back on me, Hilary!I'll love you forever'n' ever."Pauline came out a moment later, drawing on her driving gloves."I
feel like a story-book girl, going driving this time in the morning, in
a trap like this.I wish you were coming, too, Hilary.""Oh, I'm like the delicate story-book girl, who has to rest, so as to
be ready for the dissipations that are to come later.I look the part,
don't I?"Pauline looked down into the laughing, sun-browned face."If Uncle
Paul were to see you now, he might find it hard to believe I
hadn't--exaggerated that time.""Well, it's your fault--and his, or was, in the beginning.You've a
fine basket of flowers to take; Patience has done herself proud this
morning.""It's wonderful how well that young lady can behave--at times."When I hear mother tell how like her you used to
be, I don't feel too discouraged about Patty.""That strikes me as rather a double-edged sort of speech," Pauline
gathered up the reins."Good-by, and don't get too tired."Shirley's turn was to be a combination studio tea and lawn-party, to
which all club members, both regular and honorary, not to mention their
relatives and friends, had been bidden.Following this, was to be a
high tea for the regular members."That's Senior's share," Shirley had explained to Pauline."He insists
that it's up to him to do something."Dayre was on very good terms with the "S. W. F.As for
Shirley, after the first, no one had ever thought of her as an outsider.It was hard now, Pauline thought, as she drove briskly along, the lake
breeze in her face, and the sound of Bedelia's quick trotting forming a
pleasant accompaniment to her, thoughts, very hard, to realize how soon
the summer would be over.But perhaps--as Hilary said--next summer
would mean the taking up again of this year's good times and
interests,--Shirley talked of coming back.As for the winter--Pauline
had in mind several plans for the winter.Those of the club members to
stay behind must get together some day and talk them over.One thing
was certain, the club motto must be lived up to bravely.If not in one
way, why in another.There must be no slipping back into the old
dreary rut and routine.It lay with themselves as to what their winter
should be."And there's fine sleighing here, Bedelia," she said."We'll get the
old cutter out and give it a coat of paint."Bedelia tossed her head, as if she heard in imagination the gay
jingling of the sleighbells."But, in the meantime, here is the manor," Pauline laughed, "and it's
the prettiest August day that ever was, and lawn-parties and such
festivities are afoot, not sleighing parties."The manor stood facing the lake with its back to the road, a broad
sloping lawn surrounded it on three sides, with the garden at the back.For so many seasons, it had stood lonely and neglected, that Pauline
never came near it now, without rejoicing afresh in its altered aspect.Even the sight of Betsy Todd's dish towels, drying on the currant
bushes at one side of the back door, added their touch to the sense of
pleasant, homely life that seemed to envelop the old house nowadays.Shirley came to the gate, as Pauline drew up, Phil, Pat and Pudgey in
close attention."I have to keep an eye on them," she told Pauline."They've just had their baths, and they're simply wild to get out in
the middle of the road and roll.I've told them no self-respecting dog
would wish to come to a lawn-party in anything but the freshest of
white coats, but I'm afraid they're not very self-respecting.""Patience is sure Towser's heart is heavy because he is not to come;
she has promised him a lawn-party on his own account, and that no
grown-ups shall be invited.She's sent you the promised flowers, and
hinted--more or less plainly--that she would have been quite willing to
deliver them in person."Oh, but I'm afraid you've robbed yourself!""The boys have been putting
the awning up."Dayre's fellow artists, who had come up a
day or two before, on a visit to the manor.One of them, at any rate,
deserved Shirley's title."Looks pretty nice,
doesn't it?"he said, with a wave of the hand towards the red and white
striped awning, placed at the further edge of the lawn.Shirley smiled her approval, and introduced him to Pauline, adding that
Miss Shaw was the real founder of their club."It's a might jolly sort of club, too," young Oram said."That is exactly what it has turned out to be," Pauline laughed."Are
the vases ready, Shirley?"Shirley brought the tray of empty flower vases out on the veranda, and
sent Harry Oram for a bucket of fresh water."Harry is to make the
salad," she explained to Pauline, as he came back."Before he leaves
the manor he will have developed into a fairly useful member of
society.""You've never eaten one of my salads, Miss Shaw," Harry said."When
you have, you'll think all your previous life an empty dream.""It's much more likely her later life will prove a nightmare,--for a
while, at least," Shirley declared."Still, Paul, Harry does make them
rather well.Betsy Todd, I am sorry to say, doesn't approve of him.But there are so many persons and things she doesn't approve of;
lawn-parties among the latter."Pauline nodded sympathetically; she knew Betsy Todd of old.Her wonder
was, that the Dayres had been able to put up with her so long, and she
said so."'Hobson's choice,'" Shirley answered, with a little shrug."She isn't
much like our old Therese at home, is she, Harry?But nothing would
tempt Therese away from her beloved New York.Nevaire have
I heard of zat place!'she told Harry, when he interviewed her for us.Senior's gone to Vergennes--on business thoughts intent, or I hope they
are.He's under strict orders not to 'discover a single bit' along the
way, and to get back as quickly as possible.""You see how beautifully she has us all in training?"Suddenly she looked up from her flowers with sobered
face."I wonder," she said slowly, "if you know what it's meant to
us--you're being here this summer, Shirley?Sometimes things do fit in
just right after all.It's helped out wonderfully this summer, having
you here and the manor open.""Pauline has a fairy-story uncle down in New York," Shirley turned to
Harry.I've met him, once or twice--he didn't strike me as
much of a believer in fairy tales.""He's made us believe in them," Pauline answered."I think Senior might have provided me with such a delightful sort of
uncle," Shirley observed."I told him so, but he says, while he's
awfully sorry I didn't mention it before, he's afraid it's too late
now.""Uncle Paul sent us Bedelia," Pauline told the rather perplexed-looking
Harry, "and the row-boat and the camera and--oh, other things.""Because he wanted them to have a nice, jolly summer," Shirley
explained."Pauline's sister had been sick and needed brightening up.""You don't think he's looking around for a nephew to adopt, do you?""A well-intentioned, intelligent young man--with no
end of talent.""For making salads," Shirley added with a sly smile."Oh, well, you know," Harry remarked casually, "these are what Senior
calls my'salad days.'"Whereupon Shirley rose without a word, carrying off her vases of
flowers.The party at the manor was, like all the club affairs, a decided
success.Never had the old place looked so gay and animated, since
those far-off days of its early glory.The young people coming and going--the girls in their light dresses and
bright ribbons made a pleasant place of the lawn, with its background
of shining water.The tennis court, at one side of the house, was one
of the favorite gathering spots; there were one or two boats out on the
lake.The pleasant informality of the whole affair proved its greatest
charm.Allen was there, pointing out to his host the supposed end of the
subterranean passage said to connect the point on which the manor stood
with the old ruined French fort over on the New York side.The
minister was having a quiet chat with the doctor, who had made a
special point of being there.Mothers of club members were exchanging
notes and congratulating each other on the good comradeship and general
air of contentment among the young people.Sextoness Jane was there,
in all the glory of her best dress--one of Mrs.Shaw's handed-down
summer ones--and with any amount of items picked up to carry home to
Tobias, who was certain to expect a full account of this most unusual
dissipation on his mistress's part.Even Betsy Todd condescended to
put on her black woolen--usually reserved for church and funerals--and
walk about among the other guests; but always, with an air that told
plainly how little she approved of such goings on.The Boyds were
there, their badges in full evidence.And last, though far from least,
in her own estimation, Patience was there, very crisp and white and on
her best behavior,--for, setting aside those conditions mother had seen
fit to burden her with, was the delightful fact that Shirley had asked
her to help serve tea.The principal tea-table was in the studio, though there was a second
one, presided over by Pauline and Bell, out under the awning at the
edge of the lawn.Patience thought the studio the very nicest room she had ever been in.It was long and low--in reality, the old dancing-hall, for the manor
had been built after the pattern of its first owner's English home; and
in the deep, recessed windows, facing the lake, many a bepatched and
powdered little belle of Colonial days had coquetted across her fan
with her bravely-clad partner.Dayre had thrown out an extra window at one end, at right angles to
the great stone fireplace, banked to-day with golden rod, thereby
securing the desired north light.On the easel, stood a nearly finished painting,--a sunny corner of the
old manor kitchen, with Betsy Todd in lilac print gown, peeling apples
by the open window, through which one caught a glimpse of the tall
hollyhocks in the garden beyond.Before this portrait, Patience found Sextoness Jane standing in mute
astonishment."Betsy looks like she was just going to say--'take your hands out of
the dish!'Betsy had once helped out
at the parsonage, during a brief illness of Miranda's, and the young
lady knew whereof she spoke."I'd never've thought," Jane said slowly, "that anyone'd get that fond
of Sister Todd--as to want a picture of her!""Oh, it's because she's such a character, you know," Patience explained
serenely.Jane was so good about letting one explain things."'A
perfect character,' I heard one of those artist men say so.""Not what I'd call a 'perfect'
character--not that I've got anything against Sister Todd; but she's
too fond of finding out a body's faults."Patience went off then in search of empty tea-cups.She was having a
beautiful time; at present only one cloud overshadowed her horizon.Already some tiresome folks were beginning to think about going.There
was the talk of chores to be done, suppers to get, and with the
breaking up, must come an end to her share in the party.For mother,
though approached in the most delicate fashion, had proved obdurate
regarding the further festivity to follow.Had mother been willing to
consider the matter, Patience would have cheerfully undertaken to
procure the necessary invitation.Shirley was a very obliging girl."And really, my dears," she said, addressing the three P's
collectively, "it does seem a pity to have to go home before the fun's
all over.And I could manage it--Bob would take me out rowing--if I
coaxed--he rows very slowly.I don't suppose, for one moment, that we
would get back in time.I believe--"  For fully three minutes,
Patience sat quite still in one of the studio window seats, oblivious
of the chatter going on all about her; then into her blue eyes came a
look not seen there very often--"No," she said sternly, shaking her
head at Phil, much to his surprise, for he wasn't doing anything."No--it wouldn't be _square_--and there would be the most awful to-do
afterwards."Shaw called to her to come, that
father was waiting, Patience responded with a very good grace.Dayre caught the wistful look in the child's face."Bless me," he said
heartily."You're not going to take Patience home with you, Mrs.Let her stay for the tea--the young people won't keep late hours, I
assure you.""Sometimes, I find it quite as well not to think things over," Mr."Why, dear me, I'd quite counted on Patience's being
here.You see, I'm not a regular member, either; and I want someone to
keep me in countenance."So presently, Hilary felt a hand slipped eagerly into hers."And oh, I
just love Mr.Then Patience went back to her window seat to play the delightful game
of "making believe" she hadn't stayed.She imagined that instead, she
was sitting between father and mother in the gig, bubbling over with
the desire to "hi-yi" at Fanny, picking her slow way along.The studio was empty, even the dogs were outside, speeding the parting
guests with more zeal than discretion.But after awhile Harry Oram
strolled in."You're an
artist, too, aren't you?""So kind of you to say so," Harry murmured."I have heard grave doubts
expressed on the subject by my too impartial friends.""I mean to be one when I grow up," Patience told him, "so's I can have
a room like this--with just rugs on the floor; rugs slide so
nicely--and window seats and things all cluttery.""May I come and have tea with you?"It'll be really tea--not pretend kind," Patience said."But I'll have
that sort for any children who may come.Hilary takes pictures--she
doesn't make them though.Harry glanced through the open doorway, to where
Hilary sat resting.She was "making" a picture now, he thought to
himself, in her white dress, under the big tree, her pretty hair
forming a frame about her thoughtful face.Taking a portfolio from a
table near by, he went out to where Hilary sat."Your small sister says you take pictures," he said, drawing a chair up
beside hers, "so I thought perhaps you'd let me show you these--they
were taken by a friend of mine.""Oh, but mine aren't anything like these!Hilary bent over the photographs he handed her; marveling over their
soft tones.They were mostly bits of landscape, with here and there a
water view and one or two fleecy cloud effects.It hardly seemed as
though they could be really photographs."I wish I
could--there are some beautiful views about here that would make
charming pictures.""She didn't in the beginning," Harry said, "She's lame; it was an
accident, but she can never be quite well again, so she took this up,
as an amusement at first, but now it's going to be her profession.""And you really think--anyone
could learn to do it?""No, not anyone; but I don't see why the right sort of person couldn't.""I wonder--if I could develop into the right sort.""May I come and see what you have done--and talk it over?""Since this friend of mine took it up, I'm ever so interested in camera
work."She had never thought of her camera
holding such possibilities within it, of its growing into something
better and more satisfying than a mere playmate of the moment.Supper was served on the lawn; the pleasantest, most informal, of
affairs, the presence of the older members of the party serving to turn
the gay give and take of the young folks into deeper and wider
channels, and Shirley's frequent though involuntary--"Do you remember,
Senior?"calling out more than one vivid bit of travel, of description
of places, known to most of them only through books.Later, down on the lower end of the lawn, with the moon making a path
of silver along the water, and the soft hush of the summer night over
everything, Shirley brought out her guitar, singing for them strange
folk-songs, picked up in her rambles with her father.Afterwards, the
whole party sang songs that they all knew, ending up at last with the
club song."'It's a habit to be happy,'" the fresh young voices chorused, sending
the tune far out across the lake; and presently, from a boat on its
further side, it was whistled back to them.Edna said,

"Give it up," Tom answered."Someone who's heard it--there've been
plenty of opportunities for folks to hear it.""Well it isn't a bad gospel to scatter broadcast," Bob remarked."And maybe it's someone who doesn't live about here, and he will go
away taking our tune with him, for other people to catch up," Hilary
suggested."But if he only has the tune and not the words," Josie objected, "what
use will that be?""The spirit of the words is in the tune," Pauline said."No one could
whistle or sing it and stay grumpy.""They'd have to 'put the frown away awhile, and try a little sunny
smile,' wouldn't they?"Patience had been a model of behavior all the evening.Mother would be
sure to ask if she had been good, when they got home.That was one of
those aggravating questions that only time could relieve her from.No
one ever asked Paul, or Hilary, that--when they'd been anywhere.Dayre had promised, the party broke up early, going off in the
various rigs they had come in.Tom and Josie went in the trap with the
Shaws."It's been perfectly lovely--all of it," Josie said, looking
back along the road they were leaving."Every good time we have seems
the best one yet.""You wait 'til my turn comes," Pauline told her."I've such a scheme
in my head."She was in front, between Tom, who was
driving, and Hilary, then she leaned forward, they were nearly home,
and the lights of the parsonage showed through the trees."There's a
light in the parlor--there's company!""And one up in our old room, Hilary.Goodness,
it must be a visiting minister!I didn't know father was expecting
anyone.""I just bet it
isn't any visiting minister--but a visiting--uncle!I feel it in my
bones, as Miranda says.""I feel it in my bones," Patience repeated."I just _knew_ Uncle Paul
would come up--a story-book uncle would be sure to.""Well, here we are," Tom laughed."You'll know for certain pretty
quick."CHAPTER X

THE END OF SUMMER

It was Uncle Paul, and perhaps no one
was more surprised at his unexpected coming,
than he himself.That snap-shot of Hilary's had considerable
to do with it; bringing home to him the
sudden realization of the passing of the years.For the first time, he had allowed himself to
face the fact that it was some time now since
he had crossed the summit of the hill, and that
under present conditions, his old age promised
to be a lonely, cheerless affair.He had never had much to do with young
people; but, all at once, it seemed to him that
it might prove worth his while to cultivate
the closer acquaintance of these nieces of his.Pauline, in particular, struck him as likely to
improve upon a nearer acquaintance.And
that afternoon, as he rode up Broadway, he
found himself wondering how she would
enjoy the ride; and all the sights and wonders
of the great city.Later, over his solitary dinner, he suddenly
decided to run up to Winton the next day.He would not wire them, he would rather like
to take Phil by surprise.So he had arrived at the parsonage,
driving up in Jed's solitary hack, and much plied
with information, general and personal, on the
way, just as the minister and his wife reached
home from the manor.Doesn't father look
tickled to death!"Patience declared, coming
in to her sisters' room that night, ostensibly
to have an obstinate knot untied, but inwardly
determined to make a third at the usual
bedtime talk for that once, at least.It wasn't
often they all came up together."He looks mighty glad," Pauline said."And isn't it funny, bearing him called
Phil?"Patience curled herself up in the
cozy corner."I never've thought of father
as Phil."Hilary paused in the braiding of her long
hair."I'm glad we've got to know him--Uncle
Paul, I mean--through his letters, and
all the lovely things he's done for us; else, I
think I'd have been very much afraid of him.""So am I," Pauline assented.Oram meant--he doesn't look as if
he believed much in fairy stories.But I like
his looks--he's so nice and tall and straight.""He used to have red hair, before it turned
gray," Hilary said, "so that must be a family
trait; your chin's like his, Paul, too,--so
square and determined.""You cut to bed, youngster," Pauline
commanded."You're losing all your beauty
sleep; and really, you know--"

Patience went to stand before the mirror."Maybe I ain't--pretty--yet; but I'm going
to be--some day.Dayre says he likes
red hair, I asked him.He says for me not to
worry; I'll have them all sitting up and taking notice yet."At which Pauline bore promptly down
upon her, escorting her in person to the door
of her own room."And you'd better get to
bed pretty quickly, too, Hilary," she advised,
coming back."You've had enough excitement for one day."Paul Shaw stayed a week; it was a
busy week for the parsonage folk and for
some other people besides.Before it was
over, the story-book uncle had come to know
his nieces and Winton fairly thoroughly;
while they, on their side, had grown very well
acquainted with the tall, rather silent man,
who had a fashion of suggesting the most
delightful things to do in the most matter-of-fact manner.There were one or two trips decidedly
outside that ten-mile limit, including an all day
sail up the lake, stopping for the night at a
hotel on the New York shore and returning
by the next day's boat.There was a visit to
Vergennes, which took in a round of the shops,
a concert, and another night away from home.Hilary
sighed blissfully one morning, as she and her
uncle waited on the porch for Bedelia and
the trap.Hilary was to drive him over to
The Maples for dinner."Or such a summer altogether," Pauline
added, from just inside the study window."I should think it has; we ought to be
eternally grateful to you for making us find
them out," Pauline declared.Shaw smiled, more as if to himself."I
daresay they're not all exhausted yet.""Perhaps," Hilary said slowly, "some
places are like some people, the longer and
better you know them, the more you keep
finding out in them to like.""Father says," Pauline suggested, "that one
finds, as a rule, what one is looking for.""Here we are," her uncle exclaimed, as
Patience appeared, driving Bedelia."Do you
know," he said, as he and Hilary turned out
into the wide village street, "I haven't seen the
schoolhouse yet?"It isn't
much of a building," Hilary answered."It is said to be a very good school for the
size of the place."Hilary turned Bedelia
up the little by-road, leading to the old
weather-beaten schoolhouse, standing back
from the road in an open space of bare ground.I would've been this June, if I
hadn't broken down last winter.""You will be able to go on this fall?"He says, if all his patients got on so
well, by not following his advice, he'd have
to shut up shop, but that, fortunately for
him, they haven't all got a wise uncle down in
New York, to offer counter-advice."Shaw remarked,
adding, "and Pauline considers herself through school?"I know she would like
to go on--but we've no higher school here and--She
read last winter, quite a little, with
father."Supposing you both had an opportunity--for
it must be both, or neither, I judge--and
the powers that be consented--how about
going away to school this winter?"she
cried, "you mean--"

"I have a trick of meaning what I say," her
uncle said, smiling at her."I wish I could say--what I want to--and
can't find words for--" Hilary said."We haven't consulted the higher authorities
yet, you know.""And--Oh, I don't see how mother could
get on without us, even if--"

"Mothers have a knack at getting along
without a good many things--when it means
helping their young folks on a bit,"
Mr."I'll have a talk with her
and your father to-night."That evening, pacing up and down the
front veranda with his brother, Mr.Shaw
said, with his customary abruptness, "You
seem to have fitted in here, Phil,--perhaps, you
were in the right of it, after all.I take it
you haven't had such a hard time, in some ways."Looking back nearly twenty years, he told
himself, that he did not regret that early
choice of his.He had fitted into the life here;
he and his people had grown together.It had
not always been smooth sailing and more than
once, especially the past year or so, his
narrow means had pressed him sorely, but on the
whole, he had found his lines cast in a
pleasant place, and was not disposed to rebel
against his heritage."Yes," he said, at last, "I have fitted in;
too easily, perhaps."Except in the accumulating of books," his
brother suggested."I have not been
able to give unlimited rein even to that mild
ambition.Fortunately, the rarer the
opportunity, the greater the pleasure it brings
with it--and the old books never lose their charm."Paul Shaw flicked the ashes from his
cigar."And the girls--you expect them to
fit in, too?"A note the elder
brother knew of old sounded in the younger
man's voice."Don't mount your high horse just yet,
Phil," he said."I'm not going to rub you up
the wrong way--at least, I don't mean to; but
you were always an uncommonly hard chap to
handle--in some matters.I grant you, it is
their home and not a had sort of home for a
girl to grow up in."Shaw stood for a
moment at the head of the steps, looking off
down the peaceful, shadowy street.It had
been a pleasant week; he had enjoyed it
wonderfully.Already the city
was calling to him; he was homesick for its
rush and bustle, the sense of life and movement."You and I stand as far apart to-day, in
some matters, Phil, as we did twenty--thirty
years ago," he said presently, "and that eldest
daughter of yours--I'm a fair hand at reading
character or I shouldn't be where I am to-day,
if I were not--is more like me than you.""So I have come to think--lately.""That second girl takes after you; she
would never have written that letter to me
last May.""No, Hilary would not have at the time--"

"Oh, I can guess how you felt about it at
the time.But, look here, Phil, you've got
over that--surely?After all, I like to think
now that Pauline only hurried on the
inevitable."Paul Shaw laid his hand on the
minister's shoulder."Nearly twenty years is
a pretty big piece out of a lifetime.I see now
how much I have been losing all these years."Sandra moved to the garden."It has been a long time, Paul; and,
perhaps, I have been to blame in not trying more
persistently to heal the breach between us.I
assure you that I have regretted it daily.""You always did have a lot more pride in
your make-up than a man of your profession
has any right to allow himself, Phil.But if
you like, I'm prepared to point out to you
right now how you can make it up to me.Here comes Lady Shaw and we won't
waste time getting to business."That night, as Pauline and Hilary were in
their own room, busily discussing, for by no
means the first time that day, what Uncle Paul
had said to Hilary that morning, and just
how he had looked, when he said it, and was
it at all possible that father would consent,
and so on, _ad libitum_, their mother tapped at the door."That is how you take it," Mrs.She was glad, very glad, that this
unforeseen opportunity should be given her
daughters; and yet--it meant the first break
in the home circle, the first leaving home for them."I'll try and run up for a day or two, before
the girls go to school," he promised his
sister-in-law."Let me know, as soon as you have
decided _where_ to send them."Patience was divided in her opinion, as to
this new plan.It would be lonesome without
Paul and Hilary; but then, for the time
being, she would be, to all intents and purposes,
"Miss Shaw."Also, Bedelia was not going
to boarding-school--on the whole, the
arrangement had its advantages.Of course,
later, she would have her turn at school--Patience
meant to devote a good deal of her
winter's reading to boarding-school stories.She told Sextoness Jane so, when that
person appeared, just before supper time."A lot of things
keep happening to you folks right along," she
observed."Nothing's ever happened to me,
'cept mumps--and things of that sort; you
wouldn't call them interesting."They're 'round on the porch, looking at
some photos Mr.Oram's brought over; and
he's looking at Hilary's.Hilary's going in
for some other kind of picture taking.I wish
she'd leave her camera home, when she goes to
school.Do you want to speak to them about
anything particular?""I'll wait a bit," Jane sat down on the
garden-bench beside Patience.the latter said, as the
front gate clicked a few moments later.she called, "You're wanted, Paul!""You and Hilary going to be busy
tonight?"Jane asked, as Pauline came across
the lawn."Well," Jane said, "it ain't prayer-meeting
night, and it ain't young peoples' night and it
ain't choir practice night, so I thought maybe
you'd like me to take my turn at showing you
something.Not all the club--like's not they
wouldn't care for it, but if you think they
would, why, you can show it to them sometime.""So can I--if you tell mother you want me
to," Patience put in."A good two miles--we'd best walk--we
can rest after we get there.Maybe, if you
like, you'd better ask Tom and Josie.Your
ma'll be better satisfied if he goes along, I
reckon.I'll come for you at about half-past
seven.""All right, thank you ever so much," Pauline
said, and went to tell Hilary, closely
pursued by Patience.Shaw
vetoed Pauline's proposition that Patience
should make one of the party."Not every time, my dear," she explained.Promptly at half-past seven Jane
appeared.she said, as the four
young people came to meet her."You don't
want to go expecting anything out of the
common.Like's not, you've all seen it a heap
of times, but maybe not to take particular
notice of it."She led the way through the garden to the
lane running past her cottage, where Tobias
sat in solitary dignity on the doorstep, down
the lane to where it merged in to what was
nothing more than a field path."But not out on the water," Josie said."You're taking us too far below the pier for that.""It'll be on the water--what
you're going to see," she was getting
a good deal of pleasure out of her small
mystery, and when they reached the low shore,
fringed with the tall sea-grass, she took her
party a few steps along it to where an old log
lay a little back from the water."I reckon
we'll have to wait a bit," she said, "but it'll
be 'long directly."They sat down in a row, the young people
rather mystified.Apparently the broad
expanse of almost motionless water was quite
deserted.There was a light breeze blowing
and the soft swishing of the tiny waves against
the bank was the only sound to break the
stillness; the sky above the long irregular range
of mountains on the New York side, still wore
its sunset colors, the lake below sending hack
a faint reflection of them.But presently these faded until only the
afterglow was left, to merge in turn into the
soft summer twilight, through which the stars
began to glimpse, one by one.The little group had been mostly silent,
each busy with his or her thoughts; so far as
the young people were concerned, happy
thoughts enough; for if the closing of each
day brought their summer nearer to its
ending, the fall would bring with it new
experiences, an entering of new scenes.Sextoness Jane broke the silence,
pointing up the lake, to where a tiny point of
red showed like a low-hung star through the
gathering darkness.Moment by moment,
other lights came into view, silently, steadily,
until it seemed like some long, gliding
sea-serpent, creeping down towards them through
the night.They had all seen it, times without number,
before.The long line of canal boats being
towed down the lake to the canal below; the
red lanterns at either end of each boat
showing as they came.But to-night, infected
perhaps, by the pride, the evident delight, in
Jane's voice, the old familiar sight held them
with the new interest the past months had
brought to bear upon so many old, familiar things."It is--wonderful," Pauline said at last."It might be a scene from--fairyland, almost.""Me--I love to see them come stealing long
like that through the dark," Jane said slowly
and a little hesitatingly.It was odd to be
telling confidences to anyone except Tobias."I don't know where they come from, nor
where they're a-going to.Many's the night
I walk over here just on the chance of seeing
one.Mostly, this time of year, you're pretty
likely to catch one.When I was younger, I
used to sit and fancy myself going aboard on
one of them and setting off for strange parts.I wasn't looking to settle down here in Winton
all my days; but I reckon, maybe, it's just's
well--anyhow, when I got the freedom to
travel, I'd got out of the notion of it--and
perhaps, there's no telling, I might have been
terribly disappointed.And there ain't any
hindrance 'gainst my setting off--in my own
mind--every time I sits here and watches a
tow go down the lake.I've seen a heap of
big churches in my travels--it's mostly easier
'magining about them--churches are pretty
much alike I reckon, though I ain't seen many, I'll admit."No one answered for a moment, but Jane,
used to Tobias for a listener, did not mind.Then in the darkness, Hilary laid a hand
softly over the work-worn ones clasped on
Jane's lap.It was hard to imagine Jane
young and full of youthful fancies and
longings; yet years ago there had been a Jane--not
Sextoness Jane then--who had found
Winton dull and dreary and had longed to get
away.But for her, there had been no one to
wave the magic wand, that should transform
the little Vermont village into a place filled
with new and unexplored charms.Never in
all Jane's many summers, had she known one
like this summer of theirs; and for them--the
wonder was by no means over--the years
ahead were bright with untold possibilities.Hilary sighed for very happiness, wondering
if she were the same girl who had rocked
listlessly in the hammock that June morning,
protesting that she didn't care for "half-way" things."I'm ever so glad we came, thank you so
much, Jane," Pauline said heartily."I wonder what'll have happened by the
time we all see our next tow go down," Josie
said, as they started towards home."We may see a good many more than one
before the general exodus," her brother answered."But we won't have time to come watch for
them.Oh, Paul, just think, only a little
while now--"

Tom slipped into step with Hilary, a little
behind the others."I never supposed the old
soul had it in her," he said, glancing to where
Jane trudged heavily on ahead."Still, I
suppose she was young--once; though I've never
thought of her being so before.""I wonder,--maybe,
she's been better off, after all, right, here at
home.She wouldn't have got to be
Sextoness Jane anywhere else, probably.""Is there a
hidden meaning--subject to be carefully avoided?""So you and Paul are off on your travels, too?""Yes, though I can hardly believe it yet.""And just as glad to go as any of us.""Oh, but we're coming back--after we've
been taught all manner of necessary things.""Edna'll be the only one of you girls left
behind; it's rough on her.""It certainly is; we'll all have to write her
heaps of letters.""Much time there'll be for letter-writing,
outside of the home ones," Tom said."Speaking of time," Josie turned towards
them, "we're going to be busier than any bee
ever dreamed of being, before or since Dr.They certainly were busy days that
followed.So many of the young folks were
going off that fall that a good many of the
meetings of "The S. W. F. Club" resolved
themselves into sewing-bees, for the girl members only."If we'd known how jolly they were, we'd
have tried them before," Bell declared one
morning, dropping down on the rug Pauline
had spread under the trees at one end of the
parsonage lawn.Patience, pulling bastings with a business-like
air, nodded her curly head wisely."Miranda says,
folks mostly get 'round to enjoying
their blessings 'bout the time they come to lose them.""Has the all-important question been
settled yet, Paul?"Edna asked, looking up from
her work.She might not be going away to
school, but even so, that did not debar one
from new fall clothes at home."They're coming to Vergennes with me,"
Bell said."Then we can all come home
together Friday nights.""They're coming to Boston with me," Josie
corrected, "then we'll be back together for
Thanksgiving."Shirley, meekly taking her first sewing
lessons under Pauline's instructions, and frankly
declaring that she didn't at all like them,
dropped the hem she was turning."They're
coming to New York with me; and in the
between-times we'll have such fun that they'll
never want to come home.""It looks as though
Hilary and I would have a busy winter
between you all.It is a comfort to know where
we are going."she warned, when later the
party broke up."Are we going out in a blaze of glory?""You might tell us where we are going,
now, Paul," Josie urged."You wait until
Friday, like good little girls.Mind, you all
bring wraps; it'll be chilly coming home."Pauline's turn was to be the final wind-up
of the club's regular outings.No one outside
the home folks, excepting Tom, had been
taken into her confidence--it had been
necessary to press him into service.And when, on
Friday afternoon, the young people gathered
at the parsonage, all but those named were
still in the dark.Allen, Harry Oram and Patience
were there; the minister and Dr.Brice
had promised to join the party later if possible.As a rule, the club picnics were cooperative
affairs; but to-day the members, by special
request, arrived empty-handed.Paul
Shaw, learning that Pauline's turn was yet to
come, had insisted on having a share in it."I am greatly interested in this club," he
had explained."I like results, and I think,"
he glanced at Hilary's bright happy face,
"that the 'S.W. F. Club' has achieved at least
one very good result."And on the morning before the eventful
Friday, a hamper had arrived from New
York, the watching of the unpacking of which
had again transformed Patience, for the time,
from an interrogation to an exclamation point."It's a beautiful hamper," she explained to
Towser."It truly is--because father says,
it's the inner, not the outer, self that makes
for real beauty, or ugliness; and it certainly
was the inside of that hamper that counted.I wish you were going, Towser.See here,
suppose you follow on kind of quietly
to-morrow afternoon--don't show up too soon, and
I guess I can manage it."Which piece of advice Towser must have
understood.At any rate, he acted upon it to
the best of his ability, following the party at a
discreet distance through the garden and down
the road towards the lake; and only when the
halt at the pier came, did he venture near, the
most insinuating of dogs.And so successfully did Patience manage
it, that when the last boat-load pushed off
from shore, Towser sat erect on the narrow
bow seat, blandly surveying his fellow
voyagers."He does so love picnics," Patience
explained to Mr.Dayre, "and this is
the last particular one for the season.I kind
of thought he'd go along and I slipped in a
little paper of bones.""We're out on the wide ocean sailing.""I wish we
were--the water's quiet as a mill-pond this afternoon."For the great lake, appreciating perhaps
the importance of the occasion, had of its many
moods chosen to wear this afternoon its
sweetest, most beguiling one, and lay, a broad
stretch of sparkling, rippling water, between
its curving shores.Beyond, the range of mountains rose dark
and somber against the cloud-flecked sky,
their tops softened by the light haze that told
of coming autumn.And presently, from boat to boat, went the
call, "We're going to Port Edward!"But that's not _in_ Winton," Edna protested."Of it, if not in it," Jack Ward assured them."Do you reckon you can show us anything
new about that old fort, Paul Shaw?""Why, I could go all over it
blindfolded.""Not to show the new--to unfold the old,"
Pauline told him."It is--in substance," Pauline looked across
her shoulder to where Mr.Allen sat,
imparting information to Harry Oram."So that's why you asked the old fellow,"
Tracy said.They were rounding the slender point on
which the tall, white lighthouse stood, and
entering the little cove where visitors to the fort
usually beached their boats.A few rods farther inland, rose the tall,
grass-covered, circular embankment,
surrounding the crumbling, gray walls, the outer
shells of the old barracks.At the entrance to the enclosure, Tom
suddenly stepped ahead, barring the way."No
passing within this fort without the
counter-sign," he declared."'It's a
habit to be happy,'" she suggested, and Tom
drew back for her to enter.But one by one,
he exacted the password from each.Inside, within the shade of those old, gray
walls, a camp-fire had been built and
camp-kettle swung, hammocks had been hung under
the trees and when cushions were scattered
here and there the one-time fort bore anything
but a martial air.But something of the spirit of the past must
have been in the air that afternoon, or perhaps,
the spirit of the coming changes; for this
picnic--though by no means lacking in charm--was
not as gay and filled with light-hearted
chaff as usual.There was more talking in
quiet groups, or really serious searching for
some trace of those long-ago days of storm and stress.With the coming of evening, the fire was
lighted and the cloth laid within range of its
flickering shadows.The night breeze had
sprung up and from outside the sloping
embankment they caught the sound of the waves
breaking on the beach.True to their
promise, the minister and Dr.Brice appeared at
the time appointed and were eagerly welcomed
by the young people.Supper was a long, delightful affair that
night, with much talk of the days when the
fort had been devoted to far other purposes
than the present; and the young people,
listening to the tales Mr.Allen told in his quiet yet
strangely vivid way, seemed to hear the slow
creeping on of the boats outside and to be
listening in the pauses of the wind for the
approach of the enemy."I'll take it back, Paul," Tracy told her, as
they were repacking the baskets."Even the
old fort has developed new interests."W. F. Club' will
continue its good work," Jack said.John went to the office.Going back, Pauline found herself sitting
in the stern of one of the boats, beside her
father.The club members were singing the
club song.But Pauline's thoughts had
suddenly gone back to that wet May afternoon.She could see the dreary, rain-swept garden,
hear the beating of the drops on the
window-panes.How long ago and remote it all
seemed; how far from the hopeless discontent,
the vague longings, the real anxiety of that
time, she and Hilary had traveled."There's one thing,"
she said, "we've had one summer that I shall
always feel would be worth reliving.And
we're going to have more of them.""I am glad to hear that," Mr.Pauline looked about her--the lanterns at
the ends of the boats threw dancing lights out
across the water, no longer quiet; overhead,
the sky was bright with stars."Everything
is so beautiful," the girl said slowly."One
seems to feel it more--every day.""'The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the
Lord hath made even both of them,'" her
father quoted gravely."The
hearing ear and the seeing eye"--it was a good
thought to take with them--out into the new
life, among the new scenes.One would need
them everywhere--out in the world, as well as
in Winton.And then, from the boat just
ahead, sounded Patience's clear
treble,--"'There's a Good Time Coming.'"And now he will never meet with us again and the children will never
have another minister all their own.He thinks he may be able to write
letters to the children and perhaps write his own life.We all hope he
may be able to sit up if he cannot walk.We went to our old home in Penn Yan visiting last week and stayed at
Judge Ellsworth's.We called to see the Tunnicliffs and the Olivers,
Wells, Jones, Shepards, Glovers, Bennetts, Judds and several other
families.They were glad to see us for the sake of our father and
mother.Father was their pastor from 1841 to 1847.Some one told us that when Bob and Henry Antes were small boys they
thought they would like to try, just for once, to see how it would seem
to be bad, so in spite of all of Mr.Tousley's sermons they went out
behind the barn one day and in a whisper Bob said, "I swear," and Henry
said, "So do I."Then they came into the house looking guilty and quite
surprised, I suppose, that they were not struck dead just as Ananias and
Sapphira were for lying._September_.--I read in a New York paper to-day that Hon.George
Peabody, of England, presented Cyrus W. Field with a solid silver tea
service of twelve pieces, which cost $4,000.Field, with the coat of arms of the Field family.The epergne is supported by a base representing the genius of America.We had experiments in the philosophy class to-day and took electric
shocks.Chubbuck managed the battery which has two handles attached.Two of the girls each held one of these and we all took hold of hands
making the circuit complete.After a while it jerked us almost to pieces
and we asked Mr.Dana Luther, one of the
Academy boys, walked up from the post-office with me this noon.He lives
in Naples and is Florence Younglove's cousin.We went to a ball game
down on Pleasant Street after school.I got so far ahead of Anna coming
home she called me her "distant relative."1859

_January_, 1859.--Mr.Woodruff came to see Grandfather to ask him if we
could attend his singing school.He is going to have it one evening each
week in the chapel of our church.Quite a lot of the boys and girls are
going, so we were glad when Grandfather gave his consent.Woodruff
wants us all to sing by note and teaches "do re me fa sol la si do" from
the blackboard and beats time with a stick.He lets us have a recess,
which is more fun than all the rest of it.He says if we practise well
we can have a concert in Bemis Hall to end up with._February_.--Anna has been teasing me all the morning about a verse
which John Albert Granger Barker wrote in my album.He has a most
fascinating lisp when he talks, so she says this is the way the verse
reads:

    "Beauty of perthon, ith thertainly chawming
    Beauty of feachure, by no meanth alawming
    But give me in pwefrence, beauty of mind,
    Or give me Cawwie, with all thwee combined."It takes Anna to find "amuthement" in "evewything."Mary Wheeler came over and pierced my ears to-day, so I can wear my new
earrings that Uncle Edward sent me.She pinched my ear until it was numb
and then pulled a needle through, threaded with silk.It is all the
fashion for girls to cut off their hair and friz it.Anna and I have cut
off ours and Bessie Seymour got me to cut off her lovely long hair
to-day.It won't be very comfortable for us to sleep with curl papers
all over our heads, but we must do it now.I wanted my new dress waist
which Miss Rosewarne is making, to hook up in front, but Grandmother
said I would have to wear it that way all the rest of my life so I had
better be content to hook it in the back a little longer.She said when
Aunt Glorianna was married, in 1848, it was the fashion for grown up
women to have their waists fastened in the back, so the bride had hers
made that way but she thought it was a very foolish and inconvenient
fashion.It is nice, though, to dress in style and look like other
people.I have a Garibaldi waist and a Zouave jacket and a balmoral
skirt._Sunday_.--I asked Grandmother if I could write a letter to Father
to-day, and she said I could begin it and tell him that I went to church
and what Mr.Daggett's text was and then finish it to-morrow.I did so,
but I wish I could do it all after I began.She said a verse from the
Tract Primer:

    "A Sabbath well spent brings a week of content
    And strength for the toil of to-morrow,
    But a Sabbath profaned, whatever be gained,
    Is a certain forerunner of sorrow."_Monday_.--We dressed up in new fangled costumes to-day and wore them to
school.Some of us wore dresses almost up to our knees and some wore
them trailing on the ground.Some wore their hair twisted in knots and
some let theirs hang down their backs.I wore my new waterfall for the
first time and Abbie Clark said I looked like "Hagar in the Wilderness."When she came in she looked like a fashion plate, bedecked with bows and
ribbons and her hair up in a new way.When she came in the door she
stopped and said solemnly: "If you have tears prepare to shed them now!"Laura Chapin would not participate in the fun, for once.She said she
thought "Beauty unadorned was the dorndest."We did not have our lesson
in mental philosophy very well so we asked Mr.Richards to explain the
nature of dreams and their cause and effect.He gave us a very
interesting talk, which occupied the whole hour.We listened with
breathless attention, so he must have marked us 100.There was a lecture at the seminary to-night and Rev.Hibbard, the
Methodist minister, who lives next door above the Methodist church, came
home with us.Grandmother was very much pleased when we told her._March_ 1.--Our hired man has started a hot bed and we went down behind
the barn to see it.Grandfather said he was up at 6 o'clock and walked
up as far as Mr.Greig's lions and back again for exercise before
breakfast.He seems to have the bloom of youth on his face as a reward.Anna says she saw "Bloom of youth" advertised in the drug store and she
is going to buy some.I know Grandmother won't let her for it would be
like "taking coal to Newcastle."_April._--Anna wanted me to help her write a composition last night, and
we decided to write on "Old Journals," so we got hers and mine both out
and made selections and then she copied them.When we were on our way to
school this morning we met Mr.E. M. Morse and Anna asked him if he did
not want to read her composition that Carrie wrote for her.He made a
very long face and pretended to be much shocked, but said he would like
to read it, so he took it and also her album, which she asked him to
write in.At night, on his way home, he stopped at our door and left
them both.When she looked in her album, she found this was what he had
written:

"Anna, when you have grown old and wear spectacles and a cap, remember
the boyish young man who saw your fine talents in 1859 and was certain
you would add culture to nature and become the pride of Canandaigua.Do
not forget also that no one deserves praise for anything done by others
and that your progress in wisdom and goodness will be watched by no one
more anxiously than by your true friend,
                                                          E. M.I think she might as well have told Mr.Morse that the old journals were
as much hers as mine; but I think she likes to make out she is not as
good as she is.Sarah Foster helped us to do our arithmetic examples
to-day.Much to our surprise Bridget Flynn, who has lived with us so long, is
married.We didn't know she thought of such a thing, but she has gone.Anna and I have learned how to make rice and cornstarch puddings.We
have a new girl in Bridget's place but I don't think she will do.Grandmother asked her to-day if she seasoned the gravy and she said,
either she did or she didn't, she couldn't tell which.Grandfather says
he thinks she is a little lacking in the "upper story."_June._--A lot of us went down to Sucker Brook this afternoon.Abbie
Clark was one and she told us some games to play sitting down on the
grass.We played "Simon says thumbs up" and then we pulled the leaves
off from daisies and said,

    "Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief,
    Doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief,"

to see which we would marry.Anna's came
"rich man" every time and she thinks it is true because Eugene Stone has
asked to marry her and he is quite well off.He
is going now to his home in St.Paul, Minn., but he is coming back for
her some day.Tom Eddy is going to be groomsman and Emma Wheeler
bridesmaid.She has not shown any
of Eugene Stone's notes to Grandmother yet for she does not think it is
worth while.Anna broke the seal on Tom Eddy's page in her mystic book,
although he wrote on it, "Not to be opened until December 8, 1859."He
says:

Dear Anna,--

I hope that in a few years I will see you and Stone living on the banks
of the Mississippi, in a little cottage, as snug as a bug in a rug,
living in peace, so that I can come and see you and have a good
time.--Yours,
                                                        Thos.Anna says if she does marry Eugene Stone and he forgets, after two or
three years to be as polite to her as he is now she shall look up at him
with her sweetest smile and say, "Miss Anna, won't you have a little
more sugar in your tea?"When I went to school this morning Juliet
Ripley asked, "Where do you think Anna Richards is now?We could see her from
the chapel window._June_ 7.--Alice Jewett took Anna all through their new house to-day
which is being built and then they went over to Mr.Noah T. Clarke's
partly finished house and went all through that.A dog came out of Cat
Alley and barked at them and scared Anna awfully.She said she almost
had a conniption fit but Emma kept hold of her.She is so afraid of
thunder and lightning and dogs.Old Friend Burling brought Grandfather a specimen of his handwriting
to-day to keep.This is
the verse he wrote and Grandfather gave it to me to paste in my book of
extracts:

              DIVINE LOVE.Could we with ink the ocean fill,
    Was the whole earth of parchment made,
    Was every single stick a quill,
    And every man a scribe by trade;
    To write the love of God above
    Would drain the ocean dry;
    Nor could that scroll contain the whole
    Though stretched from sky to sky.Transcribed by William S. Burling, Canandaigua, 1859, in the 83rd year
of his age._Sunday, December_ 8, 1859.--Mr.E. M. Morse is our Sunday School
teacher now and the Sunday School room is so crowded that we go up into
the church for our class recitation.Abbie Clark, Fannie Gaylord and
myself are the only scholars, and he calls us the three Christian
Graces, faith, hope and charity, and the greatest of these is charity.I
am the tallest, so he says I am charity.Gibson's pew,
because it is farthest away and we do not disturb the other classes.He
gave us some excellent advice to-day as to what was right and said if we
ever had any doubts about anything we should never do it and should
always be perfectly sure we are in the right before we act.He gave us
two weeks ago a poem to learn by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.It is an
apostrophe to God and very hard to learn.It is blank verse and has 85
lines in it.I have it committed at last and we are to recite it in
concert.The last two lines are, "Tell thou the silent sky and tell the
stars and tell yon rising sun, Earth with its thousand voices praises
God."Morse delivered a lecture in Bemis Hall last Thursday night.It was splendid and he lent me the
manuscript afterwards to read.Dick Valentine lectured in the hall the
other night too.There was some difference
in the lectures and the lecturers._Friday._--The older ladies of the town have formed a society for the
relief of the poor and are going to have a course of lectures in Bemis
Hall under their auspices to raise funds.The lecturers are to be from
the village and are to be: Rev.O. E. Daggett, subject, "Ladies and
Gentlemen"; Dr.Harvey Jewett, "The House We Live In"; Prof.F. E. R.
Chubbuck, "Progress"; Hon.H. W. Taylor, "The Empty Place"; Prof.E. G.
Tyler, "Finance"; Mr.N. T. Clark, "Chemistry"; E. M. Morse, "Graybeard
and His Dogmas."The young ladies have started a society, too, and we
have great fun and fine suppers.We met at Jennie Howell's to organize.We are to meet once in two weeks and are to present each member with an
album bed quilt with all our names on when they are married.Susie
Daggett says she is never going to be married, but we must make her a
quilt just the same.Laura Chapin sang, "Mary Lindsey, Dear," and we got
to laughing so that Susie Daggett and I lost our equilibrium entirely,
but I found mine by the time I got home.Yesterday afternoon Grandfather
asked us if we did not want to go to ride with him in the big two seated
covered carriage which he does not get out very often.We said yes, and
he stopped for Miss Hannah Upham and took her with us.She sat on the
back seat with me and we rode clear to Farmington and kept up a brisk
conversation all the way.She told us how she became lady principal of
the Ontario Female Seminary in 1830.She was still telling us about it
when we got back home._December_ 23.--We have had a Christmas tree and many other attractions
in Seminary chapel.The day scholars and townspeople were permitted to
participate and we had a post office and received letters from our
friends.E. M. Morse wrote me a fictitious one, claiming to be
written from the north pole ten years hence.I will copy it in my
journal for I may lose the letter.I had some gifts on the Christmas
tree and gave some.Chubbuck, with two large
hemstitched handkerchiefs with his initials embroidered in a corner of
each.As he is favored with the euphonious name of Frank Emery Robinson
Chubbuck it was a work of art to make his initials look beautiful.I
inclosed a stanza in rhyme:

    Amid the changing scenes of life
    If any storm should rise,
    May you ever have a handkerchief
    To wipe your weeping eyes.Morse's letter:

                                        North Pole, 10 _January_ 1869.Miss Carrie Richards,

"My Dear Young Friend.--It is very cold here and the pole is covered
with ice.I climbed it yesterday to take an observation and arrange our
flag, the Stars and Stripes, which I hoisted immediately on my arrival
here, ten years ago.I thought I should freeze and the pole was so
slippery that I was in great danger of coming down faster than was
comfortable.Although this pole has been used for more than 6,000 years
it is still as good as new.The works of the Great Architect do not wear
out.It is now ten years since I have seen you and my other two
Christian Graces and I have no doubt of your present position among the
most brilliant, noble and excellent women in all America.I always knew
and recognized your great abilities.Nature was very generous to you all
and you were enjoying fine advantages at the time I last knew you.I
thought your residence with your Grandparents an admirable school for
you, and you and your sister were most evidently the best joy of their
old age.At the time that I left my
three Christian Graces, Mrs.Grundy was sometimes malicious enough to
say that they were injuring themselves by flirting.I always told the
old lady that I had the utmost confidence in the judgment and discretion
of my pupils and that they would be very careful and prudent in all
their conduct.I confessed that flirting was wrong and very injurious to
any one who was guilty of it, but I was very sure that you were not.I
could not believe that you would disappoint us all and become only
ordinary women, but that you would become the most exalted characters,
scorning all things unworthy of ladies and Christians and I was right
and Mrs.When the ice around the pole thaws out I
shall make a flying visit to Canandaigua.I send you a tame polar bear
for a playfellow.This letter will be conveyed to you by Esquimaux
express.--Most truly yours,
                                                        E. M.I think some one must have shown some verses that we girls wrote, to
Mrs.Grundy and made her think that our minds were more upon the young
men than they were upon our studies, but if people knew how much time we
spent on Paley's "Evidences of Christianity" and Butler's Analogy and
Kames' Elements of Criticism and Tytler's Ancient History and Olmstead's
Mathematical Astronomy and our French and Latin and arithmetic and
algebra and geometry and trigonometry and bookkeeping, they would know
we had very little time to think of the masculine gender.1860

_New Year's Day._--We felt quite grown up to-day and not a little scared
when we saw Mr.Chubbuck all
coming in together to make a New Year's call.We did not feel so flustrated when Will Schley and Horace Finley
came in later.Oliver Phelps, Jr., came to call upon Grandmother._January_ 5.--Abbie Clark and I went up to see Miss Emma Morse because
it is her birthday.We call her sweet Miss Emma and we think Mr.We went to William Wirt Howe's lecture in Bemis Hall
this evening.Anna wanted to walk down a little ways with the girls after school so
she crouched down between Helen Coy and Hattie Paddock and walked past
the house.Grandmother always sits in the front window, so when Anna
came in she asked her if she had to stay after school and Anna gave her
an evasive answer.It reminds me of a story I read, of a lady who told
the servant girl if any one called to give an evasive answer as she did
not wish to receive calls that day.By and by the door bell rang and the
servant went to the door.When she came back the lady asked her how she
dismissed the visitor.She said, "Shure ye towld me to give an evasive
answer, so when the man asked if the lady of the house was at home I
said, 'Faith!We never say anything like
that to our "dear little lady," but we just change the subject and
divert the conversation into a more agreeable channel.To-day some one
came to see Grandmother when we were gone and told her that Anna and
some others ran away from school.Grandmother told Anna she hoped she
would never let any one bring her such a report again.Anna said she
would not, if she could possibly help it!Some one
who believes in the text, "Look not every man on his own things, but
every man also on the things of others."Grandfather told us to-night
that we ought to be very careful what we do as we are making history
every day.Anna says she shall try not to have hers as dry as some that
she had to learn at school to-day._February_ 9.--Dear Miss Mary Howell was married to-day to Mr._February_ 28.--Grandfather asked me to read Abraham Lincoln's speech
aloud which he delivered in Cooper Institute, New York, last evening,
under the auspices of the Republican Club.He was escorted to the
platform by David Dudley Field and introduced by William Cullen Bryant.The _New York Times_ called him "a noted political exhorter and Prairie
orator."It was a thrilling talk and must have stirred men's souls._April_ 1.--Aunt Ann was over to see us yesterday and she said she made
a visit the day before out at Mrs.Phelps and
Miss Eliza Chapin also went and they enjoyed talking over old times when
they were young.Maggie Gorham is going to be married on the 25th to Mr.She always said she would not marry a farmer and
would not live in a cobblestone house and now she is going to do both,
for Mr.Benedict has bought the farm near theirs and it has a
cobblestone house.We have always thought her one of the jolliest and
prettiest of the older set of young ladies._June._--James writes that he has seen the Prince of Wales in New York.He was up on the roof of the Continental Fire Insurance building, out on
the cornice, and looked down on the procession.Afterwards there was a
reception for the Prince at the University Law School and James saw him
close by.He says he has a very pleasant youthful face.There was a ball
given for him one evening in the Academy of Music and there were 3,000
present.The ladies who danced with him will never forget it.They say
that he enters into every diversion which is offered to him with the
greatest tact and good nature, and when he visited Mount Vernon he
showed great reverence for the memory of George Washington.He attended
a literary entertainment in Boston, where Longfellow, Holmes, Emerson,
Thoreau, and other Americans of distinction were presented to him.He
will always be a favorite in America.Annie Granger asked Anna and me to come over to her house
and see her baby.We were very eager to go and wanted to hold it and
carry it around the room.She was willing but asked us if we had any
pins on us anywhere.She said she had the nurse sew the baby's clothes
on every morning so that if she cried she would know whether it was
pains or pins.We said we had no pins on us, so we stayed quite a while
and held little Miss Hattie to our heart's content.She is named for her
aunt, Hattie Granger.Anna says she thinks Miss Martha Morse will give
medals to her and Mary Daggett for being the most meddlesome girls in
school, judging from the number of times she has spoken to them to-day.Anna is getting to be a regular punster, although I told her that
Blair's Rhetoric says that punning is not the highest kind of wit.Morse met us coming from school in the rain and said it would not hurt
us as we were neither sugar nor salt.Anna said, "No, but we are
'lasses."Grandmother has been giving us sulphur and molasses for the
purification of the blood and we have to take it three mornings and then
skip three mornings.This morning Anna commenced going through some sort
of gymnastics and Grandmother asked her what she was doing, and she said
it was her first morning to skip.Abbie Clark had a large tea-party this afternoon and evening--Seminary
girls and a few Academy boys.We had a fine supper and then played
games.Abbie gave us one which is a test of memory and we tried to learn
it from her but she was the only one who could complete it.I can write
it down, but not say it:

A good fat hen.Three plump partridges, two ducks and a good fat hen.Four squawking wild geese, three plump partridges, etc.Six pairs of Don Alfonso's tweezers.Seven hundred rank and file Macedonian horsemen drawn up in line of
battle.Eight cages of heliogabalus sparrow kites.Nine sympathetical, epithetical, categorical propositions.Eleven flat bottom fly boats sailing between Madagascar and Mount
Palermo.Twelve European dancing masters, sent to teach the Egyptian mummies how
to dance, against Hercules' wedding day.Abbie says it was easier to learn than the multiplication table.They
wanted some of us to recite and Abbie Clark gave us Lowell's poem, "John
P. Robinson, he, says the world'll go right if he only says Gee!"I gave
another of Lowell's poems, "The Courtin'."Julia Phelps had her guitar
with her by request and played and sang for us very sweetly.Fred
Harrington went home with her and Theodore Barnum with me._Sunday._--Frankie Richardson asked me to go with her to teach a class
in the  Sunday School on Chapel Street this afternoon.I asked
Grandmother if I could go and she said she never noticed that I was
particularly interested in the <DW52> race and she said she thought I
only wanted an excuse to get out for a walk Sunday afternoon.However,
she said I could go just this once.When we got up as far as the
Academy, Mr.Noah T. Clarke's brother, who is one of the teachers, came
out and Frank said he led the singing at the Sunday School and she said
she would give me an introduction to him, so he walked up with us and
home again.Grandmother said that when she saw him opening the gate for
me, she understood my zeal in missionary work."The dear little lady,"
as we often call her, has always been noted for her keen discernment and
wonderful sagacity and loses none of it as she advances in years.Some
one asked Anna the other day if her Grandmother retained all her
faculties and Anna said, "Yes, indeed, to an alarming degree."Grandmother knows that we think she is a perfect angel even if she does
seem rather strict sometimes.Whether we are 7 or 17 we are children to
her just the same, and the Bible says, "Children obey your parents in
the Lord for this is right."We are glad that we never will seem old to
her.I had the same company home from church in the evening._Monday._--This morning the cook went to early mass and Anna told
Grandmother she would bake the pancakes for breakfast if she would let
her put on gloves.She would not let her, so Hannah baked the cakes.I
was invited to Mary Paul's to supper to-night and drank the first cup of
tea I ever drank in my life.I had a very nice time and Johnnie Paul
came home with me.Imogen Power and I went down together Friday afternoon to buy me a
Meteorology.We are studying that and Watts on the Mind, instead of
Philosophy._Tuesday._--I went with Fanny Gaylord to see Mrs.Callister at the hotel
to-night.She is so interested in all that we tell her, just like "one
of the girls."[Illustration: The Old Canandaigua Academy]

I was laughing to-day when I came in from the street and Grandmother
asked me what amused me so.Putnam on
the street and she looked so immense and he so minute I couldn't help
laughing at the contrast.Grandmother said that size was not everything,
and then she quoted Cowper's verse:

    "Were I so tall to reach the skies or grasp the ocean in a span,
    I must be measured by my soul, the mind is the stature of the man."_Friday._--We went to Monthly Concert of prayer for Foreign Missions
this evening.I told Grandmother that I thought it was not very
interesting.Judge Taylor read the _Missionary Herald_ about the
Madagascans and the Senegambians and the Terra del Fuegans and then
Deacon Tyler prayed and they sang "From Greenland's Icy Mountains" and
took up a collection and went home.She said she was afraid I did not
listen attentively.I don't think I did strain every nerve.I believe
Grandmother will give her last cent to Missions if the Boards get into
worse straits than they are now.In Latin class to-day Anna translated the phrase Deo Volente "with
violence," and Mr.Tyler, who always enjoys a joke, laughed so, we
thought he would fall out of his chair.He evidently thought it was the
best one he had heard lately._November_ 21.--Aunt Ann gave me a sewing bird to screw on to the table
to hold my work instead of pinning it to my knee.Grandmother tells us
when we sew or read not to get everything around us that we will want
for the next two hours because it is not healthy to sit in one position
so long.She wants us to get up and "stir around."Anna does not need
this advice as much as I do for she is always on what Miss Achert calls
the "qui vive."I am trying to make a sofa pillow out of little pieces
of silk.You have to cut pieces of paper into
octagonal shape and cover them with silk and then sew them together,
over and over.They are beautiful, with bright colors, when they are
done.There was a hop at the hotel last night and some of the girls went
and had an elegant time.Hiram Metcalf came here this morning to
have Grandmother sign some papers.He always looks very dignified, and
Anna and I call him "the deed man."We tried to hear what he said to
Grandmother after she signed her name but we only heard something about
"fear or compulsion" and Grandmother said "yes."Grandfather took us down street to-day to see the new Star
Building.It was the town house and he bought it and got Mr.Warren
Stoddard of Hopewell to superintend cutting it in two and moving the
parts separately to Coach Street.When it was completed the shout went
up from the crowd, "Hurrah for Thomas Beals, the preserver of the old
Court House."No one but Grandfather thought it could be done._December._--I went with the girls to the lake to skate this afternoon.Johnson, the <DW52> barber, is the best skater in town.He can
skate forwards and backwards and cut all sorts of curlicues, although he
is such a heavy man.He is going to Liberia and there his skates won't
do him any good.I wish he would give them to me and also his skill to
use them.Some one asked me to sit down after I got home and I said I
preferred to stand, as I had been sitting down all the afternoon!Gus
Coleman took a load of us sleigh-riding this evening.Of course he had
Clara Willson sit on the front seat with him and help him drive._Thursday._--We had a special meeting of our society this evening at
Mary Wheeler's and invited the gentlemen and had charades and general
good time.Gillette and Horace Finley made a great deal of fun for
us.Gillette into the Dorcas Society, which consists in
seating the candidate in a chair and propounding some very solemn
questions and then in token of desire to join the society, you ask him
to open his mouth very wide for a piece of cake which you swallow,
yourself, instead!We went to a concert at the Seminary this evening.Miss Mollie Bull sang
"Coming Through the Rye" and Miss Lizzie Bull sang "Annie Laurie" and
"Auld Lang Syne."Jennie Lind, herself, could not have done better._December_ 15.--Alice Jewett, Emma Wheeler and Anna are in Mrs.Worthington's Sunday School class and as they have recently united with
the church, she thought they should begin practical Christian work by
distributing tracts among the neglected classes.So this afternoon they
ran away from school to begin the good work.It was so bright and
pleasant, they thought a walk to the lake would be enjoyable and they
could find a welcome in some humble home.The girls wanted Anna to be
the leader, but she would only promise that if something pious came into
her mind, she would say it.They knocked at a door and were met by a
smiling mother of twelve children and asked to come in.They sat down
feeling somewhat embarrassed, but spying a photograph album on the
table, they became much interested, while the children explained the
pictures.Finally Anna felt that it was time to do something, so when no
one was looking, she slipped under one of the books on the table, three
tracts entitled "Consolation for the Bereaved," "Systematic Benevolence"
and "The Social Evils of dancing, card playing and theater-going."Then
they said goodbye to their new friends and started on.They decided not
to do any more pastoral work until another day, but enjoyed the outing
very much._Christmas._--We all went to Aunt Mary Carr's to dinner excepting
Grandmother, and in the evening we went to see some tableaux at Dr.We were very much pleased with
the entertainment.del Pratt, one of the patients,
said every time, "What next!"Grandfather was requested to add his picture to the gallery of portraits
of eminent men for the Court Room, so he has had it painted.An artist
by the name of Green, who lives in town, has finished it after numerous
sittings and brought it up for our approval.We like it but we do not
think it is as good looking as he is.No one could really satisfy us
probably, so we may as well try to be suited.Clarke could take Sunday night supper with us
and she said she was afraid he did not know the catechism.I asked him
Friday night and he said he would learn it on Saturday so that he could
answer every third question any way.1861

_March_ 4, 1861.--President Lincoln was inaugurated to-day._March_ 5.--I read the inaugural address aloud to Grandfather this
evening.He dwelt with such pathos upon the duty that all, both North
and South, owe to the Union, it does not seem as though there could be
war!_April._--We seem to have come to a sad, sad time.The Bible says, "A
man's worst foes are those of his own household."The whole United
States has been like one great household for many years."United we
stand, divided we fall!"has been our watchword, but some who should
have been its best friends have proven false and broken the bond.Men
are taking sides, some for the North, some for the South.Hot words and
fierce looks have followed, and there has been a storm in the air for a
long time._April_ 15.--The storm has broken upon us.The Confederates fired on
Fort Sumter, just off the coast of South Carolina, and forced her on
April 14 to haul down the flag and surrender.President Lincoln has
issued a call for 75,000 men and many are volunteering to go all around
us._May,_ 1861.--Many of the young men are going from Canandaigua and all
the neighboring towns.It seems very patriotic and grand when they are
singing, "It is sweet, Oh, 'tis sweet, for one's country to die," and we
hear the martial music and see the flags flying and see the recruiting
tents on the square and meet men in uniform at every turn and see train
loads of the boys in blue going to the front, but it will not seem so
grand if we hear they are dead on the battlefield, far from home.A lot
of us girls went down to the train and took flowers to the soldiers as
they were passing through and they cut buttons from their coats and gave
to us as souvenirs.We have flags on our paper and envelopes, and have
all our stationery bordered with red, white and blue.We wear little
flag pins for badges and tie our hair with red, white and blue ribbon
and have pins and earrings made of the buttons the soldiers gave us.We
are going to sew for them in our society and get the garments all cut
from the older ladies' society.They work every day in one of the rooms
of the court house and cut out garments and make them and scrape lint
and roll up bandages.They say they will provide us with all the
garments we will make.We are going to write notes and enclose them in
the garments to cheer up the soldier boys.It does not seem now as
though I could give up any one who belonged to me.The girls in our
society say that if any of the members do send a soldier to the war they
shall have a flag bed quilt, made by the society, and have the girls'
names on the stars._May_ 20.--I recited "Scott and the Veteran" to-day at school, and Mary
Field recited, "To Drum Beat and Heart Beat a Soldier Marches By"; Anna
recited "The Virginia Mother."There was a patriotic rally in Bemis Hall last night and a quartette
sang, "The Sword of Bunker Hill" and "Dixie" and "John Brown's Body Lies
a Mouldering in the Grave," and many other patriotic songs.We have one
West Point cadet, Albert M. Murray, who is in the thick of the fight,
and Charles S. Coy represents Canandaigua in the navy.[Illustration: The Ontario Female Seminary]

_June,_ 1861.--At the anniversary exercises, Rev.Samuel M. Hopkins of
Auburn gave the address.I have graduated from Ontario Female Seminary
after a five years course and had the honor of receiving a diploma from
the courtly hands of General John A. Granger.I am going to have it
framed and handed down to my grandchildren as a memento, not exactly of
sleepless nights and midnight vigils, but of rising betimes, at what
Anna calls the crack of dawn.She likes that expression better than
daybreak.I heard her reciting in the back chamber one morning about 4
o'clock and listened at the door.She was saying in the most nonchalant
manner: "Science and literature in England were fast losing all traces
of originality, invention was discouraged, research unvalued and the
examination of nature proscribed.It seemed to be generally supposed
that the treasure accumulated in the preceding ages was quite sufficient
for all national purposes and that the only duty which authors had to
perform was to reproduce what had thus been accumulated, adorned with
all the graces of polished style.Tameness and monotony naturally result
from a slavish adherence to all arbitrary rules and every branch of
literature felt this blighting influence.History, perhaps, was in some
degree an exception, for Hume, Robertson and more especially Gibbon,
exhibited a spirit of original investigation which found no parallel
among their contemporaries."I looked in and asked her where her book
was, and she said she left it down stairs.She has "got it" all right, I
am sure.We helped decorate the seminary chapel for two days.Our motto
was, "Still achieving, still pursuing."Miss Guernsey made most of the
letters and Mr.Chubbuck put them up and he hung all the paintings.General Granger had to use his palm leaf fan all
the time, as well as the rest of us.There were six in our class, Mary
Field, Lucy Petherick, Kate Lilly, Sarah Clay, Abby Scott and myself.Abbie Clark would have been in the class, but she went to Pittsfield,
Mass., instead.General Granger said to each one of us, "It gives me
great pleasure to present you with this diploma," and when he gave Miss
Scott hers, as she is from Alabama, he said he wished it might be as a
flag of truce between the North and the South, and this sentiment was
loudly cheered.General Granger looked so handsome with his black dress
suit and ruffled shirt front and all the natural grace which belongs to
him.The sheepskin has a picture of the Seminary on it and this
inscription: "The Trustees and Faculty of the Ontario Female Seminary
hereby certify that __________ has completed the course of study
prescribed in this Institution, maintained the requisite scholarship and
commendable deportment and is therefore admitted to the graduating
honors of this Institution.President of Board, John A. Granger;
Benjamin F. Richards, Edward G. Tyler, Principals."Morse wrote
something for the paper:

"To the Editor of the Repository:

"Dear Sir--June roses, etc., make our loveliest of villages a paradise
this week.The constellations are all glorious and the stars of earth
far outshine those of the heavens.The lake shore, 'Lovers' Lane,' 'Glen
Kitty' and the 'Points' are full of romance and romancers.The yellow
moon and the blue waters and the dark green shores and the petrified
Indians, whispering stony words at the foot of Genundewah, and Squaw
Island sitting on the waves, like an enchanted grove, and 'Whalesback'
all humped up in the East and 'Devil's Lookout' rising over all, made
the 'Sleeping Beauty' a silver sea of witchery and love; and in the
cottages and palaces we ate the ambrosia and drank the nectar of the
sweet goddesses of this new and golden age."I may as well say to you, Mr.Editor, that the Ontario Female Seminary
closed yesterday and 'Yours truly' was present at the commencement.Being a bachelor I shall plead guilty and appeal to the mercy of the
Court, if indicted for undue prejudice in favor of the charming young
orators.After the report of the Examining Committee, in which the
scholarship of the young ladies was not too highly praised, came the
Latin Salutatory by Miss Clay, a most beautiful and elegant production
(that sentence, sir, applies to both salutatory and salutatorian).The
'Shadows We Cast,' by Miss Field, carried us far into the beautiful
fields of nature and art and we saw the dark, or the brilliant shades,
which our lives will cast, upon society and history.Then 'Tongues in
Trees' began to whisper most bewitchingly, and 'Books in the Running
Brooks' were opened, and 'Sermons in Stones' were preached by Miss
Richards, and this old bachelor thought if all trees would talk so well,
and every brook would babble so musically, and each precious stone would
exhort so brilliantly, as they were made to do by the 'enchantress,'
angels and dreams would henceforth be of little consequence; and whether
the orator should be called 'Tree of Beauty,' 'Minnehaha' or the
'Kohinoor' is a'vexata questio.'Hardick, 'our own,' whose hand never touches the
piano without making delicious music, and Misses Daggett and Wilson,
also 'our own,' and the musical pupils of the Institution, gave a
concert.'The Young Volunteer' was imperatively demanded, and this for
the third time during the anniversary exercises, and was sung amid
thunders of applause, 'Star of the South,' Miss Stella Scott, shining
meanwhile in all her radiant beauty.May her glorious light soon rest on
a Union that shall never more be broken.--Soberly yours,

                                                A Very Old Bachelor."_June,_ 1861.--There was a patriotic rally this afternoon on the campus
of Canandaigua Academy and we Seminary girls went.They raised a flag on
the Academy building.Coleman led the
choir and they sang "The Star Spangled Banner."Noah T. Clarke made
a stirring speech and Mr.Gideon Granger, James C. Smith and E. M. Morse
followed.Canandaigua has already raised over $7,000 for the war.Barry drills the Academy boys in military tactics on the campus every
day.Lester P. Thompson, son of "Father
Thompson," among the others.A young man asked Anna to take a drive to-day, but Grandmother was not
willing at first to let her go.She finally gave her consent, after
Anna's plea that he was so young and his horse was so gentle.Just as
they were ready to start, I heard Anna run upstairs and I heard him say,
"What an Anna!"I asked her afterwards what she went for and she said
she remembered that she had left the soap in the water.Daggett's war sermon from the 146th Psalm was wonderful.He had a stroke of paralysis two weeks
ago and for several days he has been unconscious.The choir of our
church, of which he was leader for so long, and some of the young people
came and stood around his bed and sang, "Jesus, Lover of My Soul."They
did not know whether he was conscious or not, but they thought so
because the tears ran down his cheeks from his closed eyelids, though he
could not speak or move.Daggett's text was, "The Beloved Physician."1862

_January_ 26.--We went to the Baptist Church this evening to hear Rev.A. H. Lung preach his last sermon before going into the army._February_ 17.--Glorious news from the war to-day.Fort Donelson is
taken with 1,500 rebels._February_ 21.--Our society met at Fanny Palmer's this afternoon.I went
but did not stay to tea as we were going to Madame Anna Bishop's concert
in the evening.Her voice has great
scope and she was dressed in the latest stage costume, but it took so
much material for her skirt that there was hardly any left for the
waist.[Illustration: "Old Friend Burling", Madame Anna Bishop]

_Washington's Birthday._--Patriotic services were held in the
Congregational Church this morning.Madame Anna Bishop sang, and
National songs were sung.James C. Smith read Washington's Farewell
Address.In the afternoon a party of twenty-two, young and old, took a
ride in the Seminary boat and went to Mr.Paton's on the lake shore
road.We carried flags and made it a patriotic occasion.I sat next to
Spencer F. Lincoln, a young man from Naples who is studying law in Mr.I never met him before but he told me he had
made up his mind to go to the war.It is wonderful that young men who
have brilliant prospects before them at home, will offer themselves upon
the altar of their country.There
is a picture of the flag on the envelope and underneath, "If any one
attempts to haul down the American flag shoot him on the spot.--
John A._Sunday, February_ 23.--Everybody came out to church this morning,
expecting to hear Madame Anna Bishop sing.She was not there, and an
"agent" made a "statement."The audience did not appear particularly
edified._March_ 4.--John B. Gough lectured in Bemis Hall last night and was
entertained by Governor Clark.I told Grandfather that I had an
invitation to the lecture and he asked me who from.He did not make the least objection and I was
awfully glad, because he has asked me to the whole course.Wendell
Phillips and Horace Greeley, E. H. Chapin and John G. Saxe and Bayard
Taylor are expected.John B. Gough's lecture was fine.He can make an
audience laugh as much by wagging his coat tails as some men can by
talking an hour._March_ 26.--I have been up at Laura Chapin's from 10 o'clock in the
morning until 10 at night, finishing Jennie Howell's bed quilt, as she
is to be married very soon.We
finished it at 8 p. m. and when we took it off the frames we gave three
cheers.Some of the youth of the village came up to inspect our
handiwork and see us home.Before we went Julia Phelps sang and played
on the guitar and Captain Barry also sang and we all sang together, "O!Columbia, the gem of the ocean, three cheers for the red, white and
blue."_June_ 19.--Our cousin, Ann Eliza Field, was married to-day to George B.
Bates at her home on Gibson Street.Charlie Wheeler made great fun and threw the final shower of rice as
they drove away._June._--There was great excitement in prayer meeting last night, it
seemed to Abbie Clark, Mary Field and me on the back seat where we
always sit.Several people have asked us why we sit away back there by
old Mrs.Kinney, but we tell them that she sits on the other side of the
stove from us and we like the seat, because we have occupied it so long.I presume we would see less and hear more if we sat in front.Walter Hubbell had made one of his most beautiful prayers
and Mr.Cyrus Dixon was praying, a big June bug came zipping into the
room and snapped against the wall and the lights and barely escaped
several bald heads.Anna kept dodging around in a most startling manner
and I expected every moment to see her walk out and take Emma Wheeler
with her, for if she is afraid of anything more than dogs it is June
bugs.At this crisis the bug flew out and a cat stealthily walked in.Taylor was always unpleasantly affected by the sight
of cats and we didn't know what would happen if the cat should go near
her.The cat very innocently ascended the steps to the desk and as Judge
and Mrs.Taylor always sit on the front seat, she couldn't help
observing the ambitious animal as it started to assist Dr.Daggett in
conducting the meeting.Taylor just managed to
reach the outside door before fainting away.We were glad when the
benediction was pronounced._June._--Anna and I had a serenade last night from the Academy Glee
Club, I think, as their voices sounded familiar.We were awakened by the
music, about 11 p. m., quite suddenly and I thought I would step across
the hall to the front chamber for a match to light the candle.I was
only half awake, however, and lost my bearings and stepped off the
stairs and rolled or slid to the bottom.The stairs are winding, so I
must have performed two or three revolutions before I reached my
destination.I jumped up and ran back and found Anna sitting up in bed,
laughing.She asked me where I had been and said if I had only told her
where I was going she would have gone for me.We decided not to strike a
light, but just listen to the singing.Anna said she was glad that the
leading tenor did not know how quickly I "tumbled" to the words of his
song, "O come my love and be my own, nor longer let me dwell alone," for
she thought he would be too much flattered.Grandfather came into the
hall and asked if any bones were broken and if he should send for a
doctor.We told him we guessed not, we thought we would be all right in
the morning.He thought it was Anna who fell down stairs, as he is never
looking for such exploits in me.We girls received some verses from the
Academy boys, written by Greig Mulligan, under the assumed name of Simon
Snooks.The subject was, "The Poor Unfortunate Academy Boys."We have
answered them and now I fear Mrs.Grundy will see them and imagine
something serious is going on.But she is mistaken and will find, at the
end of the session, our hearts are still in our own possession.When we were down at Sucker Brook the other afternoon we were watching
the water and one of the girls said, "How nice it would be if our lives
could run along as smoothly as this stream."I said I thought it would
be too monotonous.Laura Chapin said she supposed I would rather have an
"eddy" in mine.We went to the examination at the Academy to-day and to the gymnasium
exercises afterwards.Noah T. Clarke's brother leads them and they
do some great feats with their rings and swings and weights and ladders.We girls can do a few in the bowling alley at the Seminary._June._--I visited Eureka Lawrence in Syracuse and we attended
commencement at Hamilton College, Clinton, and saw there, James
Tunnicliff and Stewart Ellsworth of Penn Yan.I also saw Darius Sackett
there among the students and also became acquainted with a very
interesting young man from Syracuse, with the classic name of Horace
Publius Virgilius Bogue.Both of these young men are studying for the
ministry.I also saw Henry P. Cook, who used to be one of the Academy
boys, and Morris Brown, of Penn Yan.They talk of leaving college and
going to the war and so does Darius Sackett._July,_ 1862.--The President has called for 300,000 more brave men to
fill up the ranks of the fallen.We hear every day of more friends and
acquaintances who have volunteered to go._August_ 20.--The 126th Regiment, just organized, was mustered into
service at Camp Swift, Geneva.Those that I know who belong to it are
Colonel E. S. Sherrill, Lieutenant Colonel James M. Bull, Captain
Charles A. Richardson, Captain Charles M. Wheeler, Captain Ten Eyck
Munson, Captain Orin G. Herendeen, Surgeon Dr.Charles S. Hoyt, Hospital
Steward Henry T. Antes, First Lieutenant Charles Gage, Second Lieutenant
Spencer F. Lincoln, First Sergeant Morris Brown, Corporal Hollister N.
Grimes, Privates Darius Sackett, Henry Willson, Oliver Castle, William
Lamport.Hoyt wrote home: "God bless the dear ones we leave behind; and while
you try to perform the duties you owe to each other, we will try to
perform ours."We saw by the papers that the volunteers of the regiment before leaving
camp at Geneva allotted over $15,000 of their monthly pay to their
families and friends at home.One soldier sent this telegram to his
wife, as the regiment started for the front: "God bless you._August._--The New York State S. S. convention is convened here and the
meetings are most interesting.They were held in our church and lasted
three days.Hart, from New York, led the singing and Mr.Noah T. Clarke was in his element all through
the meetings.Pardee gave some fine blackboard exercises.Tousley was wheeled into the church, in his invalid
chair, and said a few words, which thrilled every one.So much
tenderness, mingled with his old time enthusiasm and love for the cause.It is the last time probably that his voice will ever be heard in
public.They closed the grand meeting with the hymn beginning:

    "Blest be the tie that binds
    Our hearts in Christian love."In returning thanks to the people of Canandaigua for their generous
entertainment, Mr.Ralph Wells facetiously said that the cost of the
convention must mean something to Canandaigua people, for the cook in
one home was heard to say, "These religiouses do eat awful!"_September_ 13.--Darius Sackett was wounded by a musket shot in the leg,
at Maryland Heights, Va., and in consequence is discharged from the
service._September._--Edgar A. Griswold of Naples is recruiting a company here
for the 148th Regiment, of which he is captain.Hiram P. Brown, Henry S.
Murray and Charles H. Paddock are officers in the company.Elnathan
W. Simmons is surgeon._September_ 22.--I read aloud to Grandfather this evening the
Emancipation Proclamation issued as a war measure by President Lincoln,
to take effect January 1, liberating over three million slaves.He
recommends to all thus set free, to labor faithfully for reasonable
wages and to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary
self-defense, and he invokes upon this act "the considerate judgment of
mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God."_November_ 21.--This is my twentieth birthday.Anna wanted to write a
poem for the occasion and this morning she handed me what she called "An
effort."She said she wrestled with it all night long and could not
sleep and this was the result:

    "One hundred years from now, Carrie dear,
    In all probability you'll not be here;
    But we'll all be in the same boat, too,
    And there'll be no one left
    To say boo hoo!"Grandfather gave me for a present a set of books called "Irving's
Catechisms on Ancient Greeks and Romans."They are four little books
bound in leather, which were presented to our mother for a prize.It is
thus inscribed on the front page, "Miss Elizabeth Beals at a public
examination of the Female Boarding School in East Bloomfield, October
15, 1825, was judged to excel the school in Reading.In testimony of
which she receives this Premium from her affectionate instructress, S.I cannot imagine Grandmother sending us away to boarding school, but I
suppose she had so many children then, she could spare one or two as
well as not.She says they sent Aunt Ann to Miss Willard's school at
Troy.She wants
to know how everything goes at the Seminary and if Anna still occupies
the front seat in the school room most of the time.She says she
supposes she is quite a sedate young lady now but she hopes there is a
whole lot of the old Anna left.William H. Lamport went down to Virginia to see his
son and found that he had just died in the hospital from measles and
pneumonia.1863

_January._--Grandmother went to Aunt Mary Carr's to tea to-night, very
much to our surprise, for she seldom goes anywhere.Anna said she was
going to keep house exactly as Grandmother did, so after supper she took
a little hot water in a basin on a tray and got the tea-towels and
washed the silver and best china but she let the ivory handles on the
knives and forks get wet, so I presume they will all turn black.Grandmother never lets her little nice things go out into the kitchen,
so probably that is the reason that everything is forty years old and
yet as good as new.She let us have the Young Ladies' Aid Society here
to supper because I am President.She came into the parlor and looked at
our basket of work, which the elder ladies cut out for us to make for
the soldiers.She had the supper table set the whole length of the
dining room and let us preside at the table.Anna made the girls laugh
so, they could hardly eat, although they said everything was splendid.They said they never ate better biscuit, preserves, or fruit cake and
the coffee was delicious.After it was over, the "dear little lady" said
she hoped we had a good time.After the girls were gone Grandmother
wanted to look over the garments and see how much we had accomplished
and if we had made them well.Mary Field made a pair of drawers with No.She said she wanted them to look fine and I am sure they did.Most of us wrote notes and put inside the garments for the soldiers in
the hospitals.Sarah Gibson Howell has had an answer to her letter.His name is
Foster--a Major.She expects him to come and see her soon.All the girls wear newspaper bustles to school now and Anna's rattled
to-day and Emma Wheeler heard it and said, "What's the news, Anna?"They
both laughed out loud and found that "the latest news from the front"
was that Miss Morse kept them both after school and they had to copy
Dictionary for an hour.I paid $3.50 to-day for
a hoop skirt.T. Barnum delivered his lecture on "The Art of Money
Getting" in Bemis Hall this evening for the benefit of the Ladies' Aid
Society, which is working for the soldiers._February._--The members of our society sympathized with General
McClellan when he was criticised by some and we wrote him the following
letter:

                                            "Canandaigua, Feb.McClellan:

"Will you pardon any seeming impropriety in our addressing you, and
attribute it to the impulsive love and admiration of hearts which see in
you, the bravest and noblest defender of our Union.We cannot resist the
impulse to tell you, be our words ever so feeble, how our love and trust
have followed you from Rich Mountain to Antietam, through all slanderous
attacks of traitorous politicians and fanatical defamers--how we have
admired, not less than your calm courage on the battlefield, your lofty
scorn of those who remained at home in the base endeavor to strip from
your brow the hard earned laurels placed there by a grateful country: to
tell further, that in your forced retirement from battlefields of the
Republic's peril, you have 'but changed your country's arms for
more,--your country's heart,'--and to assure you that so long as our
country remains to us a sacred name and our flag a holy emblem, so long
shall we cherish your memory as the defender and protector of both.We
are an association whose object it is to aid, in the only way in which
woman, alas!Our sympathies are with
them in the cause for which they have periled all--our hearts are with
them in the prayer, that ere long their beloved commander may be
restored to them, and that once more as of old he may lead them to
victory in the sacred name of the Union and Constitution."With united prayers that the Father of all may have you and yours ever
in His holy keeping, we remain your devoted partisans."The following in reply was addressed to the lady whose name was first
signed to the above:

                                               "New York, Feb.Madam--I take great pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of the very
kind letter of the 13th inst., from yourself and your friends.Will you
do me the favor to say to them how much I thank them for it, and that I
am at a loss to express my gratitude for the pleasant and cheering terms
in which it is couched.Such sentiments on the part of those whose
brothers have served with me in the field are more grateful to me than
anything else can be.I feel far more than rewarded by them for all I
have tried to accomplish.--I am, Madam, with the most sincere respect
and friendship, yours very truly,

                                                    Geo._May._--A number of the teachers and pupils of the Academy have enlisted
for the war.Among them E. C. Clarke, H. C. Kirk, A. T. Wilder, Norman
K. Martin, T. C. Parkhurst, Mr.They have a tent on the square
and are enlisting men in Canandaigua and vicinity for the 4th N. Y.
Heavy Artillery.Noah T. Clarke's mother in
Naples.She had already sent three sons, Bela, William and Joseph, to
the war and she is very sad because her youngest has now enlisted.She
says she feels as did Jacob of old when he said, "I am bereaved of my
children.Joseph is not and Simeon is not and now you will take Benjamin
away."I have heard that she is a beautiful singer but she says she
cannot sing any more until this cruel war is over.I wish that I could
write something to comfort her but I feel as Mrs.Browning puts it: "If
you want a song for your Italy free, let none look at me."Our society met at Fannie Pierce's this afternoon.Her mother is an
invalid and never gets out at all, but she is very much interested in
the soldiers and in all young people, and loves to have us come in and
see her and we love to go.She enters into the plans of all of us young
girls and has a personal interest in us.We had a very good time
to-night and Laura Chapin was more full of fun than usual.Once there
was silence for a minute or two and some one said, "awful pause."Laura
said, "I guess you would have awful paws if you worked as hard as I do."We were talking about how many of us girls would be entitled to flag bed
quilts, and according to the rules, they said that, up to date, Abbie
Clark and I were the only ones.The explanation is that Captain George
N. Williams and Lieutenant E. C. Clarke are enlisted in their country's
service.Susie Daggett is Secretary and Treasurer of the Society and she
reported that in one year's time we made in our society 133 pairs of
drawers, 101 shirts, 4 pairs socks for soldiers, and 54 garments for the
families of soldiers.Abbie Clark and I had our ambrotypes taken to-day for two young braves
who are going to the war.William H. Adams is also commissioned Captain
and is going to the front._July_ 4.--The terrible battle of Gettysburg brings to Canandaigua sad
news of our soldier boys of the 126th Regiment.Colonel Sherrill was
instantly killed, also Captains Wheeler and Herendeen, Henry Willson and
Henry P. Cook.[Illustration: "Abbie Clark and I had our ambrotypes taken to-day",
"Mr.Noah T. Clark's Brother and I"]

_July_ 26.--Charlie Wheeler was buried with military honors from the
Congregational church to-day.Two companies of the 54th New York State
National Guard attended the funeral, and the church was packed,
galleries and all.It was the saddest funeral and the only one of a
soldier that I ever attended.He was killed
at Gettysburg, July 3, by a sharpshooter's bullet.He was a very bright
young man, graduate of Yale college and was practising law.He was
captain of Company K, 126th N. Y. Volunteers.Morse's lecture, "You and I": "And who has forgotten that
gifted youth, who fell on the memorable field of Gettysburg?To win a
noble name, to save a beloved country, he took his place beneath the
dear old flag, and while cannon thundered and sabers clashed and the
stars of the old Union shone above his head he went down in the shock of
battle and left us desolate, a name to love and a glory to endure.And
as we solemnly know, as by the old charter of liberty we most sacredly
swear, he was truly and faithfully and religiously

    Of all our friends the noblest,
    The choicest and the purest,
    The nearest and the dearest,
      In the field at Gettysburg.Of all the heroes bravest,
    Of soul the brightest, whitest,
    Of all the warriors greatest,
      Shot dead at Gettysburg.And where the fight was thickest,
    And where the smoke was blackest,
    And where the fire was hottest,
      On the fields of Gettysburg,
    There flashed his steel the brightest,
    There blazed his eyes the fiercest,
    There flowed his blood the reddest
      On the field of Gettysburg.O music of the waters
      That flow at Gettysburg,
    Mourn tenderly the hero,
    The rare and glorious hero,
    The loved and peerless hero,
      Who died at Gettysburg.His turf shall be the greenest,
    His roses bloom the sweetest,
    His willow droop the saddest
      Of all at Gettysburg.His memory live the freshest,
    His fame be cherished longest,
    Of all the holy warriors,
      Who fell at Gettysburg.These were patriots, these were our jewels.And of every soldier who has fallen in this war his friends may
write just as lovingly as you and I may do of those to whom I pay my
feeble tribute."_August,_ 1863.--The U. S. Sanitary Commission has been organized.W. Fitch Cheney to Gettysburg with supplies for the
sick and wounded and he took seven assistants with him.Home bounty was
brought to the tents and put into the hands of the wounded soldiers._August_ 12.--Lucilla Field was married in our church to-day to Rev.I always thought she was cut out for a minister's wife.Jennie
Draper cried herself sick because Lucilla, her Sunday School teacher, is
going away._October_ 8.--News came to-day of the death of Lieutenant Hiram Brown.He died of fever at Portsmouth, only little more than a year after he
went away._November_ 1.--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery is stationed at Fort
Hamilton, N. Y. harbor.Uncle Edward has invited me down to New York to
spend a month!Grandfather says that I can go and Miss
Rosewarne is beginning a new dress for me to-day._November_ 6.--We were saddened to-day by news of the death of Augustus
Torrey Wilder in the hospital at Fort Ethan Allen.Grandfather and I
came from Canandaigua yesterday.We were
met by a military escort of "one" at Albany and consequently came
through more safely, I suppose.James met us at 42d Street Grand Central
Station.He lives at Uncle Edward's; attends to all of his legal
business and is his confidential clerk.They
are very stylish and grand but I don't mind that.Aunt Emily is reserved
and dignified but very kind.People do not pour their tea or coffee into
their saucers any more to cool it, but drink it from the cup, and you
must mind and not leave your teaspoon in your cup.Morris K. Jesup lives right across the
street and I see him every day, as he is a friend of Uncle Edward.Grandfather has gone back home and left me in charge of friends "a la
militaire" and others._November_ 15.--"We" went out to Fort Hamilton to-day and are going to
Blackwell's Island to-morrow and to many other places of interest down
the Bay.Soldiers are everywhere and I feel quite important, walking
around in company with blue coat and brass buttons--very becoming style
of dress for men and the military salute at every turn is what one reads
about._Sunday_.--Went to Broadway Tabernacle to church to-day and heard Rev.Abbie Clark is visiting her sister, Mrs.Fred
Thompson, and sat a few seats ahead of us in church.We also saw Henrietta Francis Talcott, who was a "Seminary
girl."She wants me to come to see her in her New York home._November_ 19.--We wish we were at Gettysburg to-day to hear President
Lincoln's and Edward Everett's addresses at the dedication of the
National Cemetery.We will read them in to-morrow's papers, but it will
not be like hearing them._Author's Note,_ 1911.--Forty-eight years have elapsed since Lincoln's
speech was delivered at the dedication of the Soldiers' Cemetery at
Gettysburg.So eloquent and remarkable was his utterance that I believe
I am correct in stating that every word spoken has now been translated
into all known languages and is regarded as one of the World Classics.The same may be said of Lincoln's letter to the mother of five sons lost
in battle.I make no apology for inserting in this place both the speech
and the letter.Whitelaw Reid, the American Ambassador to Great
Britain, in an address on Lincoln delivered at the University of
Birmingham in December, 1910, remarked in reference to this letter,
"What classic author in our common English tongue has surpassed that?"and next may I ask, "What English or American orator has on a similar
occasion surpassed this address on the battlefield of Gettysburg?""Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this
continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a
great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated, can long endure.We are met on a great battlefield of
that war.We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final
resting place for those who gave their lives that that nation might
live.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But in
a larger sense we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot
hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here
have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.The
world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here--but it can
never forget what they did here.It is for us, the living, rather, to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have
thus far so nobly advanced.It is rather for us to be here dedicated to
the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full
measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve, that these dead shall
not have died in vain--that this nation under God shall have a new birth
of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people and for the
people, shall not perish from the earth."It was during the dark days of the war that he wrote this simple letter
of sympathy to a bereaved mother:--

"I have been shown, in the files of the War Department, a statement that
you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of
battle.I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which
should attempt to beguile you from your grief for a loss so overwhelming,
but I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation which may be
found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.I pray that our
Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave
you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn
pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the
altar of Freedom."John went to the hallway._November_ 21.--Abbie Clark and her cousin Cora came to call and invited
me and her soldier cousin to come to dinner to-night, at Mrs.He will be here this afternoon and I will give him the
invitation._November_ 22.--We had a delightful visit.Thompson took us up into
his den and showed us curios from all over the world and as many
pictures as we would find in an art gallery._Friday_.--Last evening Uncle Edward took a party of us, including Abbie
Clark, to Wallack's Theater to see "Rosedale," which is having a great
run.I enjoyed it and told James it was the best play I ever "heard."He
said I must not say that I "heard" a play.I told James that I heard of a young girl who went abroad and on her
return some one asked her if she saw King Lear and she said, no, he was
sick all the time she was there!I just loved the play last night and
laughed and cried in turn, it seemed so real.I don't know what
Grandmother will say, but I wrote her about it and said, "When you are
with the Romans, you must do as the Romans do."I presume she will say
"that is not the way you were brought up."_December_ 7.--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery has orders to move to
Fort Ethan Allen, near Washington, and I have orders to return to
Canandaigua.I have enjoyed the five weeks very much and as "the
soldier" was on parole most of the time I have seen much of interest in
the city.Uncle Edward says that he has lived here forty years but has
never visited some of the places that we have seen, so he told me when I
mentioned climbing to the top of Trinity steeple.Canandaigua, _December_ 8.--Home again.I had military attendance as far
as Paterson, N. J., and came the rest of the way with strangers.Not
caring to talk I liked it just as well.When I said good bye I could not
help wondering whether it was for years, or forever.This cruel war is
terrible and precious lives are being sacrificed and hearts broken every
day._Christmas Eve,_ 1863.--Sarah Gibson Howell was married to Major Foster
this evening.It was a
beautiful wedding and we all enjoyed it.Some time ago I asked her to
write in my album and she sewed a lock of her black curling hair on the

Arnold, a lovely girl.1864

_April_ 1.--Grandfather had decided to go to New York to attend the fair
given by the Sanitary Commission, and he is taking two immense books,
which are more than one hundred years old, to present to the Commission,
for the benefit of the war fund._April_ 18.--Grandfather returned home to-day, unexpectedly to us.I
knew he was sick when I met him at the door.He had traveled all night
alone from New York, although he said that a stranger, a fellow
passenger, from Ann Arbor, Mich., on the train noticed that he was
suffering and was very kind to him.He said he fell in his room at
Gramercy Park Hotel in the night, and his knee was very painful.Cheney and he said the hurt was a serious one and needed
most careful attention.I was invited to a spelling school at Abbie
Clark's in the evening and Grandmother said that she and Anna would take
care of Grandfather till I got back, and then I could sit up by him the
rest of the night.We spelled down and had quite a merry time.Major C.
S. Aldrich had escaped from prison and was there.He came home with me,
as my soldier is down in Virginia._April_ 19.--Grandfather is much worse.Lightfoote has come to
stay with us all the time and we have sent for Aunt Glorianna._April_ 20.--Grandfather dictated a letter to-night to a friend of his
in New York.After I had finished he asked me if I had mended his
gloves.I said no, but I would have them ready when he wanted them.he looks so sick I fear he will never wear his gloves
again._May_ 16.--I have not written in my diary for a month and it has been
the saddest month of my life.He was
buried May 2, just two weeks from the day that he returned from New
York.We did everything for him that could be done, but at the end of
the first week the doctors saw that he was beyond all human aid.Uncle
Thomas told the doctors that they must tell him.He was much surprised
but received the verdict calmly.He said "he had no notes out and
perhaps it was the best time to go."He had taught us how to live and he
seemed determined to show us how a Christian should die.He said he
wanted "Grandmother and the children to come to him and have all the
rest remain outside."When we came into the room he said to Grandmother,
"Do you know what the doctors say?"She bowed her head, and then he
motioned for her to come on one side and Anna and me on the other and
kneel by his bedside.He placed a hand upon us and upon her and said to
her, "All the rest seem very much excited, but you and I must be
composed."Then he asked us to say the 23d Psalm, "The Lord is my
Shepherd," and then all of us said the Lord's Prayer together after
Grandmother had offered a little prayer for grace and strength in this
trying hour.Then he said, "Grandmother, you must take care of the
girls, and, girls, you must take care of Grandmother."We felt as though
our hearts would break and were sure we never could be happy again.During the next few days he often spoke of dying and of what we must do
when he was gone.Once when I was sitting by him he looked up and smiled
and said, "You will lose all your roses watching over me."A good many
business men came in to see him to receive his parting blessing.The two
McKechnie brothers, Alexander and James, came in together on their way
home from church the Sunday before he died.He lived until Saturday, the 30th, and in the morning he said, "Open the
door wide."We did so and he said, "Let the King of Glory enter in."Very soon after he said, "I am going home to Paradise," and then sank
into that sleep which on this earth knows no waking.I sat by the window
near his bed and watched the rain beat into the grass and saw the
peonies and crocuses and daffodils beginning to come up out of the
ground and I thought to myself, I shall never see the flowers come up
again without thinking of these sad, sad days.He was buried Monday
afternoon, May 2, from the Congregational church, and Dr.Daggett
preached a sermon from a favorite text of Grandfather's, "I shall die in
my nest."James and John came and as we stood with dear Grandmother and
all the others around his open grave and heard Dr.Daggett say in his
beautiful sympathetic voice, "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to
dust," we felt that we were losing our best friend; but he told us that
we must live for Grandmother and so we will.The next Sabbath, Anna and I were called out of church by a messenger,
who said that Grandmother was taken suddenly ill and was dying.When we
reached the house attendants were all about her administering
restoratives, but told us she was rapidly sinking.I asked if I might
speak to her and was reluctantly permitted, as they thought best not to
disturb her.I sat down by her and with tearful voice said,
"Grandmother, don't you know that Grandfather said we were to care for
you and you were to care for us and if you die we cannot do as
Grandfather said?"She opened her eyes and looked at me and said
quietly, "Dry your eyes, child, I shall not die to-day or to-morrow."Inscribed in my diary:

    "They are passing away, they are passing away,
    Not only the young, but the aged and gray.Their places are vacant, no longer we see
    The armchair in waiting, as it used to be.The hat and the coat are removed from the nail,
    Where for years they have hung, every day without fail.The shoes and the slippers are needed no more,
    Nor kept ready waiting, as they were of yore,
    The desk which he stood at in manhood's fresh prime,
    Which now shows the marks of the finger of time,
    The bright well worn keys, which were childhood's delight
    Unlocking the treasures kept hidden from sight.These now are mementoes of him who has passed,
    Who stands there no longer, as we saw him last.Other hands turn the keys, as he did, before,
    Other eyes will his secrets, if any, explore.The step once elastic, but feeble of late,
    No longer we watch for through doorway or gate,
    Though often we turn, half expecting to see,
    The loved one approaching, but ah!We miss him at all times, at morn when we meet,
    For the social repast, there is one vacant seat.At noon, and at night, at the hour of prayer,
    Our hearts fill with sadness, one voice is not there.Yet not without hope his departure we mourn,
    In faith and in trust, all our sorrows are borne,
    Borne upward to Him who in kindness and love
    Sends earthly afflictions to draw us above.Thus hoping and trusting, rejoicing, we'll go,
    Both upward and onward through weal and through woe
    'Till all of life's changes and conflicts are past
    Beyond the dark river, to meet him at last."In Memoriam

Thomas Beals died in Canandaigua, N. Y., on Saturday, April 30th, 1864,
in the 81st year of his age.Beals was born in Boston, Mass.,
November 13, 1783.He came to this village in October, 1803, only 14 years after the first
settlement of the place.He was married in March, 1805, to Abigail
Field, sister of the first pastor of the Congregational church here.Her
family, in several of its branches, have since been distinguished in the
ministry, the legal profession, and in commercial enterprise.Living to a good old age, and well known as one of our most wealthy and
respected citizens, Mr.Beals is another added to the many examples of
successful men who, by energy and industry, have made their own fortune.On coming to this village, he was teacher in the Academy for a time, and
afterward entered into mercantile business, in which he had his share of
vicissitude.When the Ontario Savings Bank was established, 1832, he
became the Treasurer, and managed it successfully till the institution
ceased, in 1835, with his withdrawal.In the meantime he conducted,
also, a banking business of his own, and this was continued until a week
previous to his death, when he formally withdrew, though for the last
five years devolving its more active duties upon his son.As a banker, his sagacity and fidelity won for him the confidence and
respect of all classes of persons in this community.The business
portion of our village is very much indebted to his enterprise for the
eligible structures he built that have more than made good the losses
sustained by fires.More than fifty years ago he was actively concerned
in the building of the Congregational church, and also superintended the
erection of the county jail and almshouse; for many years a trustee of
Canandaigua Academy, and trustee and treasurer of the Congregational
church.At the time of his death he and his wife, who survives him, were
the oldest members of the church, having united with it in 1807, only
eight years after its organization.Until hindered by the infirmities of
age, he was a constant attendant of its services and ever devoutly
maintained the worship of God in his family.No person has been more
generally known among all classes of our citizens.Whether at home or
abroad he could not fail to be remarked for his gravity and dignity.His
character was original, independent, and his manners remarkable for a
dignified courtesy.Our citizens were familiar with his brief, emphatic
answers with the wave of his hand.He was fond of books, a great reader,
collected a valuable number of volumes, and was happy in the use of
language both in writing and conversation.In many unusual ways he often
showed his kind consideration for the poor and afflicted, and many
persons hearing of his death gratefully recollect instances, not known
to others, of his seasonable kindness to them in trouble.In his
charities he often studied concealment as carefully as others court
display.His marked individuality of character and deportment, together
with his shrewd discernment and active habits, could not fail to leave a
distinct impression on the minds of all.For more than sixty years he transacted business in one place here, and
his long life thus teaches more than one generation the value of
sobriety, diligence, fidelity and usefulness.In his last illness he remarked to a friend that he always loved
Canandaigua; had done several things for its prosperity, and had
intended to do more.He had known his measure of affliction; only four
of eleven children survive him, but children and children's children
ministered to the comfort of his last days.Notwithstanding his years
and infirmities, he was able to visit New York, returning April 18th
quite unwell, but not immediately expecting a fatal termination.As the
final event drew near, he seemed happily prepared to meet it.He
conversed freely with his friends and neighbors in a softened and
benignant spirit, at once receiving and imparting benedictions.His end
seemed to realize his favorite citation from Job: "I shall die in my
nest."His funeral was attended on Monday in the Congregational church by a
large assembly, Dr.Daggett, the pastor, officiating on the
occasion.--Written by Dr.O. E. Daggett in 1864._May._--The 4th New York Heavy Artillery is having hard times in the
Virginia mud and rain.It is such a change from
their snug winter quarters at Fort Ethan Allen.There are 2,800 men in
the Regiment and 1,200 are sick.Charles S. Hoyt of the 126th, which
is camping close by, has come to the help of these new recruits so
kindly as to win every heart, quite in contrast to the heartlessness of
their own surgeons._June_ 22.--Captain Morris Brown, of Penn Yan, was killed to-day by a
musket shot in the head, while commanding the regiment before
Petersburg._June_ 23, 1864.--Anna graduated last Thursday, June 16, and was
valedictorian of her class.There were eleven girls in the class, Ritie
Tyler, Mary Antes, Jennie Robinson, Hattie Paddock, Lillie Masters,
Abbie Hills, Miss McNair, Miss Pardee and Miss Palmer, Miss Jasper and
Anna.The subject of her essay was "The Last Time."I will copy an
account of the exercises as they appeared in this week's village paper.A WORD FROM AN OLD MAN

"Mr.Editor:

"Less than a century ago I was traveling through this enchanted region
and accidentally heard that it was commencement week at the seminary.My venerable appearance seemed to command respect and I received
many attentions.I presented my snowy head and patriarchal beard at the
doors of the sacred institution and was admitted.I heard all the
classes, primary, secondary, tertiary, et cetera.I
rose early, dressed with much care.I affectionately pressed the hands
of my two landlords and left.When I arrived at the seminary I saw at a
glance that it was a place where true merit was appreciated.I was
invited to a seat among the dignitaries, but declined.I am a modest
man, I always was.I recognized the benign Principals of the school.You
can find no better principles in the states than in Ontario Female
Seminary.After the report of the committee a very lovely young lady
arose and saluted us in Latin.As she proceeded, I thought the grand
old Roman tongue had never sounded so musically and when she pronounced
the decree, 'Richmond delenda est,' we all hoped it might be prophetic.Then followed the essays of the other young ladies and then every one
waited anxiously for 'The Last Time.'The story was
beautifully told, the adieux were tenderly spoken.We saw the withered
flowers of early years scattered along the academic ways, and the golden
fruit of scholarly culture ripening in the gardens of the future.Enchanted by the sorrowful eloquence, bewildered by the melancholy
brilliancy, I sent a rosebud to the charming valedictorian and wandered
out into the grounds.I went to the concert in the evening and was
pleased and delighted.I shall return next year unless
the gout carries me off.I hope I shall hear just such beautiful music,
see just such beautiful faces and dine at the same excellent hotel.Anna closed her valedictory with these words:

"May we meet at one gate when all's over;
  The ways they are many and wide,
And seldom are two ways the same;
  Side by side may we stand
At the same little door when all's done.The ways they are many,
    The end it is one."_July_ 10.--We have had word of the death of Spencer F. Lincoln._August._--The New York State S. S. Convention was held in Buffalo and
among others Fanny Gaylord, Mary Field and myself attended.We had a
fine time and were entertained at the home of Mr.Her
mother is living with her, a dear old lady who was Judge Atwater's
daughter and used to go to school to Grandfather Beals.John went back to the kitchen.We went with
other delegates on an excursion to Niagara Falls and went into the
express office at the R. R. station to see Grant Schley, who is express
agent there.He said it seemed good to see so many home faces._September_ 1.--My war letters come from Georgetown Hospital now.Noah T. Clarke is very anxious and sends telegrams to Andrew Chesebro
every day to go and see his brother._September_ 30.--To-day the "Benjamin" of the family reached home under
the care of Dr.J. Byron Hayes, who was sent to Washington after him.Noah T. Clarke's to see him and found him just a shadow
of his former self.However, "hope springs eternal in the human breast"
and he says he knows he will soon be well again.This is his thirtieth
birthday and it is glorious that he can spend it at home.Noah T. Clarke accompanied his brother to-day to the
old home in Naples and found two other soldier brothers, William and
Joseph, had just arrived on leave of absence from the army so the
mother's heart sang "Praise God from whom all blessings flow."The
fourth brother has also returned to his home in Illinois, disabled._November._--They are holding Union Revival Services in town now.One
evangelist from out of town said he would call personally at the homes
and ask if all were Christians.Anna told Grandmother if he came here
she should tell him about her.Grandmother said we must each give an
account for ourselves.Anna said she should tell him about her little
Grandmother anyway.We saw him coming up the walk about 11 a.m.and Anna
went to the door and asked him in.They sat down in the parlor and he
remarked about the pleasant weather and Canandaigua such a beautiful
town and the people so cultured.She said yes, she found the town every
way desirable and the people pleasant, though she had heard it remarked
that strangers found it hard to get acquainted and that you had to have
a residence above the R. R. track and give a satisfactory answer as to
who your Grandfather was, before admittance was granted to the best
society.He asked
her how long she had lived here and she told him nearly all of her brief
existence!She said if he had asked her how old she was she would have
told him she was so young that Will Adams last May was appointed her
guardian.He asked how many there were in the family and she said her
Grandmother, her sister and herself.He said, "They are Christians, I
suppose.""Yes," she said, "my sister is a S. S. teacher and my
Grandmother was born a Christian, about 80 years ago."Anna said she would have to be excused
as she seldom saw company.Mary moved to the bathroom.When he arose to go he said, "My dear young
lady, I trust that you are a Christian.""Mercy yes," she said, "years
ago."He said he was very glad and hoped she would let her light shine.She said that was what she was always doing--that the other night at a
revival meeting she sang every verse of every hymn and came home feeling
as though she had herself personally rescued by hand at least fifty
"from sin and the grave."He smiled approvingly and bade her good bye.She told Grandmother she presumed he would say "he had not found so
great faith, no not in Israel."George Wilson leads and
instructs us on the Sunday School lesson for the following Sunday.Wilson knows
Barnes' notes, Cruden's Concordance, the Westminster Catechism and the
Bible from beginning to end.1865

_March_ 5.--I have just read President Lincoln's second inaugural
address.It only takes five minutes to read it but, oh, how much it
contains._March_ 20.--Hardly a day passes that we do not hear news of Union
victories.Every one predicts that the war is nearly at an end._March_ 29.--An officer arrived here from the front yesterday and he
said that, on Saturday morning, shortly after the battle commenced which
resulted so gloriously for the Union in front of Petersburg, President
Lincoln, accompanied by General Grant and staff, started for the
battlefield, and reached there in time to witness the close of the
contest and the bringing in of the prisoners.His presence was
immediately recognized and created the most intense enthusiasm.He
afterwards rode over the battlefield, listened to the report of General
Parke to General Grant, and added his thanks for the great service
rendered in checking the onslaught of the rebels and in capturing so
many of their number.I read this morning the order of Secretary Stanton
for the flag raising on Fort Sumter.It reads thus: "War department,
Adjutant General's office, Washington, March 27th, 1865, General Orders
No.Ordered, first: That at the hour of noon, on the 14th day of
April, 1865, Brevet Major General Anderson will raise and plant upon the
ruins of Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor, the same U. S. Flag which
floated over the battlements of this fort during the rebel assault, and
which was lowered and saluted by him and the small force of his command
when the works were evacuated on the 14th day of April, 1861.Second,
That the flag, when raised be saluted by 100 guns from Fort Sumter and
by a national salute from every fort and rebel battery that fired upon
Fort Sumter.Third, That suitable ceremonies be had upon the occasion,
under the direction of Major-General William T. Sherman, whose military
operations compelled the rebels to evacuate Charleston, or, in his
absence, under the charge of Major-General Q. A. Gillmore, commanding
the department.Among the ceremonies will be the delivery of a public
address by the Rev.Fourth, That the naval forces at
Charleston and their Commander on that station be invited to participate
in the ceremonies of the occasion.By order of the President of the
United States.E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War."_April,_ 1865.--What a month this has been.On the 6th of April Governor
Fenton issued this proclamation: "Richmond has fallen.The wicked men
who governed the so-called Confederate States have fled their capital,
shorn of their power and influence.The rebel armies have been defeated,
broken and scattered.Victory everywhere attends our banners and our
armies, and we are rapidly moving to the closing scenes of the war.Through the self-sacrifice and heroic devotion of our soldiers, the life
of the republic has been saved and the American Union preserved.I,
Reuben E. Fenton, Governor of the State of New York, do designate
Friday, the 14th of April, the day appointed for the ceremony of raising
the United States flag on Fort Sumter, as a day of Thanksgiving, prayer
and praise to Almighty God, for the signal blessings we have received at
His hands."_Saturday, April_ 8.--The cannon has fired a salute of thirty-six guns
to celebrate the fall of Richmond.This evening the streets were
thronged with men, women and children all acting crazy as if they had
not the remotest idea where they were or what they were doing.Atwater
block was beautifully lighted and the band was playing in front of it.On the square they fired guns, and bonfires were lighted in the streets.Clark's house was lighted from the very garret and they had a
transparency in front, with "Richmond" on it, which Fred Thompson made.We didn't even light "our other candle," for Grandmother said she
preferred to keep Saturday night and pity and pray for the poor
suffering, wounded soldiers, who are so apt to be forgotten in the hour
of victory._Sunday Evening, April_ 9.--There were great crowds at church this
morning.Daggett's text was from Prov.18: 10: "The name of the Lord
is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe."They sang hymns relating to our country and Dr.Daggett's prayers were full of thanksgiving.Noah T. Clarke had the
chapel decorated with flags and opened the Sunday School by singing,
"Marching On," "My Country, 'tis of Thee," "The Star Spangled Banner,"
"Glory, Hallelujah," etc.H. Lamport talked very pleasantly and
paid a very touching tribute to the memory of the boys, who had gone out
to defend their country, who would never come "marching home again."He
lost his only son, 18 years old (in the 126th), about two years ago.I
sat near Mary and Emma Wheeler and felt so sorry for them._Monday Morning, April_ 10.--"Whether I am in the body, or out of the
body, I know not, but one thing I know," Lee has surrendered!and all
the people seem crazy in consequence.The bells are ringing, boys and
girls, men and women are running through the streets wild with
excitement; the flags are all flying, one from the top of our church,
and such a "hurrah boys" generally, I never dreamed of.We were quietly
eating our breakfast this morning about 7 o'clock, when our church bell
commenced to ring, then the Methodist bell, and now all the bells in
town are ringing.Noah T. Clarke ran by, all excitement, and I don't
believe he knows where he is.Aldrich
passing, so I rushed to the window and he waved his hat.I raised the
window and asked him what was the matter?He came to the front door
where I met him and he almost shook my hand off and said, "The war is
over.We have Lee's surrender, with his own name signed."I am going
down town now, to see for myself, what is going on.Later--I have
returned and I never saw such performances in my life.Every man has a
bell or a horn, and every girl a flag and a little bell, and every one
is tied with red, white and blue ribbons.I am going down town again
now, with my flag in one hand and bell in the other and make all the
noise I can.Noah T. Clarke and other leading citizens are riding
around on a dray cart with great bells in their hands ringing them as
hard as they can.The latest musical
instrument invented is called the "Jerusalem fiddle."Some boys put a
dry goods box upon a cart, put some rosin on the edge of the box and
pulled a piece of timber back and forth across it, making most unearthly
sounds.They drove through all the streets, Ed Lampman riding on the
horse and driving it._Monday evening, April_ 10.--I have been out walking for the last hour
and a half, looking at the brilliant illuminations, transparencies and
everything else and I don't believe I was ever so tired in my life.The
bells have not stopped ringing more than five minutes all day and every
one is glad to see Canandaigua startled out of its propriety for once.Every yard of red, white and blue ribbon in the stores has been sold,
also every candle and every flag.One society worked hard all the
afternoon making transparencies and then there were no candles to put in
to light them, but they will be ready for the next celebration when
peace is proclaimed.The Court House, Atwater Block, and hotel have
about two dozen candles in each window throughout, besides flags and
mottoes of every description.It is certainly the best impromptu display
ever gotten up in this town."Victory is Grant-ed," is in large red,
white and blue letters in front of Atwater Block.The speeches on the
square this morning were all very good.Daggett commenced with
prayer, and such a prayer, I wish all could have heard it.Francis
Granger, E. G. Lapham, Judge Smith, Alexander Howell, Noah T. Clarke and
others made speeches and we sang "Old Hundred" in conclusion, and Rev.Hibbard dismissed us with the benediction.Noah T. Clarke, but he told me to be careful and not hurt him, for he
blistered his hands to-day ringing that bell.He says he is going to
keep the bell for his grandchildren.Between the speeches on the square
this morning a song was called for and Gus Coleman mounted the steps and
started "John Brown" and all the assembly joined in the chorus, "Glory,
Hallelujah."This has been a never to be forgotten day._April_ 15.--The news came this morning that our dear president, Abraham
Lincoln, was assassinated yesterday, on the day appointed for
thanksgiving for Union victories.I have felt sick over it all day and
so has every one that I have seen.All seem to feel as though they had
lost a personal friend, and tears flow plenteously.How soon has sorrow
followed upon the heels of joy!One week ago to-night we were
celebrating our victories with loud acclamations of mirth and good
cheer.Now every one is silent and sad and the earth and heavens seem
clothed in sack-cloth.The
flags are all at half mast, draped with mourning, and on every store and
dwelling-house some sign of the nation's loss is visible.Just after
breakfast this morning, I looked out of the window and saw a group of
men listening to the reading of a morning paper, and I feared from their
silent, motionless interest that something dreadful had happened, but I
was not prepared to hear of the cowardly murder of our President.And
William H. Seward, too, I suppose cannot survive his wounds.I went down town shortly after I heard the news, and it
was wonderful to see the effect of the intelligence upon everybody,
small or great, rich or poor.Every one was talking low, with sad and
anxious looks.But we know that God still reigns and will do what is
best for us all.Perhaps we're "putting our trust too much in princes,"
forgetting the Great Ruler, who alone can create or destroy, and
therefore He has taken from us the arm of flesh that we may lean more
confidingly and entirely upon Him.I trust that the men who committed
these foul deeds will soon be brought to justice._Sunday, Easter Day, April_ 16.--I went to church this morning.The
pulpit and choir-loft were covered with flags festooned with crape.Although a very disagreeable day, the house was well filled.The first
hymn sung was "Oh God our help in ages past, our hope for years to
come."Daggett's prayer, I can never forget, he alluded so
beautifully to the nation's loss, and prayed so fervently that the God
of our fathers might still be our God, through every calamity or
affliction, however severe or mysterious.All seemed as deeply affected
as though each one had been suddenly bereft of his best friend.The hymn
sung after the prayer, commenced with "Yes, the Redeemer rose."Daggett said that he had intended to preach a sermon upon the
resurrection.He read the psalm beginning, "Lord, Thou hast been our
dwelling-place in all generations."His text was "That our faith and
hope might be in God."He commenced by saying, "I feel as you feel this
morning: our sad hearts have all throbbed in unison since yesterday
morning when the telegram announced to us Abraham Lincoln is shot."He
said the last week would never be forgotten, for never had any of us
seen one come in with so much joy, that went out with so much sorrow.His whole sermon related to the President's life and death, and, in
conclusion, he exhorted us not to be despondent, for he was confident
that the ship of state would not go down, though the helmsman had
suddenly been taken away while the promised land was almost in view.He
prayed for our new President, that he might be filled with grace and
power from on High, to perform his high and holy trust.On Thursday we
are to have a union meeting in our church, but it will not be the day of
general rejoicing and thanksgiving we expected.In Sunday school the desk was draped with mourning, and
the flag at half-mast was also festooned with crape.Noah T. Clarke
opened the exercises with the hymn "He leadeth me," followed by "Though
the days are dark with sorrow," "We know not what's before us," "My days
are gliding swiftly by."Clarke said that we always meant to
sing "America," after every victory, and last Monday he was wondering if
we would not have to sing it twice to-day, or add another verse, but our
feelings have changed since then.Nevertheless he thought we had better
sing "America," for we certainly ought to love our country more than
ever, now that another, and such another, martyr, had given up his life
for it.Then he talked to the children and said that last
Friday was supposed to be the anniversary of the day upon which our Lord
was crucified, and though, at the time the dreadful deed was committed,
every one felt the day to be the darkest one the earth ever knew; yet
since then, the day has been called "Good Friday," for it was the death
of Christ which gave life everlasting to all the people.So he thought
that life would soon come out of darkness, which now overshadows us all,
and that the death of Abraham Lincoln might yet prove the nation's life
in God's own most mysterious way._Wednesday evening, April_ 19, 1865.--This being the day set for the
funeral of Abraham Lincoln at Washington, it was decided to hold the
service to-day, instead of Thursday, as previously announced in the
Congregational church.All places of business were closed and the bells
of the village churches tolled from half past ten till eleven o'clock.It is the fourth anniversary of the first bloodshed of the war at
Baltimore.It was said to-day, that while the services were being held
in the White House and Lincoln's body lay in state under the dome of the
capitol, that more than twenty-five millions of people all over the
civilized world were gathered in their churches weeping over the death
of the martyred President.We met at our church at half after ten
o'clock this morning.The bells tolled until eleven o'clock, when the
services commenced.The church was beautifully decorated with flags and
black and white cloth, wreaths, mottoes and flowers, the galleries and
all.There was a shield beneath the arch of
the pulpit with this text upon it: "The memory of the just is blessed."Under the choir-loft the picture of Abraham Lincoln
hung amid the flags and drapery.The motto, beneath the gallery, was
this text: "Know ye that the Lord He is God."The four pastors of the
place walked in together and took seats upon the platform, which was
constructed for the occasion.The choir chanted "Lord, Thou hast been
our dwelling-place in all generations," and then the Episcopal rector,
Rev.Leffingwell, read from the psalter, and Rev.Daggett
followed with prayer.Judge Taylor was then called upon for a short
address, and he spoke well, as he always does.The choir sang "God is
our refuge and our strength."_Thursday, April_ 20.--The papers are full of the account of the funeral
obsequies of President Lincoln.We take Harper's Weekly and every event
is pictured so vividly it seems as though we were eye witnesses of it
all.The picture of "Lincoln at home" is beautiful.What a dear, kind
man he was.It is a comfort to know that the assassination was not the
outcome of an organized plot of Southern leaders, but rather a
conspiracy of a few fanatics, who undertook in this way to avenge the
defeat of their cause.It is rumored that one of the conspirators has
been located._April_ 24.--Fannie Gaylord and Kate Lapham have returned from their
eastern trip and told us of attending the President's funeral in Albany,
and I had a letter from Bessie Seymour, who is in New York, saying that
she walked in the procession until half past two in the morning, in
order to see his face.They say that they never saw him in life, but in
death he looked just as all the pictures represent him.We all wear
Lincoln badges now, with pin attached.They are pictures of Lincoln upon
a tiny flag, bordered with crape.Susie Daggett has just made herself a
flag, six feet by four.Noah T. Clarke gave
one to her husband upon his birthday, April 8.I think everybody ought
to own a flag._April_ 26.--Now we have the news that J. Wilkes Booth, who shot the
President and who has been concealing himself in Virginia, has been
caught, and refusing to surrender was shot dead.It has taken just
twelve days to bring him to retribution.I am glad that he is dead if he
could not be taken alive, but it seems as though shooting was too good
for him.However, we may as well take this as really God's way, as the
death of the President, for if he had been taken alive, the country
would have been so furious to get at him and tear him to pieces the
turmoil would have been great and desperate.It may be the best way to
dispose of him.Of course, it is best, or it would not be so.Morse
called this evening and he thinks Booth was shot by a lot of cowards.The flags have been flying all day, since the news came, but all,
excepting Albert Granger, seem sorry that he was not disabled instead of
being shot dead.Albert seems able to look into the "beyond" and also to
locate departed spirits.His "latest" is that he is so glad that Booth
got to h--l before Abraham Lincoln got to Springfield.Fred Thompson went down to New York last Saturday and while stopping
a few minutes at St.Johnsville, he heard a man crowing over the death
of the President.Thompson marched up to him, collared him and
landed him nicely in the gutter.The bystanders were delighted and
carried the champion to a platform and called for a speech, which was
given.Every one who hears the story, says:
"Three cheers for F. F.The other afternoon at our society Kate Lapham wanted to divert our
minds from gossip I think, and so started a discussion upon the
respective characters of Washington and Napoleon.It was just after
supper and Laura Chapin was about resuming her sewing and she exclaimed,
"Speaking of Washington, makes me think that I ought to wash my hands,"
so she left the room for that purpose._May_ 7.--Anna and I wore our new poke bonnets to church this morning
and thought we looked quite "scrumptious," but Grandmother said after we
got home, if she had realized how unbecoming they were to us and to the
house of the Lord, she could not have countenanced them enough to have
sat in the same pew.Daggett in his
text, "It is good for us to be here."It was the first time in a month
that he had not preached about the affairs of the Nation.In the afternoon the Sacrament was administered and Rev.A. D. Eddy, D.
D., who was pastor from 1823 to 1835, was present and officiated.Deacon
Castle and Deacon Hayes passed the communion.Eddy concluded the
services with some personal memories.He said that forty-two years ago
last November, he presided upon a similar occasion for the first time in
his life and it was in this very church.He is now the only surviving
male member who was present that day, but there are six women living,
and Grandmother is one of the six.The Monthly Concert of Prayer for Missions was held in the chapel in the
evening.Daggett told us that the collection taken for missions
during the past year amounted to $500.He commended us and said it was
the largest sum raised in one year for this purpose in the twenty years
of his pastorate.Eddy then said that in contrast he would tell us
that the collection for missions the first year he was here, amounted to
$5, and that he was advised to touch very lightly upon the subject in
his appeals as it was not a popular theme with the majority of the
people.One member, he said, annexed three ciphers to his name when
asked to subscribe to a missionary document which was circulated, and
another man replied thus to an appeal for aid in evangelizing a portion
of Asia: "If you want to send a missionary to Jerusalem, Yates county, I
will contribute, but not a cent to go to the other side of the world."C. H. A. Buckley was present also and gave an interesting talk.By
way of illustration, he said he knew a small boy who had been earning
twenty-five cents a week for the heathen by giving up eating butter.The
other day he seemed to think that his generosity, as well as his
self-denial, had reached the utmost limit and exclaimed as he sat at the
table, "I think the heathen have had gospel enough, please pass the
butter."_May_ 10.--Jeff Davis was captured to-day at Irwinsville, Ga., when he
was attempting to escape in woman's apparel.Green drew a picture of
him, and Mr.We bought one as a
souvenir of the war.The big headlines in the papers this morning say, "The hunt is up.He
brandisheth a bowie-knife but yieldeth to six solid arguments.At
Irwinsville, Ga., about daylight on the 10th instant, Col.Prichard,
commanding the 4th Michigan Cavalry, captured Jeff Davis, family and
staff.They will be forwarded under strong guard without delay."The
flags have been flying all day, and every one is about as pleased over
the manner of his capture as over the fact itself.Lieutenant Hathaway,
one of the staff, is a friend of Mr.Manning Wells, and he was pretty
sure he would follow Davis, so we were not surprised to see his name
among the captured.Wells says he is as fine a horseman as he ever
saw._Monday evg., May_ 22.--I went to Teachers' meeting at Mrs.George Willson is the leader and she told
us at the last meeting to be prepared this evening to give our opinion
in regard to the repentance of Solomon before he died.We concluded that
he did repent although the Bible does not absolutely say so.Grandmother
thinks such questions are unprofitable, as we would better be repenting
of our sins, instead of hunting up Solomon's at this late day._May_ 23.--We arise about 5:30 nowadays and Anna does not like it very
well.I asked her why she was not as good natured as usual to-day and
she said it was because she got up "s'urly."She thinks Solomon must
have been acquainted with Grandmother when he wrote "She ariseth while
it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her
maidens."Patrick Burns, the "poet," who has also been our man of all
work the past year, has left us to go into Mr.He
seemed to feel great regret when he bade us farewell and told us he
never lived in a better regulated home than ours and he hoped his
successor would take the same interest in us that he had.He left one of his poems as a souvenir.It is entitled, "There will soon be an end to the war," written in
March, hence a prophecy.Morse had read it and pronounced it
"tip top."It was mostly written in capitals and I asked him if he
followed any rule in regard to their use.He said "Oh, yes, always begin
a line with one and then use your own discretion with the rest."_May_ 25.--I wish that I could have been in Washington this week, to
have witnessed the grand review of Meade's and Sherman's armies.The
newspaper accounts are most thrilling.The review commenced on Tuesday
morning and lasted two days.It took over six hours for Meade's army to
pass the grand stand, which was erected in front of the President's
house.It was witnessed by the President, Generals Grant, Meade, and
Sherman, Secretary Stanton, and many others in high authority.At ten
o'clock, Wednesday morning, Sherman's army commenced to pass in review.His men did not show the signs of hardship and suffering which marked
the appearance of the Army of the Potomac.Flags were flying everywhere and windows,
doorsteps and sidewalks were crowded with people, eager to get a view of
the grand armies.The city was as full of strangers, who had come to see
the sight, as on Inauguration Day.Very soon, all that are left of the
companies, who went from here, will be marching home, "with glad and
gallant tread."_June_ 3.--I was invited up to Sonnenberg yesterday and Lottie and Abbie
Clark called for me at 5:30 p.m., with their pony and democrat wagon.Jennie Rankine was the only other lady present and, for a wonder, the
party consisted of six gentlemen and five ladies, which has not often
been the case during the war.After supper we adjourned to the lawn and
played croquet, a new game which Mr.It is something like billiards, only a mallet is used instead of a
cue to hit the balls.I did not like it very well, because I couldn't
hit the balls through the wickets as I wanted to."We" sang all the
songs, patriotic and sentimental, that we could think of.Lyon came to call upon me to-day, before he returned to New York.I told him that I regretted that I could
not sing yesterday, when all the others did, and that the reason that I
made no attempts in that line was due to the fact that one day in
church, when I thought I was singing a very good alto, my grandfather
whispered to me, and said: "Daughter, you are off the key," and ever
since then, I had sung with the spirit and with the understanding, but
not with my voice.He said perhaps I could get some one to do my singing
for me, some day.I told him he was very kind to give me so much
encouragement.Anna went to a Y.M.C.A.meeting last evening at our
chapel and said, when the hymn "Rescue the perishing," was given out,
she just "raised her Ebenezer" and sang every verse as hard as she
could.The meeting was called in behalf of a young man who has been
around town for the past few days, with only one arm, who wants to be a
minister and sells sewing silk and needles and writes poetry during
vacation to help himself along.I have had a cough lately and
Grandmother decided yesterday to send for the doctor.He placed me in a
chair and thumped my lungs and back and listened to my breathing while
Grandmother sat near and watched him in silence, but finally she said,
"Caroline isn't used to being pounded!"The doctor smiled and said he
would be very careful, but the treatment was not so severe as it seemed.After he was gone, we asked Grandmother if she liked him and she said
yes, but if she had known of his "new-fangled" notions and that he wore
a full beard she might not have sent for him!Carr was
clean-shaven and also Grandfather and Dr.Daggett, and all of the
Grangers, she thinks that is the only proper way.What a funny little
lady she is!_June_ 8.--There have been unusual attractions down town for the past
two days.a man belonging to the
Ravel troupe walked a rope, stretched across Main street from the third
story of the Webster House to the chimney of the building opposite.He
is said to be Blondin's only rival and certainly performed some
extraordinary feats.Then
took a wheel-barrow across and returned with it backwards.He went
across blindfolded with a bag over his head.Then he attached a short
trapeze to the rope and performed all sorts of gymnastics.There were at
least 1,000 people in the street and in the windows gazing at him.Grandmother says that she thinks all such performances are wicked,
tempting Providence to win the applause of men.Nothing would induce her
to look upon such things.She is a born reformer and would abolish all
such schemes.This morning she wanted us to read the 11th chapter of
Hebrews to her, about faith, and when we had finished the forty verses,
Anna asked her what was the difference between her and Moses.Grandmother said there were many points of difference.Anna was not
found in the bulrushes and she was not adopted by a king's daughter.Anna said she was thinking how the verse read, "Moses was a proper
child," and she could not remember having ever done anything strictly
"proper" in her life.I noticed that Grandmother did not contradict her,
but only smiled._June_ 13.--Van Amburgh's circus was in town to-day and crowds attended
and many of our most highly respected citizens, but Grandmother had
other things for us to consider._June_ 16.--The census man for this town is Mr.He called
here to-day and was very inquisitive, but I think I answered all of his
questions although I could not tell him the exact amount of my property.Grandmother made us laugh to-day when we showed her a picture of the
Siamese twins, and I said, "Grandmother, if I had been their mother I
should have cut them apart when they were babies, wouldn't you?"The
dear little lady looked up so bright and said, "If I had been Mrs.Siam,
I presume I should have done just as she did."I don't believe that we
will be as amusing as she is when we are 82 years old._Saturday, July_ 8.--What excitement there must have been in Washington
yesterday over the execution of the conspirators.Surratt should have deserved hanging with the others.I saw a
picture of them all upon a scaffold and her face was screened by an
umbrella.I read in one paper that the doctor who dressed Booth's broken
leg was sentenced to the Dry Tortugas.Jefferson Davis, I suppose, is
glad to have nothing worse served upon him, thus far, than confinement
in Fortress Monroe.It is wonderful that 800,000 men are returning so
quietly from the army to civil life that it is scarcely known, save by
the welcome which they receive in their own homes.Buddington, of Brooklyn, preached to-day.His wife
was Miss Elizabeth Willson, Clara Coleman's sister.My Sunday School
book is "Mill on the Floss," but Grandmother says it is not Sabbath
reading, so I am stranded for the present._December_ 8.--Yesterday was Thanksgiving day.I do not remember that it
was ever observed in December before.President Johnson appointed it as
a day of national thanksgiving for our many blessings as a people, and
Governor Fenton and several governors of other states have issued
proclamations in accordance with the President's recommendation.The
weather was very unpleasant, but we attended the union thanksgiving
service held in our church.The choir sang America for the opening
piece.Daggett read Miriam's song of praise: "The Lord hath
triumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea."Then he offered one of his most eloquent and fervent prayers, in
which the returned soldiers, many of whom are in broken health or maimed
for life, in consequence of their devotion and loyalty to their country,
were tenderly remembered.His text was from the 126th Psalm, "The Lord
hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."It was one of his
best sermons.He mentioned three things in particular which the Lord has
done for us, whereof we are glad: First, that the war has closed;
second, that the Union is preserved; third, for the abolition of
slavery.After the sermon, a collection was taken for the poor, and Dr.A. D. Eddy, who was present, offered prayer.The choir sang an anthem
which they had especially prepared for the occasion, and then all joined
in the doxology.Uncle Thomas Beals' family of four united with our
three at Thanksgiving dinner.Uncle sent to New York for the oysters,
and a famous big turkey, with all the usual accompaniments, made us a
fine repast.Anna and Ritie Tyler are reading together Irving's Life of
Washington, two afternoons each week.I wonder how long they will keep
it up._December_ 11.--I have been down town buying material for garments for
our Home Missionary family which we are to make in our society.Anna and
I were cutting them out and basting them ready for sewing, and
grandmother told us to save all the basting threads when we were through
with them and tie them and wind them on a spool for use another time.Anna, who says she never wants to begin anything that she cannot finish
in 15 minutes, felt rather tired at the prospect of this unexpected task
and asked Grandmother how she happened to contract such economical
ideas.Grandmother told her that if she and Grandfather had been
wasteful in their younger days, we would not have any silk dresses to
wear now.Anna said if that was the case she was glad that Grandmother
saved the basting thread!1866

_February_ 13.--Our brother James was married to-day to Louise
Livingston James of New York City._February_ 20.--Our society is going to hold a fair for the Freedmen, in
the Town Hall.Susie Daggett and I have been there all day to see about
the tables and stoves._February_ 21.--Been at the hall all day, trimming the room.Backus came down and if they had not helped us we would
not have done much.Backus put up all the principal drapery and made
it look beautiful._February_ 22.--At the hall all day.We had
quite a crowd in the evening and took in over three hundred dollars.Charlie Hills and Ellsworth Daggett stayed there all night to take care
of the hall.We had a fish pond, a grab-bag and a post-office.Anna says
they had all the smart people in the post-office to write the
letters,--Mr.Morse, Miss Achert, Albert Granger and herself.Some one
asked Albert Granger if his law business was good and he said one man
thronged into his office one day._February_ 23.--We took in two hundred dollars to-day at the fair.George Willson if she could not
write a poem expressing our thanks to Mr.Backus and she stepped aside
for about five minutes and handed us the following lines which we sent
to him.We think it is about the nicest thing in the whole fair."In ancient time the God of Wine
    They crowned with vintage of the vine,
    And sung his praise with song and glee
    And all their best of minstrelsy.The Backus whom we honor now
    Would scorn to wreathe his generous brow
    With heathen emblems--better he
    Will love our gratitude to see
    Expressed in all the happy faces
    Assembled in these pleasant places.May joy attend his footsteps here
    And crown him in a brighter sphere."_February_ 24.--Susie Daggett and I went to the hall this morning to
clean up.We sent back the dishes, not one broken, and disposed of
everything but the tables and stoves, which were to be taken away this
afternoon.We feel quite satisfied with the receipts so far, but the
expenses will be considerable.In _Ontario County Times_ of the following week we find this card of
thanks:

_February_ 28.--The Fair for the benefit of the Freedmen, held in the
Town Hall on Thursday and Friday of last week was eminently successful,
and the young ladies take this method of returning their sincere thanks
to the people of Canandaigua and vicinity for their generous
contributions and liberal patronage.It being the first public
enterprise in which the Society has ventured independently, the young
ladies were somewhat fearful of the result, but having met with such
generous responses from every quarter they feel assured that they need
never again doubt of success in any similar attempt so long as
Canandaigua contains so many large hearts and corresponding purses.But
our village cannot have all the praise this time.S. D. Backus of New
York City, for their very substantial aid, not only in gifts and
unstinted patronage, but for their invaluable labor in the decoration of
the hall and conduct of the Fair.But for them most of the manual labor
would have fallen upon the ladies.The thanks of the Society are
especially due, also, to those ladies who assisted personally with their
superior knowledge and older experience.W. P. Fiske for his
valuable services as cashier, and to Messrs.Daggett, Chapin and Hills
for services at the door; and to all the little boys and girls who
helped in so many ways.The receipts amounted to about $490, and thanks to our cashier, the
money is all good, and will soon be on its way carrying substantial
visions of something to eat and to wear to at least a few of the poor
Freedmen of the South.By order of Society,
                                            Carrie C. Richards, Pres't.Emma H. Wheeler, Sec'y.Editor--I expected to see an account of the Young Ladies' Fair in
your last number, but only saw a very handsome acknowledgment by the
ladies to the citizens.Your "local" must have been absent; and I beg
the privilege in behalf of myself and many others of doing tardy justice
to the successful efforts of the Aid Society at their debut February
22nd.Gotham furnished an artist and an architect, and the Society did the
rest.The decorations were in excellent taste, and so were the young
ladies.The skating pond was never in
better condition.On entering the hall I paused first before the table
of toys, fancy work and perfumery.Here was the President, and I hope I
shall be pardoned for saying that no President since the days of
Washington can compare with the President of this Society.Then I
visited a candy table, and hesitated a long time before deciding which I
would rather eat, the delicacies that were sold, or the charming
creatures who sold them.One delicious morsel, in a pink silk, was so
tempting that I seriously contemplated eating her with a
spoon--waterfall and all.[By the way, how do we know that the Romans
wore waterfalls?Because Marc Antony, in his funeral oration on Mr.Caesar, exclaimed, "O water fall was there, my countrymen!"]At this
point my attention was attracted by a fish pond.I tried my luck, caught
a whale, and seeing all my friends beginning to blubber, I determined to
visit the old woman who lived in a shoe.--She was very glad to see me.I
bought one of her children, which the Society can redeem for $1,000 in
smoking caps.The fried oysters were delicious; a great many of the bivalves got into
a stew, and I helped several of them out.Delicate ice cream, nicely
"baked in cowld ovens," was destroyed in immense quantities.I scream
when I remember the plates full I devoured, and the number of bright
women to whom I paid my devours.Beautiful cigar girls sold fragrant
Havanas, and bit off the ends at five cents apiece, extra.The fair
post-mistress and her fair clerks, so fair that they were almost
fairies, drove a very thriving business.--Let no man say hereafter that
the young ladies of Canandaigua are uneducated in all that makes women
lovely and useful.The
members of this Society have won the admiration of all their friends,
and especially of the most devoted of their servants,
                                                            Q. E. D.

If I had written that article, I should have given the praise to Susie
Daggett, for it belongs to her._Sunday, June_ 24.--My Sunday School scholars are learning the shorter
catechism.One recited thirty-five answers to questions to-day, another
twenty-six, another twenty, the others eleven.They do
not see why it is called the "shorter" Catechism!They all had their
ambrotypes taken with me yesterday at Finley's--Mary Hoyt, Fannie and
Ella Lyon, Ella Wood, Ella Van Tyne, Mary Vanderbrook, Jennie Whitlaw
and Katie Neu.They are all going to dress in white and sit on the front
seat in church at my wedding.Gooding make
individual fruit cakes for each of them and also some for each member of
our sewing society.Mary travelled to the hallway._Thursday, June_ 21.--We went to a lawn fete at Mrs.F. F. Thompson's
this afternoon.The flowers, the grounds, the
young people and the music all combined to make the occasion perfect._Note:_ Canandaigua is the summer home of Mrs.Thompson, who has
previously given the village a children's playground, a swimming school,
a hospital and a home for the aged, and this year (1911) has presented a
park as a beauty spot at foot of Canandaigua Lake._June_ 28.--Dear Abbie Clark and Captain Williams were married in the
Congregational church this evening.The church was trimmed beautifully
and Abbie looked sweet.We attended the reception afterwards at her
house."May calm and sunshine hallow their clasped hands."_July_ 15.--The girls of the Society have sent me my flag bed quilt,
which they have just finished.It was hard work quilting such hot days
but it is done beautifully.Bessie Seymour wrote the names on the stars.In the center they used six stars for "Three rousing cheers for the
Union."The names on the others are Sarah McCabe, Mary Paul, Fannie
Paul, Fannie Palmer, Nettie Palmer, Susie Daggett, Fannie Pierce, Sarah
Andrews, Lottie Clark, Abbie Williams, Carrie Lamport, Isadore Blodgett,
Nannie Corson, Laura Chapin, Mary F. Fiske, Lucilla F. Pratt, Jennie H.
Hazard, Sarah H. Foster, Mary Jewett, Mary C. Stevens, Etta Smith,
Cornelia Richards, Ella Hildreth, Emma Wheeler, Mary Wheeler, Mrs.Pierce, Alice Jewett, Bessie Seymour, Clara Coleman, Julia Phelps.It
kept the girls busy to get Abbie Clark's quilt and mine finished within
one month.They hope that the rest of the girls will postpone their
nuptials till there is a change in the weather.Mercury stands 90
degrees in the shade._July_ 19, 1866.--Our wedding day.We saw the dear little Grandmother,
God bless her, watching us from the window as we drove away.Alexandria Bay, _July_ 26.--Anna writes me that Charlie Wells said he
had always wanted a set of Clark's Commentaries, but I had carried off
the entire Ed._July_ 28.--As we were changing boats at Burlington, Vt, for Saratoga,
to our surprise, we met Captain and Abbie Williams, but could only stop
a moment.Saratoga, 29_th._--We heard Rev.Theodore Cuyler preach to-day from the
text, "Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world."He
leads devotional exercises every morning in the parlors of the Columbian
Hotel.I spoke to him this morning and he said my father was one of his
best and earliest friends.Canandaigua, _September_ 1.--A party of us went down to the Canandaigua
hotel this morning to see President Johnson, General Grant and Admiral
Farragut and other dignitaries.The train stopped about half an hour and
they all gave brief speeches.1867

_July_ 27.--Col.James M. Bull was buried from the home of Mr.Alexander
Howell to-day, as none of his family reside here now._November_ 13.--Our brother John and wife and baby Pearl have gone to
London, England, to live._December_ 28.--A large party of Canandaiguans went over to Rochester
last evening to hear Charles Dickens' lecture, and enjoyed it more than
I can possibly express.He was quite hoarse and had small bills
distributed through the Opera House with the announcement:

                    MR.CHARLES DICKENS

    Begs indulgence for a Severe Cold, but hopes its effects
    may not be very perceptible after a few minutes' Reading.We brought these notices home with us for souvenirs.It was worth a great deal just to look upon the man
who wrote Little Dorrit, David Copperfield and all the other books,
which have delighted us so much.We hope that he will live to write a
great many more.He spoke very appreciatively of his enthusiastic
reception in this country and almost apologized for some of the opinions
that he had expressed in his "American Notes," which he published, after
his first visit here, twenty-five years ago.He evidently thinks that
the United States of America are quite worth while.1871

_August_ 6.--Under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A., Hon.George H. Stuart,
President of the U. S. Christian Commission, spoke in an open air
meeting on the square this afternoon and in our church this evening.The
house was packed and such eloquence I never heard from mortal lips.He
ought to be called the Whitefield of America.He told of the good the
Christian Commission had done before the war and since.They took up a collection which must have amounted to
hundreds of dollars.1872

_Naples, June._--John has invited Aunt Ann Field, and James, his wife
and me and Babe Abigail to come to England to make them a visit, and we
expect to sail on the Baltic July sixth.Baltic, July_ 7.--We left New York yesterday under
favorable circumstances.It was a beautiful summer day, flags were
flying and everything seemed so joyful we almost forgot we were leaving
home and native land.There were many passengers, among them being Mr.Anthony Drexel and U. S. Grant, Jr., who boarded the steamer
from a tug boat which came down the bay alongside when we had been out
half an hour.President Grant was with him and stood on deck, smoking
the proverbial cigar.We were glad to see him and the passengers gave
him three cheers and three times three, with the greatest enthusiasm._Liverpool, July_ 16.--We arrived here to-day, having been just ten days
on the voyage.There were many clergymen of note on board, among them,
Rev.John H. Vincent, D.D., eminent in the Methodist Episcopal Church,
who is preparing International Sunday School lessons.He sat at our
table and Philip Phillips also, who is a noted evangelistic singer.They
held services both Sabbaths, July 7 and 15, in the grand saloon of the
steamer, and also in the steerage where the text was "And they willingly
received him into the ship."The immigrants listened eagerly, when the
minister urged them all to "receive Jesus."We enjoyed several evening
literary entertainments, when it was too cold or windy to sit on deck.We had the most luscious strawberries at dinner to-night, that I ever
ate.So large and red and ripe, with the hulls on and we dipped them in
powdered sugar as we ate them, a most appetizing way._London, July_ 17.--On our way to London to-day I noticed beautiful
flower beds at every station, making our journey almost a path of roses.In the fields, men and women both, were harvesting the hay, making
picturesque scenes, for the sky was cloudless and I was reminded of the
old hymn, commencing

    "Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
    Stand dressed in living green."We performed the journey from Liverpool to London, a distance of 240
miles, in five hours.John, Laura and little Pearl met us at Euston
Station, and we were soon whirled away in cabs to 24 Upper Woburn Place,
Tavistock Square, John's residence.Dinner was soon ready, a most
bountiful repast.We spent the remainder of the day visiting and
enjoying ourselves generally.It seemed so good to be at the end of the
journey, although we had only two days of really unpleasant weather on
the voyage.John and Laura are so kind and hospitable.They have a
beautiful home, lovely children and apparently every comfort and luxury
which this world can afford._Sunday, July_ 22.--We went to Spurgeon's Tabernacle this morning to
listen to this great preacher, with thousands of others.I had never
looked upon such a sea of faces before, as I beheld from the gallery
where we sat.The pulpit was underneath one gallery, so there seemed as
many people over the preacher's head, as there were beneath and around
him and the singing was as impressive as the sermon.I thought of the
hymn, "Hark ten thousand harps and voices, Sound the notes of praise
above."Spurgeon was so lame from rheumatism that he used two canes
and placed one knee on a chair beside him, when preaching.His text was
"And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth."I found that all I
had heard of his eloquence was true._Sunday, July_ 29.--We have spent the entire week sightseeing, taking in
Hyde Park, Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey, St.Paul's Cathedral, the
Tower of London and British Museum.We also went to Madame Tussaud's
exhibition of wax figures and while I was looking in the catalogue for
the number of an old gentleman who was sitting down apparently asleep,
he got up and walked away!We drove to Sydenham ten miles from London,
to see the Crystal Palace which Abbie called the "Christmas Palace."Henry Chesebro of Canandaigua are here and came
to see us to-day._August_ 13.--Amid the whirl of visiting, shopping and sightseeing in
this great city, my diary has been well nigh forgotten.The descriptive
letters to home friends have been numerous and knowing that they would
be preserved, I thought perhaps they would do as well for future
reference as a diary kept for the same purpose, but to-day, as St.Pancras' bell was tolling and a funeral procession going by, we heard by
cable of the death of our dear, dear Grandmother, the one who first
encouraged us to keep a journal of daily deeds, and who was always most
interested in all that interested us and now I cannot refrain if I
would, from writing down at this sad hour, of all the grief that is in
my heart.She has only stepped inside the
temple-gate where she has long been waiting for the Lord's entrance
call.I weep for ourselves that we shall see her dear face no more.It
does not seem possible that we shall never see her again on this earth.She took such an interest in our journey and just as we started I put my
dear little Abigail Beals Clarke in her lap to receive her parting
blessing.As we left the house she sat at the front window and saw us go
and smiled her farewell._August_ 20.--Anna has written how often Grandmother prayed that "He who
holds the winds in his fists and the waters in the hollow of his hands,
would care for us and bring us to our desired haven."She had received
one letter, telling of our safe arrival and how much we enjoyed going
about London, when she was suddenly taken ill and Dr.Anna's letter came, after ten days, telling us all
the sad news, and how Grandmother looked out of the window the last
night before she was taken ill, and up at the moon and stars and said
how beautiful they were.Anna says, "How can I ever write it?Our dear
little Grandmother died on my bed to-day."_August_ 30.--John, Laura and their nurse and baby John, Aunt Ann Field
and I started Tuesday on a trip to Scotland, going first to Glasgow
where we remained twenty-four hours.We visited the Cathedral and were
about to go down into the crypt when the guide told us that Gen.Sherman
of U.S.A.We stopped to look at him and felt like
telling him that we too were Americans.He was in good health and
spirits, apparently, and looked every inch a soldier with his cloak
a-la-militaire around him.We visited the Lochs and spent one night at
Inversnaid on Loch Lomond and then went on up Loch Katrine to the
Trossachs.When we took the little steamer, John said, "All aboard for
Naples," it reminded him so much of Canandaigua Lake.We arrived safely
in Edinburgh the next day by rail and spent four days in that charming
city, so beautiful in situation and in every natural advantage.We saw
the window from whence John Knox addressed the populace and we also
visited the Castle on the hill.Then we went to Melrose and visited the
Abbey and also Abbotsford, the residence of Sir Walter Scott.We went
through the rooms and saw many curios and paintings and also the
library.Sir Walter's chair at his desk was protected by a rope, but
Laura, nothing daunted, lifted the baby over it and seated him there for
a moment saying "I am sure, now, he will be clever."We continued our
journey that night and arrived in London the next morning._Ventnor, Isle of Wight, September_ 9.--Aunt Ann, Laura's sister,
Florentine Arnold, nurse and two children, Pearl and Abbie, and I are
here for three weeks on the seashore._September_ 16.--We have visited all the neighboring towns, the graves
of the Dairyman's daughter and little Jane, the young cottager, and the
scene of Leigh Richmond's life and labors.We have enjoyed bathing in
the surf, and the children playing in the sands and riding on the
donkeys.We have very pleasant rooms, in a house kept by an old couple, Mr.Tuddenham, down on the esplanade.They serve excellent meals in a
most homelike way.We have an abundance of delicious milk and cream
which they tell me comes from "Cowes"!_London, September_ 30.--Anna has come to England to live with John for
the present.She came on the Adriatic, arriving September 24.We are so
glad to see her once more and will do all in our power to cheer her in
her loneliness._Paris, October_ 18.--John, Laura, Aunt Ann and I, nurse and baby,
arrived here to-day for a few days' visit.We had rather a stormy
passage on the Channel.I asked one of the seamen the name of the vessel
and he answered me "The H'Albert H'Edward, Miss!"This information must
have given me courage, for I was perfectly sustained till we reached
Calais, although nearly every one around me succumbed._October_ 22.--We have driven through the Bois de Boulogne, visited Pere
la Chaise, the Morgue, the ruins of the Tuileries, which are left just
as they were since the Commune.We spent half a day at the Louvre
without seeing half of its wonders.I went alone to a photographer's, Le
Jeune, to be "taken" and had a funny time.He queried "Parlez-vous
Francais?"I shook my head and asked him "Parlez-vous Anglaise?"at
which query he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head!I ventured to
tell him by signs that I would like my picture taken and he held up two
sizes of pictures and asked me "Le cabinet, le vignette?"I held up my
fingers, to tell him I would like six of each, whereupon he proceeded to
make ready and when he had seated me, he made me understand that he
hoped I would sit perfectly still, which I endeavored to do.After the
first sitting, he showed displeasure and let me know that I had swayed
to and fro.Another attempt was more satisfactory and he said "Tres
bien, Madame," and I gave him my address and departed._October_ 26.--My photographs have come and all pronounce them indeed
"tres bien."We visited the Tomb of Napoleon to-day._October_ 27.--We attended service to-day at the American Chapel and I
enjoyed it more than I can ever express.After hearing a foreign tongue
for the past ten days, it seemed like getting home to go into a
Presbyterian church and hear a sermon from an American pastor.The
singing in the choir was so homelike, that when they sang "Awake my soul
to joyful lays and sing thy great Redeemer's praise," it seemed to me
that I heard a well known tenor voice from across the sea, especially in
the refrain "His loving kindness, oh how free."The text was "As an
eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad
her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, so the Lord did lead
him and there was no strange God with him."It was a
wonderful sermon and I shall never forget it.On our way home, we
noticed the usual traffic going on, building of houses, women were
standing in their doors knitting and there seemed to be no sign of
Sunday keeping, outside of the church._London, October_ 31.--John and I returned together from Paris and now I
have only a few days left before sailing for home.There was an
Englishman here to-day who was bragging about the beer in England being
so much better than could be made anywhere else.He said, "In America,
you have the 'ops, I know, but you haven't the Thames water, you know."_Sunday, November_ 3.--We went to hear Rev.He is a new light, comparatively, and bids fair to rival
Spurgeon and Newman Hall and all the rest.He is like a lion and again
like a lamb in the pulpit._Liverpool, November_ 6.--I came down to Liverpool to-day with Abbie and
nurse, to sail on the Baltic, to-morrow.There were two Englishmen in
our compartment and hearing Abbie sing "I have a Father in the Promised
Land," they asked her where her Father lived and she said "In America,"
and told them she was going on the big ship to-morrow to see him.Then
they turned to me and said they supposed I would be glad to know that
the latest cable from America was that U. S. Grant was elected for his
second term as President of the United States.I assured them that I was
very glad to hear such good news._November_ 9.--I did not know any of the passengers when we sailed, but
soon made pleasant acquaintances.Sykes from New York and in course of conversation I found that she as
well as myself, was born in Penn Yan, Yates County, New York, and that
her parents were members of my Father's church, which goes to prove that
the world is not so very wide after all.Abbie is a great pet among the
passengers and is being passed around from one to another from morning
till night.They love to hear her sing and coax her to say "Grace" at
table.She closes her eyes and folds her hands devoutly and says, "For
what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful."They
all say "Amen" to this, for they are fearful that they will not perhaps
be "thankful" when they finish!_November_ 15.--I have been on deck every day but one, and not missed a
single meal.There was a terrible storm one night and the next morning I
told one of the numerous clergymen, that I took great comfort in the
night, thinking that nothing could happen with so many of the Lord's
anointed, on board.He said that he wished he had thought of that, for
he was frightened almost to death!We have sighted eleven steamers and
on Wednesday we were in sight of the banks of Newfoundland all the
afternoon, our course being unusually northerly and we encountered no
fogs, contrary to the expectation of all.Every one pronounces the
voyage pleasant and speedy for this time of year._Naples, N. Y., November_ 20.--We arrived safely in New York on Sunday.Abbie spied her father very quickly upon the dock as we slowly came up
and with glad and happy hearts we returned his "Welcome home."We spent
two days in New York and arrived home safe and sound this evening._November_ 21.--My thirtieth birthday, which we, a reunited family, are
spending happily together around our own fireside, pleasant memories of
the past months adding to the joy of the hour.From the _New York Evangelist_ of August 15, 1872, by Rev."Died, at Canandaigua, N. Y., August 8, 1872, Mrs.Abigail Field Beals,
widow of Thomas Beals, in the 98th year of her age.Beals, whose
maiden name was Field, was born in Madison, Conn., April 7, 1784.David Dudley Field, D.D., of Stockbridge, Mass.,
and of Rev.Timothy Field, first pastor of the Congregational church of
Canandaigua.She came to Canandaigua with her brother, Timothy, in 1800.In 1805 she was married to Thomas Beals, Esq., with whom she lived
nearly sixty years, until he fell asleep.They had eleven children, of
whom only four survive.In 1807 she and her husband united with the
Congregational church, of which they were ever liberal and faithful
supporters.Beals loved the good old ways and kept her house in the
simple and substantial style of the past.She herself belonged to an age
of which she was the last.With great dignity and courtesy of manner
which repelled too much familiarity, she combined a sweet and winning
grace, which attracted all to her, so that the youth, while they would
almost involuntarily 'rise up before her,' yet loved to be in her
presence and called her blessed.She possessed in a rare degree the
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit and lived in an atmosphere of love
and peace.Her home and room were to her children and her children's
children what Jerusalem was to the saints of old.There they loved to
resort and the saddest thing in her death is the sundering of that tie
which bound so many generations together.She never ceased to take a
deep interest in the prosperity of the beautiful village of which she
and her husband were the pioneers and for which they did so much and in
the church of which she was the oldest member.Her mind retained its
activity to the last and her heart was warm in sympathy with every good
work.While she was well informed in all current events, she most
delighted in whatever concerned the Kingdom.Her Bible and religious
books were her constant companions and her conversation told much of her
better thoughts, which were in Heaven.Living so that those who knew her
never saw in her anything but fitness for Heaven, she patiently awaited
the Master's call and went down to her grave in a full age like a shock
of corn fully ripe that cometh in its season."I don't think I shall keep a diary any more, only occasionally jot down
things of importance.Noah T. Clarke's brother got possession of my
little diary in some way one day and when he returned it I found written
on the fly-leaf this inscription to the diary:

    "You'd scarce expect a volume of my size
    To hold so much that's beautiful and wise,
    And though the heartless world might call me cheap
    Yet from my pages some much joy shall reap.As monstrous oaks from little acorns grow,
    And kindly shelter all who toil below,
    So my future greatness and the good I do
    Shall bless, if not the world, at least a few."I think I will close my old journal with the mottoes which I find upon
an old well-worn writing book which Anna used for jotting down her
youthful deeds.On the cover I find inscribed, "Try to be somebody," and
on the back of the same book, as if trying to console herself for
unexpected achievement which she could not prevent, "Some must be
great!"*       *       *       *       *




1880

_June_ 17.--Our dear Anna was married to-day to Mr.Alonzo A. Cummings
of Oakland, Cal., and has gone there to live.I am sorry to have her go
so far away, but love annihilates space.There is no real separation,
except in alienation of spirit, and that can never come--to us.THE END

Over thirty printings.C. N. and A. M. WILLIAMSON'S THE PRINCESS PASSES

Illustrated by Edward Penfield.The sergeant who called to Sir Colin
was a Welshman, and I recognised him thirty-five years afterwards as old
Joe Lee, the present proprietor of the Railway Hotel in Cawnpore.He was
always known as Dobbin in his regiment; and Sir Colin, who had a most
wonderful memory for names and faces, turning to General Sir William
Mansfield who had formerly served in the Fifty-Third, said, "Isn't that
Sergeant Dobbin?"General Mansfield replied in the affirmative; and Sir
Colin, turning to Lee, said, "Do you think the breach is wide enough,
Dobbin?"Lee replied, "Part of us can get through and hold it till the
pioneers widen it with their crowbars to allow the rest to get in."The
word was then passed to the Fourth Punjabis to prepare to lead the
assault, and after a few more rounds were fired, the charge was ordered.The Punjabis dashed over the mud wall shouting the war-cry of the Sikhs,
"_Jai Khalsa Jee_!"[17] led by their two European officers, who were
both shot down before they had gone a few yards.This staggered the
Sikhs, and they halted.As soon as Sir Colin saw them waver, he turned
to Colonel Ewart, who was in command of the seven companies of the
Ninety-Third (Colonel Leith-Hay being in command of the assault on the
Thirty-Second barracks), and said: "Colonel Ewart, bring on the
tartan--let my own lads at them."Before the command could be repeated
or the buglers had time to sound the advance, the whole seven companies,
like one man, leaped over the wall, with such a yell of pent-up rage as
I had never heard before nor since.It was not a cheer, but a
concentrated yell of rage and ferocity that made the echoes ring again;
and it must have struck terror into the defenders, for they actually
ceased firing, and we could see them through the breach rushing from the
outside wall to take shelter in the two-storied building in the centre
of the garden, the gate and doors of which they firmly barred.Here I
must not omit to pay a tribute of respect to the memory of Pipe-Major
John M'Leod, who, with seven pipers, the other three being with their
companies attacking the barracks, struck up the Highland Charge, called
by some _The Haughs of Cromdell_, and by others _On wi' the Tartan_--the
famous charge of the great Montrose when he led his Highlanders so often
to victory.When all was over, and Sir Colin complimented the pipe-major
on the way he had played, John said, "I thought the boys would fecht
better wi' the national music to cheer them."The storming of the Secundrabagh has been so often described that I need
not dwell on the general action.Once inside, the Fifty-Third (who got
in by a window or small door in the wall to the right of the hole by
which we got through) and the Sikhs who followed us, joined the
Ninety-Third, and keeping together the bayonet did the work.As I before
remarked, I could write pages about the actions of individual men whose
names will never be known to history.Although pressed for space, I
must notice the behaviour of one or two.But I must leave this to
another chapter; the present one has already become too long.With regard to the incident mentioned on page 40 Captain W.
      T. Furse, A.D.C.to his Excellency, wrote to me as follows:
      "Dear Forbes-Mitchell--His Excellency has read your Mutiny
      Reminiscences with great interest, and thinks they are a
      very true description of the events of that time.He wishes
      me, however, to draw your attention to a mistake you have
      made in stating that 'the horse of Lieutenant Roberts was
      shot down under him.'But the Chief remembers that though he
      was in the position which you assign to him at that moment,
      it was not his horse that was shot, but the horse of a
      trooper of the squadron commanded by Lieut.J. Watson (now
      Sir John Watson, V.C., K.C.B.), who happened to be near Lord
      Roberts at the time."Now I could not understand this, because I had entered in my
      note-book that Lieutenant Fred.Roberts, Deputy Assistant
      Quartermaster-General of Artillery, was the first man to
      enter the Dilkoosha park and ride to the front to
      reconnoitre, that the enemy opened fire on him at
      point-blank range from a masked battery of 9-pounder guns,
      and that his horse was shot under him near the Yellow
      Bungalow (the name by which we then knew the Dilkoosha
      palace) on the morning of the 14th of November, 1857.And I
      was confident that about half-a-dozen men with Captain
      Dalziel ran out from the light company of the Ninety-Third
      to go to the assistance of Lieutenant Roberts, when we all
      saw him get on his feet and remount what we believed was a
      spare horse.The men of the light company, seeing that their
      assistance was not required, returned to the line, and
      directly we saw Lieutenant Roberts in the saddle again,
      unhurt, the whole regiment, officers and men, gave him a
      hearty cheer.But here was the Commander-in-Chief, through
      his aide-de-camp, telling me that I was incorrect!I could
      not account for it till I obtained an interview with his
      Excellency, when he explained to me that after he went past
      the Ninety-Third through the breach in the wall of the
      Dilkoosha park, Lieutenant Watson sent a trooper after him,
      and that the trooper was close to him when the battery
      unmasked and opened fire on them, the guns having been laid
      for their horses; that the second shot struck the trooper's
      horse as described by me, the horse and rider falling
      together amidst the dust knocked up by the other round shot;
      and that he, as a matter of course, dismounted and assisted
      the trooper to get from under the dead horse, and as he
      remounted after performing this humane and dangerous service
      to the fallen trooper, the Ninety-Third set up their cheer
      as I described.Now I must say the true facts of this incident rather add to
      the bravery of the action.The young lieutenant, who could
      thus coolly dismount and extricate a trooper from under a
      dead horse within point-blank range of a well-served battery

THE NINETY-THIRD--ANECDOTES OF THE SECUNDRABAGH--GENERAL EWART--THE SHAH
NUJEEF


In the first chapter of these reminiscences I mentioned that, before
leaving Dover, the Ninety-Third obtained a number of volunteers from the
other Highland regiments serving in England.Ours was the only Highland
regiment told off for the China expedition, and it was currently
whispered that Lord Elgin had specially asked for us to form his guard
of honour at the court of China after he had administered a due
castigation to the Chinese.Whether the report was true or not, the
belief did the regiment no harm; it added to the _esprit de corps_ which
was already a prominent feeling in the regiment, and enabled the boys to
boast to the girls in Portsmouth that they were "a cut above" the other
corps of the army.In support of this, the fact is worthy of being put
on record that although the regiment was not (as is usually the case)
confined to barracks the night before embarking, but were allowed leave
till midnight, still, when the time to leave the barracks came, there
was not a single man absent nor a prisoner in the guard-room; and
General Britain put it in garrison orders that he had never been able
to say the same of any other corps during the time he had commanded the
Portsmouth garrison.But the Ninety-Third were no ordinary regiment.They were then the most Scotch of all the Highland regiments; in brief,
they were a military Highland parish, minister and elders complete.The
elders were selected from among the men of all ranks,--two sergeants,
two corporals, and two privates; and I believe it was the only regiment
in the army which had a regular service of Communion plate; and in time
of peace the Holy Communion, according to the Church of Scotland, was
administered by the regimental chaplain twice a year.I hope the young
second battalion of the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders are like the
old Ninety-Third in this respect.At the same time, I don't ask them
ever to pray for the men who took away the numbers from our regiments;
may their beards be defiled, is the only feeling I have for them.By
taking away the old numbers a great deal was lost, and as far as I can
see nothing has been gained except confusion and the utter effacement of
all the old traditions of the army.The old numbers could easily have
been retained along with the territorial designations.I hope at all
events that the present regiment will never forget they are the
descendants of the old Ninety-Third, the "Thin Red Line" which Sir Colin
Campbell disdained to form four deep to meet the Russian cavalry on the
morning of the memorable 25th of October, 1854:--"Steady, Ninety-Third,
keep steady!But I am describing the relief of Lucknow, not the "Thin Red
Line" of Balaclava.Among the volunteers who came from the Seventy-Second was a man named
James Wallace.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.He and six others from the same regiment joined my
company.Wallace was not his real name, but he never took any one into
his confidence, nor was he ever known to have any correspondence.He
neither wrote nor received any letters, and he was usually so taciturn
in his manner that he was known in the company as the Quaker, a name
which had followed him from the Seventy-Second.He had evidently
received a superior education, for if asked for any information by a
more ignorant comrade, he would at once give it; or questioned as to the
translation of a Latin or French quotation in a book, he would give it
without the least hesitation.I have often seen him on the voyage out
walking up and down the deck of the _Belleisle_ during the watches of
the night, repeating the famous poem of Lamartine, _Le Chien du
Solitaire_, commencing:

    Helas!rentrer tout seul dans sa maison deserte
    Sans voir a votre approche une fenetre ouverte.Taking him all in all Quaker Wallace was a strange enigma which no one
could solve.When pressed to take promotion, for which his superior
education well fitted him, he absolutely refused, always saying that he
had come to the Ninety-Third for a certain purpose, and when that
purpose was accomplished, he only wished to die

    With his back to the field, and his feet to the foe!And leaving in battle no blot on his name,
    Look proudly to Heaven from the death-bed of fame.During the march to Lucknow it was a common thing to hear the men in my
company say they would give a day's grog to see Quaker Wallace under
fire; and the time had now come for their gratification.There was another man in the company who had joined the regiment in
Turkey before embarking for the Crimea.He was also a man of superior
education, but in many respects the very antithesis of Wallace.He was
both wild and reckless, and used often to receive money sent to him from
some one, which he as regularly spent in drink.He went under the name
of Hope, but that was also known to be an assumed name, and when the
volunteers from the Seventy-Second joined the regiment in Dover, it was
remarked that Wallace had the address of Hope, and had asked to be
posted to the same company.Yet the two men never spoke to one another;
on the contrary they evidently hated each other with a mortal hatred.If
the history of these two men could be known it would without doubt form
material for a most sensational novel.Just about the time the men were tightening their belts and preparing
for the dash on the breach of the Secundrabagh, this man Hope commenced
to curse and swear in such a manner that Captain Dawson, who commanded
the company, checked him, telling him that oaths and foul language were
no signs of bravery.Hope replied that he did not care a d---- what the
captain thought; that he would defy death; that the bullet was not yet
moulded that would kill him; and he commenced exposing himself above the
mud wall behind which we were lying.The captain was just on the point
of ordering a corporal and a file of men to take Hope to the rear-guard
as drunk and riotous in presence of the enemy, when Pipe-Major John
M'Leod, who was close to the captain, said: "Don't mind the puir lad,
sir; he's not drunk, he is fey!It's not himself
that's speaking; he will never see the sun set."The words were barely
out of the pipe-major's mouth when Hope sprang up on the top of the mud
wall, and a bullet struck him on the right side, hitting the buckle of
his purse belt, which diverted its course, and instead of going right
through his body it cut him round the front of his belly below the
waist-belt, making a deep wound, and his bowels burst out falling down
to his knees.He sank down at once, gasping for breath, when a couple of
bullets went through his chest and he died without a groan.John M'Leod
turned and said to Captain Dawson, "I told you so, sir.I am never deceived in a fey man!It was not himself who spoke when
swearing in yon terrible manner."Just at this time Quaker Wallace, who
had evidently been a witness of Hope's tragic end, worked his way along
to where the dead man lay, and looking on the distorted features he
solemnly said, "The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord._I came to the
Ninety-Third to see that man die!_" All this happened only a few seconds
before the assault was ordered, and attracted but little attention
except from those who were immediate witnesses of the incident.The
gunners were falling fast, and almost all eyes were turned on them and
the breach.When the signal for the assault was given, Quaker Wallace
went into the Secundrabagh like one of the Furies, if there are male
Furies, plainly seeking death but not meeting it, and quoting the 116th
Psalm, Scotch version in metre, beginning at the first verse:

    I love the Lord, because my voice
      And prayers He did hear.I, while I live, will call on Him,
      Who bow'd to me His ear.And thus he plunged into the Secundrabagh quoting the next verse at
every shot fired from his rifle and at each thrust given by his bayonet:

    I'll of salvation take the cup,
      On God's name will I call;
    I'll pay my vows now to the Lord
      Before His people all.It was generally reported in the company that Quaker Wallace
single-handed killed twenty men, and one wonders at this, remembering
that he took no comrade with him and did not follow Sir Colin's rule of
"fighting in threes," but whenever he saw an enemy he "went for" him!I
may here remark that the case of Wallace proved that, in a fight like
the Secundrabagh where the enemy is met hand to hand and foot to foot,
the way to escape death is to brave it.Of course Wallace might have
been shot from a distance, and in that respect he only ran an even
chance with the others; but wherever he rushed with his bayonet, the
enemy did their utmost to give him a wide berth.By the time the bayonet had done its work of retribution, the throats of
our men were hoarse with shouting "Cawnpore!The
taste of the powder (those were the days when the muzzle-loading
cartridges had to be bitten with the teeth) made men almost mad with
thirst; and with the sun high over head, and being fresh from England,
with our feather bonnets, red coats, and heavy kilts, we felt the heat
intensely.In the centre of the inner court of the Secundrabagh there was a large
_peepul_[18] tree with a very bushy top, round the foot of which were
set a number of jars full of cool water.When the slaughter was almost
over, many of our men went under the tree for the sake of its shade, and
to quench their burning thirst with a draught of the cool water from the
jars.A number however lay dead under this tree, both of the Fifty-Third
and Ninety-Third, and the many bodies lying in that particular spot
attracted the notice of Captain Dawson.After having carefully examined
the wounds, he noticed that in every case the men had evidently been
shot from above.He thereupon stepped out from beneath the tree, and
called to Quaker Wallace to look up if he could see any one in the top
of the tree, because all the dead under it had apparently been shot from
above.Wallace had his rifle loaded, and stepping back he carefully
scanned the top of the tree.He almost immediately called out, "I see
him, sir!"and cocking his rifle he repeated aloud,

    I'll pay my vows now to the Lord
      Before His people all.He fired, and down fell a body dressed in a tight-fitting red jacket and
tight-fitting rose- silk trousers; and the breast of the jacket
bursting open with the fall, showed that the wearer was a woman, She was
armed with a pair of heavy old-pattern cavalry pistols, one of which was
in her belt still loaded, and her pouch was still about half full of
ammunition, while from her perch in the tree, which had been carefully
prepared before the attack, she had killed more than half-a-dozen men.When Wallace saw that the person whom he shot was a woman, he burst into
tears, exclaiming: "If I had known it was a woman, I would rather have
died a thousand deaths than have harmed her."I cannot now recall, although he belonged to my company, what became of
Quaker Wallace, whether he lived to go through the rest of the Mutiny or
not.I have long since lost my pocket company-roll, but I think Wallace
took sick and was sent to Allahabad from Cawnpore, and was either
invalided to England or died in the country.By this time all opposition had ceased, and over two thousand of the
enemy lay dead within the building and the centre court.The troops were
withdrawn, and the muster-roll of the Ninety-Third was called just
outside the gate, which is still standing, on the level spot between the
gate and the mound where the European dead are buried.When the roll was called it was found that the Ninety-Third had nine
officers and ninety-nine men, in all one hundred and eight, killed and
wounded.The roll of the Fifty-Third was called alongside of us, and Sir
Colin Campbell rode up and addressing the men, spoke out in a clear
voice: "Fifty-Third and Ninety-Third, you have bravely done your share
of this morning's work, and Cawnpore is avenged!"Whereupon one of the
Fifty-Third sang out, "Three cheers for the Commander-in-Chief, boys,"
which was heartily responded to.All this time there was perfect silence around us, the enemy evidently
not being aware of how the tide of victory had rolled inside the
Secundrabagh, for not a soul escaped from it to tell the tale.The
silence was so great that we could hear the pipers of the Seventy-Eighth
playing inside the Residency as a welcome to cheer us all.There were
lately, by the way, some writers who denied that the Seventy-Eighth had
their bagpipes and pipers with them at Lucknow.This is not true; they
had their pipes and played them too!But we had barely saluted the
Commander-in-Chief with a cheer when a perfect hail of round-shot
assailed us both from the Tara Kothi on our left and the Shah Nujeef on
our right front.But I must leave the account of our storming the Shah
Nujeef for a separate chapter.I may here remark that on revisiting Lucknow I did not see a single
tablet or grave to show that any of the Ninety-Third are buried there.Surely Captains Dalzell and Lumsden and the men who lie in the mound to
the east of the gate of the Secundrabagh are deserving of some memorial!But it is the old, old story which was said to have been first written
on the walls of Badajoz:

    When war is rife and danger nigh,
    God and the Soldier is all the cry;
    When war is over, and wrongs are righted,
    God is forgot and the Soldier slighted.I am surprised that the officers of the Ninety-Third Regiment have never
taken any steps to erect some monument to the memory of the brave men
who fell in Lucknow at its relief, and at the siege in March, 1858.Neither is there a single tablet in the Memorial Church at Cawnpore in
memory of the Ninety-Third, although almost every one of the other
regiments have tablets somewhere in the church.If I were a millionaire
I would myself erect a statue to Sir Colin Campbell on the spot where
the muster-roll of the Ninety-Third was called on the east of the gate
of the Secundrabagh, with a life-sized figure of a private of the
Fifty-Third and Ninety-Third, a sailor and a Sikh at each corner, with
the names of every man who fell in the assault on the 16th of November,
1857; and as the Royal Artillery were also there, Sir Colin should be
represented in the centre standing on a gun, with a royal artilleryman
holding a port-fire ready.Since commencing these reminiscences I met a gentleman in Calcutta who
told me that he had a cousin in the Ninety-Third, General J. A. Ewart,
who was with the regiment in the storming of the Secundrabagh, and he
asked me if I remembered General Ewart.This leads me to believe that it
would not be out of place if I were to relate the following narrative.General Ewart, now Sir John Alexander Ewart, I am informed, is still
alive, and some mention of the part played by him, so far as I saw it,
will form an appropriate conclusion to the story of the taking of the
Secundrabagh.And should he ever read this narrative, I may inform him
that it is written by one who was present when he was adopted into the
Clan Forbes by our chief, the late Sir Charles Forbes, of Newe and
Edinglassie, Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, and this fact alone will make the
general receive my remarks with the feelings of a clansman as well as of
my old commander.The reminiscence of Secundrabagh which is here reproduced was called
forth, I should state, by a paragraph which appeared at the time in the
columns of _The Calcutta Statesman_ regarding General Ewart.The
paragraph was as follows:

      General Ewart, not having been employed since he gave over
      the command of the Allahabad division on the 30th of
      November, 1879, was placed on the retired list on the 30th
      ultimo [Nov.General Ewart is one of the few, if not
      the only general, who refused a transfer from the Allahabad
      Command to a more favourite division.He has served for over
      forty-six years, but has only been employed once since
      giving over the command of the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders in
      1864, and that was for two and a half years in this country.He commanded the Ninety-Third for about eighteen months
      before joining the Seventy-Eighth.He is in possession of
      the Crimean medal with four clasps, a novelty rather
      nowadays.He lost his left arm at the battle of Cawnpore.I accordingly wrote to _The Statesman_ desiring to correct a slight
inaccuracy in the statement that "General Ewart commanded the
Ninety-Third for about eighteen months before joining the
Seventy-Eighth."This is not, I remarked, strictly correct; General
Ewart never commanded the Ninety-Third in the sense implied.He joined
the regiment as captain in 1848, exchanging from the old Thirty-Fifth
Royal Sussex with Captain Buchanan of the Ninety-Third, and served in
the regiment till he received the regimental rank of lieutenant-colonel
on the death, at Fort Rooyah in April, 1858, of the Hon.Colonel Ewart was then in England on sick-leave, suffering from the loss
of his arm and other wounds and exchanged into the Seventy-Eighth with
Colonel Stisted about the end of 1859, so that he never actually
commanded the Ninety-Third for more than a few days at most.I will now
give a few facts about him which may interest old soldiers at least.During the whole of his service in the Ninety-Third, both as captain
and field-officer, Colonel Ewart was singularly devoted to duty, while
careful, considerate, and attentive to the wants of his men in a way
that made him more beloved by those under his command than any officer I
ever met during my service in the army.To the best of my recollection,
he was the only officer of the Ninety-Third who received the clasp for
Inkerman.At that battle he was serving on the staff of Lord Raglan as
Deputy-Assistant-Quartermaster-General, and as such was on duty on the
morning of the battle, and I believe he was the first officer of the
British army who perceived the Russian advance.He was visiting the
outposts, as was his custom when on duty, in the early morning, and gave
the alarm to Sir George Brown's division, and then carried the news of
the attack to Lord Raglan.For his services at Inkerman he was promoted
brevet lieutenant-colonel, and on the termination of the war, besides
the Crimean medal with four clasps (Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and
Sebastopol), he received the Cross of the Legion of Honour and the
Sardinian Medal, with the motto _Al valore Militare_, and also the
Turkish Order of the Medjidie.Early in the attack on the Secundrabagh three companies of the
Ninety-Third were detached under Colonel Leith-Hay to clear the ground
to the left and carry the barracks, and Colonel Ewart was left in
command of the other seven companies.For some time we lay down
sheltered by a low mud wall not more than one hundred and fifty to two
hundred yards from the walls of the Secundrabagh, to allow time for the
heavy guns to breach the garden wall.During this time Colonel Ewart had
dismounted and stood exposed on the bank, picking off the enemy on the
top of the building with one of the men's rifles which he took, making
the owner of the rifle lie down.The artillerymen were falling fast, but, after
a few discharges, a hole,--it could not be called a breach--was made,
and the order was given to the Fourth Punjab Rifles to storm.They
sprang out of cover, as I have already described, but before they were
half-way across the intervening distance, their commanding officer fell
mortally wounded, and I think two others of their European officers were
severely wounded.This caused a slight halt of the Punjabis.Sir Colin
called to Colonel Ewart, "Ewart, bring on the tartan;" one of our
buglers who was in attendance on Sir Colin, sounded the _advance_, and
the whole of the Ninety-Third dashed from behind the bank.It has always
been a disputed point who got through the hole first.I believe the
first man in was Lance-Corporal Donnelly of the Ninety-Third, who was
killed inside; then Subadar Gokul Sing, followed by Sergeant-Major
Murray, of the Ninety-Third, also killed, and fourth, Captain Burroughs,
severely wounded.It was about this time I got through myself, pushed up by Colonel Ewart
who immediately followed.My feet had scarcely touched the ground
inside, when a sepoy fired point-blank at me from among the long grass
a few yards distant.The bullet struck the thick brass clasp of my
waist-belt, but with such force that it sent me spinning heels over
head.The man who fired was cut down by Captain Cooper, of the
Ninety-Third, who got through the hole abreast with myself.When struck
I felt just as one feels when tripped up at a football match.Before I
regained my feet, I heard Ewart say as he rushed past me, "Poor fellow,
he is done for."I was but stunned, and regaining my feet and my breath
too, which was completely knocked out of me, I rushed on to the inner
court of the building, where I saw Ewart bareheaded, his feather bonnet
having been shot off his head, engaged in fierce hand-to-hand fight with
several of the enemy.I believe he shot down five or six of them with
his revolver.By that time the whole of the Ninety-Third and the Sikhs
had got in either through the wall or by the principal gate which had
now been forced open; the Fifty-Third, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon
of the Ninety-Third, and Captain B. Walton (who was severely wounded),
had got in by a window in the right angle of the garden wall which they
forced open.The inner court was rapidly filled with dead, but two
officers of the mutineers were fiercely defending a regimental colour
inside a dark room.Ewart rushed on them to seize it, and although
severely wounded in his sword-arm, he not only captured the colour, but
killed both the officers who were defending it.A few only of the defenders
of the Secundrabagh were left alive, and those few were being hunted
out of dark corners, some of them from below heaps of slain.Colonel
Ewart, seeing that the fighting was over, started with his colour to
present it to Sir Colin Campbell; but whether it was that the old Chief
considered that it was _infra dig_.for a field-officer to expose
himself to needless danger, or whether it was that he was angry at some
other thing, I know not, but this much I remember: Colonel Ewart ran up
to him where he sat on his gray charger outside the gate of the
Secundrabagh, and called out: "We are in possession of the bungalows,
sir.I have killed the last two of the enemy with my own hand, and here
is one of their colours," "D--n your colours, sir!""It's not your place to be taking colours; go back to your regiment this
instant, sir!"However, the officers of the staff who were with Sir
Colin gave a cheer for Colonel Ewart, and one of them presented him with
a cap to cover his head, which was still bare.He turned back,
apparently very much upset at the reception given to him by the old
Chief; but I afterwards heard that Sir Colin sent for him in the
afternoon, apologised for his rudeness, and thanked him for his
services.Before I conclude, I may remark that I have often thought over
this incident, and the more I think of it, the more I am convinced that,
from the wild and excited appearance of Colonel Ewart, who had been by
that time more than an hour without his hat in the fierce rays of the
sun, covered with blood and powder smoke, and his eyes still flashing
with the excitement of the fight, giving him the appearance of a man
under the influence of something more potent than "blue ribbon"
tipple--I feel pretty sure, I say, that, when Sir Colin first saw him,
he thought he was drunk.When he found out his mistake he was of course
sorry for his rudeness.After the capture of the Shah Nujeef, a field officer was required to
hold the barracks, which was one of the most important posts on our left
advance, and although severely wounded, having several sabre-cuts and
many bruises on his body, Colonel Ewart volunteered for the post of
commandant of the force.This post he held until the night of the
evacuation of the Residency and the retreat from Lucknow, for the
purpose of relieving Cawnpore for the second time from the grasp of the
Nana Sahib and the Gwalior Contingent.It was at the retaking of
Cawnpore that Colonel Ewart eventually had his arm carried off by a
cannon-shot; and the last time I saw him was when I assisted to lift him
into a _dooly_ on the plain of Cawnpore on the 1st of December, 1857.But I must leave the retaking of Cawnpore to its proper place in these
reminiscences, and resume my narrative of the capture of the
Secundrabagh.I mentioned previously that the muster-rolls had scarcely been called
outside the gateway, when the enemy evidently became aware that the
place was no longer held for them by living men, and a terrible fire was
opened on us from both our right and left, as well as from the Shah
Nujeef in our direct front.Let me here mention, before I take leave of the Secundrabagh, that I
have often been told that the hole in the wall by which the Ninety-Third
entered is still in existence.This I had heard from several sources,
and on Sunday morning, the 21st of August, 1892, when revisiting
Lucknow, I left the Royal Hotel with a guide who did not know that I had
ever seen Lucknow before, and who assured me that the breach had been
preserved just as it was left on the 16th of November, 1857, after the
Ninety-Third had passed through it; and I had made up my mind to
re-enter the Secundrabagh once again by the same old hole.On reaching
the gate I therefore made the _gharry_ stop, and walked round the
outside of the wall to the hole; but as soon as I arrived at the spot I
saw that the gap pointed out to me as the one by which the Ninety-Third
entered was a fraud, and I astonished the guide by refusing to pass
through it.The hole now shown as the one by which we entered was made
through the wall by an 18-pounder gun, which was brought from Cawnpore
by Captain Blount's troop of Royal Horse-Artillery.This was about
twenty yards to the left of the real hole, and was made to enable a few
men to keep up a cross fire through it till the stormers could get
footing inside the actual breach.This post was held by Sergeant James
Morrison and several sharp-shooters from my company, who, by direction
of Sir Colin, made a rush on this hole before the order was given for
the Fourth Punjab Infantry to storm.Any military man of the least
experience seeing the hole and its size now, thirty-five years after
the event, will know this to be a fact.The real breach was much bigger
and could admit three men abreast, and, as near as I can judge, was
about the centre of the road which now passes through the Secundrabagh.The guide, I may say, admitted such to be the case when he found that I
had seen the Secundrabagh before his time.Although it was only a hole,
and not what is correctly called a breach, in the wall, it was so wide,
and the surrounding parts of the wall had been so shaken by round-shot,
that the upper portion forming the arch must have fallen down within a
few years after 1857, and this evidently formed a convenient breach in
the wall through which the present road has been constructed.[19] The
smaller hole meanwhile has been laid hold of by the guides as the
identical passage by which the Secundrabagh was stormed.Having corrected the guide on this point, I will now give my
recollections of the assault on the Shah Nujeef, and the Kuddum Russool
which stands on its right, advancing from the Secundrabagh.The Kuddum Russool was a strongly-built domed mosque not nearly so large
as the Shah Nujeef, but it had been surrounded by a strong wall and
converted into a powder magazine by the English between the annexation
of Lucknow and the outbreak of the Mutiny.I think this fact is
mentioned by Mr.Gubbins in his _Mutinies in Oude_.The Kuddum Russool
was still used by the mutineers as a powder-magazine, but the powder had
been conveyed from it into the tomb of the Shah Nujeef, when the latter
was converted into a post of defence to bar our advance on the
Residency.Before the order was given for the attack on the Shah Nujeef, I may
mention that the quartermaster-general's department had made an estimate
of the number of the enemy slain in the Secundrabagh from their
appearance and from their parade-states of that morning.The mutineers,
let me say, had still kept up their English discipline and parade-forms,
and their parade-states and muster-rolls of the 16th of November were
discovered among other documents in a room of the Secundrabagh which had
been their general's quarters and orderly-room.It was then found that
four separate regiments had occupied the Secundrabagh, numbering about
two thousand five hundred men, and these had been augmented by a number
of _budmashes_ from the city, bringing up the list of actual slain in
the house and garden to about three thousand.Of these, over two
thousand lay dead inside the rooms of the main building and the inner
court.The colours, drums, etc., of the Seventy-First Native Infantry
and the Eleventh Oude Irregular Infantry were captured.The mutineers
fought under their English colours, and there were several Mahommedan
standards of green silk captured besides the English colours.The
Seventy-First Native Infantry was one of the crack corps of the
Company's army, and many of the men were wearing the Punjab medals on
their breasts.This regiment and the Eleventh Oude Irregulars were
simply annihilated.On examining the bodies of the dead, over fifty men
of the Seventy-First were found to have furloughs, or leave-certificates,
signed by their former commanding officer in their pockets, showing that
they had been on leave when their regiment mutinied and had rejoined
their colours to fight against us.It is a curious fact that after the
Mutiny was suppressed, many sepoys tendered these leave-certificates as
proof that they had _not_ taken part in the rebellion; and I believe all
such got enrolled either in the police or in the new regiments that were
being raised, and obtained their back pay.And doubtless if the
Ninety-Third and Fifty-Third bayonets had not cancelled those of the
Seventy-First Native Infantry all those _loyal_ men would afterwards
have presented their leave-certificates, and have claimed pay for the
time they were fighting against us!When the number of the slain was reported to Sir Colin, he turned to
Brigadier Hope, and said "This morning's work will strike terror into
the sepoys,--it will strike terror into them," and he repeated it
several times.Then turning to us again he said: "Ninety-Third, you have
bravely done your share of this morning's work, and Cawnpore is avenged!There is more hard work to be done; but unless as a last resource, I
will not call on you to storm more positions to-day.Your duty will be
to cover the guns after they are dragged into position.But, my boys,
if need be, remember I depend on you to carry the next position in the
same daring manner in which you carried the Secundrabagh."With that
some one from the ranks called out, "Will we get a medal for this, Sir
Colin?"To which he replied: "Well, my lads, I can't say what Her
Majesty's Government may do; but if you don't get a medal, all I can say
is you have deserved one better than any troops I have ever seen under
fire.I shall inform the Governor-General, and, through him, Her Majesty
the Queen, that I have never seen troops behave better."The order was
then given to man the drag-ropes of Peel's guns for the advance on the
Shah Nujeef, and obeyed with a cheer; and, as it turned out, the
Ninety-Third had to storm that position also.The advance on the Shah Nujeef has been so often described that I will
cut my recollections of it short.At the word of command Captain
Middleton's battery of Royal Artillery dashed forward with loud cheers,
the drivers waving their whips and the gunners their caps as they passed
us and Peel's guns at the gallop.The 24-pounder guns meanwhile were
dragged along by our men and the sailors in the teeth of a perfect hail
of lead and iron from the enemy's batteries.In the middle of the march
a poor sailor lad, just in front of me, had his leg carried clean off
above the knee by a round-shot, and, although knocked head over heels by
the force of the shot, he sat bolt upright on the grass, with the blood
spouting from the stump of his limb like water from the hose of a
fire-engine, and shouted, "Here goes a shilling a day, a shilling a day!Pitch into them, boys, pitch into them!Remember Cawnpore, Ninety-Third,
remember Cawnpore!and he fell back in a dead
faint, and on we went.I afterwards heard that the poor fellow was dead
before a doctor could reach the spot to bind up his limb.I will conclude this chapter with an extract from Sir Colin's despatch
on the advance on the Shah Nujeef:

      The Ninety-Third and Captain Peel's guns rolled on in one
      irresistible wave, the men falling fast, but the column
      advanced till the heavy guns were within twenty yards of the
      walls of the Shah Nujeef, where they were unlimbered and
      poured in round after round against the massive walls of the
      building, the withering fire of the Highlanders covering the
      Naval Brigade from great loss.But it was an action almost
      unexampled in war.Captain Peel behaved very much as if he
      had been laying the _Shannon_ alongside an enemy's frigate.But in this despatch Sir Colin does not mention that he was himself
wounded by a bullet after it had passed through the head of a
Ninety-Third grenadier.FOOTNOTES:

PERSONAL ANECDOTES--CAPTURE OF THE SHAH NUJEEF--A FEARFUL EXPERIENCE


I must now leave for a little the general struggle, and turn to the
actions of individual men as they fell under my own observation,--actions
which neither appear in despatches nor in history; and, by the way, I
may remark that one of the best accounts extant of the taking of the
Shah Nujeef is that of Colonel Alison, in _Blackwood's Magazine_ for
October, 1858.Both the Alisons were severely wounded on that
occasion,--Colonel Archibald Alison, Military Secretary, and his
brother, Captain F. M. Alison, A.D.C.I will now
relate a service rendered by Sergeant M. W. Findlay, of my company,
which was never noticed nor rewarded.Sergeant Findlay, let me state,
merely considered that he had done his duty, but that is no reason why I
should not mention his name.I believe he is still in India, and a
distinguished officer of the Rajpootana-Malwa Railway Volunteers at
Ajmere.However, after Captain Peel's guns were dragged into position,
the Ninety-Third took up whatever shelter they could get on the right
and left of the guns, and I, with several others, got behind the walls
of an unroofed mud hut, through which we made loopholes on the side next
to the Shah Nujeef, and were thus able to keep up a destructive fire
on the enemy.Let me add here that the surgeons of the force were
overwhelmed with work, and attending to the wounded in the thick of the
fire.Some time after the attack had commenced we noticed Captain Alison
and his horse in a heap together a few yards behind where we were in
shelter.Sergeant Findlay rushed out, got the wounded officer clear of
his dead horse under a perfect hail of bullets and round-shot, and
carried him under the shelter of the walls where we were lying.He then
ran off in search of a surgeon to bandage his wounds, which were
bleeding very profusely; but the surgeons were all too busy, and Sir
Colin was most strict on the point of wounds being attended to.Officers, no matter what their rank, had no precedence over the
rank-and-file in this respect; in fact, Sir Colin often expressed the
opinion that an officer could be far more easily replaced than a
well-drilled private.However, there was no surgeon available; so
Sergeant Findlay took his own bandage,--every soldier on going on active
service is supplied with lint and a bandage to have them handy in case
of wounds--set to work, stanched the bleeding, and bandaged up the
wounds of Captain Alison in such a surgeon-like manner that, when Dr.Menzies of the Ninety-Third at length came to see him, he thought he had
been attended to by a doctor.When he did discover that it was Sergeant
Findlay who had put on the bandages, he expressed his surprise, and said
that in all probability this prompt action had saved Captain Alison's
life, who otherwise might have been weakened by loss of blood beyond
recovery before a doctor could have attended to him.Menzies there
and then applied to Captain Dawson to get Sergeant Findlay into the
field-hospital as an extra assistant to attend to the wounded.In
closing this incident I may remark that I have known men get the
Victoria Cross for incurring far less danger than Sergeant Findlay did
in exposing himself to bring Captain Alison under shelter.The bullets
were literally flying round him like hail; several passed through his
clothes, and his feather bonnet was shot off his head.When he had
finished putting on the bandages he coolly remarked: "I must go out and
get my bonnet for fear I get sunstruck;" so out he went for his hat, and
before he got back scores of bullets were fired at him from the walls of
the Shah Nujeef.The next man I shall refer to was Sergeant Daniel White, one of the
coolest and most fearless men in the regiment.Sergeant White was a man
of superior education, an excellent vocalist and reciter, with a most
retentive memory, and one of the best amateur actors in the
Ninety-Third.Under fire he was just as cool and collected as if he had
been enacting the part of Bailie Nicol Jarvie in _Rob Roy_.In the force defending the Shah Nujeef, in addition to the regular army,
there was a large body of archers on the walls, armed with bows and
arrows which they discharged with great force and precision, and on
White raising his head above the wall an arrow was shot right into his
feather bonnet.Inside of the wire cage of his bonnet, however, he had
placed his forage cap, folded up, and instead of passing right through,
the arrow stuck in the folds of the forage cap, and "Dan," as he was
called, coolly pulled out the arrow, paraphrasing a quotation from Sir
Walter Scott's _Legend of Montrose_, where Dugald Dalgetty and Ranald
MacEagh made their escape from the castle of McCallum More.Looking at
the arrow, "My conscience!"Have we got Robin Hood and Little John back again?My conscience, the sight has not been seen in civilised war for
nearly two hundred years.And why not weavers' beams as
in the days of Goliath?that Daniel White should be able to tell in
the Saut Market of Glasgow that he had seen men fight with bows and
arrows in the days of Enfield rifles!Well, well, Jack Pandy, since bows
and arrows are the words, here's at you!"and with that he raised his
feather bonnet on the point of his bayonet above the top of the wall,
and immediately another arrow pierced it through, while a dozen more
whizzed past a little wide of the mark.Just then one poor fellow of the Ninety-Third, named Penny, of No.2
company, raising his head for an instant a little above the wall, got an
arrow right through his brain, the shaft projecting more than a foot out
at the back of his head.As the poor lad fell dead at our feet,
Sergeant White remarked, "Boys, this is no joke; we must pay them off."We all loaded and capped, and pushing up our feather bonnets again, a
whole shower of arrows went past or through them.Up we sprang and
returned a well-aimed volley from our rifles at point-blank distance,
and more than half-a-dozen of the enemy went down.But one unfortunate
man of the regiment, named Montgomery, of No.6 company, exposed himself
a little too long to watch the effect of our volley, and before he could
get down into shelter again an arrow was sent right through his heart,
passing clean through his body and falling on the ground a few yards
behind him.He leaped about six feet straight up in the air, and fell
stone dead.White could not resist making another quotation, but this
time it was from the old English ballad of _Chevy Chase_.He had a bow bent in his hand
      Made of a trusty tree,
    An arrow of a cloth-yard long
      Up to the head drew he.Against Sir Hugh Montgomerie
      So right his shaft he set,
    The grey goose wing that was thereon
      In his heart's blood was wet.Readers who have never been under the excitement of a fight like this
which I describe, may think that such coolness is an exaggeration.Remember the men of whom I write had stood in the "Thin Red
Line" of Balaclava without wavering, and had made up their minds to die
where they stood, if need be; men who had been for days and nights
under shot and shell in the trenches of Sebastopol.If familiarity
breeds contempt, continual exposure to danger breeds coolness, and, I
may say, selfishness too; where all are exposed to equal danger little
sympathy is, for the time being at least, displayed for the unlucky ones
"knocked on the head," to use the common expression in the ranks for
those who are killed.Besides, Sergeant Daniel White was an
exceptionally cool man, and looked on every incident with the eye of an
actor.By this time the sun was getting low, a heavy cloud of smoke hung over
the field, and every flash of the guns and rifles could be clearly seen.The enemy in hundreds were visible on the ramparts, yelling like demons,
brandishing their swords in one hand and burning torches in the other,
shouting at us to "Come on!"But little impression had been made on the
solid masonry walls.Brigadier Hope and his aide-de-camp were rolling on
the ground together, the horses of both shot dead; and the same shell
which had done this mischief exploded one of our ammunition waggons,
killing and wounding several men.Altogether the position looked black
and critical when Major Barnston and his battalion of detachments were
ordered to storm.This battalion of detachments was a body made up of
almost every corps in the service,--at least as far as the regiments
forming the expedition to China were concerned--and men belonging to the
different corps which had entered the Residency with Generals Havelock
and Outram.It also comprised some men who had been left (through
sickness or wounds) at Allahabad and Cawnpore, and some of the Ninetieth
Regiment which had been intercepted at Singapore on their way to China,
under Captain (now General Lord) Wolseley.However, although a made-up
battalion, they advanced bravely to the breach, and I think their
leader, Major Barnston, was killed, and the command devolved on Captain
Wolseley.He made a most determined attempt to get into the place, but
there were no scaling-ladders, and the wall was still almost twenty feet
high.During the heavy cannonade the masonry had fallen down in flakes
on the outside, but still leaving an inner wall standing almost
perpendicular, and in attempting to climb up this the men were raked
with a perfect hail of missiles--grenades and round-shot hurled from
wall-pieces, arrows and brickbats, burning torches of rags and cotton
saturated with oil--even boiling water was dashed on them!In the midst
of the smoke the breach would have made a very good representation of
Pandemonium.There were scores of men armed with great burning torches
just like what one may see in the sham fights of the _Mohurrum_, only
these men were in earnest, shouting "_Allah Akbar!_" "_Deen!Deen!_" and
"_Jai Kali ma ki!_"[20]

The stormers were driven back, leaving many dead and wounded under the
wall.At this juncture Sir Colin called on Brigadier Hope to form up
the Ninety-Third for a final attempt.Sir Colin, again addressing us,
said that he had not intended to call on us to storm more positions that
day, but that the building in our front must be carried before dark, and
the Ninety-Third must do it, and he would lead us himself, saying again:
"Remember, men, the lives at stake inside the Residency are those of
women and children, and they must be rescued."A reply burst from the
ranks: "Ay, ay, Sir Colin!we stood by you at Balaklava, and will stand
by you here; but you must not expose yourself so much as you are doing.We can be replaced, but you can't.You must remain behind; we can lead
ourselves."By that time the battalion of detachments had cleared the front, and the
enemy were still yelling to us to "Come on," and piling up missiles to
give us a warm reception.Captain Peel had meanwhile brought his
infernal machine, known as a rocket battery, to the front, and sent a
volley of rockets through the crowd on the ramparts around the breach.Just at that moment Sergeant John Paton of my company came running down
the ravine that separated the Kuddum Russool from the Shah Nujeef,
completely out of breath through exertion, but just able to tell
Brigadier Hope that he had gone up the ravine at the moment the
battalion of detachments had been ordered to storm, and had discovered a
breach in the north-east corner of the rampart next to the river
Goomtee.It appears that our shot and shell had gone over the first
breach, and had blown out the wall on the other side in this particular
spot.Paton told how he had climbed up to the top of the ramparts
without difficulty, and seen right inside the place as the whole
defending force had been called forward to repulse the assault in front.Captain Dawson and his company were at once called out, and while the
others opened fire on the breach in front of them, we dashed down the
ravine, Sergeant Paton showing the way.As soon as the enemy saw that
the breach behind had been discovered, and that their well-defended
position was no longer tenable, they fled like sheep through the back
gate next to the Goomtee and another in the direction of the Motee
Munzil.7 company had got in behind them and cut off their
retreat by the back gate, it would have been Secundrabagh over again!As
it was, by the time we got over the breach we were able to catch only
about a score of the fugitives, who were promptly bayoneted; the rest
fled pell-mell into the Goomtee, and it was then too dark to see to use
the rifle with effect on the flying masses.However, by the great pools
of blood inside, and the number of dead floating in the river, they had
plainly suffered heavily, and the well-contested position of the Shah
Nujeef was ours.By this time Sir Colin and those of his staff remaining alive or
unwounded were inside the position, and the front gate thrown open.A
hearty cheer was given for the Commander-in-Chief, as he called the
officers round him to give instructions for the disposition of the
force for the night.As it was Captain Dawson and his company who had
scaled the breach, to them was assigned the honour of holding the Shah
Nujeef, which was now one of the principal positions to protect the
retreat from the Residency.And thus ended the terrible 16th of
November, 1857.In the taking of the Secundrabagh all the subaltern officers of my
company were wounded, namely, Lieutenants E. Welch and S. E. Wood, and
Ensign F. R. M'Namara.The only officer therefore with the company in
the Shah Nujeef was Captain Dawson.Sergeant Findlay, as already
mentioned, had been taken over as hospital-assistant, and another
sergeant named Wood was either sick or wounded, I forget which, and
Corporals M'Kenzie and Mitchell (a namesake of mine, belonging to
Balmoral) were killed.It thus fell to my lot as the non-commissioned
officer on duty to go round with Captain Dawson to post the sentries.Kavanagh, who was officiating as a volunteer staff-officer,
accompanied us to point out the direction of the strongest positions of
the enemy, and the likely points from which any attempts would be made
to recapture our position during the night.During the absence of the
captain the command of the company devolved on Colour-Sergeant David
Morton, of "Tobacco Soup" fame, and he was instructed to see that none
of the enemy were still lurking in the rooms surrounding the mosque of
the Shah Nujeef, while the captain was going round the ramparts placing
the sentries for the protection of our position.As soon as the sentries were posted on the ramparts and regular reliefs
told off, arrangements were made among the sergeants and corporals to
patrol at regular intervals from sentry to sentry to see that all were
alert.This was the more necessary as the men were completely worn out
and fatigued by long marches and heavy fighting, and in fact had not
once had their belts off for a week previous, while all the time
carrying double ammunition on half-empty stomachs.Every precaution had
therefore to be taken that the sentries should not go to sleep, and it
fell to me as the corporal on duty to patrol the first two hours of the
night, from eight o'clock till ten.The remainder of the company
bivouacked around the piled arms, which were arranged carefully loaded
and capped with bayonets fixed, ready for instant action should an
attack be made on our position.After the great heat of the day the
nights by contrast felt bitterly cold.There was a stack of dry wood in
the centre of the grounds from which the men kindled a large fire near
the piled arms, and arranged themselves around it, rolled in their
greatcoats but fully accoutred, ready to stand to arms at the least
alarm.In writing these reminiscences it is far from my wish to make them an
autobiography.My intention is rather to relate the actions of others
than recount what I did myself; but an adventure happened to me in the
Shah Nujeef which gave me such a nervous fright that to this day I often
dream of it.I have forgotten to state that when the force advanced
from the Alumbagh each man carried his greatcoat rolled into what was
then known in our regiment as the "Crimean roll," with ends strapped
together across the right shoulder just over the ammunition pouch-belt,
so that it did not interfere with the free use of the rifle, but rather
formed a protection across the chest.As it turned out many men owed
their lives to the fact that bullets became spent in passing through the
rolled greatcoats before reaching a vital part.Now it happened that in
the heat of the fight in the Secundrabagh my greatcoat was cut right
through where the two ends were fastened together, by the stroke of a
keen-edged _tulwar_ which was intended to cut me across the shoulder,
and as it was very warm at the time from the heat of the mid-day sun
combined with the excitement of the fight, I was rather glad than
otherwise to be rid of the greatcoat; and when the fight was over, it
did not occur to me to appropriate another one in its place from one of
my dead comrades.But by ten o'clock at night there was a considerable
difference in the temperature from ten in the morning, and when it came
to my turn to be relieved from patrol duty and to lie down for a sleep,
I felt the cold wet grass anything but comfortable, and missed my
greatcoat to wrap round my knees; for the kilt is not the most suitable
dress imaginable for a bivouac, without greatcoat or plaid, on a cold,
dewy November night in Upper India; with a raw north wind the climate of
Lucknow feels uncommonly cold at night in November, especially when
contrasted with the heat of the day.I have already mentioned that the
sun had set before we entered the Shah Nujeef, the surrounding enclosure
of which contained a number of small rooms round the inside of the
walls, arranged after the manner of the ordinary Indian native
travellers' _serais_.The Shah Nujeef, it must be remembered, was the
tomb of Ghazee-ood-deen Hyder, the first king of Oude, and consequently
a place of Mahommedan pilgrimage, and the small rooms round the four
walls of the square were for the accommodation of pilgrims.These rooms
had been turned into quarters by the enemy, and, in their hurry to
escape, many of them had left their lamps burning, consisting of the
ordinary _chirags_[22] placed in small niches in the walls, leaving also
their evening meal of _chupatties_ in small piles ready cooked, and the
curry and _dhal_[23] boiling on the fires.Many of the lamps were still
burning when my turn of duty was over, and as I felt the want of a
greatcoat badly, I asked the colour-sergeant of the company (the captain
being fast asleep) for permission to go out of the gate to where our
dead were collected near the Secundrabagh to get another one.This
Colour-Sergeant Morton refused, stating that before going to sleep the
captain had given strict orders that except those on sentry no man was
to leave his post on any pretence whatever.I had therefore to try to
make the best of my position, but although dead tired and wearied out I
felt too uncomfortable to go to sleep, and getting up it struck me that
some of the sepoys in their hurried departure might have left their
greatcoats or blankets behind them.With this hope I went into one of
the rooms where a lamp was burning, took it off its shelf, and shading
the flame with my hand walked to the door of the great domed tomb, or
mosque, which was only about twenty or thirty yards from where the arms
were piled and the men lying round the still burning fire.I peered into
the dark vault, not knowing that it was a king's tomb, but could see
nothing, so I advanced slowly, holding the _chirag_ high over my head
and looking cautiously around for fear of surprise from a concealed
enemy, till I was near the centre of the great vault, where my progress
was obstructed by a big black heap about four or five feet high, which
felt to my feet as if I were walking among loose sand.I lowered the
lamp to see what it was, and immediately discovered that I was standing
up to the ankles in _loose gunpowder_!of it lay in a
great heap in front of my nose, while a glance to my left showed me a
range of twenty to thirty barrels also full of powder, and on the right
over a hundred 8-inch shells, all loaded with the fuses fixed, while
spare fuses and slow matches and port-fires in profusion lay heaped
beside the shells.By this time my eyes had become accustomed to the darkness of the
mosque, and I took in my position and my danger at a glance.Here I was
up to my knees in powder,--in the very bowels of a magazine with a
naked light!My hair literally stood on end; I felt the skin of my head
lifting my feather bonnet off my scalp; my knees knocked together, and
despite the chilly night air the cold perspiration burst out all over me
and ran down my face and legs.I had neither cloth nor handkerchief in
my pocket, and there was not a moment to be lost, as already the
overhanging wick of the _chirag_ was threatening to shed its smouldering
red tip into the live magazine at my feet with consequences too
frightful to contemplate.Quick as thought I put my left hand under the
down-dropping flame, and clasped it with a grasp of determination;
holding it firmly I slowly turned to the door, and walked out with my
knees knocking one against the other!Fear had so overcome all other
feeling that I am confident I never felt the least pain from grasping
the burning wick till after I was outside the building and once again in
the open air; but when I opened my hand I felt the smart acutely enough.I poured the oil out of the lamp into the burnt hand, and kneeling down
thanked God for having saved myself and all the men lying around me from
horrible destruction.I then got up and, staggering rather than walking
to the place where Captain Dawson was sleeping, and shaking him by the
shoulder till he awoke, I told him of my discovery and the fright I had
got.At first he either did not believe me, or did not comprehend the danger.Corporal Mitchell," was all his answer, "you have woke up out of
your sleep, and have got frightened at a shadow," for my heart was
still thumping against my ribs worse than it was when I first discovered
my danger, and my voice was trembling.I turned my smarting hand to the
light of the fire and showed the captain how it was scorched; and then,
feeling my pride hurt at being told I had got frightened at a shadow, I
said: "Sir, you're not a Highlander or you would know the Gaelic proverb
'_The heart of one who can look death in the face will not start at a
shadow_,' and you, sir, can yourself bear witness that I have not
shirked to look death in the face more than once since daylight this
morning."He replied, "Pardon me, I did not mean that; but calm yourself
and explain what it is that has frightened you."I then told him that I
had gone into the mosque with a naked lamp burning, and had found it
half full of loose gunpowder piled in a great heap on the floor and a
large number of loaded shells."Are you sure you're not dreaming from
the excitement of this terrible day?"With that I
looked down to my feet and my gaiters, which were still covered with
blood from the slaughter in the Secundrabagh; the wet grass had softened
it again, and on this the powder was sticking nearly an inch thick.I
scraped some of it off, throwing it into the fire, and said, "There is
positive proof for you that I'm not dreaming, nor my vision a shadow!"On that the captain became almost as alarmed as I was, and a sentry was
posted near the door of the mosque to prevent any one from entering it.The sleeping men were aroused, and the fire smothered out with as great
care as possible, using for the purpose several earthen _ghurrahs_, or
jars of water, which the enemy had left under the trees near where we
were lying.When all was over, Colour-Sergeant Morton coolly proposed to the captain
to place me under arrest for having left the pile of arms after he, the
colour-sergeant, had refused to give me leave.To this proposal Captain
Dawson replied: "If any one deserves to be put under arrest it is you
yourself, Sergeant Morton, for not having explored the mosque and
discovered the gunpowder while Corporal Mitchell and I were posting the
sentries; and if this neglect comes to the notice of either Colonel Hay
or the Commander-in-Chief, both you and I are likely to hear more about
it; so the less you say about the matter the better!"This ended the
discussion and my adventure, and at the time I was glad to hear nothing
more about it, but I have sometimes since thought that if the part I
acted in this crisis had come to the knowledge of either Colonel Hay or
Sir Colin Campbell, my burnt hand would have brought me something more
than a proposal to place me under arrest, and take my corporal's stripes
from me!Be that as it may, I got a fright that I have never forgotten,
and, as already mentioned, even to this day I often dream of it, and
wake up with a sudden start, the cold perspiration in great beads on my
face, as I think I see again the huge black heap of powder in front of
me.After a sentry had been posted on the mosque and the fire put out, a
glass lantern was discovered in one of the rooms, and Captain Dawson
and I, with an escort of three or four men, made the circuit of the
walls, searching every room.I remember one of the escort was James
Wilson, the same man who wished to bayonet the Hindoo _jogie_ in the
village who afterwards shot poor Captain Mayne as told in my fourth
chapter.As Wilson was peering into one of the rooms, a concealed sepoy
struck him over the head with his _tulwar_, but the feather bonnet saved
his scalp as it had saved many more that day, and Captain Dawson being
armed with a pair of double-barrelled pistols, put a bullet through the
sepoy before he had time to make another cut at Wilson.In the same room
I found a good cotton quilt which I promptly annexed to replace my lost
greatcoat.After all was quiet, the men rolled off to sleep again, and wrapping
round my legs my newly-acquired quilt, which was lined with silk and had
evidently belonged to a rebel officer, I too lay down and tried to
sleep.My nerves were however too much shaken, and the pain of my burnt
hand kept me awake, so I lay and listened to the men sleeping around me;
and what a night that was!Had I the descriptive powers of a Tennyson or
a Scott I might draw a picture of it, but as it is I can only very
faintly attempt to make my readers imagine what it was like.The
horrible scenes through which the men had passed during the day had told
with terrible effect on their nervous systems, and the struggles,--eye
to eye, foot to foot, and steel to steel--with death in the
Secundrabagh, were fought over again by most of the men in their sleep,
oaths and shouts of defiance often curiously intermingled with prayers.One man would be lying calmly sleeping and commence muttering something
inaudible, and then break out into a fierce battle-cry of "Cawnpore, you
bloody murderer!";
and a third, "Keep together, boys, don't fire; forward, forward; if we
are to die, let us die like men!"Then I would hear one muttering, "Oh,
mother, forgive me, and I'll never leave you again!"; while his comrade
would half rise up, wave his hand, and call, "There they are!Fire low,
give them the bayonet!And so it was throughout that
memorable night inside the Shah Nujeef; and I have no doubt but it was
the same with the men holding the other posts.The pain of my burnt hand
and the terrible fright I had got kept me awake, and I lay and listened
till nearly daybreak; but at length completely worn out, I, too, dosed
off into a disturbed slumber, and I suppose I must have behaved in much
the same way as those I had been listening to, for I dreamed of blood
and battle, and then my mind would wander to scenes on Dee and Don side,
and to the Braemar and Lonach gathering, and from that the scene would
suddenly change, and I was a little boy again, kneeling beside my
mother, saying my evening-hymn.Verily that night convinced me that
Campbell's _Soldier's Dream_ is no mere fiction, but must have been
written or dictated from actual experience by one who had passed
through such another day of excitement and danger as that of the 16th
of November, 1857.My dreams were rudely broken into by the crash of a round-shot through
the top of the tree under which I was lying, and I jumped up repeating
aloud the seventh verse of the ninety-first Psalm, Scotch version:

    A thousand at thy side shall fall,
      On thy right hand shall lie
    Ten thousand dead; yet unto thee
      It shall not once come nigh.Captain Dawson and the sergeants of the company had been astir long
before, and a party of ordnance-lascars from the ammunition park and
several warrant-officers of the Ordnance-Department were busy removing
the gunpowder from the tomb of the Shah Nujeef.Over sixty _maunds_[24]
of loose powder were filled into bags and carted out, besides twenty
barrels of the ordinary size of powder-barrels, and more than one
hundred and fifty loaded 8-inch shells.The work of removal was scarcely
completed before the enemy commenced firing shell and red-hot round-shot
from their batteries in the Badshahibagh across the Goomtee, aimed
straight for the door of the tomb facing the river, showing that they
believed the powder was still there, and that they hoped they might
manage to blow us all up.FOOTNOTES:

BREAKFAST UNDER DIFFICULTIES--LONG SHOTS--THE LITTLE DRUMMER--EVACUATION
OF THE RESIDENCY BY THE GARRISON


By this time several of the old campaigners had kindled a fire in one of
the small rooms, through the roof of which one of our shells had fallen
the day before, making a convenient chimney for the egress of the smoke.They had found a large copper pot which had been left by the sepoys, and
had it on the fire filled with a stew of about a score or more of
pigeons which had been left shut up in a dovecot in a corner of the
compound.There were also plenty of pumpkins and other vegetables in the
rooms, and piles of _chupatties_ which had been cooked by the sepoys for
their evening meal before they fled.Everything in fact was there for
making a good breakfast for hungry men except salt, and there was no
salt to be found in any of the rooms; but as luck favoured us, I had one
of the old-fashioned round cylinder-shaped wooden match-boxes full of
salt in my haversack, which was more than sufficient to season the stew.I had carried this salt from Cawnpore, and I did so by the advice of an
old veteran who had served in the Ninety-Second Gordon Highlanders all
through the Peninsular war, and finally at Waterloo.When as a boy I had
often listened to his stories and told him that I would also enlist for
a soldier, he had given me this piece of practical advice, which I in my
turn present to every young soldier and volunteer.It is this: "Always
carry a box of salt in your haversack when on active service; because
the commissariat department is usually in the rear, and as a rule when
an army is pressed for food the men have often the chance of getting
hold of a bullock or a sheep, or of fowls, etc., but it is more
difficult to find salt, and even good food without salt is very
unpalatable."I remembered the advice, and it proved of great service to
myself and comrades in many instances during the Mutiny.As it was,
thanks to my foresight the hungry men in the Shah Nujeef made a good
breakfast on the morning of the 17th of November, 1857.I may here say
that my experience is that the soldiers who could best look after their
stomachs were also those who could make the best use of the bayonet, and
who were the least likely to fall behind in a forced march.If I had the
command of an army in the field my rule would be: "Cut the grog, and
give double grub when hard work has to be done!"After making a good breakfast the men were told off in sections, and we
discharged our rifles at the enemy across the Goomtee,[25] and then
spunged them out, which they sorely needed, because they had not been
cleaned from the day we advanced from the Alumbagh.Our rifles had in
fact got so foul with four days' heavy work that it was almost
impossible to load them, and the recoil had become so great that the
shoulders of many of the men were perfectly black with bruises.As soon
as our rifles were cleaned, a number of the best shots in the company
were selected to try and silence the fire from the battery in the
Badshahibagh across the river, which was annoying us by endeavouring to
pitch hot shot and shell into the tomb, and to shorten the distance they
had brought their guns outside the gate on to the open ground.They
evidently as yet did not understand the range of the Enfield rifle, as
they now came within about a thousand to twelve hundred yards of the
wall of the Shah Nujeef next the river.Some twenty of the best shots in
the company, with carefully cleaned and loaded rifles, watched till they
saw a good number of the enemy near their guns, then, raising sights to
the full height and carefully aiming high, they fired a volley by word
of command slowly given--_one, two, fire!_ and about half a dozen of the
enemy were knocked over.They at once withdrew their guns inside the
Badshahibagh and shut the gate, and did not molest us any more.During the early part of the forenoon we had several men struck by rifle
bullets fired from one of the minarets in the Motee Mahal, which was
said to be occupied by one of the ex-King of Oude's eunuchs who was a
first-rate marksman, and armed with an excellent rifle; from his
elevated position in the minaret he could see right into the square of
the Shah Nujeef.We soon had several men wounded, and as there was no
surgeon with us Captain Dawson sent me back to where the field-hospital
was formed near the Secundrabagh, to ask Dr.Munro if an
assistant-surgeon could be spared for our post.Munro told me to
tell Captain Dawson that it was impossible to spare an assistant-surgeon
or even an apothecary, because he had just been informed that the
Mess-House and Motee Mahal were to be assaulted at two o'clock, and
every medical officer would be required on the spot; but he would try
and send a hospital-attendant with a supply of lint and bandages.By the
time I got back the assault on the Mess-House had begun, and Sergeant
Findlay, before mentioned, was sent with a _dooly_ and a supply of
bandages, lint, and dressing, to do the best he could for any of ours
who might be wounded.About half an hour after the assault on the Mess-House had commenced a
large body of the enemy, numbering at least six or seven hundred men,
whose retreat had evidently been cut off from the city, crossed from the
Mess-House into the Motee Mahal in our front, and forming up under cover
of some huts between the Shah Munzil and Motee Mahal, they evidently
made up their minds to try and retake the Shah Nujeef.They debouched on
the plain with a number of men in front carrying scaling-ladders, and
Captain Dawson being on the alert ordered all the men to kneel down
behind the loopholes with rifles sighted for five hundred yards, and
wait for the word of command.It was now our turn to know what it felt
like to be behind loopholed walls, and we calmly awaited the enemy,
watching them forming up for a dash on our position.The silence was
profound, when Sergeant Daniel White repeated aloud a passage from the
third canto of Scott's _Bridal of Triermain_:

    Bewcastle now must keep the Hold,
      Speir-Adam's steeds must bide in stall,
    Of Hartley-burn the bowmen bold
      Must only shoot from battled wall;
    And Liddesdale may buckle spur,
      And Teviot now may belt the brand,
    Taras and Ewes keep nightly stir,
      And Eskdale foray Cumberland.Of wasted fields and plunder'd flocks
      The Borderers bootless may complain;
    They lack the sword of brave De Vaux,
      There comes no aid from Triermain.Captain Dawson, who had been steadily watching the advance of the enemy
and carefully calculating their distance, just then called "Attention,
five hundred yards, ready--_one, two, fire!_" when over eighty rifles
rang out, and almost as many of the enemy went down like ninepins on the
plain!Their leader was in front, mounted on a finely-accoutred charger,
and he and his horse were evidently both hit; he at once wheeled round
and made for the Goomtee, but horse and man both fell before they got
near the river.After the first volley every man loaded and fired
independently, and the plain was soon strewn with dead and wounded.The unfortunate assaulters were now between two fires, for the force
that had attacked the Shah Munzil and Motee Mahal commenced to send
grape and canister into their rear, so the routed rebels threw away
their arms and scaling-ladders, and all that were able to do so bolted
pell-mell for the Goomtee.Only about a quarter of the original number,
however, reached the opposite bank, for when they were in the river our
men rushed to the corner nearest to them and kept peppering at every
head above water.One tall fellow, I well remember, acted as cunningly
as a jackal; whether struck or not he fell just as he got into shallow
water on the opposite side, and lay without moving, with his legs in the
water and his head on the land.He appeared to be stone dead, and every
rifle was turned on those that were running across the plain for the
gate of the Badshahibagh, while many others who were evidently severely
wounded were fired on as our fellows said, "_in mercy to put them out of
pain_."I have previously remarked that the war of the Mutiny was a
horrible, I may say a demoralising, war for civilised men to be engaged
in.The inhuman murders and foul treachery of the Nana Sahib and others
put all feeling of humanity or mercy for the enemy out of the question,
and our men thus early spoke of putting a wounded Jack Pandy _out of
pain_, just as calmly as if he had been a wild beast; it was even
considered an act of mercy.It is now horrible to recall it all, but
what I state is true.The only excuse is that _we_ did not begin this
war of extermination; and no apologist for the mutineers can say that
they were actuated by patriotism to throw off the yoke of the oppressor.The cold-blooded cruelty of the mutineers and their leaders from first
to last branded them in fact as traitors to humanity and cowardly
assassins of helpless women and children.But to return to the Pandy
whom I left lying half-covered with water on the further bank of the
Goomtee opposite the Shah Nujeef.This particular man was ever after
spoken of as the "jackal," because jackals and foxes have often been
known to sham dead and wait for a chance of escape; and so it was with
Jack Pandy.After he had lain apparently dead for about an hour, some
one noticed that he had gradually dragged himself out of the water; till
all at once he sprang to his feet, and ran like a deer in the direction
of the gate of the Badshahibagh.He was still quite within easy range,
and several rifles were levelled at him; but Sergeant Findlay, who was
on the rampart, and was himself one of the best shots in the company,
called out, "Don't fire, men; give the poor devil a chance!"Instead of
a volley of bullets, the men's better feelings gained the day, and Jack
Pandy was reprieved, with a cheer to speed him on his way.As soon as he
heard it he realised his position, and like the Samaritan leper of old,
he halted, turned round, and putting up both his hands with the palms
together in front of his face, he salaamed profoundly, prostrating
himself three times on the ground by way of thanks, and then _walked_
slowly towards the Badshahibagh, while we on the ramparts waved our
feather bonnets and clapped our hands to him in token of good-will.I
have often wondered if that particular Pandy ever after fought the
English, or if he returned to his village to relate his exceptional
experience of our clemency.Just at this time we noticed a great commotion in front, and heard our
fellows and even those in the Residency cheering like mad.The cause we
shortly after learned; that the generals, Sir Colin Campbell, Havelock,
and Outram had met.The Residency was relieved and the women and
children were saved, although not yet out of danger, and every man in
the force slept with a lighter heart that night.If the cost was heavy,
the gain was great.I may here mention that there is an entry in my note-book, dated 18th of
November 1857: "That Lieutenant Fred.Roberts planted the Union Jack
three times on the top of the Mess-House as a signal to the force in the
Residency that the Mess-House was in our possession, and it was as often
shot down."Some time ago there was, I remember, a dispute about who was
entitled to the credit of this action.Now I did not see it myself, but
I must have got the information from some of the men of the other
companies who witnessed the deed, as it was known that I was keeping a
rough diary of the leading events.Such was the glorious issue of the 17th of November.The meeting of the
Generals, Sir Colin Campbell, Outram, and Havelock, proved that Lucknow
was relieved and the women and children were safe; but to accomplish
this object our small force had lost no less than forty-five officers
and four hundred and ninety-six men--more than a tenth of our whole
number!The brunt of the loss fell on the Artillery and Naval Brigade,
and on the Fifty-Third, the Ninety-Third, and the Fourth Punjab
Infantry.These losses were respectively as follows:

 Artillery and Naval Brigade         105 Men
 Fifty-Third Regiment                 76  "
 Ninety-Third Highlanders            108  "
 Fourth Punjab Infantry               95  "
                                     ---
                   Total             384

leaving one hundred and twelve to be divided among the other corps
engaged.In writing mostly from memory thirty-five years after the events
described, many incidents, though not entirely forgotten, escape being
noticed in their proper sequence, and that is the case with the
following, which I must here relate before I enter on the evacuation of
the Residency.Immediately after the powder left by the enemy had been removed from the
tomb of the Shah Nujeef, and the sun had dispelled the fog which rested
over the Goomtee and the city, it was deemed necessary to signal to the
Residency to let them know our position, and for this purpose our
adjutant, Lieutenant William M'Bean, Sergeant Hutchinson, and Drummer
Ross, a boy of about twelve years of age but even small for his years,
climbed to the top of the dome of the Shah Nujeef by means of a rude
rope-ladder which was fixed on it; thence with the regimental colour of
the Ninety-Third and a feather bonnet on the tip of the staff they
signalled to the Residency, and the little drummer sounded the
regimental call on his bugle from the top of the dome.The signal was
seen, and answered from the Residency by lowering their flag three
times.But the enemy on the Badshahibagh also saw the signalling and the
daring adventurers on the dome, and turned their guns on them, sending
several round-shots quite close to them.Their object being gained,
however, our men descended; but little Ross ran up the ladder again like
a monkey, and holding on to the spire of the dome with his left hand he
waved his feather bonnet and then sounded the regimental call a second
time, which he followed by the call known as _The Cock of the North_,
which he sounded as a blast of defiance to the enemy.When peremptorily
ordered to come down by Lieutenant M'Bean, he did so, but not before the
little monkey had tootled out--

    There's not a man beneath the moon,
      Nor lives in any land he,
    That hasn't heard the pleasant tune
      Of Yankee Doodle Dandy!In cooling drinks and clipper ships,
      The Yankee has the way shown,
    On land and sea 'tis he that whips
      Old Bull, and all creation.When little Ross reached the parapet at the foot of the dome, he turned
to Lieutenant M'Bean and said: "Ye ken, sir, I was born when the
regiment was in Canada when my mother was on a visit to an aunt in the
States, and I could not come down till I had sung _Yankee Doodle_, to
make my American cousins envious when they hear of the deeds of the
Ninety-Third.Won't the Yankees feel jealous when they hear that the
littlest drummer-boy in the regiment sang _Yankee Doodle_ under a hail
of fire on the dome of the highest mosque in Lucknow!"As mentioned in the last chapter, the Residency was relieved on the
afternoon of the 17th of November, and the following day preparations
were made for the evacuation of the position and the withdrawal of the
women and children.To do this in safety however was no easy task, for
the mutineers and rebels showed but small regard for the laws of
chivalry; a man might pass an exposed position in comparative safety,
but if a helpless woman or little child were seen, they were made the
target for a hundred bullets.So far as we could see from the Shah
Nujeef, the line of retreat was pretty well sheltered till the refugees
emerged from the Motee Mahal; but between that and the Shah Nujeef there
was a long stretch of plain, exposed to the fire of the enemy's
artillery and sharp-shooters from the opposite side of the Goomtee.To
protect this part of their route a flying sap was constructed: a battery
of artillery and some of Peel's guns, with a covering force of infantry,
were posted in the north-east corner of the Motee Mahal; and all the
best shots in the Shah Nujeef were placed on the north-west corner of
the ramparts next to the Goomtee.These men were under command of
Sergeant Findlay, who, although nominally our medical officer, stuck to
his post on the ramparts, and being one of the best shots in the company
was entrusted with the command of the sharp-shooters for the protection
of the retreating women and children.From these two points,--the
north-east corner of the Motee Mahal and the north-west of the Shah
Nujeef--the enemy on the north bank of the Goomtee were brought under a
cross-fire, the accuracy of which made them keep a very respectful
distance from the river, with the result that the women and children
passed the exposed part of their route without a single casualty.I
remember one remarkably good shot made by Sergeant Findlay.He unhorsed
a rebel officer close to the east gate of the Badshahibagh, who came out
with a force of infantry and a couple of guns to open fire on the line
of retreat; but he was no sooner knocked over than the enemy retreated
into the _bagh_, and did not show themselves any more that day.By midnight of the 22nd of November the Residency was entirely
evacuated, and the enemy completely deceived as to the movements; and
about two o'clock on the morning of the 23rd we withdrew from the Shah
Nujeef and became the rear-guard of the retreating column, making our
way slowly past the Secundrabagh, the stench from which, as can easily
be imagined, was something frightful.I have seen it stated in print
that the two thousand odd of the enemy killed in the Secundrabagh were
dragged out and buried in deep trenches outside the enclosure.The European slain were removed and buried in a deep
trench, where the mound is still visible, to the east of the gate, and
the Punjabees recovered their slain and cremated them near the bank of
the Goomtee.But the rebel dead had to be left to rot where they lay, a
prey to the vulture by day and the jackal by night, for from the
smallness of the relieving force no other course was possible; in fact,
it was with the greatest difficulty that men could be spared from the
piquets,--for the whole force simply became a series of outlying
piquets--to bury our own dead, let alone those of the enemy.And when we
retired their friends did not take the trouble, as the skeletons were
still whitening in the rooms of the buildings when the Ninety-Third
returned to the siege of Lucknow in March, 1858.Their bones were
doubtless buried after the fall of Lucknow, but that would be at least
six months after their slaughter.By daylight on the 23rd of November
the whole of the women and children had arrived at the Dilkoosha, where
tents were pitched for them, and the rear-guard had reached the
Martiniere.Here the rolls were called again to see if any were missing,
when it was discovered that Sergeant Alexander Macpherson, of No.2
company, who had formed one of Colonel Ewart's detachment in the
barracks, was not present.Shortly afterwards he was seen making his way
across the plain, and reported that he had been left asleep in the
barracks, and, on waking up after daylight and finding himself alone,
guessed what had happened, and knowing the direction in which the column
was to retire, he at once followed.Fortunately the enemy had not even
then discovered the evacuation of the Residency, for they were still
firing into our old positions.Sergeant Macpherson was ever after this
known in the regiment as "Sleepy Sandy."There was also an officer, Captain Waterman, left asleep in the
Residency.He, too, managed to join the rear-guard in safety; but he got
such a fright that I afterwards saw it stated in one of the Calcutta
papers that his mind was affected by the shock to his nervous system.Some time later an Irishman in the Ninety-Third gave a good reason why
the fright did not turn the head of Sandy Macpherson.In those days
before the railway it took much longer than now for the mails to get
from Cawnpore to Calcutta, and for Calcutta papers to get back again;
and some time,--about a month or six weeks--after the events above
related, when the Calcutta papers got back to camp with the accounts of
the relief of Lucknow, I and Sergeant Macpherson were on outlying piquet
at Futtehghur (I think), and the captain of the piquet gave me a bundle
of the newspapers to read out to the men.In these papers there was an
account of Captain Waterman's being left behind in the Residency, in
which it was stated that the shock had affected his intellect.When I
read this out, the men made some remarks concerning the fright which it
must have given Sandy Macpherson when he found himself alone in the
barracks, and Sandy joining in the remarks, was inclined to boast that
the fright had not upset _his_ intellect, when an Irishman of the
piquet, named Andrew M'Onville, usually called "Handy Andy" in the
company, joining in the conversation, said: "Boys, if Sergeant
Macpherson will give me permission, I will tell you a story that will
show the reason why the fright did not upset his intellect."Permission
was of course granted for the story, and Handy Andy proceeded with his
illustration as follows, as nearly as I can remember it.Gough, the great American Temperance
lecturer.Well, the year before I enlisted he came to Armagh, giving a
course of temperance lectures, and all the public-house keepers and
brewers were up in arms to raise as much opposition as possible against
Mr.Gough and his principles, and in one of his lectures he laid great
stress on the fact that he considered moderation the parent of
drunkenness.A brewer's drayman thereupon went on the platform to
disprove this assertion by actual facts from his own experience, and in
his argument in favour of _moderate_ drinking, he stated that for
upwards of twenty years he had habitually consumed over a gallon of beer
and about a pint of whisky daily, and solemnly asserted that he had
never been the worse for liquor in his life.Gough replied:
'My friends, there is no rule without its exception, and our friend here
is an exception to the general rule of moderate drinking; but I will
tell you a story that I think exactly illustrates his case.Some years
ago, when I was a boy, my father had two <DW64> servants, named Uncle
<DW71> and Snowball.Near our house there was a branch of one of the
large fresh-water lakes which swarmed with fish, and it was the duty of
Snowball to go every morning to catch sufficient for the breakfast of
the household.The way Snowball usually caught his fish was by making
them drunk by feeding them with Indian corn-meal mixed with strong
whisky and rolled into balls.When these whisky balls were thrown into
the water the fish came and ate them readily, but after they had
swallowed a few they became helplessly drunk, turning on their backs and
allowing themselves to be caught, so that in a very short time Snowball
would return with his basket full of fish.But as I said, there is no
rule without an exception, and one morning proved that there is also an
exception in the matter of fish becoming drunk.As usual Snowball went
to the lake with an allowance of whisky balls, and spying a fine big
fish with a large flat head, he dropped a ball in front of it, which it
at once ate and then another, and another, and so on till all the whisky
balls in Snowball's basket were in the stomach of this queer fish, and
still it showed no signs of becoming drunk, but kept wagging its tail
and looking for more whisky balls.On this Snowball returned home and
called old Uncle <DW71> to come and see this wonderful fish which had
swallowed nearly a peck of whisky balls and still was not drunk.When
old Uncle <DW71> set eyes on the fish, he exclaimed, "O Snowball,
Snowball!you foolish boy, you will never be able to make that fish
drunk with your whisky balls.That fish could live in a barrel of whisky
and not get drunk.That fish, my son, is called a mullet-head: it has
got no brains."Gough, turning to the
brewer's drayman, 'for our friend here being able for twenty years to
drink a gallon of beer and a pint of whisky daily and never become
drunk.'And so, my chums," said Handy Andy, "if you will apply the same
reasoning to the cases of Sergeant Macpherson and Captain Waterman I
think you will come to the correct conclusion why the fright did not
upset the intellect of Sergeant Macpherson."We all joined in the laugh
at Handy Andy's story, and none more heartily than the butt of it, Sandy
Macpherson himself.Shortly after the roll was called at the
Martiniere, a most unfortunate accident took place.Corporal Cooper and
four or five men went into one of the rooms of the Martiniere in which
there was a quantity of loose powder which had been left by the enemy,
and somehow,--it was never known how--the powder got ignited and they
were all blown up, their bodies completely charred and their eyes
scorched out.The poor fellows all died in the greatest agony within an
hour or so of the accident, and none of them ever spoke to say how it
happened.The quantity of powder was not sufficient to shatter the
house, but it blew the doors and windows out, and burnt the poor fellows
as black as charcoal.This sad accident cast a gloom over the regiment,
and made me again very mindful of and thankful for my own narrow
escape, and that of my comrades in the Shah Nujeef on that memorable
night of the 16th of November.Later in the day our sadness increased when it was found that
Colour-Sergeant Alexander Knox, of No.He had
called the roll of his company at daylight, and had then gone to see a
friend in the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders.He had stayed some time with
his friend and left to return to his own regiment, but was never heard
of again.Poor Knox had two brothers in the regiment, and he was the
youngest of the three.He was a most deserving and popular
non-commissioned officer, decorated with the French war medal and the
Cross of the Legion of Honour for valour in the Crimea, and was about to
be promoted sergeant-major of the regiment, _vice_ Murray killed in the
Secundrabagh.About two o'clock in the afternoon, the regiment being all together
again, the following general order was read to us, and although this is
well-known history, still there must be many of the readers of these
reminiscences who have not ready access to histories.I will therefore
quote the general order in question for the information of young
soldiers.HEADQUARTERS, LA MARTINIERE, LUCKNOW, _23rd
      November, 1857_.The Commander-in-Chief has reason to be thankful to the
      force he conducted for the relief of the garrison of
      Lucknow.Hastily assembled, fatigued by forced marches, but
      animated by a common feeling of determination to accomplish
      the duty before them, all ranks of this force have
      compensated for their small number, in the execution of a
      most difficult duty, by unceasing exertions.From the morning of the 16th till last night the whole
      force has been one outlying piquet, never out of fire, and
      covering an immense extent of ground, to permit the garrison
      to retire scatheless and in safety covered by the whole of
      the relieving force.That ground was won by fighting as hard as it ever fell
      to the lot of the Commander-in-Chief to witness, it being
      necessary to bring up the same men over and over again to
      fresh attacks; and it is with the greatest gratification
      that his Excellency declares he never saw men behave better.The storming of the Secundrabagh and the Shah Nujeef has
      never been surpassed in daring, and the success of it was
      most brilliant and complete.The movement of retreat of last night, by which the final
      rescue of the garrison was effected, was a model of
      discipline and exactness.The consequence was that the enemy
      was completely deceived, and the force retired by a narrow,
      tortuous lane, the only line of retreat open, in the face of
      50,000 enemies, without molestation.The Commander-in-Chief offers his sincere thanks to
      Major-General Sir James Outram, G.C.B., for the happy manner
      in which he planned and carried out his arrangements for the
      evacuation of the Residency of Lucknow.By order of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief,
                                   W. MAYHEW, _Major_,
                        _Deputy Adjutant-General of the Army_.Thus were achieved the relief and evacuation of the Residency of
Lucknow.[26] The enemy did not discover that the Residency was deserted
till noon on the 23rd, and about the time the above general order was
being read to us they fired a salute of one hundred and one guns, but
did not attempt to follow us or to cut off our retreat.That night we
bivouacked in the Dilkoosha park, and retired on the Alumbagh on the
25th, the day on which the brave and gallant Havelock died.But that is
a well-known part of the history of the relief of Lucknow, and I will
turn to other matters.FOOTNOTES:

[25] It may be necessary to remind civilians that the rifles of 1857
were muzzle-loading.[26] It must always be recollected that this was the _second_ relief of
Lucknow.The first was effected by the force under Havelock and Outram
on the 25th September, 1857, and was in fact more of a reinforcement
than a relief.CHAPTER VII

BAGPIPES AT LUCKNOW--A BEWILDERED BABOO--THE FORCED MARCH TO
CAWNPORE--OPIUM--WYNDHAM'S MISTAKE


Since commencing these reminiscences, and more particularly during my
late visit to Lucknow and Cawnpore, I have been asked by several people
about the truth of the story of the Scotch girl and the bagpipes at
Lucknow, and in reply to all such inquiries I can only make the
following answer.About the time of the anniversary dinner in celebration of the relief of
Lucknow, in September, 1891, some writers in the English papers went so
far as to deny that the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders had their bagpipes
with them at Lucknow, and in _The Calcutta Statesman_ of the 18th of
October, 1891, I wrote a letter contradicting this assertion, which with
the permission of the editor I propose to republish in this chapter.But
I may first mention that on my late visit to Lucknow a friend showed me
a copy of the original edition of _A Personal Narrative of the Siege of
Lucknow_, by L. E. R. Rees, one of the surviving defenders, which I had
never before seen, and on page 224 the following statement is given
regarding the entry of Havelock's force.After describing the prevailing
excitement the writer goes on to say: "The shrill tones of the
Highlanders' bagpipes now pierced our ears; not the most beautiful music
was ever more welcome or more joy-bringing," and so on.Further on, on
page 226: "The enemy found some of us dancing to the sounds of the
Highlanders' pipes.The remembrance of that happy evening will never be
effaced from my memory."While yet again, on page 237, he gives the
story related by me below about the Highland piper putting some of the
enemy's cavalry to flight by a blast from his pipes.So much in proof of
the fact that the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders had their bagpipes with
them, and played them too, at the first relief of Lucknow.I must now devote a few remarks to the incident of Jessie Brown, which
Grace Campbell has immortalised in the song known as _Jessie's Dream_.In the _Indian Empire_, by R. Montgomery Martin, vol.page 470,
after denying that this story had its origin in Lucknow, the author
gives the following foot-note: "It was originally a little romance,
written by a French governess at Jersey for the use of her pupils; which
found its way into a Paris paper, thence to the _Jersey Times_, thence
to the London _Times_, December 12th, 1857, and afterwards appeared in
nearly all the journals of the United Kingdom."With regard to this
remark, I am positive that I heard the story in Lucknow in November,
1857, at the same time as I heard the story about the piper frightening
the enemy's _sowars_ with his bagpipes; and it appears a rather
far-fetched theory about a French governess inventing the story in
Jersey.What was the name of this governess, and, above all, why go for
its origin to such an out-of-the-way place as Jersey?I doubt very much
if it was possible for the news of the relief of Lucknow to have reached
Jersey, and for the said French governess to have composed and printed
such a romance in time for its roundabout publication in _The Times_ of
the 12th of December, 1857.This version of the origin of _Jessie's
Dream_ therefore to my thinking carries its own refutation on the face
of it, and I should much like to see the story in its original French
form before I believe it.Be that as it may, in the letters published in the home papers, and
quoted in _The Calcutta Statesman_ in October, 1891, one lady gave the
positive statement of a certain Mrs.Gaffney, then living in London, who
asserted that she was, if I remember rightly, in the same compartment of
the Residency with Jessie Brown at the very time the latter said that
she heard the bagpipes when dull English ears could detect nothing
besides the accustomed roar of the cannon.Her husband, Sergeant Gaffney, served with me in the Commissariat
Department in Peshawur just after the Mutiny, and I was present as his
best man when he married Mrs.I forget now what was the name of
her first husband, but she was a widow when Sergeant Gaffney married
her.I think her first husband was a sergeant of the Company's
Artillery, who was either killed in the defence of the Residency or
died shortly after.Gaffney either in the end
of 1860 or beginning of 1861, and I have often heard her relate the
incident of Jessie Brown's hearing the bagpipes in the underground
cellar, or _tykhana_, of the Residency, hours before any one would
believe that a force was coming to their relief, when in the words of
J. B. S. Boyle, the garrison were repeating in dull despair the lines so
descriptive of their state:

    No news from the outer world!Days, weeks, and months have sped;
    Pent up within our battlements,
    We seem as living dead.Have British soldiers quailed
    Before the rebel mutineers?--
    Has British valour failed?If the foregoing facts do not convince my readers of the truth of the
origin of _Jessie's Dream_ I cannot give them any more.I am positive on
the point that the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders _had_ their bagpipes and
pipers with them in Lucknow, and that I first heard the story of
_Jessie's Dream_ on the 23rd of November, 1857, on the Dilkoosha heights
before Lucknow.The following is my letter of the 18th of October, 1891,
on the subject, addressed to the editor of _The Calcutta Statesman_.SIR,--In an issue of the _Statesman_ of last week
      there was a letter from Deputy-Inspector-General Joseph Jee,
      V.C., C.B., late of the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders
      (Ross-shire Buffs), recopied from an English paper,
      contradicting a report that had been published to the
      effect that the bagpipes of the Seventy-Eighth had been left
      behind at Cawnpore when the regiment went with General
      Havelock to the first relief of Lucknow; and I write to
      support the assertion of Deputy-Inspector-General Jee that
      if any late pipe-major or piper of the old Seventy-Eighth
      has ever made such an assertion, he must be mad!I was not
      in the Seventy-Eighth myself, but in the Ninety-Third, the
      regiment which saved the "Saviours of India" (as the
      Seventy-Eighth were then called), and rescued them from the
      Residency, and I am positive that the Seventy-Eighth had
      their bagpipes and pipers too inside the Residency; for I
      well remember they struck up the same tunes as the pipers of
      the Ninety-Third, on the memorable 16th of November, 1857.I
      recollect the fact as if it were only yesterday.When the
      din of battle had ceased for a time, and the roll of the
      Ninety-Third was being called outside the Secundrabagh to
      ascertain how many had fallen in that memorable combat,
      which Sir Colin Campbell said had "never been surpassed and
      rarely equalled," Pipe-Major John McLeod called me aside to
      listen to the pipers of the Seventy-Eighth, inside the
      Residency, playing _On wi' the Tartan_, and I could hear the
      pipes quite distinctly, although, except for the practised
      _lug_ of John McLeod, I could not have told the tune.However, I don't suppose there are many now living fitter to
      give evidence on the subject than Doctor Jee; but I may
      mention another incident.The morning after the Residency
      was evacuated, I visited the bivouac of the Seventy-Eighth
      near Dilkoosha, to make inquiries about an old school chum
      who had enlisted in the regiment.I found him still alive,
      and he related to me how he had been one of the men who were
      with Dr.Jee collecting the wounded in the streets of
      Lucknow on the 26th of September, and how they had been cut
      off from the main body and besieged in a house the whole
      night, and Dr.Jee was the only officer with the party, and
      that he had been recommended for the Victoria Cross for his
      bravery in defending the place and saving a large number of
      the wounded.I may mention another incident which my friend
      told me, and which has not been so much noticed as the
      Jessie Brown story.It was told to me as a fact at the time,
      and it afterwards appeared in a Glasgow newspaper.It was as
      follows: When Dr.Jee's detachment and the wounded were
      fighting their way to the Residency, a wounded piper and
      three others who had fired their last round of ammunition
      were charged by half-a-dozen rebel _sowars_[27] in a side
      street, and the three men with rifles prepared to defend
      themselves with the bayonet; but as soon as the _sowars_
      were within about twenty paces of the party, the piper
      pointed the drones of his bagpipes straight at them and blew
      such a wild blast that they turned tail and fled like the
      wind, mistaking the bagpipes for some infernal machine!But
      enough of Lucknow.Who
      ever heard of a Highland regiment going into action without
      their bagpipes and pipers, unless the latter were all
      "kilt"?John moved to the garden.No officer who ever commanded Highlanders knew the
      worth of a good piper better than Colonel John Cameron, "the
      grandson of Lochiel, the valiant Fassifern."And is there a
      Highland soldier worthy of the name who has not heard of his
      famous favourite piper who was shot at Cameron's side when
      playing the charge, while crossing the Nive in face of the
      French?The historian of the Peninsula war relates: "When
      the Ninety-Second Highlanders were in the middle of the
      stream, Colonel Cameron's favourite piper was shot by his
      side.Stooping from his saddle, Fassifern tried to rescue
      the body of the man who had so often cheered the regiment to
      victory, but in vain: the lifeless corpse was swept away by
      the torrent.cried the brave Cameron, dashing the
      tears from his eyes, 'I would rather have lost twenty
      grenadiers than you.'"Let us next turn to McDonald's
      _Martial Music of Scotland_, and we read: "The bagpipes are
      sacred to Scotland and speak a language which Scotchmen only
      know, and inspire feelings which Scotchmen only feel.Need
      it be told to how many fields of danger and victory the
      warlike strains of the bagpipes have led?There is not a
      battlefield that is honourable to Britain where their
      war-blast has not sounded!When every other instrument has
      been silenced by the confusion and the carnage of the scene,
      the bagpipes have been borne into the thick of battle, and
      many a devoted piper has sounded at once encouragement to
      his clansmen and his own _coronach_!"In the garb of old Gaul, with the fire of old Rome,
    From the heath-covered mountains of Scotia we come;
    Our loud-sounding pipe breathes the true martial strain,
    And our hearts still the old Scottish valour retain.We rested at the Alumbagh on the 26th of November, but early on the 27th
we understood something had gone wrong in our rear, because, as usual
with Sir Colin when he contemplated a forced march, we were served out
with three days' rations and double ammunition,--sixty rounds in our
pouches and sixty in our haversacks; and by two o'clock in the afternoon
the whole of the women and children, all the sick and wounded, in every
conceivable kind of conveyance, were in full retreat towards Cawnpore.General Outram's Division being made up to four thousand men was left in
the Alumbagh to hold the enemy in check, and to show them that Lucknow
was not abandoned, while three thousand fighting men, to guard over two
thousand women and children, sick and wounded, commenced their march
southwards.So far as I can remember the Third and Fifth Punjab Infantry
formed the infantry of the advance-guard; the Ninth Lancers and Horse
Artillery supplied the flanking parties; while the rear guard, being the
post of honour, was given to the Ninety-Third, a troop of the Ninth
Lancers and Bourchier's light field-battery, No.17 of the Honourable
East India Company's artillery.We started from the Alumbagh late in the
afternoon, and reached Bunnee Bridge, seventeen miles from Lucknow,
about 11 P.M.Here the regiment halted till daylight on the
morning of the 28th of November, but the advance-guard with the women
and children, sick and wounded, had been moving since 2 A.M.As already mentioned, all the subaltern officers in my company were
wounded, and I was told off, with a guard of about twenty men, to see
all the baggage-carts across Bunnee Bridge and on their way to Cawnpore.While I was on this duty an amusing incident happened.A commissariat
cart, a common country hackery, loaded with biscuits, got upset, and its
wheel broke just as we were moving it on to the road.The only person
near it belonging to the Commissariat Department was a young _baboo_
named Hera Lall Chatterjee, a boy of about seventeen or eighteen years
of age, who defended his charge as long as he could, but he was soon put
on one side, the biscuits-bags were ripped open, and the men commenced
filling their haversacks from them.Just at this time, an escort of the
Ninth Lancers, with some staff-officers, rode up from the rear.It was
the Commander-in-Chief and his staff.Hera Lall seeing him rushed up and
called out: "O my Lord, you are my father and my mother!These wild Highlanders will not hear me, but are stealing
commissariat biscuits like fine fun."Sir Colin pulled up, and asked the
_baboo_ if there was no officer present; to which Hera Lall replied, "No
officer, sir, only one corporal, and he tell me, 'Shut up, or I'll shoot
you, same like rebel mutineer!'"Hearing this I stepped out of the crowd
and saluting Sir Colin, told him that all the officers of my company
were wounded except Captain Dawson, who was in front; that I and a party
of men had been left to see the last of the carts on to the road; that
this cart had broken down, and as there was no other means of carrying
the biscuits, the men had filled their haversacks with them rather than
leave them on the ground.On hearing that, Hera Lall again came to the
front with clasped hands, saying: "O my Lord, if one cart of biscuits
short, Major Fitzgerald not listen to me, but will order thirty lashes
with provost-marshal's cat!What can a poor _baboo_ do with such wild
Highlanders?"Sir Colin replied: "Yes, _baboo_, I know these Highlanders
are very wild fellows when hungry; let them have the biscuits;" and
turning to one of the staff, he directed him to give a voucher to the
_baboo_ that a cart loaded with biscuits had broken down and the
contents had been divided among the rear-guard by order of the
Commander-in-Chief.Sir Colin then turned to us and said: "Men, I give
you the biscuits; divide them with your comrades in front; but you must
promise me should a cart loaded with rum break down, you will not
interfere with it."We all replied: "No, no, Sir Colin, if rum breaks
down we'll not touch it.""All right," said Sir Colin, "remember I trust
you," and looking round he said, "I know every one of you," and rode on.We very soon found room for the biscuits, until we got up to the rest of
the company, when we honestly shared them.I may add that _baboo_ Hera
Lall Chatterjee is still living, and is the only native employe I know
who served through the second relief of Lucknow.He now holds the post
of cashier in the offices of Messrs.McNeill and Co., of Clive Ghat
Street, Calcutta, which doubtless he finds more congenial employment
than defending commissariat stores from hungry wild Highlanders, with
the prospect of the provost-marshal's cat as the only reward for doing
his best to defend his charge.About five miles farther on a general halt was made for a short rest and
for all stragglers to come up.Sir Colin himself, being still with the
column, ordered the Ninety-Third to form up, and, calling the officers
to the front, he made the first announcement to the regiment that
General Wyndham had been attacked by the Nana Sahib and the Gwalior
Contingent in Cawnpore; that his force had been obliged to retire within
the fort at the head of the bridge of boats, and that we must reach
Cawnpore that night, because, if the bridge of boats should be captured
before we got there, we would be cut off in Oude with fifty thousand of
our enemies in our rear, a well-equipped army of forty thousand men,
with a powerful train of artillery numbering over forty siege guns, in
our front, and with all the women and children, sick and wounded, to
guard."So, Ninety-Third," said the grand old Chief, "I don't ask you to
undertake this forced march, in your present tired condition, without
good reason.You must reach Cawnpore to-night at all costs."And, as
usual, when he took the men into his confidence, he was answered from
the ranks, "All right, Sir Colin, we'll do it."To which he replied,
"Very well, Ninety-Third, remember I depend on you."And he and his
staff and escort rode on.By this time we could plainly hear the guns of the Gwalior Contingent
bombarding General Wyndham's position in Cawnpore; and although terribly
footsore and tired, not having had our clothes off, nor a change of
socks, since the 10th of the month (now eighteen days) we trudged on our
weary march, every mile making the roar of the guns in front more
audible.I may remark here that there is nothing to rouse tired soldiers
like a good cannonade in front; it is the best tonic out!Even the
youngest soldier who has once been under fire, and can distinguish the
sound of a shotted gun from blank, pricks up his ears at the sound and
steps out with a firmer tread and a more erect bearing.I shall never forget the misery of that march!However, we reached the
sands on the banks of the Ganges, on the Oude side of the river opposite
Cawnpore, just as the sun was setting, having covered the forty-seven
miles under thirty hours.Of course the great hardship of the march was
caused by our worn-out state after eighteen days' continual duty,
without a change of clothes or our accoutrements off.And when we got in
sight of Cawnpore, the first thing we saw was the enemy on the opposite
side of the river from us, making bonfires of our spare kits and baggage
which had been left at Cawnpore when we advanced for the relief of
Lucknow!Tired as we were, we assisted to drag Peel's heavy guns into
position on the banks of the river, whence the Blue-jackets opened fire
on the left flank of the enemy, the bonfires of our spare baggage being
a fine mark for them.Just as the Nana Sahib had got his first gun to bear on the bridge of
boats, that gun was struck on the side by one of Peel's 24-pounders and
upset, and an 8-inch shell from one of his howitzers bursting in the
midst of a crowd of them, we could see them bolting helter-skelter.This put a stop to their game for the night, and we lay down and rested
on the sands till daybreak next morning, the 29th of November.I must mention here an experience of my own which I always recall to
mind when I read some of the insane ravings of the Anti-Opium Society
against the use of that drug.I was so completely tired out by that
terrible march that after I had lain down for about half an hour I
positively could not stand up, I was so stiff and worn out.Having been
on duty as orderly corporal before leaving the Alumbagh, I had been much
longer on my feet than the rest of the men; in fact, I was tired out
before we started on our march on the afternoon of the 27th, and now,
after having covered forty-seven miles under thirty hours, my condition
can be better imagined than described.After I became cold, I grew so
stiff that I positively could not use my legs.Now Captain Dawson had a
native servant, an old man named Hyder Khan, who had been an officers'
servant all his life, and had been through many campaigns.I had made a
friend of old Hyder before we left Chinsurah, and he did not forget me.Having ridden the greater part of the march on the camel carrying his
master's baggage, Hyder was comparatively fresh when he got into camp,
and about the time our canteen-sergeant got up and was calling for
orderly-corporals to draw grog for the men, old Hyder came looking for
me, and when he saw my tired state, he said, in his camp English:
"Corporal _sahib_, you God-damn tired; don't drink grog.Old Hyder give
you something damn much better than grog for tired mans."With that he
went away, but shortly after returned, and gave me a small pill, which
he told me was opium, and about half a pint of hot tea, which he had
prepared for himself and his master.I swallowed the pill and drank the
tea, and _in less than ten minutes_ I felt myself so much refreshed as
to be able to get up and draw the grog for the men of the company and to
serve it out to them while the colour-sergeant called the roll.I then
lay down, rolled up in my sepoy officer's quilt, which I had carried
from the Shah Nujeef, and had a sound refreshing sleep till next
morning, and then got up so much restored that, except for the sores on
my feet from broken blisters, I could have undertaken another forty-mile
march.I always recall this experience when I read many of the ignorant
arguments of the Anti-Opium Society, who would, if they had the power,
compel the Government to deprive every hard-worked _coolie_ of the only
solace in his life of toil.I am certainly not an opium-eater, and the
abuse of opium may be injurious, as is the abuse of anything; but I am
so convinced in my own mind of the beneficial effects of the temperate
use of the drug, that if I were the general of an army after a forced
march like that of the retreat from Lucknow to the relief of Cawnpore, I
would make the Medical Department give every man a pill of opium and
half a pint of hot tea, instead of rum or liquor of any sort!I hate
drunkenness as much as anybody, but I have no sympathy with what I may
call the intemperate temperance of most of our teetotallers and the
Anti-Opium Society.My experience has been as great and as varied as
that of most Europeans in India, and that experience has led me to the
conviction that the members of the Anti-Opium Society are either
culpably ignorant of facts, or dishonest in the way they represent what
they wish others to believe to be facts.Most of the assertions made
about the Government connection with opium being a hindrance to
mission-work and the spread of Christianity, are gross exaggerations not
borne out by experience, and the opium slave and the opium den, as
depicted in much of the literature on this subject, have no existence
except in the distorted imagination of the writers.But I shall have
some more observations to make on this score elsewhere, and some
evidence to bring forward in support of them.[28]

Early on the morning of the 29th of November the Ninety-Third crossed
the bridge of boats, and it was well that Sir Colin had returned so
promptly from Lucknow to the relief of Cawnpore, for General Wyndham's
troops were not only beaten and cowed,--they were utterly demoralised.When the Commander-in-Chief left Cawnpore for Lucknow, General Wyndham,
known as the "Hero of the Redan," was left in command at Cawnpore with
instructions to strengthen his position by every means, and to detain
all detachments arriving from Calcutta after the 10th of November,
because it was known that the Gwalior Contingent were in great force
somewhere across the Jumna, and there was every probability that they
would either attack Cawnpore, or cross into Oude to fall on the rear of
the Commander-in-Chief's force to prevent the relief of Lucknow.But
strict orders were given to General Wyndham that he was _on no account_
to move out of Cawnpore, should the Gwalior Contingent advance on his
position, but to act on the defensive, and to hold his entrenchments and
guard the bridge of boats at all hazards.By that time the entrenchment
or mud fort at the Cawnpore end of the bridge, where the Government
Harness and Saddlery Factory now stands, had become a place of
considerable strength under the able direction of Captain Mowbray
Thomson, one of the four survivors of General Wheeler's force.Captain
Thomson had over four thousand _coolies_ daily employed on the defences
from daybreak till dark, and he was a most energetic officer himself, so
that by the time we passed through Cawnpore for the relief of Lucknow
this position had become quite a strong fortification, especially when
compared with the miserable apology for an entrenchment so gallantly
defended by General Wheeler's small force and won from him by such black
treachery.When we advanced for the relief of Lucknow, all our spare
baggage, five hundred new tents, and a great quantity of clothing for
the troops coming down from Delhi, were shut up in Cawnpore, with a
large quantity of spare ammunition, harness, and saddlery; in brief,
property to the value of over five _lakhs_ of rupees was left stored in
the church and in the houses which were still standing near the church
between the town and the river, a short distance from the house in which
the women and children were murdered.All this property, as already
mentioned, fell into the hands of the Gwalior Contingent, and we
returned just in time to see them making bonfires of what they could not
use.Colonel Sir Robert Napier (afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala) lost
all the records of his long service, and many valuable engineering
papers which could never be replaced.As for us of the Ninety-Third, we
lost all our spare kits, and were now without a chance of a change of
underclothing or socks.Let all who may read this consider what it meant
to us, who had not changed our clothes from the 10th of the month, and
how, on the morning of the 29th, the sight of the enemy making bonfires
of our kits, just as we were within reach of them, could hardly have
been soothing to contemplate.But to return to General Wyndham's force.By the 26th of November it
numbered two thousand four hundred men, according to Colonel Adye's
_Defence of Cawnpore_; and when he heard of the advance of the Nana
Sahib at the head of the Gwalior Contingent, Wyndham considered himself
strong enough to disobey the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, and moved
out of his entrenchment to give them battle, encountering their advance
guard at Pandoo Nuddee about seven miles from Cawnpore.He at once
attacked and drove it back through a village in its rear; but behind
the village he found himself confronted by an army of over forty
thousand men, twenty-five thousand of them being the famous Gwalior
Contingent, the best disciplined troops in India, which had never been
beaten and considered themselves invincible, and which, in addition to a
siege train of thirty heavy guns, 24 and 32-pounders, had a
well-appointed and well-drilled field-artillery.General Wyndham now saw
his mistake, and gave the order for retreat.His small force retired in
good order, and encamped on the plain outside Cawnpore on the Bithoor
road for the night, to find itself outflanked and almost surrounded by
Tantia Topee and his Mahrattas on the morning of the 27th; and at the
end of five hours' fighting a general retreat into the fort had again to
be ordered.The retiring force was overwhelmed by a murderous cannonade, and, being
largely composed of young soldiers, a panic ensued.The men got out of
hand, and fled for the fort with a loss of over three hundred,--mostly
killed, because the wounded who fell into the hands of the enemy were
cut to pieces,--and several guns.Moore, Church of England
Chaplain with General Wyndham's force, gave a very sad picture of the
panic in which the men fled for the fort, and his description was borne
out by what I saw myself when we passed through the fort on the morning
of the 29th.Moore said: "The men got quite out of hand and fled
pell-mell for the fort.An old Sikh _sirdar_ at the gate tried to stop
them, and to form them up in some order, and when they pushed him aside
and rushed past him, he lifted up his hands and said, 'You are not the
brothers of the men who beat the Khalsa army and conquered the Punjab!'"Moore went on to say that, "The old Sikh followed the flying men
through the Fort Gate, and patting some of them on the back said, 'Don't
run, don't be afraid, there is nothing to hurt you!'"The fact is the
men were mostly young soldiers, belonging to many different regiments,
simply battalions of detachments.They were crushed by the heavy and
well-served artillery of the enemy, and if the truth must be told, they
had no confidence in their commander, who was a brave soldier, but no
general; so when the men were once seized with panic, there was no
stopping them.The only regiment, or rather part of a regiment, for they
only numbered fourteen officers of all ranks and a hundred and sixty
men, which behaved well, was the old Sixty-Fourth, and two companies of
the Thirty-Fourth and Eighty-Second, making up a weak battalion of
barely three hundred.This was led by brave old Brigadier Wilson, who
held them in hand until he brought them forward to cover the retreat,
which he did with a loss of seven officers killed and two wounded,
eighteen men of the Sixty-Fourth killed and twenty-five wounded, with
equally heavy proportions killed and wounded from the companies of the
Thirty-Fourth and Eighty-Second.Brigadier Wilson first had his horse
shot, and was then himself killed, while urging the men to maintain the
honour of the regiment.The command then devolved on Major Stirling,
one of the Sixty-Fourth, who was cut down in the act of spiking one of
the enemy's guns, and Captain M'Crea of the same regiment was also cut
down just as he had spiked his fourth gun.This charge, and these
individual acts of bravery, retarded the advance of the enemy till some
sort of order had been re-established inside the fort.The Sixty-Fourth
were then driven back, and obliged to leave their dead.This then was the state of matters when we reached Cawnpore from
Lucknow.The whole of our spare baggage was captured: the city of
Cawnpore and the whole of the river-side up to the house where the Nana
had slaughtered the women and children were in the hands of the enemy;
but they had not yet injured the bridge of boats, nor crossed the canal,
and the road to Allahabad still remained open.We marched through the fort, and took up ground near where the jute mill
of Messrs.We
crossed the bridge without any loss except one officer, who was slightly
wounded by being struck on the shin by a spent bullet from a charge of
grape.He was a long slender youth of about sixteen or seventeen years
of age, whom the men had named "Jack Straw."He was knocked down just as
we cleared the bridge of boats, among the blood of some camp-followers
who had been killed by the bursting of a shell just in front of us.Sergeant Paton, of my company, picked him up, and put him into an empty
_dooly_ which was passing.During the day a piquet of one sergeant, one corporal, and about twenty
men, under command of Lieutenant Stirling, who was afterwards killed on
the 5th of December, was sent out to bring in the body of Brigadier
Wilson, and a man named Doran, of the Sixty-Fourth, who had gone up to
Lucknow in the Volunteer Cavalry, and had there done good service and
returned with our force, volunteered to go out with them to identify the
brigadier's body, because there were many more killed near the same
place, and their corpses having been stripped, they could not be
identified by their uniform, and it would have been impossible to have
brought in all without serious loss.The party reached the brigadier's
body without apparently attracting the attention of the enemy; but just
as two men, Rule of my regiment and Patrick Doran, were lifting it into
the _dooly_ they were seen, and the enemy opened fire on them.A bullet
struck Doran and went right through his body from side to side, without
touching any of the vital organs, just as he was bending down to lift
the brigadier--a most extraordinary wound!If the bullet had deviated a
hair's-breadth to either side, the wound must have been mortal, but
Doran was able to walk back to the fort, and lived for many years after
taking his discharge from the regiment.During the time that this piquet was engaged the Blue-jackets of Peel's
Brigade and our heavy artillery had taken up positions in front of the
fort, and showed the gunners of the Gwalior Contingent that they were no
longer confronted by raw inexperienced troops.By the afternoon of the
29th of November, the whole of the women and children and sick and
wounded from Lucknow had crossed the Ganges, and encamped behind the
Ninety-Third on the Allahabad road, and here I will leave them and close
this chapter.FOOTNOTES:

CHAPTER VIII

ANECDOTES--ACTION WITH THE GWALIOR CONTINGENT--ITS DEFEAT--PURSUIT OF
THE NANA--BITHOOR--JOHN LANG AND JOTEE PERSHAD


So far as I now remember, the 30th of November, 1857, passed without any
movement on the part of the enemy, and the Commander-in-Chief, in his
letter describing the state of affairs to the Governor-General, said, "I
am obliged to submit to the hostile occupation of Cawnpore until the
actual despatch of all my incumbrances towards Allahabad is effected."As stated in the last chapter, when our tents came up our camp was
pitched (as near as I can now make out from the altered state of
Cawnpore), about the spot where Joe Lee's hotel and the jute mill of
Messrs.Andrew's day and evening
passed without molestation, except that strong piquets lined the canal
and guarded our left and rear from surprise, and the men in camp slept
accoutred, ready to turn out at the least alarm.But during the night,
or early on the morning of the 1st of December, the enemy had quietly
advanced some guns, unseen by our piquets, right up to the Cawnpore side
of the canal, and suddenly opened fire on the Ninety-Third just as we
were falling in for muster-parade, sending round-shot and shell right
through our tents.One shrapnel shell burst right in the centre of
Captain Cornwall's company severely wounding the captain,
Colour-Sergeant M'Intyre, and five men, but not killing any one.Captain Cornwall was the oldest officer in the regiment, even an older
soldier than Colonel Leith-Hay who had then commanded it for over three
years, and for long he had been named by the men "Old Daddy Cornwall."He was poor, and had been unable to purchase promotion, and in
consequence was still a captain with over thirty-five years' service.The bursting of the shell right over his head stunned the old gentleman,
and a bullet from it went through his shoulder breaking his collar-bone
and cutting a deep furrow down his back.The old man was rather stout
and very short-sighted; the shock of the fall stunned him for some time,
and before he regained his senses Dr.Munro had cut the bullet out of
his back and bandaged up his wound as well as possible.Daddy came to
himself just as the men were lifting him into a _dooly_.Munro standing by with the bullet in his hand, about to present it to
him as a memento of Cawnpore, Daddy gasped out, "Munro, is my wound
dangerous?""No, Cornwall," was the answer, "not if you don't excite
yourself into a fever; you will get over it all right."The next
question put was, "Is the road clear to Allahabad?"To which Munro
replied that it was, and that he hoped to have all the sick and wounded
sent down country within a day or two."Then by----" said Daddy, with
considerable emphasis, "I'm off."The poor old fellow had through long
disappointment become like our soldiers in Flanders,--he sometimes
swore; but considering how promotion had passed over him, that was
perhaps excusable.All this occupied far less time than it takes to
write it, and I may as well here finish the history of Daddy Cornwall
before I leave him.He went home in the same vessel as a rich widow,
whom he married on arrival in Dublin, his native place, the corporation
of which presented him with a valuable sword and the freedom of the
city.The death of Brigadier-General Hope in the following April gave
Captain Cornwall his majority without purchase, and he returned to India
in the end of 1859 to command the regiment for about nine months,
retiring from the army in 1860, when we lay at Rawul Pindee.Being shelled out of our tents, the
regiment was advanced to the side of the canal under cover of the mud
walls of what had formerly been the sepoy lines, in which we took
shelter from the fire of the enemy.Later in the day Colonel Ewart lost
his left arm by a round-shot striking him on the elbow just as he had
dismounted from his charger on his return from visiting the piquets on
the left and rear of our position, he being the field-officer for the
day.This caused universal regret in the regiment, Ewart being the most
popular officer in it.By the evening of the 3rd of December the whole of the women and
children, and as many of the wounded as could bear to be moved, were on
their way to Allahabad; and during the 4th and 5th reinforcements
reached Cawnpore from England, among them our old comrades of the
Forty-Second whom we had left at Dover in May.We were right glad to see
them, on the morning of the 5th December, marching in with bagpipes
playing, which was the first intimation we had of another Highland
regiment being near us.These reinforcements raised the force under Sir
Colin Campbell to five thousand infantry, six hundred cavalry, and
thirty-five guns.Early on the morning of the 6th of December we struck our tents, which
were loaded on elephants, and marched to a place of safety behind the
fort on the river bank, whilst we formed up in rear of the unroofed
barracks--the Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, Ninety-Third, and Fourth Punjab
Infantry, with Peel's Brigade and several batteries of artillery, among
them Colonel Bourchier's light field-battery (No.17 of the old
Company's European artillery), a most daring lot of fellows, the Ninth
Lancers, and one squadron of Hodson's Horse under command of Lieutenant
Gough,[29] a worthy pupil of a famous master.This detachment of
Hodson's Horse had come down with Sir Hope Grant from Delhi, and served
at the final relief of Lucknow and the retreat to the succour of
Cawnpore.The headquarters of the regiment under its famous commander
had been left with Brigadier Showers.As this force was formed up in columns, masked from the view of the
enemy by the barracks on the plain of Cawnpore, the Commander-in-Chief
rode up, and told us that he had just got a telegram informing him of
the safe arrival of the women and children, sick and wounded, at
Allahabad, and that now we were to give battle to the famous Gwalior
Contingent, consisting of twenty-five thousand well-disciplined troops,
with about ten thousand of the Nana Sahib's Mahrattas and all the
_budmashes_ of Cawnpore, Calpee, and Gwalior, under command of the Nana
in person, who had proclaimed himself Peishwa and Chief of the Mahratta
power, with Tantia Topee, Bala Sahib (the Nana's brother), and Raja Koor
Sing, the Rajpoot Chief of Judgdespore, as divisional commanders, and
with all the native officers of the Gwalior Contingent as brigade and
regimental commanders.Sir Colin also warned us that there was a large
quantity of rum in the enemy's camp, which we must carefully avoid,
because it was reported to have been drugged."But, Ninety-Third," he
continued, "I trust you.The supernumerary rank will see that no man
breaks the ranks, and I have ordered the rum to be destroyed as soon as
the camp is taken."The Chief then rode on to the other regiments and as soon as he had
addressed a short speech to each, a signal was sent up from Peel's
rocket battery, and General Wyndham opened the ball on his side with
every gun at his disposal, attacking the enemy's left between the city
and the river.Sir Colin himself led the advance, the Fifty-Third and
Fourth Punjab Infantry in skirmishing order, with the Ninety-Third in
line, the cavalry on our left, and Peel's guns and the horse-artillery
at intervals, with the Forty-Second in the second line for our support.Directly we emerged from the shelter of the buildings which had masked
our formation, the piquets fell back, the skirmishers advanced at the
double, and the enemy opened a tremendous cannonade on us with
round-shot, shell, and grape.But, nothing daunted, our skirmishers soon
lined the canal, and our line advanced, with the pipers playing and the
colours in front of the centre company, without the least
wavering,--except now and then opening out to let through the round-shot
which were falling in front, and rebounding along the hard
ground-determined to show the Gwalior Contingent that they had different
men to meet from those whom they had encountered under Wyndham a week
before.John went back to the kitchen.By the time we reached the canal, Peel's Blue-jackets were
calling out--"Damn these cow horses," meaning the gun-bullocks, "they're
too slow!Come, you Ninety-Third, give us a hand with the drag-ropes as
you did at Lucknow!"We were then well under the range of the enemy's
guns, and the excitement was at its height.A company of the
Ninety-Third slung their rifles, and dashed to the assistance of the
Blue-jackets.The bullocks were cast adrift, and the native drivers were
not slow in going to the rear.The drag-ropes were manned, and the
24-pounders wheeled abreast of the first line of skirmishers just as if
they had been light field-pieces.When we reached the bank the infantry paused for a moment to see if the
canal could be forded or if we should have to cross by the bridge over
which the light field-battery were passing at the gallop, and
unlimbering and opening fire, as soon as they cleared the head of the
bridge, to protect our advance.At this juncture the enemy opened on us
with grape and canister shot, but they fired high and did us but little
damage.As the peculiar _whish_ (a sound when once heard never to be
forgotten) of the grape was going over our heads, the Blue-jackets gave
a ringing cheer for the "Red, white, and blue!"While the Ninety-Third,
led off by Sergeant Daniel White, struck up _The Battle of the Alma_, a
song composed in the Crimea by Corporal John Brown of the Grenadier
Guards, and often sung round the camp-fires in front of Sebastopol.I
here give the words, not for their literary merit, but to show the
spirit of the men who could thus sing going into action in the teeth of
the fire of thirty well-served, although not very correctly-aimed guns,
to encounter a force of more than ten to one.Just as the Blue-jackets
gave their hurrah for the "Red, white, and blue," Dan White struck up
the song, and the whole line, including the skirmishers of the
Fifty-Third and the sailors, joined in the stirring patriotic tune,
which is a first-rate quick march:

    Come, all you gallant British hearts
      Who love the Red and Blue,[30]
    Come, drink a health to those brave lads
      Who made the Russians rue.Fill up your glass and let it pass,
      Three cheers, and one cheer more,
    For the fourteenth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.We sailed from Kalimita Bay,
      And soon we made the coast,
    Determined we would do our best
      In spite of brag and boast.We sprang to land upon the strand,
      And slept on Russian shore,
    On the fourteenth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.We marched along until we came
      Upon the Alma's banks,
    We halted just beneath their guns
      To breathe and close our ranks.we heard, and at the word
      Right through the brook we bore,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.We scrambled through the clustering vines,
      Then came the battle's brunt;
    Our officers, they cheered us on,
      Our colours waved in front;
    And fighting well full many fell,
      Alas!to rise no more,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.The French were on the right that day,
      And flanked the Russian line,
    While full upon their left they saw
      The British bayonets shine.With hearty cheers we stunned their ears,
      Amidst the cannon's roar,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.A picnic party Menschikoff
      Had asked to see the fun;
    The ladies came at twelve o'clock
      To see the battle won.They found the day too hot to stay,
      The Prince felt rather sore,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.For when he called his carriage up,
      The French came up likewise;
    And so he took French leave at once
      And left to them the prize.The Chasseurs took his pocket-book,
      They even sacked his store,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.A letter to Old Nick they found,
      And this was what it said:
    "To meet their bravest men, my liege,
      Your soldiers do not dread;
    But devils they, not mortal men,"
      The Russian General swore,
    "That drove us off the Alma's heights
      In September, fifty-four."Long life to Royal Cambridge,
      To Peel and Camperdown,
    And all the gallant British Tars
      Who shared the great renown,
    Who stunned Russian ears with British cheers,
      Amidst the cannon's roar,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.Here's a health to noble Raglan,
      To Campbell and to Brown,
    And all the gallant Frenchmen
      Who shared that day's renown.Whilst we displayed the black cockade,
      They the tricolour bore;
    The Russian crew wore gray and blue
      In September, fifty-four.Come, let us drink a toast to-night,
      Our glasses take in hand,
    And all around this festive board
      In solemn silence stand.Before we part let each true heart
      Drink once to those no more,
    Who fought their last fight on Alma's height
      In September, fifty-four!Around our bivouac fires that night as _The Battle of the Alma_ was sung
again, Daniel White told us that when the Blue-jackets commenced
cheering under the hail of grape-shot, he remembered that the Scots
Greys and Ninety-Second Highlanders had charged at Waterloo singing
_Bruce's Address at Bannockburn_, "Scots wha hae," and trying to think
of something equally appropriate in which Peel's Brigade might join, he
could not at the moment recall anything better than the old Crimean song
aforesaid.After clearing the canal and re-forming our ranks, we came under shelter
of a range of brick kilns behind which stood the camp of the enemy, and
behind the camp their infantry were drawn up in columns, not deployed in
line.The rum against which Sir Colin had warned us was in front of the
camp, casks standing on end with the heads knocked out for convenience;
and there is no doubt but the enemy expected the Europeans would break
their ranks when they saw the rum, and had formed up their columns to
fall on us in the event of such a contingency.But the Ninety-Third
marched right on past the rum barrels, and the supernumerary rank soon
upset the casks, leaving the contents to soak into the dry ground.As soon as we cleared the camp, our line of infantry was halted.Up to
that time, except the skirmishers, we had not fired a shot, and we could
not understand the reason of the halt till we saw the Ninth Lancers and
the detachment of Hodson's Horse galloping round some fields of tall
sugar-cane on the left, masking the light field-battery.When the enemy
saw the tips of the lances (they evidently did not see the guns) they
quickly formed squares of brigades.They were armed with the old musket,
"Brown Bess," and did not open fire till the cavalry were within about
three hundred yards.Just as they commenced to fire, we could hear Sir
Hope Grant, in a voice as loud as a trumpet, give the command to the
cavalry, "Squadrons, outwards!"while Bourchier gave the order to his
gunners, "Action, front!"The cavalry wheeled as if they had been at a
review on the Calcutta parade-ground; the guns, having previously been
charged with grape, were swung round, unlimbered as quick as lightning
within about two hundred and fifty yards of the squares, and round after
round of grape was poured into the enemy with murderous effect, every
charge going right through, leaving a lane of dead from four to five
yards wide.By this time our line was advanced close up behind the
battery, and we could see the mounted officers of the enemy, as soon as
they caught sight of the guns, dash out of the squares and fly like
lightning across the plain.Directly the squares were broken, our
cavalry charged, while the infantry advanced at the double with the
bayonet.The battle was won, and the famous Gwalior Contingent was a
flying rabble, although the struggle was protracted in a series of
hand-to-hand fights all over the plain, no quarter being given.Peel's
guns were wheeled up, as already mentioned, as if they had been
6-pounders, and the left wing of the enemy taken in rear and their
retreat on the Calpee road cut off.What escaped of their right wing
fled along this road.The cavalry and horse-artillery led by Sir Colin
Campbell in person, the whole of the Fifty-Third, the Fourth Punjab
Infantry, and two companies of the Ninety-Third, pursued the flying mass
for fourteen miles.The rebels, being cut down by hundreds wherever they
attempted to rally for a stand, at length threw away their arms and
accoutrements to expedite their flight, for none were spared,--"neither
the sick man in his weakness, nor the strong man in his strength," to
quote the words of Colonel Alison.The evening closed with the total
rout of the enemy, and the capture of his camp, the whole of his
ordnance-park, containing a large quantity of ammunition and thirty-two
guns of sizes, siege-train, and field-artillery, with a loss of only
ninety-nine killed and wounded on our side.As night fell, large bodies of the left wing of the enemy were seen
retreating from the city between our piquets and the Ganges, but we were
too weary and too few in number to intercept them, and they retired
along the Bithoor road.About midnight the force which had followed the
enemy along the Calpee road returned, bringing in a large number of
ammunition-waggons and baggage-carts, the bullocks driven by our men,
and those not engaged in driving sitting on the waggons or carts, too
tired and footsore to walk.We rested hungry and exhausted, but a man of
my company, named Bill Summers, captured a little pack-bullock loaded
with two bales of stuff which turned out to be fine soft woollen socks
of Loodiana manufacture, sufficient to give every man in the company
three pairs,--a real godsend for us, since at that moment there was
nothing we stood more in need of than socks; and as no commissariat had
come up from the rear, we slaughtered the bullock and cut it into
steaks, which we broiled on the tips of our ramrods around the bivouac
fires.Thus we passed the night of the 6th of December, 1857.Early on the morning of the 7th a force was sent into the city of
Cawnpore, and patrolled it from end to end, east, west, north, and
south.Not only did we meet no enemy, but many of the townspeople
brought out food and water to our men, appearing very glad to see us.During the afternoon our tents came up from the rear, and were pitched
by the side of the Grand Trunk road, and the Forty-Second being put on
duty that night, we of the Fifty-Third and Ninety-Third were allowed to
take our accoutrements off for the first night's sleep without them
since the 10th of November--seven and twenty days!Our spare kits
having all vanished with the enemy, as told in the last chapter, our
quarter-master collected from the captured baggage all the underclothing
and socks he could lay hands on.Thanks to Bill Summers and the little
pack-bullock, my company got a change of socks; but there was more work
before us before we got a bath or a change of shirts.About noon on the 8th the Commander-in-Chief, accompanied by Sir Hope
Grant and Brigadier Adrian Hope, had our brigade turned out, and as soon
as Sir Colin rode in among us we knew there was work to be done.He
called the officers to the front, and addressing them in the hearing of
the men, told them that the Nana Sahib had passed through Bithoor with a
large number of men and seventeen guns, and that we must all prepare for
another forced march to overtake him and capture these guns before he
could either reach Futtehghur or cross into Oude with them.After
stating that the camp would be struck as soon as we had got our dinners,
the Commander-in-Chief and Sir Hope Grant held a short but animated
conversation, which I have always thought was a prearranged matter
between them for our encouragement.In the full hearing of the men, Sir
Hope Grant turned to the Commander-in-Chief, and said, in rather a loud
tone: "I'm afraid, your Excellency, this march will prove a wild-goose
chase, because the infantry, in their present tired state, will never be
able to keep up with the cavalry."On this, Sir Colin turned round in
his saddle, and looking straight at us, replied in a tone equally loud,
so as to be heard by all the men: "I tell you, General Grant, you are
wrong.You don't know these men; these Highlanders will march your
cavalry blind."And turning to the men, as if expecting to be
corroborated by them, he was answered by over a dozen voices, "Ay, ay,
Sir Colin, we'll show them what we can do!"As soon as dinner was over we struck tents, loaded them on the
elephants, and by two o'clock P.M.were on the march along the Grand
Trunk road.By sunset we had covered fifteen miles from Cawnpore.Here
we halted, lit fires, cooked tea, served out grog, and after a rest of
three hours, to feed and water the horses as much as to rest the men, we
were off again.on the 9th of December we had
reached the thirtieth mile from the place where we started, and the
scouts brought word to the general that we were ahead of the flying
enemy.We then turned off the road to our right in the direction of the
Ganges, and by eight o'clock came in sight of the enemy at Serai _ghat_,
a ferry twenty-five miles above Cawnpore, preparing to embark the guns
of which we were in pursuit.Our cavalry and horse-artillery at once galloped to the front through
ploughed fields, and opened fire on the boats.The enemy returned the
fire, and some Mahratta cavalry made a dash at the guns, but their
charge was met by the Ninth Lancers and the detachment of Hodson's
Horse, and a number of them cut down.Seeing the infantry advancing in
line, the enemy broke and fled for the boats, leaving all their fifteen
guns, a large number of ordnance waggons loaded with ammunition, and a
hundred carts filled with their baggage and the plunder of Cawnpore.Our
horse-artillery and infantry advanced right up to the banks of the river
and kept up a hot fire on the retreating boats, swamping a great number
of them.The Nana Sahib was among this lot; but the spies reported that
his boat was the first to put off, and he gained the Oude side in
safety, though some thousands of his Mahratta rebels must have been
drowned or killed.This was some return we felt for his treachery at
Suttee Chowrah _ghat_ six months before.It was now our turn to be
peppering the flying boats!There were a number of women and children
left by the routed rebels among their baggage-carts; they evidently
expected to be killed, but were escorted to a village in our rear, and
left there.We showed them that we had come to war with men--not to
butcher women!By the afternoon we had dragged the whole of the captured
guns back from the river, and our tents coming up under the rear-guard,
we encamped for the night, glad enough to get a rest.On the morning of the 10th our quarter-master divided among us a lot of
shirts and underclothing, mostly what the enemy had captured at
Cawnpore, a great part of which we had now recovered; and we were
allowed to go by wings to undress and have a bath in the sacred Ganges,
and to change our underclothing, which we very much needed to do.The
condition of our flannel shirts is best left undescribed, while our
bodies round our waists, where held tight by our belts, were eaten to
raw flesh.We sent our shirts afloat on the sacred waters of Mother
Gunga, glad to be rid of them, and that night we slept in comfort.Even
now, thirty-five years after, the recollection of the state of my own
flannel when I took it off makes me shiver.This is not a pleasant
subject, but I am writing these reminiscences for the information of our
soldiers of to-day, and merely stating facts, to let them understand
something of what the soldiers of the Mutiny had to go through.Up to this time, the columns of the British had been mostly acting, as
it were, on the defensive; but from the date of the defeat of the
Gwalior Contingent, our star was in the ascendant, and the attitude of
the country people showed that they understood which was the winning
side.Provisions, such as butter, milk, eggs, and fruit, were brought
into our camp by the villagers for sale the next morning, sparingly at
first, but as soon as the people found that they were well received and
honestly paid for their supplies, they came in by scores, and from that
time there was no scarcity of provisions in our bazaars.We halted at Serai _ghat_ for the 11th and 12th December, and on the
13th marched back in triumph to Bithoor with our captured guns.The
reason of our return to Bithoor was because spies had reported that the
Nana Sahib had concealed a large amount of treasure in a well there near
the palace of the ex-Peishwa of Poona.Rupees to the amount of thirty
_lakhs_[31] were recovered, which had been packed in ammunition-boxes
and sunk in a well; also a very large amount of gold and silver plate
and other valuables, among other articles a silver howdah which had been
the state howdah of the ex-Peishwa.Besides the rupees, the plate and
other valuables recovered were said to be worth more than a million
sterling, and it was circulated in the force that each private soldier
would receive over a thousand rupees in prize-money.But we never got a
_pie_![32] All we did get was hard work.Four strong
frames were erected on the top of it by the sappers, and large leathern
buckets with strong iron frames, with ropes attached, were brought from
Cawnpore; then a squad of twenty-five men was put on to each rope, and
relieved every three hours, two buckets keeping the water down and two
drawing up treasure.Thus we worked day and night from the 15th to the
26th of December, the Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, and Ninety-Third
supplying the working-parties for pulling, and the Bengal Sappers
furnishing the men to work in the well; these last, having to stand in
the water all the time, were relieved every hour.It was no light work
to keep the water down, so as to allow the sappers to sling the boxes
containing the rupees, and to lift three million rupees, or thirty
_lakhs_, out from a deep well required considerable labour.But the
men, believing that the whole would be divided as prize-money, worked
with a will.A paternal Government, however, ignored our general's
assurance on this head, on the plea that we had merely recovered the
treasure carried off by the Nana from Cawnpore.The plate and jewellery
belonging to the ex-Peishwa were also claimed by the Government as State
property, and the troops got--nothing!We had even to pay from our own
pockets for the replacement of our kits which were taken by the Gwalior
Contingent when they captured Wyndham's camp.About this time _The Illustrated London News_ reached India with a
picture purporting to be that of the Nana Sahib.I forget the date of
the number which contained this picture; but I first saw it in Bithoor
some time between the 15th and 25th December 1857.I will now give the
history of that picture, and show how Ajoodia Pershad, commonly known as
Jotee Pershad, the commissariat contractor, came to figure as the Nana
Sahib in the pages of _The Illustrated London News_.It is a well-known
fact that there is no authentic portrait of the Nana in existence; it is
even asserted that he was never painted by any artist, and photography
had not extended to Upper India before 1857.I believe this is the first
time that the history of the picture published as that of the Nana Sahib
by _The Illustrated London News_ has been given.I learnt the facts
which I am about to relate some years after the Mutiny, under a promise
of secrecy so long as my informant, the late John Lang,
barrister-at-law and editor and proprietor of _The Mofussilite_, should
be alive.As both he and Ajoodia Pershad have been many years dead, I
commit no breach of confidence in now telling the story.The picture
purporting to be that of the Nana having been published in 1857, it
rightly forms a reminiscence of the Mutiny, although much of the
following tale occurred several years earlier; but to make the history
of the picture complete, the facts which led to it must be noticed.There are but few Europeans now in India who remember the scandal
connected with the trial of Ajoodia Pershad, the commissariat
contractor, for payment for the supplies and carriage of the army
throughout the second Sikh war.When it came to a final settlement of
his accounts with the Commissariat Department, Ajoodia Pershad claimed
three and a half _crores_ of rupees (equal to three and a half millions
sterling), in excess of what the auditor would pass as justly due to
him; and the Commissariat Department, backed by the Government of India,
not only repudiated the claim, but put Ajoodia Pershad on his trial for
falsification of accounts and attempting to defraud the Government.There being no high courts in those days, nor trial by jury, corrupt or
otherwise, for natives in the Upper Provinces, an order of the
Governor-General in Council was passed for the trial of Ajoodia Pershad
by special commission, with the judge-advocate-general as prosecutor.The trial was ordered to be held at Meerut, and the commission
assembled there, commencing its sittings in the Artillery mess-house
during the cold weather of 1851-52.There were no barristers or pleaders
in India in those days--at least in the Mofussil, and but few in the
presidency towns; but Ajoodia Pershad, being a very wealthy man, sent an
agent to England, and engaged the services of Mr.John Lang,
barrister-at-law, to come out and defend him.John Lang left England in
May, 1851, and came out round the Cape in one of Green's celebrated
liners, the _Nile_, and he reached Meerut about December, when the trial
commenced.Everything went swimmingly with the prosecution till Mr.Lang began his
cross-examination of the witnesses, he having reserved his privilege
till he heard the whole case for the prosecution.Directly the
cross-examination commenced, the weakness of the Government case became
apparent.I need not now recall how the commissary-general, the deputy
commissary-general, and their assistants were made to contradict each
other, and to contradict themselves out of their own mouths.Lang,
who appeared in court every day in his wig and gown, soon became a noted
character in Meerut, and the night before he was to sum up the case for
the defence, some officers in the Artillery mess asked him his opinion
of the members of the commission.Not being a teetotaller, Mr.Lang may
have been at the time somewhat under the influence of "John Exshaw," who
was the ruling spirit in those days, and he replied that the whole
batch, president and members, including the judge-advocate-general, were
a parcel of "d--d _soors_."[33] Immediately several officers present
offered to lay a bet of a thousand rupees with Mr.Lang that he was not
game to tell them so to their faces in open court the following day.Lang accepted the bet, the stakes were deposited, and an umpire
appointed to decide who should pocket the money.When the court
re-assembled next morning, the excitement was intense.Lang opened
his address by pulling the evidence for the prosecution to shreds, and
warming to his work, he went at it somewhat as follows--I can only give
the purport:--"Gentlemen of the commission forming this court, I now
place the dead carcass of this shameful case before you in all its naked
deformity, and the more we stir it up the more it stinks!The only stink
in my long experience that I can compare it to is the experience gained
in the saloon of the _Nile_ on my passage out to India the day after a
pig was slaughtered.We had a pig's cheek at the head of the table
[indicating the president of the commission]; we had a roast leg of pork
on the right [pointing to another member]; we had a boiled leg, also
pork, on the left [indicating a third member]"; and so on he went till
he had apportioned out the whole carcass of the supposed pig amongst the
members of the commission.Then, turning to the judge-advocate-general,
who was a little man dressed in an elaborately frilled shirt, and his
assistant, who was tall and thin, pointing to each in turn, Mr.Lang
proceeded,--"And for side-dishes we had chitterlings on one side, and
sausages on the other.In brief, the whole saloon smelt of nothing but
pork: and so it is, gentlemen, with this case.It is the Government of
India who has ordered this trial.It is for the interest of that
Government that my client should be convicted; therefore every member on
this commission is a servant of Government.The officers representing
the prosecution are servants of Government, and every witness for the
prosecution is also a servant of Government.In brief, the whole case
against my client is nothing but pork, and a disgrace to the Government
of India, and to the Honourable East India Company, who have sanctioned
this trial, and who put every obstacle in my way to prevent my coming
out to defend my client.I repeat my assertion that the case is a
disgrace to the Honourable Company and the Government of India, and to
every servant of that Government who has had any finger in the
manufacture of this pork-pie."Lang continued, showing how
Ajoodia Pershad had come forward to the assistance of the State in its
hour of need, by supplying carriage for the materials of the army and
rations for the troops, and so forth, till the judge-advocate-general
declared that he felt ashamed to be connected with the case.The result
was that Ajoodia Pershad was acquitted on all counts, and decreed to be
entitled to his claims in full, and the umpire decided that Mr.Lang had
won the bet of a thousand rupees.But my readers may ask--What has all this to do with the portrait of the
Nana Sahib?After his honourable acquittal,
Ajoodia Pershad was so grateful to Mr.Lang that he presented him with
an honorarium of three _lakhs_ of rupees, equal in those days to over
L30,000, in addition to the fees on his brief; and Mr.Lang happening to
say that he would very much like to have a portrait of his generous
client, Ajoodia Pershad presented him with one painted by a famous
native artist of those days, and the portrait was enshrined in a
jewelled frame worth another twenty-five thousand rupees.Lang used to carry this portrait with him wherever he
went.When the Mutiny broke out he was in London, and the artists of
_The Illustrated London News_ were calling on every old Indian of
position known to be in England, to try and get a portrait of the Nana.Lang possessed a picture of an Indian
prince--then, as now, all Indians were princes to the British
public--which might be that of the arch-assassin of Cawnpore.The artist
lost no time in calling on Mr.Lang to see the picture, and when he saw
it he declared it was just the thing he wanted.Lang protested,
pointing out that the picture no more resembled the Nana of Bithoor than
it did her Gracious Majesty the Queen of England; that neither the dress
nor the position of the person represented in the picture could pass in
India for a Mahratta chief.The artist declared he did not care for
people in India: he required the picture for the people of England.So
he carried it off to the engraver, and in the next issue of _The
Illustrated London News_ the picture of Ajoodia Pershad, the
commissariat contractor, appeared as that of the Nana Sahib.When those
in India who had known the Nana saw it, they declared it had no
resemblance to him whatever, and those who had seen Ajoodia Pershad
declared that the Nana was very like Ajoodia Pershad.But no one could
understand how the Nana could ever have allowed himself to be painted in
the dress of a Marwaree banker.To the day of his death John Lang was in
mortal fear lest Ajoodia Pershad should ever come to hear how his
picture had been allowed to figure as that of the arch-assassin of the
Indian Mutiny.By Christmas Day, 1857, we had recovered
all the gold and silver plate of the ex-Peishwa and the thirty _lakhs_
of treasure from the well in Bithoor, and on the morning of the 27th we
marched for the recapture of Futtehghur, which was held by a strong
force under the Nawab of Furruckabad.But I must leave the re-occupation
of Futtehghur for another chapter.NOTE

      Jotee Pershad was the native banker who, during the height
      of the Mutiny, victualled the Fort of Agra and saved the
      credit, if not the lives, of the members of the Government
      of the North-West Provinces.FOOTNOTES:

HODSON OF HODSON'S HORSE--ACTION AT THE KALEE NUDDEE--FUTTEHGHUR


As a further proof that the British star was now in the ascendant,
before we had been many days in Bithoor each company had got its full
complement of native establishment, such as cooks, water-carriers,
washer-men, etc.We left Bithoor on the 27th of December _en route_ for
Futtehghur, and on the 28th we made a forced march of twenty-five miles,
joining the Commander-in-Chief on the 29th.Early on the 30th we reached
a place named Meerun-ke-serai, and our tents had barely been pitched
when word went through the camp like wildfire that Hodson, of Hodson's
Horse, and another officer[34] had arrived in camp with despatches from
Brigadier Seaton to the Commander-in-Chief, having ridden from
Mynpooree, about seventy miles from where we were.We of the Ninety-Third were eager to see Hodson, having heard so much
about him from the men of the Ninth Lancers.There was nothing, however
daring or difficult, that Hodson was not believed capable of doing, and
a ride of seventy miles more or less through a country swarming with
enemies, where every European who ventured beyond the range of British
guns literally carried his life in his hand, was not considered anything
extraordinary for him.Personally, I was most anxious to see this famous
fellow, but as yet there was no chance; Hodson was in the tent of the
Commander-in-Chief, and no one knew when he might come out.However, the
hours passed, and during the afternoon a man of my company rushed into
the tent, calling, "Come, boys, and see Hodson!He and Sir Colin are in
front of the camp; Sir Colin is showing him round, and the smile on the
old Chief's face shows how he appreciates his companion."I hastened to
the front of the camp, and was rewarded by having a good look at Hodson;
and, as the man who had called us had said, I could see that he had made
a favourable impression on Sir Colin.Little did I then think that in
less than three short months I should see Hodson receive his
death-wound, and that thirty-five years after I should be one of the few
spared to give evidence to save his fair fame from undeserved slander.My memory always turns back to that afternoon at Meerunke-serai when I
read any attack on the good name of Hodson of Hodson's Horse.And
whatever prejudiced writers of the present day may say, the name of
Hodson will be a name to conjure with among the Sikhs of the Punjab for
generations yet unborn.On the 1st of January, 1858, our force reached the Kalee Nuddee
suspension bridge near Khoodagunj, about fifteen miles from Futtehghur,
just in time to prevent the total destruction of the bridge by the
enemy, who had removed a good part of the planking from the roadway, and
had commenced to cut the iron-work when we arrived.We halted on the
Cawnpore side of the Kalee Nuddee on New Year's Day, while the
engineers, under cover of strong piquets, were busy replacing the
planking of the roadway on the suspension bridge.Early on the morning
of the 2nd of January the enemy from Futtehghur, under cover of a thick
fog along the valley of the Kalee Nuddee, came down in great force to
dispute the passage of the river.The first intimation of their approach
was a shell fired on our advance piquet; but our camp was close to the
bridge, and the whole force was under arms in an instant.As soon as the
fog lifted the enemy were seen to have occupied the village of
Khoodagunj in great force, and to have advanced one gun, a 24-pounder,
planting it in the toll-house which commanded the passage of the bridge,
so as to fire it out of the front window just as if from the porthole of
a ship.As soon as the position of the enemy was seen, the cavalry brigade of
our force was detached to the left, under cover of the dense jungle
along the river, to cross by a ford which was discovered about five
miles up stream to our left, the intention of the movement being to get
in behind the enemy and cut off his retreat to Futtehghur.The Fifty-Third were pushed across the bridge to reinforce the piquets,
with orders not to advance, but to act on the defensive, so as to allow
time for the cavalry to get behind the enemy.The right wing of the
Ninety-Third was also detached with some horse-artillery guns to the
right, to cross by another ford about three miles below the bridge, to
attack the enemy on his left flank.The left wing was held in reserve
with the remainder of the force behind the bridge, to be in readiness to
reinforce the Fifty-Third in case of need.By the time these dispositions were made, the enemy's gun from the
toll-house had begun to do considerable damage.Peel's heavy guns were
accordingly brought to bear on it, and, after a round or two to feel
their distance, they were able to pitch an 8-inch shell right through
the window, which burst under the gun, upsetting it, and killing or
disabling most of the enemy in the house.Immediately after this the Fifty-Third, being well in advance, noticed
the enemy attempting to withdraw some of his heavy guns from the
village, and disregarding the order of the Commander-in-Chief not to
precipitate the attack, they charged these guns and captured two or
three of them.This check caused the enemy's line to retire, and Sir
Colin himself rode up to the Fifty-Third to bring to book the officer
commanding them for prematurely commencing the action.This officer
threw the blame on the men, stating that they had made the charge
against his orders, and that the officers had been unable to keep them
back.Sir Colin then turned on the men, threatening to send them to the
rear, and to make them do fatigue-duty and baggage-guard for the rest of
the campaign.On this an old Irishman from the ranks called out: "Shure,
Sir Colin, you don't mean it!You'll never send us on fatigue-duty
because we captured those guns that the Pandies were carrying off?";
Hearing this, Sir Colin asked what guns he meant."Shure, them's the
guns," was the answer, "that Sergeant Dobbin [now Joe Lee of Cawnpore]
and his section are dragging on to the road."Sir Colin seeing the guns,
his stern countenance relaxed and broke into a smile, and he made some
remark to the officer commanding that he did not know about the guns
having been withdrawn before the regiment had made the rush on the
enemy.On this the Irish spokesman from the ranks called out: "Three
cheers for the Commander-in-Chief, boys!I told you he did not mean us
to let the Pandies carry off those guns."By this time our right wing and the horse-artillery had crossed the ford
on our right and were well advanced on the enemy's left flank.But we of
the main line, composed of the Eighth (the old "King's"--now called the
Liverpool Regiment, I think), the Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, and left
wing of the Ninety-Third under Adrian Hope, were allowed to advance
slowly, just keeping them in sight.The enemy retired in an orderly
manner for about three or four miles, when they formed up to make a
stand, evidently thinking we were afraid to press them too closely.As
soon as they faced round again, our line was halted only about seven
hundred yards from them, and just then we could see our cavalry
debouching on to the Grand Trunk road about a mile from where we were.My company was in the centre of the road, and I could see the tips of
the lances of the Ninth wheeling into line for a charge right in the
enemy's rear.He was completely out-generalled, and his retreat cut off.The excitement was just then intense, as we dared not fire for fear of
hitting our men in the rear.The Forty-First Native Infantry was the
principal regiment of the enemy's line on the Grand Trunk road.Directly
they saw the Lancers in their rear they formed square while the enemy's
cavalry charged our men, but were met in fine style by Hodson's Horse
and sent flying across the fields in all directions.The Ninth came down
on the square of the Native Infantry, who stood their ground and opened
fire.The Lancers charged well up to within about thirty yards, when the
horses turned off right and left from the solid square.We were just
preparing to charge it with the bayonet, when at that moment the
squadrons were brought round again, just as a hawk takes a circle for a
swoop on its prey, and we saw Sergeant-Major May, who was mounted on a
powerful untrained horse, dash on the square and leap right into it,
followed by the squadron on that side.The square being thus broken, the
other troops of the Ninth rode into the flying mass, and in less than
five minutes the Forty-First regiment of Native Infantry was wiped out
of the ranks of the mutineers.The enemy's line of retreat became a
total rout, and the plain for miles was strewn with corpses speared down
by the Lancers or hewn down by the keen-edged sabres of Hodson's Horse.Our infantry line now advanced, but there was nothing for us to do but
collect the ammunition-carts and baggage of the enemy.Just about sunset
we halted and saw the Lancers and Sikhs returning with the captured
standards and every gun which the enemy had brought into the field in
the morning.The infantry formed up along the side of the Grand Trunk
road to cheer the cavalry as they returned.It was a sight never to be
forgotten,--the infantry and sailors cheering the Lancers and Sikhs, and
the latter returning our cheers and waving the captured standards and
their lances and sabres over their heads!Sir Colin Campbell rode up,
and lifting his hat, thanked the Ninth Lancers and Sikhs for their day's
work.It was reported in the camp that Sir Hope Grant had recommended
Sergeant-Major May for the Victoria Cross, but that May had modestly
remonstrated against the honour, saying that every man in the Ninth was
as much entitled to the Cross as he was, and that he was only able to
break the square by the accident of being mounted on an untrained horse
which charged into the square instead of turning off from it.This is of
course hearsay, but I believe it is fact.I may here remark that this charge of the Lancers forcibly impressed me
with the absurdity of our cavalry-drill for the purpose of breaking an
infantry square.On field-days in time of peace our cavalry were made
to charge squares of infantry, and directly the horses came within
thirty or forty yards the squadrons opened out right and left, galloping
clear of the square under the blank fire of the infantry.The horses
were thus drilled to turn off and gallop clear of the squares, instead
of charging home right through the infantry.When it came to actual war
the horses, not being reasoning animals, naturally acted just as on a
field-day; instead of charging straight into the square, they galloped
right past it, simply because they were drilled to do so.Of course, I
do not propose that several battalions of infantry should be slaughtered
every field-day for the purpose of training cavalry.But I would have
the formation altered, and instead of having the infantry in solid
squares, I would form them into quarter distance columns, with lanes
between the companies wide enough for the cavalry to gallop through
under the blank fire of the infantry.The horses would thus be trained
to gallop straight on, and no square of infantry would be able to resist
a charge of well-trained cavalry when it came to actual war.I am
convinced, in my own mind, that this was the reason that the untrained
remount ridden by Sergeant-Major May charged into the square of the
Forty-First, and broke it, while the well-drilled horses galloped round
the flanks in spite of their riders.But the square once being broken,
the other horses followed as a matter of course.However, we are now in
the age of breech-loaders and magazine rifles, and I fear the days of
cavalry charging squares of infantry are over.But we are still a long
way from the millennium, and the experience of the past may yet be
turned to account for the wars of the future.We reached Futtehghur on the morning of the 3rd of January to find it
deserted, the enemy having got such a "drubbing" that it had struck
terror into their reserves, which had bolted across the Ganges, leaving
large quantities of Government property behind them, consisting of tents
and all the ordnance stores of the Gun-carriage Agency.The enemy had
also established a gun and shot and shell foundry here, and a
powder-factory, all of which they had abandoned, leaving a number of
brass guns in the lathes, half turned, with many more just cast, and
large quantities of metal and material for the manufacture of both
powder and shot.During the afternoon of the day of our arrival the whole force was
turned out, owing to a report that the Nawab of Furruckabad was still in
the town; and it was said that the civil officer with the force had sent
a proclamation through the city that it would be given over to plunder
if the Nawab was not surrendered.Whether this was true or not, I cannot
say.The district was no longer under martial law, as from the date of
the defeat of the Gwalior Contingent the civil power had resumed
authority on the right bank of the Ganges.But so far as the country was
concerned, around Futtehghur at least, this merely meant that the
hangmen's noose was to be substituted for rifle-bullet and bayonet.However, our force had scarcely been turned out to threaten the town of
Furruckabad when the Nawab was brought out, bound hand and foot, and
carried by _coolies_ on a common country _charpoy_.[35] I don't know
what process of trial he underwent; but I fear he had neither jury nor
counsel, and I know that he was first smeared over with pig's fat,
flogged by sweepers, and then hanged.This was by the orders of the
civil commissioner.Both Sir Colin Campbell and Sir William Peel were
said to have protested against the barbarity, but this I don't know for
certain.We halted in Futtehghur till the 6th, on which date a brigade, composed
of the Forty-Second, Ninety-Third, a regiment of Punjab infantry, a
battery of artillery, a squadron of the Ninth Lancers, and Hodson's
Horse, marched to Palamhow in the Shumshabad district.This town had
been a hot-bed of rebellion under the leadership of a former native
collector of revenue, who had proclaimed himself Raja of the district,
and all the bad characters in it had flocked to his standard.However,
the place was occupied without opposition.We encamped outside the town,
and the civil police, along with the commissioner, arrested great
numbers, among them being the man who had proclaimed himself the Raja or
Nawab for the Emperor of Delhi.My company, with some of Hodson's Horse
and two artillery guns, formed a guard for the civil commissioner in the
_chowk_ or principal square of the town.The commissioner held his court
in what had formerly been the _kotwaiee_ or police station.I cannot say
what form of trial the prisoners underwent, or what evidence was
recorded against them.I merely know that they were marched up in
batches, and shortly after marched back again to a large tree of the
banian species, which stood in the centre of the square, and hanged
thereon.This went on from about three o'clock in the afternoon till
daylight the following morning, when it was reported that there was no
more room on the tree, and by that time there were one hundred and
thirty men hanging from its branches.Many charges of cruelty and want of pity have been made against the
character of Hodson.This makes me here mention a fact that certainly
does not tend to prove these charges.During the afternoon of the day of
which I write, Hodson visited the squadron of his regiment forming the
cavalry of the civil commissioner's guard.Just at the time of his visit
the commissioner wanted a hangman, and asked if any man of the
Ninety-Third would volunteer for the job, stating as an inducement that
all valuables in the way of rings or money found on the persons of the
condemned would become the property of the executioner.No one
volunteering for the job, the commissioner asked Jack Brian, a big tall
fellow who was the right-hand man of the company, if he would act as
executioner.Jack Brian turned round with a look of disgust, saying:
"Wha do ye tak' us for?We of the Ninety-Third enlisted to fight men
with arms in their hands.I widna' become yer hangman for all the loot
in India!"Captain Hodson was standing close by, and hearing the answer,
said, "Well answered, my brave fellow.I wish to shake hands with you,"
which he did.Then turning to Captain Dawson, Hodson said: "I'm sick of
work of this kind.I'm glad I'm not on duty;" and he mounted his horse,
and rode off.However, some _domes_[36] or sweeper-police were found to
act as hangmen, and the trials and executions proceeded.We returned to Futtehghur on the 12th of January and remained in camp
there till the 26th, when another expedition was sent out in the same
direction.But this time only the right wing of the Ninety-Third and a
wing of the Forty-Second formed the infantry, so my company remained in
camp.This second force met with more opposition than the first one.Lieutenant Macdowell, Hodson's second in command, and several troopers
were killed, and Hodson himself and some of his men were badly wounded,
Hodson having two severe cuts on his sword arm; while the infantry had
several men killed who were blown up with gunpowder.This force returned
on the 28th of January, and either on the 2nd or 3rd of February we left
Futtehghur _en route_ again for Lucknow _via_ Cawnpore.We reached Cawnpore by ordinary marches, crossed into Oude, and encamped
at Oonao till the whole of the siege-train was passed on to Lucknow.FOOTNOTES:

THE STRANGE STORY OF JAMIE GREEN


When we returned to Cawnpore, although we had been barely two months
away, we found it much altered.Many of the burnt-down bungalows were
being rebuilt, and the fort at the end of the bridge of boats had become
quite a strong place.The well where the murdered women and children
were buried was now completely filled up, and a wooden cross erected
over it.I visited the slaughter-house again, and found the walls of the
several rooms all scribbled over both in pencil and charcoal.This had
been done since my first visit in October; I am positive on this point.The unfortunate women who were murdered in the house left no writing on
the walls whatever.There was writing on the walls of the barrack-rooms
of Wheeler's entrenchment, mostly notes that had been made during the
siege, but none on the walls of the slaughter-house.As mentioned in my
last chapter, we only halted one day in Cawnpore before crossing into
Oude, and marching to Oonao about the 10th of February, we encamped
there as a guard for the siege-train and ordnance-park which was being
pushed on to Lucknow.While at Oonao a strange thing happened, which I shall here set down.Men live such busy lives in India that many who may have heard the story
at the time have possibly forgotten all about it, while to most of my
home-staying readers it will be quite fresh.Towards the end of February, 1858, the army for the siege of Lucknow was
gradually being massed in front of the doomed city, and lay, like a huge
boa-constrictor coiled and ready for its spring, all along the road from
Cawnpore to the Alumbagh.A strong division, consisting of the
Forty-Second and Ninety-Third Highlanders, the Fifty-Third, the Ninth
Lancers, Peel's Naval Brigade, the siege-train, and several batteries of
field-artillery, with the Fourth Punjab Infantry and other Punjabee
corps, lay at Oonao under the command of General Sir Edward Lugard and
Brigadier Adrian Hope.We had been encamped in that place for about ten
days,--the monotony of our lives being only occasionally broken by the
sound of distant cannonading in front--when we heard that General
Outram's position at the Alumbagh had been vigorously attacked by a
force from Lucknow, sometimes led by the Moulvie, and at others by the
Begum in person.Now and then somewhat duller sounds came from the rear,
which, we understood, arose from the operations of Sir Robert Napier and
his engineers, who were engaged in blowing up the temples of Siva and
Kalee overlooking the _ghats_ at Cawnpore; not, as some have asserted,
out of revenge, but for military considerations connected with the
safety of the bridge of boats across the Ganges.During one of these days of comparative inaction, I was lying in my tent
reading some home papers which had just arrived by the mail, when I
heard a man passing through the camp, calling out, "Plum-cakes!The
advent of a plum-cake _wallah_ was an agreeable change from ration-beef
and biscuit, and he was soon called into the tent, and his own maxim of
"taste and try before you buy" freely put into practice.This plum-cake
vendor was a very good-looking, light- native in the prime of
life, dressed in scrupulously clean white clothes, with dark, curly
whiskers and mustachios, carefully trimmed after the fashion of the
Mahommedan native officers of John Company's army.He had a
well-developed forehead, a slightly aquiline nose, and intelligent eyes.Altogether his appearance was something quite different from that of the
usual camp-follower.But his companion, or rather the man employed as
_coolie_ to carry his basket, was one of the most villainous-looking
specimens of humanity I ever set eyes on.As was the custom in those
days, seeing that he did not belong to our own bazaar, and being the
non-commissioned officer in charge of the tent, I asked the plum-cake
man if he was provided with a pass for visiting the camp?"Oh yes,
Sergeant _sahib_," he replied, "there's my pass all in order, not from
the Brigade-Major, but from the Brigadier himself, the Honourable Adrian
Hope.I'm Jamie Green, mess-_khansama_[37] of the late (I forget the
regiment he mentioned), and I have just come to Oonao with a letter of
introduction to General Hope from Sherer _sahib_, the magistrate and
collector of Cawnpore.You will doubtless know General Hope's
handwriting."And there it was, all in order, authorising the bearer, by
name Jamie Green, etc.etc., to visit both the camp and outpost for the
sale of his plum-cakes, in the handwriting of the brigadier, which was
well known to all the non-commissioned officers of the Ninety-Third,
Hope having been colonel of the regiment.Next to his appearance what struck me as the most remarkable thing about
Jamie Green was the purity and easy flow of his English, for he at once
sat down beside me, and asked to see the newspapers, and seemed anxious
to know what the English press said about the mutiny, and to talk of all
subjects connected with the strength, etc., of the army, the
preparations going forward for the siege of Lucknow, and how the
newly-arrived regiments were likely to stand the hot weather.In course
of conversation I made some remarks about the fluency of his English,
and he accounted for it by stating that his father had been the
mess-_khansama_ of a European regiment, and that he had been brought up
to speak English from his childhood, that he had learned to read and
write in the regimental school, and for many years had filled the post
of mess-writer, keeping all the accounts of the mess in English.During
this time the men in the tent had been freely trying the plum-cakes, and
a squabble arose between one of them and Jamie Green's servant about
payment.When I made some remark about the villainous look of the
latter Green replied: "Oh, never mind him; he is an Irishman, and his
name is Micky.His mother belongs to the regimental bazaar of the
Eighty-Seventh Royal Irish, and he lays claim to the whole regiment,
including the sergeant-major's cook, for his father.He has just come
down from the Punjab with the Agra convoy, but the commanding officer
dismissed him at Cawnpore, because he had a young wife of his own, and
was jealous of the good looks of Micky.But," continued Jamie Green, "a
joke is a joke, but to eat a man's plum-cakes and then refuse to pay for
them must be a Highland joke!"On this every man in the tent,
appreciating the good humour of Jamie Green, turned on the man who had
refused payment, and he was obliged to fork out the amount demanded.Jamie Green and Micky passed on to another tent, after the former had
borrowed a few of the latest of my newspapers.Thus ended my first
interview with the plum-cake vendor.The second one was more interesting, and with a sadder termination.On
the evening of the day after the events just described, I was on duty as
sergeant in charge of our camp rear-guard, and at sunset when the
orderly-corporal came round with the evening grog, he told us the
strange news that Jamie Green, the plum-cake _wallah_, had been
discovered to be a spy from Lucknow, had been arrested, and was then
undergoing examination at the brigade-major's tent; and that it being
too late to hang him that night, he was to be made over to my guard for
safe custody, and that men had been warned for extra sentry on the
guard-tent.I need not say that I was very sorry to hear the
information, for, although a spy is at all times detested in the army,
and no mercy is ever shown to one, yet I had formed a strong regard for
this man, and a high opinion of his abilities in the short conversation
I had held with him the previous day; and during the interval I had been
thinking over how a man of his appearance and undoubted education could
hold so low a position as that of a common camp-follower.But now the
news that he had been discovered to be a spy accounted for the anomaly.It would be needless for me to describe the bitter feeling of all
classes against the mutineers, or rebels, and for any one to be
denounced as a spy simply added fuel to the flames of hatred.Asiatic
campaigns have always been conducted in a more remorseless spirit than
those between European nations, but the war of the Mutiny, as I have
before remarked in these reminiscences, was far worse than the usual
type of even Asiatic fighting.It was something horrible and downright
brutalising for an English army to be engaged in such a struggle, in
which no quarter was ever given or asked.It was a war of downright
butchery.Wherever the rebels met a Christian or a white man he was
killed without pity or remorse, and every native who had assisted any
such to escape, or was known to have concealed them, was as
remorselessly put to death wherever the rebels had the ascendant.And
wherever a European in power, either civil or military, met a rebel in
arms, or any native whatever on whom suspicion rested, his shrift was as
short and his fate as sure.The farce of putting an accused native on
his trial before any of the civil officers attached to the different
army-columns, after the civil power commenced to reassert its authority,
was simply a parody on justice and a protraction of cruelty.Under
martial law, punishment, whether deserved or not, was stern but sharp.But the civilian officers attached to the different movable columns for
the trial of rebels, as far as they came under my notice, were even more
relentless.No doubt these men excused themselves by the consideration
that they were engaged in suppressing rebellion and mutiny, and that the
actors on the other side had perpetrated great crimes.[38] So far as the
Commander-in-Chief was concerned, Sir Colin Campbell was utterly opposed
to extreme measures, and deeply deplored the wholesale executions by the
civil power.Although as a soldier he would have been the last man in
the country to spare rebels caught with arms in their hands, or those
whose guilt was well known (and I know for certain that he held the
action of Major Hodson with regard to the Delhi princes to have been
justifiable), I well remember how emphatically I once heard him express
his disgust when, on the march back from Futtehghur to Cawnpore, he
entered a mango-tope full of rotting corpses, where one of those special
commissioners had passed through with a movable column a few days
before.I had barely heard the news that Green
had been arrested as a spy, when he was brought to my guard by some of
the provost-marshal's staff, and handed over to me with instructions to
keep him safe till he should be called for next morning.He was
accompanied by the man who had carried his basket, who had also been
denounced as one of the butchers at Cawnpore in July, 1857.And here I
may state that the appearance of this man certainly did tally with the
description afterwards given of one of these butchers by Fitchett, an
Eurasian drummer attached to the Sixth Native Infantry which mutinied at
Cawnpore, who embraced the Mahommedan religion to save his life, and was
enrolled in the rebel force, but afterwards made his escape and
presented himself at Meerut for enlistment in the police levy raised in
October, 1858.What I am relating took place in February, 1858, about
eight months before the existence of Fitchett was known to the
authorities.However, when it was discovered that Fitchett had been
serving in one of the mutineers' regiments, he was called on to say what
he knew about the Cawnpore massacre, and I remember his statement was
considered the most consistent of any of the numerous narratives
published about it.Fitchett alleged that the sepoys of the Sixth
Native Infantry and other regiments, including the Nana Sahib's own
guard, had refused to kill the European women and children in the
_bibi-ghur_,[39] and that five men were then brought by a slave-girl or
mistress of the Nana to do it.Of the five men employed, two were
butchers and two were villagers, and the fifth man was "a stout
_bilaitee_[40] with very hairy hands."Fitchett further described one of
the butchers as a tall, ugly man, very dark, and very much disfigured by
smallpox, all points that tallied exactly with the appearance of this
_coolie_.I don't suppose that Fitchett could have known that a man
answering to his description had been hanged, as being one of the actors
in the Cawnpore tragedy, some eight months before, for I don't recollect
ever having seen the matter which I am relating mentioned in any
newspaper.My prisoners had no sooner been made
over to me, than several of the guard, as was usual in those days,
proposed to bring some pork from the bazaar to break their castes, as a
sort of preparation for their execution.This I at once denounced as a
proceeding which I certainly would not tolerate so long as I held charge
of the guard, and I warned the men that if any one attempted to molest
the prisoners, I should at once strip them of their belts, and place
them in arrest for disobedience of orders and conduct unworthy of a
British soldier, and the better-disposed portion of the guard at once
applauded my resolution.I shall never forget the look of gratitude
which came over the face of the unfortunate man who had called himself
Jamie Green, when he heard me give these orders.He at once said it was
an act of kindness which he had never expected, and for which he was
truly grateful; and he unhesitatingly pronounced his belief that Allah
and his Prophet would requite my kindness by bringing me safely through
the remainder of the war.I thanked my prisoner for his good wishes and
his prayers, and made him the only return in my power, viz., to cause
his hands to be unfastened to allow him to perform his evening's
devotions, and permitted him as much freedom as I possibly could,
consistent with safe custody.His fellow-prisoner merely received my
kindness with a scowl of sullen hatred, and when reproved by his master,
I understood him to say that he wished for no favour from infidel dogs;
but he admitted that the sergeant _sahib_, deserved a Mussulman's
gratitude for saving him from an application of pig's fat.After allowing my prisoners to perform their evening devotions, and
giving them such freedom as I could, I made up my mind to go without
sleep that night, for it would have been a serious matter for me if
either of these men had escaped.I also knew that by remaining on watch
myself I could allow them more freedom, and I determined they should
enjoy every privilege in my power for what would certainly be their last
night on earth, since it was doubtful if they would be spared to see
the sun rise.With this view, I sent for one of the Mahommedan
shopkeepers from the regimental bazaar, and told him to prepare at my
expense whatever food the prisoners would eat.To this the man replied
that since I, a Christian, had shown so much kindness to a Mussulman in
distress, the Mahommedan shopkeepers in the bazaar would certainly be
untrue to their faith if they should allow me to spend a single _pie_,
from my own pocket.After being supplied with a savoury meal from the bazaar, followed by a
fragrant hookah, to both of which he did ample justice, Jamie Green
settled himself on a rug which had been lent to him, and said "_Shook'r
Khooda!_, (Thanks be to God)," for having placed him under the charge of
such a merciful _sahib_, for this the last night of his life!"Such," he
continued, "has been my _kismut_, and doubtless Allah will reward you,
Sergeant _sahib_, in his own good time for your kindness to his
oppressed and afflicted servant.You have asked me to give you some
account of my life, and if it is really true that I am a spy.With
regard to being a spy in the ordinary meaning of the term, I most
emphatically deny the accusation.I am no spy; but I am an officer of
the Begum's army, come out from Lucknow to gain reliable information of
the strength of the army and siege-train being brought against us.I am
the chief engineer of the army of Lucknow, and came out on a
reconnoitring expedition, but Allah has not blessed my enterprise.I
intended to have left on my return to Lucknow this evening, and if fate
had been propitious, I would have reached it before sunrise to-morrow,
for I had got all the information which was wanted; but I was tempted to
visit Oonao once more, being on the direct road to Lucknow, because I
was anxious to see whether the siege-train and ammunition-park had
commenced to move, and it was my misfortune to encounter that son of a
defiled mother who denounced me as a spy.A contemptible wretch who, to
save his own neck from the gallows (for he first sold the English), now
wishes to divert attention from his former rascality by selling the
lives of his own countrymen and co-religionists; but Allah is just, he
will yet reap the reward of his treachery in the fires of Jehunnum.[41]

"You ask me," continued the man, "what my name is, and state that you
intend to write an account of my misfortune to your friends in Scotland.The people of England,--and by England I mean
Scotland as well--are just, and some of them may pity the fate of this
servant of Allah.I have friends both in London and in Edinburgh, for I
have twice visited both places.I belong to
one of the best families of Rohilcund, and was educated in the Bareilly
College, and took the senior place in all English subjects.From
Bareilly College I passed to the Government Engineering College at
Roorkee, and studied engineering for the Company's service, and passed
out the senior student of my year, having gained many marks in excess of
all the European pupils, both civil and military.I was nominated to the rank of _jemadar_, of the Company's
engineers, and sent to serve with a company on detached duty on the hill
roads as a native commissioned officer, but actually subordinate to a
European sergeant, a man who was my inferior in every way, except,
perhaps, in mere brute strength, a man of little or no education, who
would never have risen above the grade of a working-joiner in England.Like most ignorant men in authority, he exhibited all the faults of the
Europeans which most irritate and disgust us, arrogance, insolence, and
selfishness.Unless you learn the language of my countrymen, and mix
with the better-educated people of this country, you will never
understand nor estimate at its full extent the mischief which one such
man does to your national reputation.One such example is enough to
confirm all that your worst enemies can say about your national
selfishness and arrogance, and makes the people treat your pretensions
to liberality and sympathy as mere hypocrisy.I had not joined the
Company's service from any desire for wealth, but from the hope of
gaining honourable service; yet on the very threshold of that service I
met with nothing but disgrace and dishonour, having to serve under a man
whom I hated, yea, worse than hated, whom I despised.I wrote to my
father, and requested his permission to resign, and he agreed with me
that I the descendant of princes, could not serve the Company under
conditions such as I have described.I resigned the service and returned
home, intending to offer my services to his late Majesty
Nussir-ood-Deen, King of Oude; but just when I reached Lucknow I was
informed that his Highness Jung Bahadoor of Nepal, who is now at
Goruckpore with an army of Goorkhas coming to assist in the loot of
Lucknow, was about to visit England, and required a secretary well
acquainted with the English language.I at once applied for the post,
and being well backed by recommendations both from native princes and
English officials, I secured the appointment, and in the suite of the
Maharaja I landed in England for the first time, and, among other
places, we visited Edinburgh, where your regiment, the Ninety-Third
Highlanders, formed the guard of honour for the reception of his
Highness.Little did I think when I saw a kilted regiment for the first
time, that I should ever be a prisoner in their tents in the plains of
Hindustan; but who can predict or avoid his fate?"Well, I returned to India, and filled several posts at different native
courts till 1854, when I was again asked to visit England in the suite
of Azeemoolla Khan, whose name you must have often heard in connection
with this mutiny and rebellion.On the death of the Peishwa, the Nana
had appointed Azeemoolla Khan to be his agent.He, like myself, had
received a good education in English, under Gunga Deen, head-master of
the Government school at Cawnpore.Azeemoolla was confident that, if he
could visit England, he would be able to have the decrees of Lord
Dalhousie against his master reversed, and when I joined him he was
about to start for England, well supplied with money to engage the best
lawyers, and also to bribe high officials, if necessary.But I need not
give you any account of our mission.You already know that, so far as
London drawing-rooms went, it proved a social success, but as far as
gaining our end a political failure; and we left England after spending
over L50,000, to return to India _via_ Constantinople in 1855.From
Constantinople we visited the Crimea, where we witnessed the assault and
defeat of the English on the 18th of June, and were much struck by the
wretched state of both armies in front of Sebastopol.Thence we returned
to Constantinople, and there met certain real or pretended Russian
agents, who made large promises of material support if Azeemoolla could
stir up a rebellion in India.It was then that I and Azeemoolla formed
the resolution of attempting to overthrow the Company's Government, and,
_Shook'r Khooda!_ we have succeeded in doing that; for from the
newspapers which you lent me, I see that the Company's _raj_ has gone,
and that their charter for robbery and confiscation will not be renewed.Although we have failed to wrest the country from the English, I hope we
have done some good, and that our lives will not be sacrificed in vain;
for I believe direct government under the English parliament will be
more just than was that of the Company, and that there is yet a future
before my oppressed and downtrodden countrymen, although I shall not
live to see it."I do not speak, _sahib_, to flatter you or to gain your favour.I have
already gained that, and I know that you cannot help me any farther than
you are doing, and that if you could, your sense of duty would not let
you.I know I must die; but the unexpected kindness which you have shown
to me has caused me to speak my mind.I came to this tent with hatred in
my heart, and curses on my lips; but your kindness to me, unfortunate,
has made me, for the second time since I left Lucknow, ashamed of the
atrocities committed during this rebellion.The first time was at
Cawnpore a few days ago, when Colonel Napier of the Engineers was
directing the blowing up of the Hindoo temples on the Cawnpore _ghat_,
and a deputation of Hindoo priests came to him to beg that the temples
might not be destroyed.'Now, listen to me,' said Colonel Napier in
reply to them; 'you were all here when our women and children were
murdered, and you also well know that we are not destroying these
temples for vengeance, but for military considerations connected with
the safety of the bridge of boats.But if any man among you can prove to
me that he did a single act of kindness to any Christian man, woman, or
child, nay, if he can even prove that he uttered one word of
intercession for the life of any one of them, I pledge myself to spare
the temple where he worships.'Sandra went to the bedroom.I was standing in the crowd close to
Colonel Napier at the time, and I thought it was bravely spoken.There
was no reply, and the cowardly Brahmins slunk away.Napier gave the
signal and the temples leaped into the air; and I was so impressed with
the justness of Napier's remarks that I too turned away, ashamed."On this I asked him, "Were you in Cawnpore when the Mutiny broke out?"To which he replied: "No, thank God!I was in my home in Rohilcund; and
my hands are unstained by the blood of any one, excepting those who have
fallen in the field of battle.I knew that the storm was about to burst,
and had gone to place my wife and children in safety, and I was in my
village when I heard the news of the mutinies at Meerut and Bareilly.I
immediately hastened to join the Bareilly brigade, and marched with them
for Delhi.There I was appointed engineer-in-chief, and set about
strengthening the defences by the aid of a party of the Company's
engineers which had mutinied on the march from Roorkee to Meerut.I
remained in Delhi till it was taken by the English in September.I then
made my way to Lucknow with as many men as I could collect of the
scattered forces.We first marched to Muttra, where we were obliged to
halt till I threw a bridge of boats across the Jumna for the retreat of
the army.We had still a force of over thirty thousand men under the
command of Prince Feroz Shah and General Bukht Khan.As soon as I
reached Lucknow I was honoured with the post of chief-engineer.I was in
Lucknow in November when your regiment assisted to relieve the
Residency.I saw the horrible slaughter in the Secundrabagh.I had
directed the defences of that place the night before, and was looking
on from the Shah Nujeef when you assaulted it.I had posted over three
thousand of the best troops in Lucknow in the Secundrabagh, as it was
the key to the position, and not a man escaped.I nearly fainted; my
liver turned to water when I saw the green flag pulled down, and a
Highland bonnet set up on the flag-staff which I had erected the night
before.I knew then that all was over, and directed the guns of the Shah
Nujeef to open fire on the Secundrabagh.Since then I have planned and
superintended the construction of all the defensive works in and around
Lucknow.You will see them when you return, and if the sepoys and
artillerymen stand firmly behind them, many of the English army will
lose the number of their mess, as you call it, before you again become
masters of Lucknow."I then asked him if it was true that the man he had called Micky on our
first acquaintance had been one of the men employed by the Nana to
butcher the women and children at Cawnpore in July?To this he replied:
"I believe it is true, but I did not know this when I employed him; he
was merely recommended to me as a man on whom I could depend.If I had
known then that he was a murderer of women and children, I should have
had nothing to do with him, for it is he who has brought bad luck on me;
it is my _kismut_, and I must suffer.Your English proverb says, 'You
cannot touch pitch and escape defilement,' and I must suffer; Allah is
just.It is the conduct of wretches such as these that has brought the
anger of Allah on our cause."On this I asked him if he knew whether
there was any truth in the report of the European women having been
dishonoured before being murdered."_Sahib_," he replied, "you are a
stranger to this country or you would not ask such a question.Any one
who knows anything of the customs of this country and the strict rules
of caste, knows that all such stories are lies, invented to stir up
race-hatred, as if we had not enough of that on both sides already.That
the women and children were cruelly murdered I admit, but not one of
them was dishonoured; and all the sentences written on the walls of the
houses in Cawnpore, such as, 'We are at the mercy of savages, who have
ravished young and old,' and such like, which have appeared in the
Indian papers and been copied from them into the English ones, are
malicious forgeries, and were written on the walls after the
re-occupation of Cawnpore by General Outram's and Havelock's forces.Although I was not there myself, I have spoken with many who were there,
and I know that what I tell you is true."I then asked him if he could give me any idea of the reason that had led
the Nana to order the commission of such a cold-blooded, cowardly crime."Asiatics," he said, "are weak, and their promises are not to be relied
on, but that springs more from indifference to obligations than from
prearranged treachery.When they make promises, they intend to keep
them; but when they find them inconvenient, they choose to forget them.And so it was, I believe, with the Nana Sahib.He intended to have
spared the women and children, but they had an enemy in his _zenana_ in
the person of a female fiend who had formerly been a slave-girl, and
there were many about the Nana (Azeemoolla Khan for one) who wished to
see him so irretrievably implicated in rebellion that there would be no
possibility for him to draw back.So this woman was powerfully supported
in her evil counsel, and obtained permission to have the English ladies
killed; and after the sepoys of the Sixth Native Infantry and the Nana's
own guard had refused to do the horrible work, this woman went and
procured the wretches who did it.This information I have from General
Tantia Topee, who quarrelled with the Nana on this same matter.What I
tell you is true: the murder of the European women and children at
Cawnpore was a woman's crime, for there is no fiend equal to a female
fiend; but what cause she had for enmity against the unfortunate ladies
I don't know--I never inquired."Those of my readers who were in India at the time may remember that
something about this slave-girl was said in all the native evidence
collected at the time on the subject of the Cawnpore massacre.I next asked Mahomed Ali Khan if he knew whether there was any truth in
the stories about General Wheeler's daughter having shot four or five
men with a revolver, and then leaped into the well at Cawnpore."All
these stories," was his answer, "are pure inventions with no foundation
of truth.General Wheeler's daughter is still alive, and is now in
Lucknow; she has become a Mussulmanee, and has married according to
Mahommedan law the man who protected her; whether she may ever return to
her own people I know not."In such conversation I passed the night with my prisoner, and towards
daybreak I permitted him to perform his ablutions and morning devotions,
after which he once more thanked me, and prayed that Allah might reward
me for my kindness to His oppressed servant.Once, and only once, did he
show any weakness, in alluding to his wife and two boys in their faraway
home in Rohilcund, when he remarked that they would never know the fate
of their unfortunate father.But he at once checked himself, saying, "I
have read French history as well as English; I must remember Danton, and
show no weakness."He then produced a gold ring which was concealed
among his hair, and asked me if I would accept it and keep it in
remembrance of him, in token of his gratitude.It was, he said, the only
thing he could give me, as everything of value had been taken from him
when he was arrested.He went on to say that the ring in question was
only a common one, not worth more than ten rupees, but that it had been
given to him by a holy man in Constantinople as a talisman, though the
charm had been broken when he had joined the unlucky man who was his
fellow-prisoner.I accepted the ring, which he placed on my finger with
a blessing and a prayer for my preservation, and he told me to look on
it and remember Mahomed Khan when I was in front of the fortifications
of Lucknow, and no evil would befall me.He had hardly finished speaking
when a guard from the provost-marshal came with an order to take over
the prisoners, and I handed this man over with a sincere feeling of pity
for his fate.Immediately after, I received orders that the division would march at
sunrise for Lucknow, and that my party was to join the rear-guard, after
the ammunition-park and siege-train had moved on.The sun was high in
the heavens before we left the encamping-ground, and in passing under a
tree on the side of the Cawnpore and Lucknow road, I looked up, and was
horrified to see my late prisoner and his companion hanging stark and
stiffened corpses!I could hardly repress a tear as I passed.But on the
11th of March, in the assault on the Begum's Kothee, I remembered
Mahomed Ali Khan and looked on the ring.I am thankful to say that I
went through the rest of the campaign without a scratch, and the
thoughts of my kindness to this unfortunate man certainly did not
inspire me with any desire to shirk danger.I still have the ring, the
only piece of Mutiny plunder I ever possessed, and shall hand it down to
my children together with the history of Mahomed Ali Khan.FOOTNOTES:

[37] Butler.[38] It must also be remembered that these officials knew much more of
the terrible facts attending the Mutiny--of the wholesale murder (and
even worse) of English women and the slaughter of English children--than
the rank and file were permitted to hear; and that they were also, both
from their station and their experience, far better able to decide the
measures best calculated to crush the imminent danger threatening our
dominion in India.Among the sepoys the word usually signified an Afghan or
Caubuli.[41] This very man who denounced Jamie Green as a spy was actually
hanged in Bareilly in the following May for having murdered his master
in that station when the Mutiny first broke out.CHAPTER XI

THE SIEGE OF LUCKNOW--SIR COLIN APPOINTED COLONEL OF THE NINETY-THIRD
--ASSAULT ON THE MARTINIERE--A "RANK" JOKE.After leaving Oonao our division under Sir Edward Lugard reached
Buntera, six miles from the Alumbagh, on the 27th of February, and
halted there till the 2nd of March, when we marched to the Dilkoosha,
encamping a short distance from the palace barely beyond reach of the
enemy's guns, for they were able at times to throw round-shot into our
camp.We then settled down for the siege and capture of Lucknow; but the
work before us was considered tame and unimportant when compared with
that of the relief of the previous November.Every soldier in the camp
clearly recognised that the capture of the doomed city was simply a
matter of time,--a few days more or less--and the task before us a mere
matter of routine, nothing to be compared to the exciting exertions
which we had to put forth for the relief of our countrywomen and their
children.At the time of the annexation of Oude Lucknow was estimated to contain
from eight to nine hundred thousand inhabitants, or as many as Delhi and
Benares put together.The camp and bazaars of our force were full of
reports of the great strength and determination of the enemy, and
certainly all the chiefs of Oude, Mahommedan and Hindoo, had joined the
standard of the Begum and had sworn to fight for their young king Brijis
Kuddur.All Oude was therefore still against us, and we held only the
ground covered by the British guns.Bazaar reports estimated the enemy's
strength at from two hundred and fifty to three hundred thousand
fighting men, with five hundred guns in position; but in the
Commander-in-Chief's camp the strength of the enemy was computed at
sixty thousand regulars, mutineers who had lately served the Company,
and about seventy thousand irregulars, matchlock-men, armed police,
dacoits, etc., making a total of one hundred and thirty thousand
fighting men.To fight this large army, sheltered behind entrenchments
and loophooled walls, the British force, even after being joined by Jung
Bahadoor's Goorkhas, mustered only about thirty-one thousand men of all
arms, and one hundred and sixty-four guns.From the heights of the Dilkoosha in the cool of the early morning,
Lucknow, with its numerous domed mosques, minarets, and palaces, looked
very picturesque.I don't think I ever saw a prettier scene than that
presented on the morning of the 3rd of March, 1858, when the sun rose,
and Captain Peel and his Blue-jackets were getting their heavy guns,
68-pounders, into position.From the Dilkoosha, even without the aid of
telescopes, we could see that the defences had been greatly
strengthened since we retired from Lucknow in November, and I called to
mind the warning of Jamie Green, that if the enemy stood to their guns
like men behind those extensive earthworks, many of the British force
would lose the number of their mess before we could take the city; and
although the Indian papers which reached our camp affected to sneer at
the Begum, Huzrut Mahal, and the legitimacy of her son Brijis Kuddur,
whom the mutineers had proclaimed King of Oude, they had evidently the
support of the whole country, for every chief and _zemindar_ of any
importance had joined them.On the morning after we had pitched our camp in the Dilkoosha park, I
went out with Sergeant Peter Gillespie, our deputy provost-marshal, to
take a look round the bazaars, and just as we turned a corner on our way
back to camp, we met some gentlemen in civilian dress, one of whom
turned out to be Mr.Russell, the _Times'_ correspondent, whom we never
expected to have seen in India.I never did think of meeting you here,
but I am right glad to see you, and so will all our boys be!"After a
short chat and a few inquiries about the regiment, Mr.Russell asked
when we expected to be in Lucknow, to which Peter Gillespie replied:
"Well, I dinna ken, sir, but when Sir Colin likes to give the order,
we'll just advance and take it."I may here mention that Sergeant
Gillespie lived to go through the Mutiny, and the cholera epidemic in
Peshawar in 1862, only to die of hydrophobia from the bite of a pet dog
in Sialkote years after, when he was about to retire on his sergeant's
pension.I mention this because Peter Gillespie was a well-known
character in the old regiment; he had served on the staff of the
provost-marshal throughout the Crimean war, and, so far as I now
remember, Colonel Ewart and Sergeant Gillespie were the only two men in
the regiment who gained the Crimean medal with the four clasps, for
Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and Sebastopol.On the 4th of March the Ninety-Third, a squadron of the Ninth Lancers,
and a battery of artillery, were marched to the banks of the Goomtee
opposite Beebeepore House, to form a guard for the engineers engaged in
throwing a pontoon bridge across the Goomtee.The weather was now very
hot in the day-time, and as we were well beyond the range of the enemy's
guns, we were allowed to undress by companies and bathe in the river.As
far as I can remember, we were two days on this duty.During the
forenoon of the second day the Commander-in-Chief visited us, and the
regiment fell in to receive him, because, he said, he had something of
importance to communicate.When formed up, Sir Colin told us that he had
just received despatches from home, and among them a letter from the
Queen in which the Ninety-Third was specially mentioned.He then pulled
the letter out of his pocket, and read the paragraph alluded to, which
ran as follows, as nearly as I remembered to note it down after it was
read: "The Queen wishes Sir Colin to convey the expression of her great
admiration and gratitude to all European as well as native troops who
have fought so nobly and so gallantly for the relief of Lucknow, amongst
whom the Queen is rejoiced to see the Ninety-Third Highlanders."Colonel
Leith-Hay at once called for three cheers for her Majesty the Queen,
which were given with hearty good-will, followed by three more for the
Commander-in-Chief.The colonel then requested Sir Colin to return the
thanks of the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the
regiment to her Majesty the Queen for her most gracious message, and for
her special mention of the Ninety-Third, an honour which no one serving
in the regiment would ever forget.To this Sir Colin replied that
nothing would give him greater pleasure than to comply with this
request; but he had still more news to communicate.He had also a letter
from his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge to read to us, which he
proceeded to do as follows: "One line in addition to my letter addressed
to you this morning, to say that, in consequence of the Colonelcy of the
Ninety-Third Highlanders having become vacant by the death of General
Parkinson, I have recommended the Queen to remove you to the command of
that distinguished and gallant corps, with which you have been so much
associated, not alone at the present moment in India, but also during
the whole of the campaign in the Crimea.I thought such an arrangement
would be agreeable to yourself, and I know that it is the highest
compliment that her Majesty could pay to the Ninety-Third Highlanders to
see their dear old chief at their head."As soon as Sir Colin had read
this letter, the whole regiment cheered till we were hoarse; and when
Sir Colin's voice could again be heard, he called for the master-tailor
to go to the headquarters camp to take his measure to send home for a
uniform of the regiment for him, feather bonnet and all complete; and
about eighteen months afterwards Sir Colin visited us in Subathoo,
dressed in the regimental uniform then ordered.Early on the 7th of March General Outram's division crossed the Goomtee
by the bridge of boats, and we returned to our tents at the Dilkoosha.About mid-day we could see Outram's division, of which the Seventy-Ninth
Cameron Highlanders formed one of the infantry corps, driving the enemy
before them in beautiful style.We saw also the Queen's Bays, in their
bright scarlet uniform and brass helmets, make a splendid charge,
scattering the enemy like sheep, somewhere about the place where the
buildings of the Upper India Paper Mills now stand.In this charge Major
Percy Smith and several men galloped right through the enemy's lines,
and were surrounded and killed.Spies reported that Major Smith's head
was cut off, and, with his helmet, plume, and uniform, paraded through
the streets of Lucknow as the head of the Commander-in-Chief.But the
triumph of the enemy was short.On the 8th General Outram was firmly
established on the north bank of the Goomtee, with a siege-train of
twenty-two heavy guns, with which he completely turned and enfiladed the
enemy's strong position.On the 9th of March we were ordered to take our dinners at twelve
o'clock, and shortly after that hour our division, consisting of the
Thirty-Eighth, Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, Ninetieth, Ninety-Third, and
Fourth Punjab Infantry, was under arms, screened by the Dilkoosha palace
and the garden walls round it, and Peel's Blue-jackets were pouring shot
and shell, with now and again a rocket, into the Martiniere as fast as
ever they could load.About two o'clock the order was given for the
advance--the Forty-Second to lead and the Ninety-Third to support; but
we no sooner emerged from the shelter of the palace and garden-walls
than the orderly advance became a rushing torrent.Both regiments dashed
down the <DW72> abreast, and the earthworks, trenches, and rifle-pits in
front of the Martiniere were cleared, the enemy flying before us as fast
as their legs could carry them.We pursued them right through the
gardens, capturing their first line of works along the canal in front of
Banks's bungalow and the Begum's palace.There we halted for the night,
our heavy guns and mortar-batteries being advanced from the Dilkoosha;
and I, with some men from my company, was sent on piquet to a line of
unroofed huts in front of one of our mortar-batteries, for fear the
enemy from the Begum's palace might make a rush on the mortars.This
piquet was not relieved till the morning of the 11th, when I learned
that my company had been sent back as camp-guards, the captains of
companies having drawn lots for this service, as all were equally
anxious to take part in the assault on the Begum's palace, and it was
known the Ninety-Third were to form the storming-party.As soon as the
works should be breached, I and the men who were with me on the
advance-piquet were to be sent to join Captain M'Donald's company,
instead of going back to our own in camp.After being relieved from
piquet, our little party set about preparing some food.Our own company
having gone back to camp, no rations had been drawn for us, and our
haversacks were almost empty; so I will here relate a mild case of
cannibalism.Of the men of my own company who were with me on this
piquet one was Andrew M'Onvill,--Handy Andy, as he was called in the
regiment--a good-hearted, jolly fellow, and as full of fun and practical
jokes as his namesake, Lever's hero,--a thorough Paddy from Armagh, a
soldier as true as the steel of a Damascus blade or a Scotch Andrea
Ferrara.When last I heard of him, I may add, he was sergeant-major of a
New Zealand militia regiment.Others were Sandy Proctor, soldier-servant
to Dr.Munro, and George Patterson, the son of the carrier of Ballater
in Aberdeenshire.I forget who the rest were, but we were joined by John
M'Leod, the pipe-major, and one or two more.We got into an empty hut,
well sheltered from the bullets of the enemy, and Handy Andy sallied out
on a foraging expedition for something in the way of food.He had a
friend in the Fifty-Third who was connected in some way with the
quarter-master's department, and always well supplied with extra
provender.The Fifty-Third were on our right, and there Handy Andy found
his friend, and returned with a good big steak, cut from an artillery
gun-bullock which had been killed by a round-shot; also some sheep's
liver and a haversack full of biscuits, with plenty of pumpkin to make
a good stew.There was no lack of cooking-pots in the huts around, and
plenty of wood for fuel, so we kindled a fire, and very soon had an
excellent stew in preparation.But the enemy pitched some shells into
our position, and one burst close to a man named Tim Drury, a big stout
fellow, killing him on the spot.I forget now which company he belonged
to, but his body lay where he fell, just outside our hut, with one thigh
nearly torn away.My readers must not for a moment think that such a
picture in the foreground took away our appetites in the least.There is
nothing like a campaign for making one callous and selfish, and
developing the qualities of the wild beast in one's nature; and the
thought which rises uppermost is--Well, it is his turn now, and it may
be mine next, and there is no use in being down-hearted!Our steak had
been broiled to a turn, and our stew almost cooked, when we noticed
tiffin and breakfast combined arrive for the European officers of the
Fourth Punjab Regiment, and some others who were waiting sheltered by
the walls of a roofless hut near where we were.Among them was a young
fellow, Lieutenant Fitzgerald Cologan, attached to some native regiment,
a great favourite with the Ninety-Third for his pluck.John M'Leod at
once proposed that Handy Andy should go and offer him half of our
broiled steak, and ask him for a couple of bottles of beer for our
dinner, as it might be the last time we should have the chance of
drinking his health.He and the other officers with him accepted the
steak with thanks, and Andy returned, to our no small joy, with two
quart bottles of Bass's beer.But, unfortunately he had attracted the
attention of Charley F., the greatest glutton in the Ninety-Third, who
was so well known for his greediness that no one would chum with him.Charley was a long-legged, humpbacked, cadaverous-faced, bald-headed
fellow, who had joined the regiment as a volunteer from the
Seventy-Second before we left Dover in the spring of 1857, and on
account of his long legs and humpback, combined with the inordinate
capacity of his stomach and an incurable habit of grumbling, he had been
re-christened the "Camel," before we had proceeded many marches with
that useful animal in India.Our mutual congratulations were barely over
on the acquisition of the two bottles of beer, when, to our
consternation, we saw the Camel dodging from cover to cover, as the
enemy were keeping up a heavy fire on our position, and if any one
exposed himself in the least, a shower of bullets was sent whistling
round him.However, the Camel, with a due regard to the wholeness of his
skin, steadily made way towards our hut.We all knew that if he were
admitted to a share of our stew, very little would be left for
ourselves.John M'Leod and I suggested that we should, at the risk of
quarrelling with him, refuse to allow him any share, but Handy Andy
said, "Leave him to me, and if a bullet doesn't knock him over as he
comes round the next corner, I'll put him off asking for a share of the
stew."Well, the Camel took good
care to dodge the bullets of Jack Pandy, and he no sooner reached a
sheltered place in front of the hut, than Andy called out: "Come along,
Charley, you are just in time; we got a slice of a nice steak from an
artillery-bullock this morning, and because it was too small alone for a
dinner for the four of us, we have just stewed it with a slice from Tim
Drury, and bedad it's first-rate!Tim tastes for all the world like
fresh pork"; and with that Andy picked out a piece of the sheep's liver
on the prongs of his fork, and offered it to Charley as part of Tim
Drury, at the same time requesting him not to mention the circumstance
to any one.This was too much for the Camel's stomach.He plainly
believed Andy, and turned away, as if he would be sick.However, he
recovered himself, and replied: "No, thank you; hungry as I am, it shall
never be in the power of any one to tell my auld mither in the Grass
Market o' Edinboro' that her Charley had become a cannibal!But if you
can spare me a drop of the beer I'll be thankful for it, for the sight
of your stew has made me feel unco' queer."We expressed our sorrow that
the beer was all drunk before we had seen Charley performing his oblique
advance, and Andy again pressed him to partake of a little of the stew;
but Charley refused to join, and sitting down in a sheltered spot in the
corner of our roofless mud-hut, made wry faces at the relish evinced by
the rest of us over our savoury stew.The Camel eventually discovered
that he had been made a fool of, and he never forgave us for cheating
him out of a share of the savoury mess.CHAPTER XII

ASSAULT ON THE BEGUM'S KOTHEE--DEATH OF CAPTAIN M'DONALD--MAJOR HODSON
WOUNDED--HIS DEATH


We had barely finished our meal when we noticed a stir among the
staff-officers, and a consultation taking place between General Sir
Edward Lugard, Brigadier Adrian Hope, and Colonel Napier.Suddenly the
order was given to the Ninety-Third to fall in.This was quietly done,
the officers taking their places, the men tightening their belts and
pressing their bonnets firmly on their heads, loosening the ammunition
in their pouches, and seeing that the springs of their bayonets held
tight.Thus we stood for a few seconds, when Brigadier Hope passed the
signal for the assault on the Begum's Kothee.Just before the signal was
given two men from the Fifty-Third rushed up to us with a soda-water
bottle full of grog.One of them was Lance-Corporal Robert Clary, who is
at present, I believe, police-sergeant in the Municipal Market,
Calcutta; the other was the friend of Andrew M'Onvill, who had supplied
us with the steaks for our "cannibal feast."I may mention that
Lance-Corporal Clary was the same man who led the party of the
Fifty-Third to capture the guns at the Kalee Nuddee bridge, and who
called out: "Three cheers for the Commander-in-Chief, boys," when Sir
Colin Campbell was threatening to send the regiment to the rear for
breach of orders.Clary was a County Limerick boy of the right sort,
such as filled the ranks of our Irish regiments of the old days.No
Fenian nor Home Ruler; but ever ready to uphold the honour of the
British Army by land or by sea, and to share the contents of his
haversack or his glass of grog with a comrade; one of those whom Scott
immortalises in _The Vision of Don Roderick_.from yon stately ranks what laughter rings,
      Mingling wild mirth with war's stern minstrelsy,
    His jest while each blithe comrade round him flings,
      And moves to death with military glee!tameless, frank, and free,
      In kindness warm, and fierce in danger known,
    Rough Nature's children, humorous as she.When Captain M'Donald, whose company we had joined, saw the two
Fifty-Third boys, he told them that they had better rejoin their own
regiment.Clary replied, "Sure, Captain, you don't mean it;" and seeing
Dr.Munro, our surgeon, busy giving directions to his assistants and
arranging bandages, etc., in a _dooly_, Clary went on:--"We have been
sent by Lieutenant Munro of our company to take care of his namesake
your doctor, who never thinks of himself, but is sure to be in the thick
of the fight, looking out for wounded men.You of the Ninety-Third don't
appreciate his worth.There's not another doctor in the army to equal
him or to replace him should he get knocked over in this scrimmage, and
we of the Fifty-Third have come to take care of him.""If that is the
case," said Captain M'Donald, "I'll allow you to remain; but you must
take care that no harm befalls our doctor, for he is a great friend of
mine."And with that Captain M'Donald stepped aside and plucked a rose
from a bush close by, (we were then formed up in what had been a
beautiful garden), and going up to Munro he gave him the flower saying,
"Good-bye, old friend, keep this for my sake."I have often recalled
this incident and wondered if poor Captain M'Donald had any presentiment
that he would be killed!Although he had been a captain for some years,
he was still almost a boy.He was a son of General Sir John M'Donald,
K.C.B., of Dalchosnie, Perthshire, and was wounded in his right arm
early in the day by a splinter from a shell, but he refused to go to the
rear, and remained at the head of his company, led it through the
breach, and was shot down just inside, two bullets striking him almost
at once, one right in his throat just over the breast-bone, as he was
waving his claymore and cheering on his company.After the fight was
over I made my way to where the dead were collected and cut off a lock
of his hair and sent it to a young lady, Miss M. E. Ainsworth, of
Inverighty House, Forfar, who, I knew, was acquainted with Captain
M'Donald's family.I intended the lock of hair for his mother, and I did
not know if his brother officers would think of sending any memento of
him.I don't know if ever the lock of hair reached his mother or not.When I went to do this I found Captain M'Donald's soldier-servant
crying beside the lifeless body of his late master, wringing his hands
and saying, "Oh!I never
saw a more girlish-looking face than his was in death; his features were
so regular, and looked strangely like those of a wax doll, which was, I
think, partly the effect of the wound in the throat.When Captain McDonald fell the company was led by the senior lieutenant,
and about twenty yards inside the breach in the outer rampart we were
stopped by a ditch nearly eighteen feet wide and at least twelve to
fourteen feet deep.It was easy enough to slide down to the bottom; the
difficulty was to get up on the other side!However, there was no
hesitation; the stormers dashed into the ditch, and running along to the
right in search of some place where we could get up on the inside, we
met part of the grenadier company headed by Lieutenant E. S. Wood, an
active and daring young officer.I may here mention that there were two
lieutenants of the name of Wood at this time in the Ninety-Third.One
belonged to my company; his name was S. E. Wood and he was severely
wounded at the relief of Lucknow and was, at the time of which I am
writing, absent from the regiment.The one to whom I now refer was
Lieutenant E. S. Wood of the grenadier company.When the two parties in
the ditch met, both in search of a place to get out, Mr.Wood got on the
shoulders of another grenadier and somehow scrambled up claymore in
hand.He was certainly the first man inside the inner works of the
Begum's palace, and when the enemy saw him emerge from the ditch they
fled to barricade doors and windows to prevent us getting into the
buildings.His action saved us, for the whole of us might have been shot
like rats in the ditch if they had attacked Mr.Wood, instead of flying
when they saw the tall grenadier claymore in hand.As soon as he saw the
coast clear the lieutenant lay down on the top of the ditch, and was
thus able to reach down and catch hold of the men's rifles by the bends
of the bayonets; and with the aid of the men below pushing up behind, we
were all soon pulled out of the ditch.When all were up, one of the men
turned to Mr.Wood and said: "If any officer in the regiment deserves to
get the Victoria Cross, sir, you do; for besides the risk you have run
from the bullets of the enemy, it's more than a miracle that you're not
shot by our own rifles; they're all on full-cock."Seizing loaded rifles on full-cock by the muzzles, and pulling more than
a score of men out of a deep ditch, was a dangerous thing to do; but no
one thought of the danger, nor did anyone think of even easing the
spring to half-cock, much less of firing his rifle off before being
pulled up.Wood escaped, and after getting his captaincy he
left the regiment and became Conservator of Forests in Oude.H. W. I. Wood, for
many years the well-known secretary to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.He has just lately retired on his pension; I wonder if he ever recalls
the danger he incurred from pulling his men out of the ditch of the
Begum's palace by the muzzles of their loaded rifles on full-cock!By the time we got out of the ditch we found every door and window of
the palace buildings barricaded, and every loophole defended by an
invisible enemy.But one barrier after another was forced, and men in
small parties, headed by the officers, got possession of the inner
square, where the enemy in large numbers stood ready for the struggle.But no thought of unequal numbers held us back.The command was given:
"Keep well together, men, and use the bayonet; give them the
Secundrabagh and the sixteenth of November over again."It raged for about two hours from court to court,
and from room to room; the pipe-major, John M'Leod, playing the pipes
inside as calmly as if he had been walking round the officers' mess-tent
at a regimental festival.When all was over, General Sir Edward Lugard,
who commanded the division, complimented the pipe-major on his coolness
and bravery: "Ah, sir," said John, "I knew our boys would fight all the
better when cheered by the bagpipes.""Within about two hours from the time the signal for the assault was
given, over eight hundred and sixty of the enemy lay dead within the
inner court, and no quarter was sought or given.By this time we were
broken up in small parties in a series of separate fights, all over the
different detached buildings of the palace.Captain M'Donald being dead,
the men who had been on piquet with me joined a party under Lieutenant
Sergison, and while breaking in the door of a room, Mr.Sergison was
shot dead at my side with several men.When we had partly broken in the
door, I saw that there was a large number of the enemy inside the room,
well armed with swords and spears, in addition to fire-arms of all
sorts, and, not wishing to be either killed myself or have more of the
men who were with me killed, I divided my party, placing some at each
side of the door to shoot every man who showed himself, or attempted to
rush out.I then sent two men back to the breach, where I knew Colonel
Napier with his engineers were to be found, to get a few bags of
gunpowder with slow-matches fixed, to light and pitch into the room.Instead of finding Napier, the two men sent by me found the redoubtable
Major Hodson who had accompanied Napier as a volunteer in the storming
of the palace.Hodson did not wait for the powder-bags, but, after
showing the men where to go for them, came running up himself, sabre in
hand.I pointed to the door of the
room, and Hodson, shouting 'Come on!'I implored
him not to do so, saying, 'It's certain death; wait for the powder; I've
sent men for powder-bags,' Hodson made a step forward, and I put out my
hand to seize him by the shoulder to pull him out of the line of the
doorway, when he fell back shot through the chest.He gasped out a few
words, either 'Oh, my wife!'--I cannot now rightly
remember--but was immediately choked by blood.At the time I thought the
bullet had passed through his lungs, but since then I have seen the
memoir written by his brother, the Rev.George H. Hodson, Vicar of
Enfield, in which it is stated that the bullet passed through his liver.However, I assisted to get him lifted into a _dooly_ (by that time the
bearers had got in and were collecting the wounded who were unable to
walk), and I sent him back to where the surgeons were, fully expecting
that he would be dead before anything could be done for him.It will
thus be seen that the assertion that Major Hodson was looting when he
was killed is untrue.No looting had been commenced, not even by Jung
Bahadoor's Goorkhas.That Major Hodson was killed through his own
rashness cannot be denied; but for any one to say that he was looting is
a cruel slander on one of the bravest of Englishmen."Shortly after I had lifted poor Hodson into the _dooly_ and sent him
away in charge of his orderly, the two men who had gone for the powder
came up with several bags, with slow-matches fixed in them.These we
ignited, and then pitched the bags in through the door.Two or three
bags very soon brought the enemy out, and they were bayoneted down
without mercy.One of the men who were with me was, I think, Mr.Rule,
who is now _sans_ a leg, and employed by the G.I.P.Railway in Bombay,
but was then a powerful young man of the light company.Rule rushed in
among the rebels, using both bayonet and butt of his rifle, shouting,
"Revenge for the death of Hodson!"and he killed more than half the men
single-handed.By this time we had been over two hours inside the
breach, and almost all opposition had ceased.Lieutenant and Adjutant
"Willie" MacBean, as he was known to the officers, and "Paddy" MacBean
to the men, encountered a _havildar_, a _naik_, and nine sepoys at one
gate, and killed the whole eleven, one after the other.The _havildar_
was the last; and by the time he got out through the narrow gate,
several men came to the assistance of MacBean, but he called to them not
to interfere, and the _havildar_ and he went at it with their swords.At
length MacBean made a feint cut, but instead gave the point, and put his
sword through the chest of his opponent.For this MacBean got the
Victoria Cross, mainly, I believe, because Sir Edward Lugard, the
general in command of the division, was looking down from the ramparts
above and saw the whole affair.I don't think that MacBean himself
thought he had done anything extraordinary.He was an Inverness-shire
ploughman before he enlisted, and rose from the ranks to command the
regiment, and died a major-general.There were still a number of old
soldiers in the regiment who had been privates with MacBean when I
enlisted, and many anecdotes were related about him.One of these was
that when MacBean first joined, he walked with a rolling gait, and the
drill-corporal was rather abusive with him when learning his drill.At
last he became so offensive that another recruit proposed to MacBean,
who was a very powerful man, that they should call the corporal behind
the canteen in the barrack-yard and give him a good thrashing, to which
proposal MacBean replied: "Toots, toots, man, that would never do.I am
going to command this regiment before I leave it, and it would be an ill
beginning to be brought before the colonel for thrashing the
drill-corporal!"MacBean kept to his purpose, and _did_ live to command
the regiment, going through every rank from private to major-general.I
have seen it stated that he was a drummer-boy in the regiment, but that
is not correct.He was kept seven years lance-corporal, partly because
promotion went slow in the Ninety-Third, but several were promoted over
him because, at the time of the disruption in the Church of Scotland,
MacBean joined the Free Kirk party.This fact may appear strange to
military readers of the present day with our short service and
territorial regiments; but in the times of which I am writing, as I have
before mentioned, the Ninety-Third was constituted as much after the
arrangements of a Highland parish as those of a regiment in the army;
and, to use the words of old Colonel Sparks who commanded, MacBean was
passed over four promotions because "He was a d--d Free Kirker."But I must hark back to my story and to the Begum's palace on the
evening of the 11th of March, 1858.By the time darkness set in all
opposition had ceased, but there were still numbers of the mutineers
hiding in the rooms.Our loss was small compared with that inflicted on
the enemy.Our regiment had one captain, one lieutenant, and thirteen
rank and file killed; Lieutenant Grimston, Ensign Hastie, and
forty-five men wounded.Many of the wounded died afterwards; but eight
hundred and sixty of the enemy lay dead in the centre court alone, and
many hundreds more were killed in the different enclosures and
buildings.That night we bivouacked in the courts of the palace, placing
strong guards all round.When daylight broke on the morning of the 12th
of March, the sights around were horrible.I have already mentioned that
many sepoys had to be dislodged from the close rooms around the palace
by exploding bags of gunpowder among them, and this set fire to their
clothing and to whatever furniture there was in the rooms; and when day
broke on the 12th, there were hundreds of bodies all round, some still
burning and others half-burnt, and the stench was sickening.However,
the Begum's palace was the key to the enemy's position.During the day
large parties of camp-followers were brought in to drag out the dead of
the enemy, and throw them into the ditch which had given us so much
trouble to cross, and our batteries were advanced to bombard the
Imambara and Kaiserbagh.During the forenoon of the 12th, I remember seeing Mr.Russell of _The
Times_ going round making notes, and General Lugard telling him to take
care and not to attempt to go into any dark room for fear of being
"potted" by concealed Pandies.Many such were hunted out during the day,
and as there was no quarter for them they fought desperately.We had
one sergeant killed at this work and several men wounded.During the
afternoon a divisional order by General Sir Edward Lugard was read to
us, as follows:--

"Major-General Sir Edward Lugard begs to thank Brigadier the Honourable
Adrian Hope, Colonel Leith-Hay, and the officers and men of the
Ninety-Third who exclusively carried the position known as the Begum's
Kothee.No words are sufficient to express the gallantry, devotion, and
fearless intrepidity displayed by every officer and man in the regiment.The Major-General will not fail to bring their conduct prominently to
the notice of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief."During the day Sir Colin himself visited the position, and told us that
arrangements would be made for our relief the following day, and on
Saturday, the 13th, we returned to camp and rested all the following
Sunday.So far as I remember, the two men of the Fifty-Third,
Lance-Corporal Clary and his comrade, remained with us till after the
place was taken, and then returned to their own regiment when the
fighting was over, reporting to Lieutenant Munro that they had gone to
take care of his brother, Doctor Munro of the Ninety-Third.There were many individual acts of bravery performed during the assault,
and it is difficult to single them out.But before closing this chapter
I may relate a rather laughable incident that happened to a man of my
company named Johnny Ross.He was a little fellow, and there were two
of the same name in the company, one tall and the other short, so they
were named respectively John and Johnny.Before falling in for the
assault on the Begum's palace, Johnny Ross and George Puller, with some
others, had been playing cards in a sheltered corner, and in some way
quarrelled over the game.When the signal was given for the "fall in,"
Puller and Ross were still arguing the point in dispute, and Puller told
Ross to "shut up."Just at that very moment a spent bullet struck Ross
in the mouth, knocking in four of his front teeth.Johnny thought it was
Puller who had struck him, and at once returned the blow; when Puller
quietly replied, "You d--d fool, it was not I who struck you; you've got
a bullet in your mouth."And so it was: Johnny Ross put up his hand to
his mouth, and spat out four front teeth and a leaden bullet.He at once
apologised to Puller for having struck him, and added, "How will I
manage to bite my cartridges the noo?"Those were the days of
muzzle-loading cartridges, which had to be torn open with the teeth when
loading.We returned to our tents at the Dilkoosha on Saturday, the 13th, and the
whole regiment formed a funeral party for our killed near the palace;
but I could not find the place on my late visit to Lucknow, nor do I
think any monument marks it.When going round the Dilkoosha heights I
found no trace of the graves of the Ninety-Third, nor was there any one
who could point them out to me.The guide took me to see the grave of
Major Hodson.I found it in excellent preservation, with a wall round
it, and an iron gate to it near the entrance to the Martiniere College.This care had been taken of Hodson's last resting-place by his friend,
Lord Napier of Magdala, and I cut a branch from the cypress-tree planted
at his head, and posted half of it to the address of his brother in
England.NOTE

HODSON OF HODSON'S HORSE

      Sir Colin Campbell wrote thus at the time of Major Hodson's
      death: "The whole army, which admired his talents, his
      bravery, and his military skill, deplores his loss.... I
      attended his funeral yesterday evening, in order to show
      what respect I could to the memory of one of the most
      brilliant officers under my command.--(Signed) C.
      CAMPBELL, Commander-in-Chief in East Indies."The following tributes were also paid to Hodson's memory at
      the time.From a leading article in _The Times_: "The
      country will receive with lively regret the news that the
      gallant Major Hodson, who has given his name to an
      invincible and almost ubiquitous body of cavalry, was killed
