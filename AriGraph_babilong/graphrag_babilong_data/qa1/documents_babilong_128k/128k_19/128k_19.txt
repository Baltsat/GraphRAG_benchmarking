There is nothing more interesting than to trace predisposition.An
indefinite, yet strong sympathy with the peasantry of the realm had been
one of the characteristic sensibilities of Lord Henry at Eton.Yet a
schoolboy, he had busied himself with their pastimes and the details of
their cottage economy.As he advanced in life the horizon of his views
expanded with his intelligence and his experience; and the son of one of
the noblest of our houses, to whom the delights of life are offered with
fatal facility, on the very threshold of his career he devoted his
time and thought, labour and life, to one vast and noble purpose, the
elevation of the condition of the great body of the people.'I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule,' said Lord Henry: 'I will
be content with being his gentleman usher.''It shall be put to the vote,' said Lord Vere.'No one has a chance against Buckhurst,' said Coningsby.'Now, Sir Charles,' said Lady Everingham, 'your absolute sway is about
to commence.'The first thing must be my formal installation,' said Buckhurst.'I
vote the Boar's head be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and
Beau shall be the champion to challenge all who may question my right.Duke, you shall be my chief butler, the Duchess my herb-woman.She is to
walk before me, and scatter rosemary.Coningsby shall carry the Boar's
head; Lady Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the canticle; Lord
Everingham shall be marshal of the lists, and put all in the stocks who
are found sober and decorous; Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy
Land, and Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse.Some must carry cups of
Hippocras, some lighted tapers; all must join in chorus.'He ceased his instructions, and all hurried away to carry them into
effect.Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies
in robes of white, with garlands of flowers; some drew pieces of armour
from the wall, and decked themselves with helm and hauberk; others waved
ancient banners.They brought in the Boar's head on a large silver dish,
and Coningsby raised it aloft.They formed into procession, the Duchess
distributing rosemary; Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of
Tamerlane, his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility;
and the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chanting the first verse of the
canticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa:

  I.
        Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade in hande bring I,
  With garlandes gay and rosemary:
  I pray you all singe merrily,
        Qui estis in convivio.Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade I understande
  Is the chief servyce in this lande
  Loke whereever it be fande,
        Servite cum cantico.Then they stopped; and the Lord
of Misrule ascended his throne, and his courtiers formed round him
in circle.Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their
glittering arms, and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the
Boar's head covered with garlands.It was a good picture, and the Lord
of Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy.He was addressing
his court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense, when a servant
approached Coningsby, and told him that he was wanted without.A despatch had arrived for him from
London.Without any prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke
the seal with a trembling hand.His presence was immediately desired in
town: Lord Monmouth was dead.This was a crisis in the life of Coningsby; yet, like many critical
epochs, the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware
of its character.The first feeling which he experienced at the
intelligence was sincere affliction.He was fond of his grandfather; had
received great kindness from him, and at a period of life when it was
most welcome.The neglect and hardships of his early years, instead of
leaving a prejudice against one who, by some, might be esteemed their
author, had by their contrast only rendered Coningsby more keenly
sensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his
happy youth.The next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable
speculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes.Lord
Monmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for
him as became a near relative to whom he was attached, and in a manner
which ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman.The
allowance which Lord Monmouth had made him, as considerable as usually
accorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers, might justify him in
estimating his future patrimony as extremely ample.He was aware,
indeed, that at a subsequent period his grandfather had projected for
him fortunes of a still more elevated character.He looked to Coningsby
as the future representative of an ancient barony, and had been
purchasing territory with the view of supporting the title.But
Coningsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being
realised.He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his
grandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford, he had at the
moment arrested arrangements which, from the tone of Lord Monmouth's
communication, he believed were then in progress for that purpose;
and he thought it improbable, with his knowledge of his grandfather's
habits, that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to
resume before his decease the completion of these plans.Indeed there
was a period when, in adopting the course which he pursued with respect
to Darlford, Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the
large fortune which was to accompany the barony.Had not a separation
between Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with
Coningsby's difference with his grandfather, he was conscious that the
consequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects; but
the absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture, its permanent
removal, indeed, from the scene, coupled with his fortunate though not
formal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth, had long ago banished from his
memory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the
time to shut his eyes.Before he left town for Scotland he had made a
farewell visit to his grandfather, who, though not as cordial as in
old days, had been gracious; and Coningsby, during his excursion to the
moors, and his various visits to the country, had continued at intervals
to write to his grandfather, as had been for some years his custom.On
the whole, with an indefinite feeling which, in spite of many a rational
effort, did nevertheless haunt his mind, that this great and sudden
event might exercise a vast and beneficial influence on his worldly
position, Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the
affliction which he sincerely experienced, in the hope that he might at
all events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms, her virtues,
and her love.Although he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet
reconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham, Coningsby was never
long without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life; and the
correspondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney, while they
were at the moors, had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir's suit had
terminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had
quitted London.It was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town: he called at
once on Lord Eskdale, who was one of Lord Monmouth's executors; and he
persuaded Coningsby, whom he saw depressed, to dine with him alone.'You should not be seen at a club,' said the good-natured peer; 'and I
remember myself in old days what was the wealth of an Albanian larder.'Lord Eskdale, at dinner, talked frankly of the disposition of Lord
Monmouth's property.He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was
his grandfather's principal heir.'I don't know whether you will be happier with a large fortune?''It is a troublesome thing: nobody is satisfied with
what you do with it; very often not yourself.To maintain an equable
expenditure; not to spend too much on one thing, too little on another,
is an art.There must be a harmony, a keeping, in disbursement, which
very few men have.The thing to have is about ten
thousand a year, and the world to think you have only five.There is
some enjoyment then; one is let alone.But the instant you have a large
fortune, duties commence.And then impudent fellows borrow your money;
and if you ask them for it again, they go about town saying you are a
screw.'Lord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa, which latterly
he never quitted, at a little supper, with no persons near him but those
who were amusing.He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his
lips, and being extremely polite, waited a few minutes before he asked
Clotilde, who was singing a sparkling drinking-song, to do him that
service.When, in accordance with his request, she reached him, it was
too late.The ladies shrieked, being frightened: at first they were
in despair, but, after reflection, they evinced some intention of
plundering the house.Villebecque, who was absent at the moment, arrived
in time; and everybody became orderly and broken-hearted.The body had been removed to Monmouth House, where it had been embalmed
and laid in state.There was
nobody in town; some distinguished connections, however, came up from
the country, though it was a period inconvenient for such movements.After the funeral, the will was to be read in the principal saloon of
Monmouth House, one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the
boyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof, and
now hung in black, adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer.The testamentary dispositions of the late lord were still unknown,
though the names of his executors had been announced by his family
solicitor, in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained.The executors under the will were Lord Eskdale, Mr.By a subsequent appointment Sidonia had been added.Coningsby, who had been chief mourner,
stood on the right hand of the solicitor, who sat at the end of a long
table, round which, in groups, were ranged all who had attended the
funeral, including several of the superior members of the household,
among them M. Villebecque.The solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in
the habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original
will, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was
therefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument.So saying,
he sat down, and breaking the seals of a large packet, he produced the
will of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained
in his custody since its execution.By this will, of the date of 1829, the sum of 10,000_l._ was left to
Coningsby, then unknown to his grandfather; the same sum to Mr.There was a great number of legacies, none of superior amount, most of
them of less: these were chiefly left to old male companions, and women
in various countries.There was an almost inconceivable number of small
annuities to faithful servants, decayed actors, and obscure foreigners.The residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen, three of
whom had quitted this world before the legator; the bequests, therefore,
had lapsed.The fourth residuary legatee, in whom, according to the
terms of the will, all would have consequently centred, was Mr.There followed several codicils which did not materially affect the
previous disposition; one of them leaving a legacy of 20,000_l._ to
the Princess Colonna; until they arrived at the latter part of the year
1832, when a codicil increased the 10,000_l._ left under the will to
Coningsby to 50,000_l._.After Coningsby's visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change
occurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth's estate.The legacy of
50,000_l._ in his favour was revoked, and the same sum left to the
Princess Lucretia.A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr.Rigby; and
Coningsby was left sole residuary legatee.An estate of about
nine thousand a year, which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased, and was
therefore in his own disposition, was left to Coningsby.Rigby was reduced to 20,000_l._, and the whole of his residue left
to his issue by Lady Monmouth.In case he died without issue, the estate
bequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account, and the residue then
to be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson.It was
under this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor and
to whom Lord Monmouth left, among others, the celebrated picture of
the Holy Family by Murillo, as his friend had often admired it.To Lord
Eskdale he left all his female miniatures, and to Mr.Ormsby his rare
and splendid collection of French novels, and all his wines, except his
Tokay, which he left, with his library, to Sir Robert Peel; though this
legacy was afterwards revoked, in consequence of Sir Robert's conduct
about the Irish corporations.The solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water.While this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the
room, but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity
of the lawyer.Coningsby was silent, his brow a little knit.Rigby
was pale and restless, but said nothing.Ormsby took a pinch of
snuff, and offered his box to Lord Eskdale, who was next to him.They
exchanged glances, and made some observation about the weather.Sidonia
stood apart, with his arms folded.He had not, of course attended the
funeral, nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby.'Now, gentlemen,' said the solicitor, 'if you please, I will proceed.'They came to the year 1839, the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley.This
appeared to be a critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth; while
Coningsby's reached to the culminating point.Rigby was reduced to
his original legacy under the will of 10,000_l._; a sum of equal amount
was bequeathed to Armand Villebecque, in acknowledgment of faithful
services; all the dispositions in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked,
and she was limited to her moderate jointure of 3,000_l._ per annum,
under the marriage settlement; while everything, without reserve, was
left absolutely to Coningsby.A subsequent codicil determined that the 10,000_l._ left to Mr.Rigby
should be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay; but as some
compensation Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby
the bust of that gentleman, which he had himself presented to his
Lordship, and which, at his desire, had been placed in the vestibule
at Coningsby Castle, from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth's
decease Mr.Rigby might wish, perhaps, to present it to some other
friend.Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr.As for Coningsby, he saw nobody.He maintained, during the extraordinary
situation in which he was placed, a firm demeanour; but serene and
regulated as he appeared to the spectators, his nerves were really
strung to a high pitch.It bore the date of June 1840, and was
made at Brighton, immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth.It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great
emergency.He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all
right.He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed
of, it must principally refer to the disinheritance of Coningsby,
secured by Rigby's well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what
had occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer.And then to whom
could Lord Monmouth leave his money?However he might cut and carve up
his fortunes, Rigby, and especially at a moment when he had so served
him, must come in for a considerable slice.All the dispositions in favour of'my
grandson Harry Coningsby' were revoked; and he inherited from his
grandfather only the interest of the sum of 10,000_l._ which had been
originally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood.The executors had
the power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper
for his advancement in life, provided always it was not placed in 'the
capital stock of any manufactory.'Coningsby turned pale; he lost his abstracted look; he caught the eye
of Rigby; he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious
countenance.What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was
thought and sensation enough for a year; but it was as the flash that
reveals a whole country, yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens.There was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle
these conventional calamities, a natural and sacred confidence in his
youth and health, and knowledge and convictions.Even the recollection
of Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations.At
least the mightiest foe to their union was departed.All this was the impression of an instant, simultaneous with the reading
of the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the
Marquess of Monmouth left the sum of 30,000_l._ to Armand Villebecque;
and all the rest, residue, and remainder of his unentailed property,
wheresoever and whatsoever it might be, amounting in value to nearly a
million sterling, was given, devised, and bequeathed to Flora, commonly
called Flora Villebecque, the step-child of the said Armand Villebecque,
'but who is my natural daughter by Marie Estelle Matteau, an actress at
the Theatre Francais in the years 1811-15, by the name of Stella.'said Coningsby, with a grave rather than agitated
countenance, to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him, without,
however, any expression of condolence.'This time next year you will not think so,' said Sidonia.'The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage,' said Sidonia,
'is the condolence of the gentle world.For the present we
will not speak of it.'So saying, Sidonia good-naturedly got Coningsby
out of the room.They walked together to Sidonia's house in Carlton Gardens, neither of
them making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring
where he had been, what he had been doing, since they last met, and
himself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little more feeling
in his manner than was his custom.When they had arrived there, Sidonia
ordered their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the
command and its appearance, he called Coningsby's attention to an old
German painting he had just received, its brilliant colouring and quaint
costumes.'Eat, and an appetite will come,' said Sidonia, when he observed
Coningsby somewhat reluctant.'Take some of that Chablis: it will put
you right; you will find it delicious.'In this way some twenty minutes passed; their meal was over, and they
were alone together.'I have been thinking all this time of your position,' said Sidonia.'A sorry one, I fear,' said Coningsby.'I really cannot see that,' said his friend.'You have experienced this
morning a disappointment, but not a calamity.If you had lost your eye
it would have been a calamity: no combination of circumstances could
have given you another.There are really no miseries except natural
miseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions.What seems
conventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently
viewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one's life.''I hope the day may come when I may feel this.''Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is
the moment when you should clearly comprehend the circumstances which
surround you.You think, for
example, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because you
have lost the fortune on which you counted?''I ask you again, which would you have rather lost, your grandfather's
inheritance or your right leg?''Most certainly my inheritance,'

'Or your left arm?''Would you have received the inheritance on condition that your front
teeth should be knocked out?''Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?''Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.''Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great.''Why, you have put it in an ingenious point of view; and yet it is
not so easy to convince a man, that he should be content who has lost
everything.''You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer
to the fortune that you have forfeited.How then can you be said to have
lost everything?''You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable
knowledge, a fine courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible
experience.With each of these qualities one might make a fortune; the
combination ought to command the highest.''You console me,' said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter
smile.I think you are a most
fortunate young man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if
you had been your grandfather's heir; perhaps less so.But I wish you
to comprehend your position: if you understand it you will cease to
lament.''Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object.I make you no
offers of fortune, because I know you would not accept them, and indeed
I have no wish to see you a lounger in life.If you had inherited a
great patrimony, it is possible your natural character and previous
culture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a
question, even with you.Now you are free; that is to say, you are free,
if you are not in debt.A man who has not seen the world, whose fancy is
harassed with glittering images of pleasures he has never experienced,
cannot live on 300_l._ per annum; but you can.You have nothing to haunt
your thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of your studies.You have seen
the most beautiful women; you have banqueted in palaces; you know what
heroes, and wits, and statesmen are made of: and you can draw on
your memory instead of your imagination for all those dazzling and
interesting objects that make the inexperienced restless, and are the
cause of what are called scrapes.But you can do nothing if you be in
debt.Before, therefore, we proceed, I must beg you
to be frank on this head.If you have any absolute or contingent
incumbrances, tell me of them without reserve, and permit me to clear
them at once to any amount.You will sensibly oblige me in so doing:
because I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start
with a clog my psychological observations will be imperfect.''You are, indeed, a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay
them.My grandfather was so lavish in his
allowance to me that I never got into difficulties.Besides, there
are horses and things without end which I must sell, and money at
Drummonds'.''That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt.I
conceive there are two careers which deserve your consideration.In the
first place there is Diplomacy.If you decide upon that, I can assist
you.There exist between me and the Minister such relations that I can
at once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain.After that, much, if not all, depends on yourself.But I could advance
you, provided you were capable.You should, at least, not languish for
want of preferment.In an important post, I could throw in your way
advantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets.I doubt not your success, and for such a career,
speedy.Suppose
yourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a chief court, or at
a critical post, with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate
perspective; and, after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage.A Diplomatist is, after all,
a phantom.There is a want of nationality about his being.I always look
upon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political
creeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which
pervades the career of an eminent citizen in a free and great country.''You read my thoughts,' said Coningsby.'I should be sorry to sever
myself from England.''There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career,' said
Sidonia, 'which in England may give you all, the Bar.I am absolutely
persuaded that with the requisite qualifications, and with perseverance,
success at the Bar is certain.It may be retarded or precipitated by
circumstances, but cannot be ultimately affected.You have a right to
count with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe
for them.You appear to me to have all the qualities necessary for the
Bar; and you may count on that perseverance which is indispensable, for
the reason I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your
experience.''I have resolved,' said Coningsby; 'I will try for the Great Seal.'Alone in his chambers, no longer under the sustaining influence of
Sidonia's converse and counsel, the shades of night descending
and bearing gloom to the gloomy, all the excitement of his spirit
evaporated, the heart of Coningsby sank.All now depended on himself,
and in that self he had no trust.And even success
could only be conducted to him by the course of many years.His career,
even if prosperous, was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which
the heart of man could be called upon to sustain.Upon the stern altar
of his fortunes he must immolate his first and enduring love.Before,
he had a perilous position to offer Edith; now he had none.The future
might then have aided them; there was no combination which could improve
his present.Under any circumstances he must, after all his thoughts and
studies, commence a new novitiate, and before he could enter the arena
must pass years of silent and obscure preparation.He looked up, his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley
which she had given him in the days of their happy hearts.That was all
that was to remain of their loves.He was to bear it to the future
scene of his labours, to remind him through revolving years of toil and
routine, that he too had had his romance, had roamed in fair gardens,
and whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion.That drawing
was to become the altar-piece of his life.Coningsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep, waking often with a
consciousness of having experienced some great misfortune, yet with an
indefinite conception of its nature.It was a gloomy day, a raw north-easter blowing up the cloisters of
the Albany, in which the fog was lingering, the newspaper on his
breakfast-table, full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather's
will, which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him.To the bright, bracing morn of that merry
Christmas!That radiant and cheerful scene, and those gracious and
beaming personages, seemed another world and order of beings to the
one he now inhabited, and the people with whom he must now commune.It was the wild excitement of despair, the frenzied
hope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin, that could alone have
inspired such a hallucination!His
energies could rally no more.He gave orders that he was at home to no
one; and in his morning gown and slippers, with his feet resting on the
fireplace, the once high-souled and noble-hearted Coningsby delivered
himself up to despair.The day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie.He was like a particle of chaos; at the best,
a glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades.Towards evening the wind
changed, the fog dispersed, there came a clear starry night, brisk and
bright.Coningsby roused himself, dressed, and wrapping his cloak around
him, sallied forth.Once more in the mighty streets, surrounded by
millions, his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper
position.Well had Sidonia taught him, view everything in its relation
to the rest.Here was the mightiest of
modern cities; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient.Whether he inherited or forfeited fortunes, what was it to the passing
throng?They would not share his splendour, or his luxury, or his
comfort.But a word from his lip, a thought from his brain, expressed
at the right time, at the right place, might turn their hearts, might
influence their passions, might change their opinions, might affect
their destiny.As civilisation
advances, the accidents of life become each day less important.The power of man, his greatness and his glory, depend on essential
qualities.Brains every day become more precious than blood.You must
give men new ideas, you must teach them new words, you must modify
their manners, you must change their laws, you must root out prejudices,
subvert convictions, if you wish to be great.Greatness no longer
depends on rentals, the world is too rich; nor on pedigrees, the world
is too knowing.'The greatness of this city destroys my misery,' said Coningsby, 'and my
genius shall conquer its greatness.'This conviction of power in the midst of despair was a revelation of
intrinsic strength.It is indeed the test of a creative spirit.From
that moment all petty fears for an ordinary future quitted him.He felt
that he must be prepared for great sacrifices, for infinite suffering;
that there must devolve on him a bitter inheritance of obscurity,
struggle, envy, and hatred, vulgar prejudice, base criticism, petty
hostilities, but the dawn would break, and the hour arrive, when the
welcome morning hymn of his success and his fame would sound and be
re-echoed.He returned to his rooms; calm, resolute.He slept the deep sleep of
a man void of anxiety, that has neither hope nor fear to haunt his
visions, but is prepared to rise on the morrow collected for the great
human struggle.Fresh, vigorous, not rash or precipitate, yet
determined to lose no time in idle meditation, Coningsby already
resolved at once to quit his present residence, was projecting a visit
to some legal quarter, where he intended in future to reside, when his
servant brought him a note.Coningsby, with
great earnestness, to do her the honour and the kindness of calling on
her at his earliest convenience, at the hotel in Brook Street where she
now resided.It was an interview which Coningsby would rather have avoided; yet it
seemed to him, after a moment's reflection, neither just, nor kind, nor
manly, to refuse her request.She was, after
all, his kin.Was it for a moment to be supposed that he was envious of
her lot?He replied, therefore, that in an hour he would wait upon her.In an hour, then, two individuals are to be brought together whose first
meeting was held under circumstances most strangely different.Then
Coningsby was the patron, a generous and spontaneous one, of a being
obscure, almost friendless, and sinking under bitter mortification.His favour could not be the less appreciated because he was the
chosen relative of a powerful noble.That noble was no more; his vast
inheritance had devolved on the disregarded, even despised actress,
whose suffering emotions Coningsby had then soothed, and whose fortune
had risen on the destruction of all his prospects, and the balk of all
his aspirations.Flora was alone when Coningsby was ushered into the room.The extreme
delicacy of her appearance was increased by her deep mourning; and
seated in a cushioned chair, from which she seemed to rise with an
effort, she certainly presented little of the character of a fortunate
and prosperous heiress.'You are very good to come to me,' she said, faintly smiling.Coningsby extended his hand to her affectionately, in which she placed
her own, looking down much embarrassed.'You have an agreeable situation here,' said Coningsby, trying to break
the first awkwardness of their meeting.'Yes; but I hope not to stop here long?''No; I hope never to leave England!'There was a slight pause; and then Flora sighed and said,

'I wish to speak to you on a subject that gives me pain; yet of which I
must speak.'I am sure,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great kindness, 'that you
could injure no one.''It was not mine by any right, legal or moral.There were others who
might have urged an equal claim to it; and there are many who will now
think that you might have preferred a superior one.''You had enemies; I was not one.They sought to benefit themselves by
injuring you.They have not benefited themselves; let them not say that
they have at least injured you.''We will not care what they say,' said Coningsby; 'I can sustain my
lot.'She sighed again with a downcast
glance.Then looking up embarrassed and blushing deeply, she added, 'I
wish to restore to you that fortune of which I have unconsciously and
unwillingly deprived you.''The fortune is yours, dear Flora, by every right,' said Coningsby,
much moved; 'and there is no one who wishes more fervently that it may
contribute to your happiness than I do.''It is killing me,' said Flora, mournfully; then speaking with unusual
animation, with a degree of excitement, she continued, 'I must tell what
I feel.I am happy in the inheritance, if you
generously receive it from me, because Providence has made me the means
of baffling your enemies.I never thought to be so happy as I shall be
if you will generously accept this fortune, always intended for you.I
have lived then for a purpose; I have not lived in vain; I have returned
to you some service, however humble, for all your goodness to me in my
unhappiness.''You are, as I have ever thought you, the kindest and most
tender-hearted of beings.But you misconceive our mutual positions,
my gentle Flora.The custom of the world does not permit such acts to
either of us as you contemplate.It is left you by
one on whose affections you had the highest claim.I will not say
that so large an inheritance does not bring with it an alarming
responsibility; but you are not unequal to it.You have a good heart; you have good sense; you have a
well-principled being.Your spirit will mount with your fortunes, and
blend with them.'I shall soon learn to find content, if not happiness, from other
sources,' said Coningsby; 'and mere riches, however vast, could at no
time have secured my felicity.''But they may secure that which brings felicity,' said Flora, speaking
in a choking voice, and not meeting the glance of Coningsby.'You had
some views in life which displeased him who has done all this; they may
be, they must be, affected by this fatal caprice.Speak to me, for I
cannot speak, dear Mr.Coningsby; do not let me believe that I, who
would sacrifice my life for your happiness, am the cause of such
calamities!''Whatever be my lot, I repeat I can sustain it,' said Coningsby, with a
cheek of scarlet.he is angry with me,' exclaimed Flora; 'he is angry with me!'and
the tears stole down her pale cheek.dear Flora; I have no other feelings to you than those of
affection and respect,' and Coningsby, much agitated, drew his chair
nearer to her, and took her hand.'I am gratified by these kind wishes,
though they are utterly impracticable; but they are the witnesses of
your sweet disposition and your noble spirit.There never shall exist
between us, under any circumstances, other feelings than those of kin
and kindness.'When she saw that, she started, and seemed to
summon all her energies.'You are going,' she exclaimed, 'and I have said nothing, I have said
nothing; and I shall never see you again.This fortune is yours; it must be yours.Do
not think I am speaking from a momentary impulse.I have
lived so much alone, I have had so little to deceive or to delude me,
that I know myself.If you will not let me do justice you declare my
doom.I cannot live if my existence is the cause of all your prospects
being blasted, and the sweetest dreams of your life being defeated.When
I die, these riches will be yours; that you cannot prevent.Refuse my
present offer, and you seal the fate of that unhappy Flora whose fragile
life has hung for years on the memory of your kindness.''You must not say these words, dear Flora; you must not indulge in these
gloomy feelings.You must live, and you must live happily.You have
every charm and virtue which should secure happiness.The duties and
the affections of existence will fall to your lot.It is one that will
always interest me, for I shall ever be your friend.You have conferred
on me one of the most delightful of feelings, gratitude, and for that I
bless you.CHAPTER V.


About a week after this interview with Flora, as Coningsby one morning
was about to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the
Temple, to which his notice had been attracted, there was a loud ring, a
bustle in the hall, and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst were ushered in.There never was such a cordial meeting; and yet the faces of his
friends were serious.The truth is, the paragraphs in the newspapers had
circulated in the country, they had written to Coningsby, and after a
brief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions.Immediately they
came up to town.Henry Sydney, a younger son, could offer little but
sympathy, but he declared it was his intention also to study for the
bar, so that they should not be divided.Buckhurst, after many embraces
and some ordinary talk, took Coningsby aside, and said, 'My dear fellow,
I have no objection to Henry Sydney hearing everything I say, but still
these are subjects which men like to be discussed in private.Of course
I expect you to share my fortune.There was something in Buckhurst's fervent resolution very lovable and a
little humorous, just enough to put one in good temper with human nature
and life.If there were any fellow's fortune in the world that Coningsby
would share, Buckhurst's would have had the preference; but while he
pressed his hand, and with a glance in which a tear and a smile seemed
to contend for mastery, he gently indicated why such arrangements were,
with our present manners, impossible.'I see,' said Buckhurst, after a moment's thought, 'I quite agree with
you.The thing cannot be done; and, to tell you the truth, a fortune
is a bore.What I vote that we three do at once is, to take plenty of
ready-money, and enter the Austrian service.'There is something in that,' said Coningsby.'In the meantime, suppose
you two fellows walk with me to the Temple, for I have an appointment to
look at some chambers.'It was a fine day, and it was by no means a gloomy walk.Though the
two friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth, and
miserable about their companion, once more in his society, and finding
little difference in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their
habitual tone.As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple, which
he visited for the first time.The tombs in the
church convinced him that the Crusades were the only career.He would
have himself become a law student if he might have prosecuted his
studies in chain armour.The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the
misfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion
of his life amid these halls and courts, gardens and terraces, that
maintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century, so much
of the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners.Henry Sydney was sanguine; he was reconciled to the disinheritance of
Coningsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to
make him a Lord Chancellor.These faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was
established in Paper Buildings, and had become a pupil of a celebrated
special pleader.They would have remained longer had not he himself
suggested that it was better that they should part.It seemed a terrible
catastrophe after all the visions of their boyish days, their college
dreams, and their dazzling adventures in the world.'And this is the end of Coningsby, the brilliant Coningsby, that we all
loved, that was to be our leader!'said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as
they quitted him.'Well, come what may, life has lost something of its
bloom.''The great thing now,' said Lord Henry, 'is to keep up the chain of
our friendship.We must write to him very often, and contrive to be
frequently together.It is dreadful to think that in the ways of life
our hearts may become estranged.I never felt more wretched than I do at
this moment, and yet I have faith that we shall not lose him.'said Buckhurst; 'but I feel my plan about the Austrian service
was, after all, the only thing.He might
have been prime minister; several strangers have been; and as for war,
look at Brown and Laudohn, and half a hundred others.I had a much
better chance of being a field-marshal than he has of being a Lord
Chancellor.''I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will be Lord Chancellor,' said
Henry Sydney, gravely.This change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution.Within a month after the death of his grandfather
his name had been erased from all his fashionable clubs, and his horses
and carriages sold, and he had become a student of the Temple.He
entirely devoted himself to his new pursuit.His being was completely
absorbed in it.There was nothing to haunt his mind; no unexperienced
scene or sensation of life to distract his intelligence.One sacred
thought alone indeed there remained, shrined in the innermost sanctuary
of his heart and consciousness.But it was a tradition, no longer a
hope.The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of
his grandfather's will; had clearly ascertained the consequences to
himself, and had resolved on the course to pursue; he had communicated
unreservedly with Oswald Millbank, and had renounced those pretensions
to the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer.Millbank met Henry Sydney and
Buckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby.Once more they were all
four together; but under what different circumstances, and with what
different prospects from those which attended their separation at Eton!Alone with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could
not convey.He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith; but
they would not conceal from themselves that, at this moment, and in the
present state of affairs, all was hopeless.In no way did Coningsby ever
permit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his disinheritance.He
was, of course, silent on it to his other friends; as any communication
of the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his
inmost soul.The state of political parties in England in the spring of 1841 offered
a most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated
in the first chapter of this work.The banners of the Conservative camp
at this moment lowered on the Whig forces, as the gathering host of the
Norman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex.The Whigs were not
yet conquered, but they were doomed; and they themselves knew it.The
mistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining
office in 1839; and, whether we consider their conduct in a national
and constitutional light, or as a mere question of political tactics and
party prudence, it was unquestionably a great mistake; had infused into
the corps of Whig authority a kind of galvanic action, which only the
superficial could mistake for vitality.Even to form a basis for their
future operations, after the conjuncture of '39, the Whigs were obliged
to make a fresh inroad on the revenue, the daily increasing debility
of which was now arresting attention and exciting public alarm.It was
clear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial.Under all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Whig
Cabinet, in their final propositions, cannot be described as deficient
either in boldness or prudence.The policy which they recommended was
in itself a sagacious and spirited policy; but they erred in supposing
that, at the period it was brought forward, any measure promoted by the
Whigs could have obtained general favour in the country.The Whigs were
known to be feeble; they were looked upon as tricksters.The country
knew they were opposed by a powerful party; and though there certainly
never was any authority for the belief, the country did believe that
that powerful party were influenced by great principles; had in their
view a definite and national policy; and would secure to England,
instead of a feeble administration and fluctuating opinions, energy and
a creed.The future effect of the Whig propositions of '41 will not be
detrimental to that party, even if in the interval they be appropriated
piecemeal, as will probably be the case, by their Conservative
successors.But for the moment, and in the plight in which the Whig
party found themselves, it was impossible to have devised measures more
conducive to their precipitate fall.Great interests were menaced by a
weak government.Tadpole and Taper
saw it in a moment.They snuffed the factious air, and felt the coming
storm.Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies,
there was a little latent jealousy between them.Tadpole worshipped
Registration: Taper, adored a Cry.Tadpole always maintained that it
was the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day;
Taper, on the contrary, faithful to ancient traditions, was ever of
opinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamour.It
always seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be
popular; the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders
not being sufficiently apparent to be esteemed an adequate set-off
against the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions; that the
Tadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places; and Taper had
had his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively
against the New Poor-law, and for hiring several link-boys to bawl
a much-wronged lady's name in the Park when the Court prorogued
Parliament.And now, after all, in 1841, it seemed that Taper was right.There was
a great clamour in every quarter, and the clamour was against the Whigs
and in favour of Conservative principles.What Canadian timber-merchants
meant by Conservative principles, it is not difficult to conjecture;
or West Indian planters.It was tolerably clear on the hustings
what squires and farmers, and their followers, meant by Conservative
principles.What they mean by Conservative principles now is another
question: and whether Conservative principles mean something higher than
a perpetuation of fiscal arrangements, some of them impolitic, none of
them important.But no matter what different bodies of men understood by
the cry in which they all joined, the Cry existed.Taper beat Tadpole;
and the great Conservative party beat the shattered and exhausted Whigs.Notwithstanding the abstraction of his legal studies, Coningsby could
not be altogether insensible to the political crisis.In the political
world of course he never mixed, but the friends of his boyhood were
deeply interested in affairs, and they lost no opportunity which
he would permit them, of cultivating his society.Their occasional
fellowship, a visit now and then to Sidonia, and a call sometimes
on Flora, who lived at Richmond, comprised his social relations.His
general acquaintance did not desert him, but he was out of sight, and
did not wish to be remembered.Ormsby asked him to dinner, and
occasionally mourned over his fate in the bow window of White's; while
Lord Eskdale even went to see him in the Temple, was interested in his
progress, and said, with an encouraging look, that, when he was called
to the bar, all his friends must join and get up the steam.Rigby, who was walking with the Duke of Agincourt,
which was probably the reason he could not notice a lawyer.Lord Eskdale had obtained from Villebecque accurate details as to the
cause of Coningsby being disinherited.Our hero, if one in such fallen
fortunes may still be described as a hero, had mentioned to Lord Eskdale
his sorrow that his grandfather had died in anger with him; but Lord
Eskdale, without dwelling on the subject, had assured him that he had
reason to believe that if Lord Monmouth had lived, affairs would have
been different.He had altered the disposition of his property at a
moment of great and general irritation and excitement; and had been too
indolent, perhaps really too indisposed, which he was unwilling ever to
acknowledge, to recur to a calmer and more equitable settlement.Lord
Eskdale had been more frank with Sidonia, and had told him all about
the refusal to become a candidate for Darlford against Mr.Millbank; the
communication of Rigby to Lord Monmouth, as to the presence of Oswald
Millbank at the castle, and the love of Coningsby for his sister; all
these details, furnished by Villebecque to Lord Eskdale, had been truly
transferred by that nobleman to his co-executor; and Sidonia, when he
had sufficiently digested them, had made Lady Wallinger acquainted with
the whole history.The dissolution of the Whig Parliament by the Whigs, the project of
which had reached Lord Monmouth a year before, and yet in which nobody
believed to the last moment, at length took place.All the world was
dispersed in the heart of the season, and our solitary student of the
Temple, in his lonely chambers, notwithstanding all his efforts, found
his eye rather wander over the pages of Tidd and Chitty as he remembered
that the great event to which he had so looked forward was now
occurring, and he, after all, was no actor in the mighty drama.It was
to have been the epoch of his life; when he was to have found himself
in that proud position for which all the studies, and meditations, and
higher impulses of his nature had been preparing him.It was a keen
trial of a man.Every one of his friends and old companions were
candidates, and with sanguine prospects.Lord Henry was certain for a
division of his county; Buckhurst harangued a large agricultural
borough in his vicinity; Eustace Lyle and Vere stood in coalition for
a Yorkshire town; and Oswald Millbank solicited the suffrages of an
important manufacturing constituency.They sent their addresses to
Coningsby.He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence
of his own mind; often recognised the very expressions to which he
had habituated them.Amid the confusion of a general election, no
unimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to
an isolated constituency; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements
of political parties might have detected in these public declarations
some intimation of new views, and of a tone of political feeling that
has unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this
country.It was the end of a sultry July day, the last ray of the sun shooting
down Pall Mall sweltering with dust; there was a crowd round the doors
of the Carlton and the Reform Clubs, and every now and then an express
arrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph.He was going to dine at the Oxford
and Cambridge Club, the only club on whose list he had retained his
name, that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or
Cambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former
fashionable acquaintances.The latter did not notice him, but Mr.Tadpole, more good-natured, bestowed on him a rough nod, not unmarked by
a slight expression of coarse pity.Coningsby ordered his dinner, and then took up the evening papers, where
he learnt the return of Vere and Lyle; and read a speech of Buckhurst
denouncing the Venetian Constitution, to the amazement of several
thousand persons, apparently not a little terrified by this unknown
danger, now first introduced to their notice.Being true Englishmen,
they were all against Buckhurst's opponent, who was of the Venetian
party, and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities.Coningsby had dined, and was reading in the library, when a waiter
brought up a third edition of the _Sun_, with electioneering bulletins
from the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour.Some large
letters which expressed the name of Darlford caught his eye.There
seemed great excitement in that borough; strange proceedings had
happened.The column was headed, 'Extraordinary Affair!His eye glanced over an animated speech of Mr.Millbank, his
countenance changed, his heart palpitated.Millbank had resigned
the representation of the town, but not from weakness; his avocations
demanded his presence; he had been requested to let his son supply his
place, but his son was otherwise provided for; he should always take a
deep interest in the town and trade of Darlford; he hoped that the
link between the borough and Hellingsley would be ever cherished; loud
cheering; he wished in parting from them to take a step which should
conciliate all parties, put an end to local heats and factious
contentions, and secure the town an able and worthy representative.For
these reasons he begged to propose to them a gentleman who bore a
name which many of them greatly honoured; for himself, he knew the
individual, and it was his firm opinion that whether they considered his
talents, his character, or the ancient connection of his family with
the district, he could not propose a candidate more worthy of their
confidence than HARRY CONINGSBY, ESQ.This proposition was received with that wild enthusiasm which
occasionally bursts out in the most civilised communities.The contest
between Millbank and Rigby was equally balanced, neither party was
over-confident.The Conservatives were not particularly zealous in
behalf of their champion; there was no Marquess of Monmouth and no
Coningsby Castle now to back him; he was fighting on his own resources,
and he was a beaten horse.The Liberals did not like the prospect of a
defeat, and dreaded the mortification of Rigby's triumph.The Moderate
men, who thought more of local than political circumstances, liked the
name of Coningsby.Millbank had dexterously prepared his leading
supporters for the substitution.Some traits of the character and
conduct of Coningsby had been cleverly circulated.Thus there was a
combination of many favourable causes in his favour.In half an hour's
time his image was stamped on the brain of every inhabitant of the
borough as an interesting and accomplished youth, who had been wronged,
and who deserved to be rewarded.It was whispered that Rigby was his
enemy.Rigby into the river, or to burn down his hotel, in case he was
prudent enough not to show.Rigby determined to fight to the last.All his hopes were now staked on the successful result of this contest.It were impossible if he were returned that his friends could refuse him
high office.The whole of Lord Monmouth's reduced legacy was devoted
to this end.The third edition of the _Sun_ left Mr.Rigby in vain
attempting to address an infuriated populace.Here was a revolution in the fortunes of our forlorn Coningsby!When his
grandfather first sent for him to Monmouth House, his destiny was
not verging on greater vicissitudes.He rose from his seat, and was
surprised that all the silent gentlemen who were about him did not mark
his agitation.It was now an hour
to midnight, and to-morrow the almost unconscious candidate was to go to
the poll.In a tumult of suppressed emotion, Coningsby returned to his
chambers.He found a letter in his box from Oswald Millbank, who had
been twice at the Temple.Oswald had been returned without a contest,
and had reached Darlford in time to hear Coningsby nominated.He set off
instantly to London, and left at his friend's chambers a rapid narrative
of what had happened, with information that he should call on him
again on the morrow at nine o'clock, when they were to repair together
immediately to Darlford in time for Coningsby to be chaired, for no one
entertained a doubt of his triumph.Coningsby did not sleep a wink that night, and yet when he rose early
felt fresh enough for any exploit, however difficult or hazardous.He
felt as an Egyptian does when the Nile rises after its elevation had
been despaired of.At the very lowest ebb of his fortunes, an event
had occurred which seemed to restore all.He dared not contemplate the
ultimate result of all these wonderful changes.Enough for him, that
when all seemed dark, he was about to be returned to Parliament by
the father of Edith, and his vanquished rival who was to bite the dust
before him was the author of all his misfortunes.Love, Vengeance,
Justice, the glorious pride of having acted rightly, the triumphant
sense of complete and absolute success, here were chaotic materials from
which order was at length evolved; and all subsided in an overwhelming
feeling of gratitude to that Providence that had so signally protected
him.It seemed
that Oswald was as excited as Coningsby.His eye sparkled, his manner
was energetic.'We must talk it all over during our journey.We have not a minute to
spare.'During that journey Coningsby learned something of the course of affairs
which gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his
favour.We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of
the circumstances which had occasioned and attended the disinheritance
of Coningsby.These he had told to Lady Wallinger, first by letter,
afterwards in more detail on her arrival in London.Lady Wallinger had
conferred with her husband.She was not surprised at the goodness of
Coningsby, and she sympathised with all his calamities.He had ever been
the favourite of her judgment, and her romance had always consisted in
blending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith.Sir Joseph was a
judicious man, who never cared to commit himself; a little selfish, but
good, just, and honourable, with some impulses, only a little afraid
of them; but then his wife stepped in like an angel, and gave them the
right direction.They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby's
admirable conduct, and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband
should express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison
with herself.Millbank, who stared; but Sir
Joseph spoke feebly.Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence, and
all her impressions, to Oswald and Edith.The younger Millbank talked
with his father, who, making no admissions, listened with interest,
inveighed against Lord Monmouth, and condemned his will.Millbank made inquiries about Coningsby, took an
interest in his career, and, like Lord Eskdale, declared that when he
was called to the bar, his friends would have an opportunity to evince
their sincerity.Affairs remained in this state, until Oswald thought
that circumstances were sufficiently ripe to urge his father on
the subject.The position which Oswald had assumed at Millbank had
necessarily made him acquainted with the affairs and fortune of his
father.When he computed the vast wealth which he knew was at his
parent's command, and recalled Coningsby in his humble chambers, toiling
after all his noble efforts without any results, and his sister pining
in a provincial solitude, Oswald began to curse wealth, and to
ask himself what was the use of all their marvellous industry and
supernatural skill?He addressed his father with that irresistible
frankness which a strong faith can alone inspire.What are the objects
of wealth, if not to bless those who possess our hearts?The only
daughter, the friend to whom the only son was indebted for his life,
here are two beings surely whom one would care to bless, and both are
unhappy.Millbank listened without prejudice, for he was already
convinced.But he felt some interest in the present conduct of
Coningsby.A Coningsby working for his bread was a novel incident for
him.He was resolved to
convince himself of the fact.And perhaps he would have gone on yet
for a little time, and watched the progress of the experiment,
already interested and delighted by what had reached him, had not the
dissolution brought affairs to a crisis.The misery of Oswald at the
position of Coningsby, the silent sadness of Edith, his own conviction,
which assured him that he could do nothing wiser or better than take
this young man to his heart, so ordained it that Mr.Millbank, who
was after all the creature of impulse, decided suddenly, and decided
rightly.Never making a single admission to all the representations of
his son, Mr.Millbank in a moment did all that his son could have dared
to desire.This is a very imperfect and crude intimation of what had occurred
at Millbank and Hellingsley; yet it conveys a faint sketch of the
enchanting intelligence that Oswald conveyed to Coningsby during their
rapid travel.When they arrived at Birmingham, they found a messenger
and a despatch, informing Coningsby, that at mid-day, at Darlford, he
was at the head of the poll by an overwhelming majority, and that Mr.He was, however, requested to remain at Birmingham,
as they did not wish him to enter Darlford, except to be chaired, so
he was to arrive there in the morning.At Birmingham, therefore, they
remained.There was Oswald's election to talk of as well as Coningsby's.They had
hardly had time for this.Men must have been at school together, to enjoy the real fun of meeting
thus, and realising boyish dreams.Often, years ago, they had talked
of these things, and assumed these results; but those were words and
dreams, these were positive facts; after some doubts and struggles, in
the freshness of their youth, Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby
were members of the British Parliament; public characters, responsible
agents, with a career.This afternoon, at Birmingham, was as happy an afternoon as usually
falls to the lot of man.Both of these companions were labouring under
that degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity.Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful
subject.There was rapture in their again meeting under such
circumstances.Then there were their friends; that dear Buckhurst, who
had just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian, and all
their companions of early days.What a sudden and marvellous change in
all their destinies!Life was a pantomime; the wand was waved, and it
seemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power,
springs of the great machine.A train arrived; restless they sallied forth, to seek diversion in the
dispersion of the passengers.Coningsby and Millbank, with that glance,
a little inquisitive, even impertinent, if we must confess it, with
which one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance,
were lounging on the platform.The train arrived; stopped; the doors
were thrown open, and from one of them emerged Mr.Coningsby, who
had dined, was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow,
but he refrained.He was evidently
used up; a man without a resource; the sight of Coningsby his last blow;
he had met his fate.'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'I remember I wanted you to dine with
my grandfather at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you.About eleven o'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford
station.Here they were met by an anxious deputation, who received
Coningsby as if he were a prophet, and ushered him into a car covered
with satin and blue ribbons, and drawn by six beautiful grey horses,
caparisoned in his colours, and riden by postilions, whose very whips
were blue and white.Triumphant music sounded; banners waved; the
multitude were marshalled; the Freemasons, at the first opportunity,
fell into the procession; the Odd Fellows joined it at the nearest
corner.Preceded and followed by thousands, with colours flying,
trumpets sounding, and endless huzzas, flags and handkerchiefs waving
from every window, and every balcony filled with dames and maidens
bedecked with his colours, Coningsby was borne through enthusiastic
Darlford like Paulus Emilius returning from Macedon.Uncovered, still
in deep mourning, his fine figure, and graceful bearing, and his
intelligent brow, at once won every female heart.The singularity was, that all were of the same opinion: everybody
cheered him, every house was adorned with his colours.His triumphal
return was no party question.Magog Wrath and Bully Bluck walked
together like lambs at the head of his procession.The car stopped before the principal hotel in the High Street.The broad street was so crowded, that, as
every one declared, you might have walked on the heads of the people.Every window was full; the very roofs were peopled.The car stopped,
and the populace gave three cheers for Mr.Their late member,
surrounded by his friends, stood in the balcony, which was fitted up
with Coningsby's colours, and bore his name on the hangings in gigantic
letters formed of dahlias.The flashing and inquiring eye of Coningsby
caught the form of Edith, who was leaning on her father's arm.The hustings were opposite the hotel, and here, after a while, Coningsby
was carried, and, stepping from his car, took up his post to address,
for the first time, a public assembly.Anxious as the people were
to hear him, it was long before their enthusiasm could subside into
silence.He spoke; his
powerful and rich tones reached every ear.In five minutes' time every
one looked at his neighbour, and without speaking they agreed that there
never was anything like this heard in Darlford before.He addressed them for a considerable time, for he had a great deal to
say; not only to express his gratitude for the unprecedented manner in
which he had become their representative, and for the spirit in which
they had greeted him, but he had to offer them no niggard exposition
of the views and opinions of the member whom they had so confidingly
chosen, without even a formal declaration of his sentiments.He did this with so much clearness, and in a manner so pointed and
popular, that the deep attention of the multitude never wavered.His
lively illustrations kept them often in continued merriment.But when,
towards his close, he drew some picture of what he hoped might be the
character of his future and lasting connection with the town, the vast
throng was singularly affected.There were a great many present at that
moment who, though they had never seen Coningsby before, would willingly
have then died for him.Coningsby had touched their hearts, for he had
spoken from his own.Darlford
believed in Coningsby: and a very good creed.And now Coningsby was conducted to the opposite hotel.The progress was slow, as every one wished to shake hands
with him.His friends, however, at last safely landed him.He sprang
up the stairs; he was met by Mr.Millbank, who welcomed him with the
greatest warmth, and offered his hearty congratulations.'It is to you, dear sir, that I am indebted for all this,' said
Coningsby.Millbank, 'it is to your own high principles, great
talents, and good heart.'After he had been presented by the late member to the principal
personages in the borough, Mr.Millbank said,

'I think we must now give Mr.Come with me,' he
added, 'here is some one who will be very glad to see you.'Speaking thus, he led our hero a little away, and placing his arm in
Coningsby's with great affection opened the door of an apartment.There
was Edith, radiant with loveliness and beaming with love.Their agitated
hearts told at a glance the tumult of their joy.The father joined their
hands, and blessed them with words of tenderness.The marriage of Coningsby and Edith took place early in the autumn.It was solemnised at Millbank, and they passed their first moon at
Hellingsley, which place was in future to be the residence of the member
for Darlford.The estate was to devolve to Coningsby after the death of
Mr.Millbank, who in the meantime made arrangements which permitted
the newly-married couple to reside at the Hall in a manner becoming its
occupants.Millbank assured Coningsby,
were effected not only with the sanction, but at the express instance,
of his son.An event, however, occurred not very long after the marriage of
Coningsby, which rendered this generous conduct of his father-in-law no
longer necessary to his fortunes, though he never forgot its exercise.The gentle and unhappy daughter of Lord Monmouth quitted a scene with
which her spirit had never greatly sympathised.Perhaps she might have
lingered in life for yet a little while, had it not been for that fatal
inheritance which disturbed her peace and embittered her days, haunting
her heart with the recollection that she had been the unconscious
instrument of injuring the only being whom she loved, and embarrassing
and encumbering her with duties foreign to her experience and her
nature.The marriage of Coningsby had greatly affected her, and from
that day she seemed gradually to decline.She died towards the end
of the autumn, and, subject to an ample annuity to Villebecque, she
bequeathed the whole of her fortune to the husband of Edith.Gratifying
as it was to him to present such an inheritance to his wife, it was not
without a pang that he received the intelligence of the death of Flora.Edith sympathised in his affectionate feelings, and they raised a
monument to her memory in the gardens of Hellingsley.Coningsby passed his next Christmas in his own hall with his beautiful
and gifted wife by his side, and surrounded by the friends of his heart
and his youth.They stand now on the threshold of public life.They are in the leash,
but in a moment they will be slipped.Will they
maintain in august assemblies and high places the great truths which, in
study and in solitude, they have embraced?Or will their courage exhaust
itself in the struggle, their enthusiasm evaporate before hollow-hearted
ridicule, their generous impulses yield with a vulgar catastrophe to the
tawdry temptations of a low ambition?Will their skilled intelligence
subside into being the adroit tool of a corrupt party?Will Vanity
confound their fortunes, or Jealousy wither their sympathies?Or will
they remain brave, single, and true; refuse to bow before shadows and
worship phrases; sensible of the greatness of their position, recognise
the greatness of their duties; denounce to a perplexed and disheartened
world the frigid theories of a generalising age that have destroyed
the individuality of man, and restore the happiness of their country by
believing in their own energies, and daring to be great?Figure to yourselves, gentlemen, this elysium, graced
by some hundreds of our fair countrywomen, an absolute galaxy of
animated beauty, and that music lends its aid, and you will agree with
me that a more fascinating treat could hardly be devised.New flowers,
new fruits, recent varieties of those of long standing and established
character for excellence, are thus introduced, in lieu of those whose
inferiority is no longer doubtful.New culinary vegetables, or, from
superior treatment or mode of culture, rendered more salubrious and of
exquisite flavour, will load the stalls of our market-gardeners.I call
upon you, then, gentlemen, for your zealous support.Say not that you
have no gardens, or that your gardens are inconsiderable, or that you
are no cultivators; you are all interested in having good and delicious
fruits, nutritious and delicate culinary vegetables, and in procuring
them at a reasonable rate, which will be the results of improved and
successful cultivation.At our various exhibitions, let each contribute
that in which he excels, and our object will be attained.Gentlemen, I
fear I have trespassed too long on your patience and indulgence.I will
just urge one more motive for your warm support of our intended society;
it is this: that, by diffusing a love of plants and gardening, you will
materially contribute to the comfort and happiness of the laborious
classes; for the pleasure taken in such pursuits forms an
unexceptionable relaxation from the toils of business, and every hour
thus spent is subtracted from the ale-house and other haunts of idleness
and dissipation."[76] In the grounds of _Hagley_, were once inscribed these lines:--

   Here Pope!--ah, never must that tow'ring mind
   To his loved haunts, or dearer friend return;
   What art, what friendships!what fame resign'd:
   In yonder glade I trace his mournful urn.[77] At Holm-Lacey is preserved a sketch, in crayons, by Pope, (when on
a visit there) of Lord Strafford by Vandyke.It is well known that Pope
painted Betterton in oil colours, and gave it to Lord Mansfield.The
noble lord regretted the loss of this memorial, when his house was
consumed at the time of the disgraceful and ignorant riots.[78] Sir Joshua Reynolds used to tell the following anecdote relative to
Pope.--"When Reynolds was a young man, he was present at an auction of
very scarce pictures, which attracted a great crowd of _connoisseurs_
and others; when, in the moment of a very interesting piece being put
up, Mr.All was in an instant, from a scene of
confusion and bustle, a dead calm.The auctioneer, as if by instinct,
suspended his hammer.The audience, to an individual, as if by the same
impulse, rose up to receive the poet; and did not resume their seats
till he had reached the upper end of the room."A similar honour was paid to the Abbe Raynal, whose reputation was such,
that the Speaker of the House of Commons observing _him_ among the
spectators, suspended the business of the house till he had seen the
eloquent historian placed in a more commodious seat.It is painful to
relate, that this powerful writer, and good man, who narrowly escaped
the guillotine, expired in a garret, in extreme poverty, at the age of
eighty-four; the only property he left being one assignat of fifty
livres, worth not threepence in ready money.Perhaps one might have
applied the following anecdote (told by Dr.Drake in his Literary Hours)
to Abbe Raynal:--"A respectable character, having long figured in the
gay world at Paris, was at length compelled to live in an obscure
retreat in that city, the victim of severe misfortunes.He was so
indigent, that he subsisted only on an allowance from the parish.Every
week bread was sent to him sufficient for his support, and yet at
length, he demanded more.'With whom, sir, is it possible I should live?I am wretched, since I thus solicit charity, and am abandoned by all the
world.''But, sir, if you live alone, why do you ask for more bread than
is sufficient for yourself?'The other at last, with great reluctance,
confessed that he had a dog.The curate desired him to observe, that he
was only the distributor of the bread that belonged to the poor, and
that it was absolutely necessary that he should dispose of his dog.exclaimed the poor man, weeping, 'and if I lose my dog, who is
there then to love me?'The good pastor took his purse, and giving it to
him, 'take this, sir,' said he; 'this is mine--this I _can_ give.'"[79] How applicable are Gray's lines to Lord Byron himself, now!Can storied urn or animated bust
     Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
     Or flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?Perhaps in this _neglected_ spot is laid
     Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire!--



[80] Mr.Bowles, in some stanzas written since the death of Byron, thus
feelingly apostrophizes his noble spirit:--

   But I will bid th' Arcadian cypress wave,
     Pluck the green laurel from Peneus' side,
   And pray thy spirit may such quiet have
     That not one thought unkind be murmur'd o'er thy grave.[81] Perhaps one motive (no doubt there were numberless others) that
_might_ have induced Mr.Mason thus to honour the memory of Pope,

   ----_letting cold tears bedew his silver urn_,

_might_ have been from the recollection of his attachment to what
equally charmed Mr.[82] I know not whether Milton's portrait should have been here noticed.In a note to the eloquent, the talented, and graceful "Discours
d'Installation, prononce par M. le Vicomte H. de Thury, president de la
Societe d'Horticulture de Paris," it is beautifully observed, that
"Personne n'a mieux decrit ce delicieux jardin que Milton.Les Anglais
regardent comme le type de tous les jardins paysagers, et pittoresques,
la description que fait Milton du jardin d'Eden, et qui atteste que se
sublime genie etoit egalement poete, peintre et paysagiste."As I have
sought for the portraits of Mr.Whateley, and
have noticed those of Launcelot Brown, and Mr.Cradock, M.
R. P. Knight and Sir U. Price, who were all _paysagists_; surely our
great and severe republican was one.The Prince de Ligne speaks thus of Milton:--"les vers enchanteurs de ce
Roi des poetes, et des _jardiniers_.I do not know that every one will agree with Switzer in the concluding
part of what he says of Milton, in the History of Gardening, prefixed to
his Iconologia:--"But although things were in this terrible combustion,
we must not omit the famous Mr.John Milton, one of Cromwell's
Secretaries; who, by his excellent and never-to-be-equalled poem of
Paradise Lost, has particularly distinguished gardening, by taking that
for his theme; and shows, that though his eyes deprived him of the
benefit of seeing, yet his mind was wonderfully moved with the
philosophy, innocence, and beauty of this employ; his books, though
mixed with other subjects, being a kind of a philosophical body of
gardening, as well as divinity._had his pen been employed on
no other subject_."It must be needless reminding my reader, that Mr.Walpole's powerful pen
has taken care that our mighty poet, (who "on evil days, though fallen,
and with darkness and solitude compassed round,") shall not be
_defrauded of half his glory_.It is gratifying to remark, that an edition of Paradise Lost is now
announced for publication, in which the zeal of its spirited proprietors
has determined, that every word shall be printed in letters of gold.The
sanction of some of our most distinguished divines, and men of high
rank, evince the pride with which we all acknowledge the devout zeal and
mighty powers of the blind poet.Garrick's fondness for ornamental gardening, induced him finely
to catch at this invention, in his inimitable performance of Lord
Chalkstone.Pulteney relates this anecdote of Mr.Miller: "He was the only
person I ever knew who remembered to have seen Mr.I shall not
easily forget the pleasure that enlightened his countenance, it so
strongly expressed the _Virgilium tantum vidi_, when, in speaking of
that revered man, he related to me that incident of his youth."Ray only meditated a work to have been entitled _Horti_ Angliae.Had he written it, I should have felt a singular pride in introducing
his valued name in the present imperfect volume.[85] The generous minded reader will be gratified by referring to the
kind tribute, paid to the memory of Shenstone, by Mr.Johnson, in his History
of Gardening, thus speaks:--"Taken as a whole, it is the most complete
book of gardening ever published;"--and that, with the exception of
chymistry, "every art and science, at all illustrative of gardening, are
made to contribute their assistance."[86] In his "Unconnected Thoughts" he admires the _Oak_, for "its
majestic appearance, the rough grandeur of its bark, and the wide
protection of its branches: a large, branching, aged oak, is, perhaps,
the most venerable of all inanimate objects."[87] Tea was the favourite beverage of Dr.When Hanway
pronounced his anathema against it, Johnson rose in defence of it,
declaring himself "in that article a hardened sinner, having for years
diluted my meals with the infusion of that fascinating plant; my
tea-kettle has had no time to cool; with tea I have solaced the midnight
hour, and with tea welcomed the morning."Pennant was a great lover
of tea; a hardy honest Welch parson, on hearing that he usually retired
in the afternoon to his summer-house to enjoy that beverage, was moved
with indignation, that any thing weaker than ale or wine should be drunk
there; and calling to mind the good hunting times of old, passionately
exclaimed, "his father would have scorned it."[88] Sir Uvedale thus expresses his own sensations when viewing some of
these plantations:--"The inside fully answers to the dreary appearance
of the outside; of all dismal scenes it seems to me the most likely for
a man to hang himself in; he would, however, find some difficulty in the
execution, for amidst the endless multitude of stems, there is rarely a
single side branch to which a rope could be fastened.The whole wood is
a collection of tall naked poles.... Even its gloom is without
solemnity; it is only dull and dismal; and what light there is, like
that of hell,

   _Serves only to discover scenes of woe,
   Regions of sorrow, doleful shades._"



[89] This observation confirms what Sir U. Price so pointedly enforces
throughout the whole of his causticly sportive letter to Mr.Repton:
"that the best landscape painters would be the best landscape gardeners,
were they to turn their minds to the practical part; consequently, a
study of their works, the most useful study to an improver."--And that
"Van Huysum would be a much better judge of the merits and defects of
the most dressed scene--of a mere flower garden,--than a gardener."Browne was not an author; yet the title of the present volume
is "On the Portraits of English _Authors_ on Gardening."Neither was old
Bridgman nor Kent _authors_ on this subject; still I could not prevail
on myself to pass over such names in total silence.Clive resided at Moreton-Say, near Market-Drayton.He was a
prebend of Westminster.In
his village, scarcely a poor man existed.His kindness and benevolence
to the poor, could only be equalled by his friendly hospitality and kind
feeling to the more affluent in his neighbourhood:

   _Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,
   Follow thee up to joy and bliss for ever._

Miss Seward thus concludes one of her letters to him:--"I wish none were
permitted to enter the lists of criticism but those who feel poetic
beauty as keenly as yourself, and who have the same generous desire that
others should feel it."Clive with gratitude, from a
recollection of kindnesses received from him at a very early period of
my life, and which were of such a nature, as could not fail to animate
the mind of a young man to studious exertions.Archdeacon Plimley (now
the truly venerable Archdeacon Corbet, and who has been so long an
honour to his native county), in his Agricultural Survey of Shropshire,
respectfully introduces Mr.Clive's name; and when he addressed his
charge to the diocese of Hereford, in 1793, one really cannot but apply
to Mr.Clive, what he so eloquently enforces in that charge to each
clergyman:--"to cultivate a pure spirit within their own bosoms; to be
in every instance the right-hand neighbour to each parishioner; their
private adviser, their public monitor, their example in christian
conduct, their joy in health, their consolation in sickness."Archdeacon Clive, lies buried Robert Lord Clive,
conqueror of _Plassy_: on whose death appeared these extempore lines, by
a man of distinction, a friend to Lord Clive:--

   Life's a surface, slippery, glassy,
   Whereon tumbled Clive of Plassy;
   All the wealth the east could give,
   Brib'd not death to let him live:
   There's no distinction in the grave
   'Twixt the nabob and the slave.His lordship's death, in 1774, was owing to the same cause which
hastened that of the most worthy of men, Sir Samuel Romilly--from
shattered and worn out nerves;--from severe study in the latter, and
from the burning climate of the east in the former.Had Lord Clive lived
a few years longer, he would have enriched the whole neighbourhood round
his native spot.His vigorous, ardently-gifted, and penetrating mind,
projected plantations and other improvements, that could only have been
conceived by such minds as Olivier de Serres, or by Sully, or by our own
Evelyn.He was generous, social and
friendly; and if ever charity to the poor warmed the breast of any
mortal, it warmed that of Lord Clive.Few men had more kind affections
than Lord Clive.[92] The following passage from a favourite book of Dr.Darwin's, (the
System of Nature, by Linnaeus) will well apply to that searching and
penetrating mind, which so strongly possessed him through life.--"How
small a part of the great works of nature is laid open to our eyes, and
how many things are going on in secret which we know nothing of!How
many things are there which this age first was acquainted with!How many
things that we are ignorant of will come to light when all memory of us
shall be no more!for nature does not at once reveal all her secrets.We
are apt to look on ourselves as already admitted into the sanctuary of
her temple; we are still only in the porch."How full of grace, of
tenderness, and passion, is that elegy, which he composed the night he
feared a life he so passionately loved (Mrs.Pole, of Radburn,) was in
imminent danger, and when he dreamed she was dead:

   Stretch'd on her sable bier, the grave beside,
     A snow-white shroud her breathless bosom bound,
   O'er her white brow the _mimic lace_ was tied,
     And loves, and virtues, hung their garlands round.From these cold lips did softest accents flow?Round that pale mouth did sweetest dimples play?On this dull cheek the rose of beauty blow,
     And those dim eyes diffuse celestial rays?Did this cold hand unasking want relieve,
     Or wake the lyre to every rapturous sound?How sad, for other's woes, this breast could heave!How light this heart, for other's transport, bound![93] It was at this period of his residence at Lichfield, that the
present writer heard him strongly enforce the cultivation of _papaver
somniferum_.What he may have also enforced to others, may possibly have
given rise to some of those ingenious papers on its cultivation, which
are inserted not only in the Transactions of the Society for the
Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce; in other publications,
but in the first and fifth volumes of the Memoirs of the Caledonian
Horticultural Society.Jones, on its
cultivation, in the former of these transactions, are particularly
diffuse and valuable.The subjoined plate is a copy of that in the title page to
"_Opiologia_, ou traicte concernant le naturel proprietes, vraye
preparation, et seur vsage de l'opium," a favourite volume with Dr.Darwin, printed at _la Haye_, 1614, 12mo.Darwin, in his Botanical
Garden, thus speaks of opium: "the finest opium is procured by wounding
the heads of large poppies with a three-edged knife, and tying
muscle-shells to them, to catch the drops.In small quantities it
exhilirates the mind, raises the passions, and invigorates the body; in
large ones, it is succeeded by intoxication, languor, stupor, and
death."[94] _Sterne_ mentions a traveller who always set out with the spleen
and jaundice,--"without one generous connection, or pleasurable anecdote
to tell of,--travelling straight on, looking neither to his right hand
or his left, lest love or pity should seduce him out of the road."Loudon seems to be a very different kind of a traveller: for his
horticultural spirit and benevolent views, pervade almost every page of
his late tour through _Bavaria_.One envies his feelings, too, in
another rural excursion, through the romantic scenery of _Bury_, at Mr.Hope's at _Deepdene_; and particularly when he
paints his own emotions on viewing the room of sculpture there.He even
could not, in October last, take his rural ride from _Edgware_ to _St.Alban's_ without thus awakening in each traveller a love of gardens, and
giving this gentle hint to an honest landlord:--"A new inn, in the
outskirts of _St.Alban's_, in the _Dunstable_ road, has an ample
garden, not made the most of.Such a piece of ground, and a gardener of
taste, would give an inn, so situated, so great a superiority, that
_every one would be tempted to stop there_; but the garden of this
Boniface, exhibits but the beginning of a good idea."When travelling
along our English roads, his mind no doubt frequently reverts to those
road-side gardens in the Netherlands, which he thus happily adverts to
in p.32 of his Encyclopaedia: "The gardens of the cottagers in these
countries, are undoubtedly better managed and more productive than those
of any other country; no man who has a cottage is without a garden
attached; often small, but rendered useful to a poor family, by the high
degree of culture given to it."Linnaeus, in his eloquent oration at
Upsal, enforces the pleasure of travelling in one's own country, through
its fields _and roads_.Heath, the zealous and affectionate
historian of Monmouth, in his account of that town and its romantic
neighbourhood, (published in 1804,) omits no opportunity of noticing the
many neat gardens, which add to the other rural charms of its rich
scenery, thus mentions another Boniface:--"The late Thomas Moxley, who
kept the public-house at Manson Cross, was a person that took great
delight in fruit-trees, and had a large piece of ground let him, for the
purpose of planting it with apple-trees; but his death (which followed
soon after) prevented the plan from being carried to the extent he
intended, though some of the land bears evidence of his zeal and
labour."Heath cannot even travel on the turnpike road, from
Monmouth to Hereford, without benevolently remarking, that "a number of
laborious families have erected small tenements, with a garden to each,
most of which are thickly planted with apple-trees, whose produce
considerably adds to the owner's support."[95] Of this celebrated biographer of Dr.Darwin (whose Verses to the
Memory of Mr.Garrick, and whose Monody on Captain Cook, will live as
long as our language is spoken,) Sir W. Scott thus describes his first
personal interview with:--"Miss Seward, when young, must have been
exquisitely beautiful; for, in advanced age, the regularity of her
features, the fire and expression of her countenance, gave her the
appearance of beauty, and almost of youth.Her eyes were auburn, of the
precise shade and hue of her hair, and possessed great expression.In
reciting, or in speaking with animation, they appeared to become darker;
and, as it were, to flash fire.I should have hesitated to state the
impression which this peculiarity made upon me at the time, had not my
observation been confirmed by that of the first actress of this or any
other age, with whom I lately happened to converse on our deceased
friend's expressive powers of countenance."[96] From one of these pleasing sermons I extract these few
lines:--"Among the most pleasing sights of a country village, is that of
a father and mother, followed by their family of different ages, issuing
from their little dwelling on a Sunday morning, as the bell tolls to
church.The children, with their ruddy, wholesome looks, are all neat
and clean.Their behaviour at church shews what an impression their
parents have given them of the holiness of the place, and of the duties
they have to perform.Though unregarded, as they return home, by their
richer neighbours, they carry back with them to their humble cottage the
blessing of God.--Pious parents!lead on your children from church to
heaven.an account of
some of the most remarkable places in North Wales.de Voltaire was so charmed with the taste and talents, and
polite engaging manners of La Fage, that he paid him the following
compliment; which may very justly be applied to Mr.Cradock:

   _Il recut deux presens des Dieux,
   Les plus charmans qu'ils puissent faire;
   L'un etoit le talent de plaire,
   L'autre le secret d'etre heureux._



[99] The Quarterly Review for April, 1821, observes, that "The total
number of exotics, introduced into this country, appears to be 11,970,
of which the first forty-seven species, including the orange, apricot,
pomegranate, &c. were introduced previously or during the reign of Henry
VIII., and no fewer than 6756 in the reign of George III.For this proud
accession to our exotic botany in the last century, the public are
chiefly indebted to Sir Joseph Banks, and Messrs.Lee and Kennedy, of
the Hammersmith nursery."[100] The invocation to this Vale, reminds one of Mr.Repton's
description:--"Downton Vale, near Ludlow, one of the most beautiful and
romantic valleys that the imagination can conceive.It is impossible by
description to convey an idea of its natural charms, or to do justice to
that taste which has displayed these charms to the greatest advantage,

   _With art clandestine, and conceal'd design._

A narrow, wild, and natural path, sometimes creeps under the beetling
rock, close by the margin of a mountain stream.It sometimes ascends to
an awful precipice, from whence the foaming waters are heard roaring in
the dark abyss below, or seen wildly dashing against its opposite banks;
while, in other places, the course of the river _Teme_ being impeded by
natural ledges of rock, the vale presents a calm, glassy mirror, that
reflects the surrounding foliage.The path, in various places, crosses
the water by bridges of the most romantic and contrasted forms; and,
branching in various directions, including some miles in length, is
occasionally varied and enriched by caves and cells, hovels, and covered
seats, or other buildings, in perfect harmony with the wild but pleasing
horrors of the scene."[101] Foxley, this far-famed seat of dignified and benevolent
retirement, has on many occasions become interesting.It gave a peaceful asylum to Benjamin Stillingfleet, when
his mind was depressed by disappointment.The then owner, Robert Price,
Esq.and his mild and amiable lady, both kindly pressed him to become an
inmate of their domestic retreat, that his health might be restored, and
his mind calmed; and though he modestly refused being a constant
intruder, yet he took up his residence in a cottage near them, and
delighted to pass his leisure hours in their happy domestic circle,
"blending his studious pursuits, with rural occupations," and
particularly with gardening.No doubt, to this protecting kindness, may,
on this spot, have been imbibed his great veneration for Theophrastus;
and here he must have laid the foundation of those attainments, which,
during the future periods of his life, obtained for him the high
approbation of the justly celebrated Mrs.Montagu, who, in her letters,
speaks of "this invaluable friend," in the highest possible terms of
praise.In this peaceful and consoling retreat, was written his original
and masterly tribute to the talents of Xenophon; and here was first
kindled his deep enthusiastic zeal for the classic authors of antiquity;
and the materials for his then intended edition of Milton (who he says
equalled all the ancients whom he imitated; the sublimity of Homer, the
majesty of Sophocles, the softness of Theocritus, and the gaiety of
Anacreon,) enriched with parallel passages from holy writ, the classics,
and the early Italian poets; and here he composed his matchless treatise
on the power and principles of Tartini's music (for it seems Mr.Price
himself "was a master of the art.")Here too, most probably, he
sketched, or first gathered, his early memoranda towards his future
general history of husbandry, from the earliest ages of the world to his
own time; and fostered a devoted zeal for Linnaeus, which produced that
spirited eulogium on him, which pervades the preface to his translation
of "Miscellaneous Tracts on Natural History."[102] Sir Uvedale, about fifty years ago, translated _Pausanias_ from
the Greek.One may judge of the feeling with which he dwelt on the pages
of this book, by what he says of that nation in vol.65 of his
Essays, where he speaks of being struck with the extreme richness of
some of the windows of our cathedrals and ruined abbeys: "I hope it will
not be supposed, that by admiring the picturesque circumstances of the
Gothic, I mean to undervalue the symmetry and beauty of Grecian
buildings: whatever comes to us from the Greeks, has an irresistible
claim to our admiration; that distinguished people seized on the true
points both of beauty and grandeur in all the arts, and their
architecture has justly obtained the same high pre-eminence as their
sculpture, poetry, and eloquence."[103] On the pomp of devotion in our ancient abbeys, Mr.R. P. Knight
thus interests his readers, in the chapter "Of the Sublime and
Pathetic," in the Inquiry into the principles of Taste:--"Every person
who has attended the celebration of high mass, at any considerable
ecclesiastical establishment, must have felt how much the splendour and
magnificence of the Roman Catholic worship tends to exalt the spirit of
devotion, and to inspire the soul with rapture and enthusiasm.Not only
the impressive melody of the vocal and instrumental music, and the
imposing solemnity of the ceremonies, but the pomp and brilliancy of the
sacerdotal garments, and the rich and costly decorations of the altar,
raise the character of religion, and give it an air of dignity and
majesty unknown to any of the reformed churches."he thus adverts to the effects of
the levelling system of Launcelot Browne:--"From this influence of
fashion, and the particular influence of Mr.Browne, models of old
gardens are in this country still scarcer in nature than in painting;
and therefore what good parts there may be in such gardens, whether
proceeding from original design, or from the changes produced by time
and accident, can no longer be observed; and yet, from these specimens
of ancient art, however they may be condemned as old fashioned, many
hints might certainly be taken, and blended with such modern
improvements as really deserve the name."--"Were my arguments in favour
of many parts of the old style of gardening ever so convincing, the most
I could hope from them at present, would be, to produce _some caution_;
and to assist in preserving some of the few remains of old magnificence
that still exist, by making the owner less ready to listen to a
professor, whose interest it is to recommend total demolition."R.
P. Knight, in a note to his _landscape_, thus remarks on this subject:
"I remember a country clock-maker, who being employed to clean a more
complex machine than he had been accustomed to, very confidently took it
to pieces; but finding, when he came to put it together again, some
wheels of which he could not discover the use, very discreetly carried
them off in his pocket.The simple artifice of this prudent mechanic,
always recurs to my mind, when I observe the manner in which our modern
improvers repair and embellish old places; not knowing how to employ the
terraces, mounds, avenues, and other features which they find there,
they take them all away, and cover the places which they occupied with
turf.It is a short and easy method of proceeding; and if their
employers will be satisfied with it, they are not to be blamed for
persevering in it, as it may be executed by proxy, as well as in
person."Severely (and no doubt justly), as the too generally smooth and
monotonous system of Mr.Browne has been condemned, yet he must have had
great merit to have obtained the many encomiums he did obtain from some
of our first nobility and gentry.The _evil_ which he did in many of
their altered pleasure-grounds, _lives after him--the good is oft
interred in his grave_.George Mason justly observes that "Nature's favourite haunts
are the school of gardening."Chrysostom said of Xenophon, that "he had something of
witchcraft in his writings."It would not be too much to say the same of
this poet._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means
flower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,
exists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,
Macedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of
Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is
represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the
extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,
his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the
preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of
reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs
under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient
divinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the
lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the
dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of
writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,
reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,
since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,
to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to
scatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at
the foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of
which I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a
sitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were
placed three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a
platform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the
cynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the
principal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the
kneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient
city was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon
(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her
home, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen
the royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is
symbolical of her domestic happiness.Before
her is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness
of his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral
qualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood
phrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to
seduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her
extended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest
read her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the
man, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and
threatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen
at a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is
another serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded
about the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue
protruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing
from its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the
myth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the
woman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render
them invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which
Chaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known
to their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had
imagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being
wounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not
laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still
prevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed
during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of
paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic
words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be
possessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by
wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the
Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and
other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did
not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational
conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing
but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its
etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told
that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established
himself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book
where mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise
magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura
(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the
Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call
themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are
words belonging to the American Maya language.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst
the Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in
Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,
where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a
goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that
she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to
the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a
country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a
sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its
inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called
themselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their
hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a
_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to
indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,
were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual
character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with
the sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent
men and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they
undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they
emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their
inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it
in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was
considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and
Greece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization
from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores
and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them
at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and
beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This
appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures
sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly
discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the
celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced
by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their
civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that
I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians
were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites
and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed
towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as
gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still
in MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective
antiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by
the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.
Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists
still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of
these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the
life of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened
between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of
the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the
structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the
thirty-sixth column.How long did that event occur before the Spanish
conquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take
place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years
since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being
finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the
nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will
remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third
person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his
finger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the
word is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which
they computed time, says:

"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books
every twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these
lustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,
which means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In certain sacred
buildings and in the houses of the priests every twenty years they place
a hewn stone upon those already there.When seven of these stones have
thus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after
the first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of
the big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more
they placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the
north; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they
put a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus
finished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years."There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the
monuments of Mayab:

1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that
their builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices
fronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,
since _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol
of deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been
contemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became
separated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and
their colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what
Psenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon
"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian
legislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the
lands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night," then we may
be able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America
and their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,
that after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of
_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the
stones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,
the full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,
the possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the
_sine qua non_ to form an uncontrovertible one, free from the
speculations which invalidate all books published on the subject
heretofore.If by reading these pages you have learned something new, your time has
not been lost; nor mine in writing them.Transcriber's Note

either kind or charitable to foster rascally fakes like that," pointing
to the picture in Miss Flora's lap."I'd stake my life on most of 'em," declared Mr."They have all
the earmarks of fakes, all right.""But I was having a beautiful time giving until these horrid letters
began to come.""Flora, do you give because YOU like the sensation of giving, and of
receiving thanks, or because you really want to help somebody?"asked
Miss Maggie, a bit wearily."Why, Maggie Duff, I want to help people, of course," almost wept Miss
Flora."Well, then, suppose you try and give so it will help them, then," said
Miss Maggie."One of the most risky things in the world, to my way of
thinking, is a present of--cash.Y-yes, of course," stammered Mr.Smith, growing
suddenly, for some unapparent reason, very much confused.Smith finished speaking, he threw an oddly nervous glance
into Miss Maggie's face.But Miss Maggie had turned back to Miss Flora."There, dear," she admonished her, "now, you do just as Mr.Just hand over your letters to him for a while, and forget all about
them.He'll tell you how he answers them, of course.But you won't have
to worry about them any more.Besides they'll soon stop coming,--won't
they, Mr.They'll dwindle to a few scattering ones,
anyway,--after I've handled them for a while.""Well, I should like that," sighed Miss Flora."But--can't I give
anything anywhere?""But I would investigate a
little, first, dear.Smith threw a swiftly questioning
glance into Miss Maggie's face."Yes, oh, yes; I believe in--investigation," he said then."And now,
Miss Flora," he added briskly, as Miss Flora reached for her wraps,
"with your kind permission I'll walk home with you and have a look
at--my new job of secretarying."CHAPTER XIX

STILL OTHER FLIES


It was when his duties of secretaryship to Miss Flora had dwindled to
almost infinitesimal proportions that Mr.Smith wished suddenly that he
were serving Miss Maggie in that capacity, so concerned was he over a
letter that had come to Miss Maggie in that morning's mail.He himself had taken it from the letter-carrier's hand and had placed
it on Miss Maggie's little desk.Casually, as he did so, he had noticed
that it bore a name he recognized as that of a Boston law firm; but he
had given it no further thought until later, when, as he sat at his
work in the living-room, he had heard Miss Maggie give a low cry and
had looked up to find her staring at the letter in her hand, her face
going from red to white and back to red again."Why, Miss Maggie, what is it?"As she turned toward him he saw that her eyes were full of tears."Why, it--it's a letter telling me---" She stopped abruptly, her eyes
on his face."Yes, yes, tell me," he begged."Why, you are--CRYING, dear!"Smith, plainly quite unaware of the caressing word he had used, came
nearer, his face aglow with sympathy, his eyes very tender.The red surged once more over Miss Maggie's face.She drew back a
little, though manifestly with embarrassment, not displeasure."It's--nothing, really it's nothing," she stammered."It's just a
letter that--that surprised me.""Oh, well, I--I cry easily sometimes."With hands that shook visibly,
she folded the letter and tucked it into its envelope.Then with a
carelessness that was a little too elaborate, she tossed it into her
open desk.Very plainly, whatever she had meant to do in the first
place, she did not now intend to disclose to Mr."Miss Maggie, please tell me--was it bad news?"Smith thought he detected a break very like a sob in the laugh."But maybe I could--help you," he pleaded."You couldn't--indeed, you couldn't!""Miss Maggie, was it--money matters?"He had his answer in the telltale color that flamed instantly into her
face--but her lips said:--

"It was--nothing--I mean, it was nothing that need concern you."She
hurried away then to the kitchen, and Mr.Smith was left alone to fume
up and down the room and frown savagely at the offending envelope
tiptilted against the ink bottle in Miss Maggie's desk, just as Miss
Maggie's carefully careless hand had thrown it.Miss Maggie had several more letters from the Boston law firm, and Mr.Smith knew it--though he never heard Miss Maggie cry out at any of the
other ones.That they affected her deeply, however, he was certain.Her
very evident efforts to lead him to think that they were of no
consequence would convince him of their real importance to her if
nothing else had done so.He watched her, therefore, covertly,
fearfully, longing to help her, but not daring to offer his services.That the affair had something to do with money matters he was sure.That she would not deny this naturally strengthened him in this belief.He came in time, therefore, to formulate his own opinion: she had lost
money--perhaps a good deal (for her), and she was too proud to let him
or any one else know it.He watched then all the more carefully to see if he could detect any
NEW economies or new deprivations in her daily living.Then, because he
could not discover any such, he worried all the more: if she HAD lost
that money, she ought to economize, certainly.Could she be so foolish
as to carry her desire for secrecy to so absurd a length as to live
just exactly as before when she really could not afford it?Smith requested to have hot water
brought to his room morning and night, for which service he insisted,
in spite of Miss Maggie's remonstrances, on paying three dollars a week
extra.There came a strange man to call one day.He was a member of the Boston
law firm.Smith found out that much, but no more.Miss Maggie was
almost hysterical after his visit.She talked very fast and laughed a
good deal at supper that night; yet her eyes were full of tears nearly
all the time, as Mr."And I suppose she thinks she's hiding it from me--that her heart is
breaking!"Smith savagely to himself, as he watched Miss
Maggie's nervous efforts to avoid meeting his eyes."I vow I'll have it
out of her.I'll have it out--to-morrow!"Smith did not "have it out" with Miss Maggie the following day,
however.Something entirely outside of himself sent his thoughts into a
new channel.He was alone in the Duff living-room, and was idling over his work, at
his table in the corner, when Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell opened the door and
hurried in, wringing her hands.Smith sprang to his feet and hastened toward her."Oh, I don't know--I don't know," moaned the woman, flinging herself
into a chair."There can't anybody do anything, I s'pose; but I've GOT
to have somebody.I can't stay there in that house--I can't--I can't--I
CAN'T!"And you shan't," soothed the man."And she'll
be here soon, I'm sure--Miss Maggie will.But just let me help you off
with your things," he urged, somewhat awkwardly trying to unfasten her
heavy wraps.Impatiently she jerked off the rich fur coat and
tossed it into his arms; then she dropped into the chair again and fell
to wringing her hands."Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?"Can't I send for--for your husband?"Blaisdell fell to weeping afresh.He's gone--to Fred, you know.""Yes, yes, that's what's the matter.Blaisdell, I'm so sorry!The woman dropped her hands from her face and looked up wildly, half
defiantly.He isn't bad and
wicked, is he?And they can't shut him up if--if we pay it back--all of
it that he took?They won't take my boy--to PRISON?"Smith's face, she began to wring her hands
again.I'll have to tell you--I'll have to," she
moaned."But, my dear woman,--not unless you want to.""I do want to--I do want to!With a visible effort she calmed herself a little and forced
herself to talk more coherently.He wanted seven hundred
dollars and forty-two cents.He said he'd got to have it--if he didn't,
he'd go and KILL himself.He said he'd spent all of his allowance,
every cent, and that's what made him take it--this other money, in the
first place.""You mean--money that didn't belong to him?""Yes; but you mustn't blame him, you mustn't blame him, Mr."Yes; and--Oh, Maggie, Maggie, what shall I do?she
broke off wildly, leaping to her feet as Miss Maggie pushed open the
door and hurried in.Miss Maggie,
white-faced, but with a cheery smile, was throwing off her heavy coat
and her hat.A moment later she came over and took Mrs.Hattie's
trembling hands in both her own."Now, first, tell me all about it,
dear.""Only a little," answered Miss Maggie, gently pushing the other back
into her chair.Jim telephoned him something, just before
he left.She began to wring her hands again, but
Miss Maggie caught and held them firmly."You see, Fred, he was
treasurer of some club, or society, or something; and--and he--he
needed some money to--to pay a man, and he took that--the money that
belonged to the club, you know, and he thought he could pay it back,
little by little.But something happened--I don't know what--a new
treasurer, or something: anyhow, it was going to be found out--that
he'd taken it.It was going to be found out to-morrow, and so he wrote
the letter to his father.But he looked so--oh, I never
saw him look so white and terrible.And I'm so afraid--of what he'll
do--to Fred."Is Jim going to give him the money?"And he's going to give it to him.Oh, they can't shut him
up--they CAN'T send him to prison NOW, can they?"No, they won't send him to prison.If Jim has gone with
the money, Fred will pay it back and nobody will know it.But, Hattie,
Fred DID it, just the same.""And, Hattie, don't you see?Don't you
see where all this is leading?But he isn't going to, any more.He said if his father would help him out of this
scrape, he'd never get into another one, and he'd SHOW him how much he
appreciated it."I'm glad to hear that," cried Miss Maggie."He'll come out all
right, yet."Smith, over at the window, blew his nose
vigorously.Smith had not sat down since Miss Maggie's entrance.He
had crossed to the window, and had stood looking out--at nothing--all
through Mrs."You do think he will, don't you?"Hattie, turning from one
to the other piteously."He said he was ashamed of himself; that this
thing had been an awful lesson to him, and he promised--oh, he promised
lots of things, if Jim would only go up and help him out of this.He'd
never, never have to again.But he will, I know he will, if that
Gaylord fellow stays there.The whole thing was his fault--I know it
was."Why, Hattie, I thought you liked them!"They're mean, stuck-up things, and they snub me awfully.Don't you suppose I know when I'm being snubbed?And that Gaylord
girl--she's just as bad, and she's making my Bessie just like her.I
got Bess into the same school with her, you know, and I was so proud
and happy.Why, my Bess, my own daughter,
actually looks down on us.She's ashamed of her own father and
mother--and she shows it.And it's that Gaylord girl that's done it,
too, I believe.I thought I--I was training my daughter to be a lady--a
real lady; but I never meant to train her to look down on--on her own
mother!""I'm afraid Bessie--needs something of a lesson," commented Miss Maggie
tersely."But Bessie will be older, one of these days, Hattie, and then
she'll--know more.""But that's what I've been trying to teach her--'more,' something more
all the time, Maggie," sighed Mrs."And I've
tried to remember and call her Elizabeth, too.--but I can't.But,
somehow, to-day, nothing seems of any use, any way.And even if she
learns more and more, I don't see as it's going to do any good.I'm not fine enough yet, it seems, for
Mrs.They don't want me among them, and
they show it.And all my old friends are so envious and jealous since
the money came that THEY don't want me, and THEY show it; so I don't
feel comfortable anywhere.""Never mind, dear, just stop trying to live as you think other folks
want you to live, and live as YOU want to, for a while."Hattie smiled faintly, wiped her eyes again, and got to her feet."Well, just try it," smiled Miss Maggie, helping her visitor into the
luxurious fur coat."You've no idea how much more comfort you'll take."Hattie's eyes were wistful, but almost instantly they
showed an alert gleam of anger."Well, anyhow, I'm not going to try to do what those Gaylords do any
longer.And--and you're SURE Fred won't have to go to prison?""I'm very sure," nodded Miss Maggie.You always make
me feel better, Maggie, and you, too, Mr."Now, go home and go to bed, and don't
worry any more or you'll have one of your headaches."As the door closed behind her visitor, Miss Maggie turned and sank into
a chair.She looked worn and white, and utterly weary."I hope she won't meet Frank or Jane anywhere."Do you think they'd blame her--about this
unfortunate affair of Fred's?"I just
came from Frank's, and--"

"Yes?"Something in her face sent a questioning frown to Mr."Do you remember hearing Flora say that Jane had bought a lot of the
Benson gold-mine stock?""Well, Benson has failed; and they've just found out that that
gold-mine stock is worth--about two cents on a dollar."And how much--"

"About forty thousand dollars," said Miss Maggie wearily."Well, I'll be--"

He did not finish his sentence.CHAPTER XX

FRANKENSTEIN: BEING A LETTER FROM JOHN SMITH TO EDWARD D. NORTON,
ATTORNEY AT LAW


DEAR NED:--Wasn't there a story written once about a fellow who created
some sort of a machine man without any soul that raised the very
dickens and all for him?Frank--Frankenstein?--I guess that was it.Well, I've created a Frankenstein creature--and I'm dead up against it
to know what to do with him.Ned, what in Heaven's name am I going to do with Mr.John Smith, let me tell you, is a very healthy, persistent, insistent,
important person, with many kind friends, a definite position in the
world, and no small degree of influence.Worse yet (now prepare for a
stunning blow, Ned!Smith has been so inconsiderate as to fall in
love.And he has fallen in love as absolutely and as
idiotically as if he were twenty-one instead of fifty-two.Now, will
you kindly tell me how Mr.John Smith is going to fade away into
nothingness?And, even if he finds the way to do that, shall he, before
fading, pop the question for Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, or shall he trust
to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's being able to win for himself the love Mr.Seriously, joking aside, I'm afraid I've made a mess of things, not
only for myself, but for everybody else.I'll spare you rhapsodies, Ned.They say, anyway,
that there's no fool like an old fool.But I will admit that that
future looks very dark to me if I am not to have the companionship of
the little woman, Maggie Duff.Oh, yes, it's "Poor Maggie."As for Miss Maggie herself, perhaps it's
conceited, but I believe she's not entirely indifferent to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton I have my doubts; but,
alas!I have no doubts whatever as to what her opinion will be of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's masquerading as Mr.Stanley G. Fulton the job he's got on his hands to put himself
right with her, either.But there's one thing he can be sure of, at
least; if she does care for Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton's money that was the bait.you see already I have adopted the Hillerton
vernacular.)But I fear Miss Maggie is indeed "poor" now.She has had
several letters that I don't like the looks of, and a call from a
villainous-looking man from Boston--one of your craft, I believe
(begging your pardon).I think she's lost some money, and I don't
believe she had any extra to lose.She's as proud as Lucifer, however,
and she's determined no one shall find out she's lost any money, so her
laugh is gayer than ever.I can hear
something in her voice that isn't laughter.Ned, what a mess I HAVE made of it!I feel more than ever now
like the boy with his ear to the keyhole.These people are my
friends--or, rather, they are Mr.As for being
mine--who am I, Smith, or Fulton?Will they be Fulton's friends, after
they find he is John Smith?Will they be Smith's friends, even, after
they find he is Fulton?Oh, yes, I can hear you say that it serves me right, and that you
warned me, and that I was deaf to all remonstrances.Now, we'll waste no more time on that.I've acknowledged my error, and my transgression is ever
before me.I built the box, I walked into it, and I deliberately shut
the cover down.I've got to get out--some
way.I can't spend the rest of my natural existence as John Smith,
hunting Blaisdell data--though sometimes I think I'd be willing to, if
it's the only way to stay with Miss Maggie.I tell you, that little
woman can make a home out of--

But I couldn't stay with Miss Maggie.John Smith wouldn't have money
enough to pay his board, to say nothing of inviting Miss Maggie to
board with him, would he?Stanley G. Fulton's last
will and testament on the first day of next November will effectually
cut off Mr.There is no provision in the
will for Mr.I don't think
he'd like that.By the way, I wonder: do you suppose John Smith could
earn--his salt, if he was hard put to it?Very plainly, then, something
has got to be done about getting John Smith to fade away, and Stanley
G. Fulton to appear before next November.And I had thought it would be so easy!Early this summer John Smith was
to pack up his Blaisdell data, bid a pleasant adieu to Hillerton, and
betake himself to South America.In due course, after a short trip to
some obscure Inca city, or down some little-known river, Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton would arrive at some South American hotel from the interior, and
would take immediate passage for the States, reaching Chicago long
before November first.There would be a slight flurry, of course, and a few annoying
interviews and write-ups; but Mr.Stanley G. Fulton always was known to
keep his affairs to himself pretty well, and the matter would soon be
put down as merely another of the multi-millionaire's eccentricities.The whole thing would then be all over, and well over.But--nowhere had
there been taken into consideration the possibilities of--a Maggie
Duff.And now, to me, that same Maggie Duff is the only thing worth
considering--anywhere.And even after all this, I haven't accomplished what I set out to
do--that is, find the future possessor of the Fulton millions (unless
Miss Maggie--bless her!--says "yes."And even then, some one will have
to have them after us).As
conditions are now, I should not want either Frank, or James, or Flora
to have them--not unless the millions could bring them more happiness
than these hundred thousand apiece have brought.Honest, Ned, that miserable money has made more--But, never mind.It's
too long a story to write.I'll tell you when I see you--if I ever do
see you.There's still the possibility, you know, that Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton is lost in darkest South America, and of course John Smith CAN
go to work!I believe I won't sign any name--I haven't got any name--that I feel
really belongs to me now.Still I might--yes, I will sign it

SYMPATHIES MISPLACED


The first time Mr.Smith saw Frank Blaisdell, after Miss Maggie's news
of the forty-thousand-dollar loss, he tried, somewhat awkwardly, to
express his interest and sympathy.But Frank Blaisdell cut him short."That's all right, and I thank you," he cried heartily."And I know
most folks would think losing forty thousand dollars was about as bad
as it could be.Jane, now, is all worked up over it; can't sleep
nights, and has gone back to turning down the gas and eating sour cream
so's to save and help make it up.But me--I call it the best thing that
ever happened."Smith; "I'm sure that's a very delightful
way to look at it--if you can.""Well, I can; and I'll tell you why.It's put me back where I
belong--behind the counter of a grocery store.Oh, I had enough left for that, and more!Gorry, but I was glad to feel the old floor under my feet again!""But I thought you--you were tired of work, and--wanted to enjoy
yourself," stammered Mr."Tired of work--wanted to enjoy myself, indeed!Yes, I know I did say
something like that.But, let me tell you this, Mr.Talk about
work!--I never worked so hard in my life as I have the last ten months
trying to enjoy myself.How these folks can stand gadding 'round the
country week in and week out, feeding their stomachs on a French
dictionary instead of good United States meat and potatoes and squash,
and spending their days traipsing off to see things they ain't a mite
interested in, and their nights trying to get rested so they can go and
see some more the next day, I don't understand.""I'm afraid these touring agencies wouldn't like to have you write
their ads for them, Mr."Well, they hadn't better ask me to," smiled the other grimly.Since I come back I've been working even harder trying
to enjoy myself here at home--knockin' silly little balls over a
ten-acre lot in a game a healthy ten-year-old boy would scorn to play.""Oh, yes, I enjoyed the riding well enough; but I didn't enjoy hunting
for punctures, putting on new tires, or burrowing into the inside of
the critter to find out why she didn't go!And that's what I was doing
most of the time.He paused a moment, then went on a little wistfully:--

"I suspect, Mr.Smith, there ain't anything in my line but groceries.If--if I had my life to
live over again, I'd do different, maybe.I'd see if I couldn't find
out what there was in a picture to make folks stand and stare at it an
hour at a time when you could see the whole thing in a minute--and it
wa'n't worth lookin' at, anyway, even for a minute.Now, I like a good tune what is a tune; but them caterwaulings and
dirges that that chap Gray plays on that fiddle of his--gorry, Mr.Smith, I'd rather hear the old barn door at home squeak any day.But if
I was younger I'd try to learn to like 'em.She can set by the hour in front of that phonygraph of hers, and
not know it!""And there's books, too," resumed the other, still wistfully."I'd read
books--if I could stay awake long enough to do it--and I'd find out
what there was in 'em to make a good sensible man like Jim Blaisdell
daft over 'em--and Maggie Duff, too.Why, that little woman used to go
hungry sometimes, when she was a girl, so she could buy a book she
wanted.Why, I'd 'a' given anything this last year if I
could 'a' got interested--really interested, readin'.I could 'a'
killed an awful lot of time that way.I bought a
lot of 'em, too, an' tried it; but I expect I didn't begin young
enough.Smith, I've about come to the conclusion that
there ain't a thing in the world so hard to kill as time.I've tried
it, and I know.Why, I got so I couldn't even kill it EATIN'--though I
'most killed myself TRYIN' to!A full
stomach ain't in it with bein' hungry an' knowing a good dinner's
coming.Why, there was whole weeks at a time back there that I didn't
know the meaning of the word 'hungry.'You'd oughter seen the jolt I
give one o' them waiter-chaps one day when he comes up with his paper
and his pencil and asks me what I wanted.'There ain't
but one thing on this earth I want, and you can't give it to me.I'm tired of bein' so blamed satisfied all the
time!'""And what did--Alphonso say to that?"Oh, the waiter-fellow, you mean?Oh, he just stared a
minute, then mumbled his usual 'Yes, sir, very good, sir,' and shoved
that confounded printed card of his a little nearer to my nose.I guess you've heard enough of this, Mr.It's only that I
was trying to tell you why I'm actually glad we lost that money.It's
give me back my man's job again."I won't waste any more sympathy on you,"
laughed Mr.I hope it'll give me
back a little of my old faith in my fellow-man."I won't suspect every man, woman, and child that says a
civil word to me now of having designs on my pocketbook.Smith, you wouldn't believe it, if I told you, the things that's been
done and said to get a little money out of me.Of course, the open
gold-brick schemes I knew enough to dodge,'most of 'em (unless you
count in that darn Benson mining stock), and I spotted the blackmailers
all right, most generally.But I WAS flabbergasted when a WOMAN tackled
the job and began to make love to me--actually make love to me!--one
day when Jane's back was turned.DO I look such a fool as that,
Mr.Well, anyhow, there won't be any more of that kind, nor
anybody after my money now, I guess," he finished with a sage wag of
his head as he turned away.Smith said, after recounting the
earlier portion of the conversation: "So you see you were right, after
all.Frank Blaisdell had plenty to
retire upon, but nothing to retire to.But I'm glad--if he's happy now.""And he isn't the only one that that forty-thousand-dollar loss has
done a good turn to," nodded Miss Maggie."Mellicent has just been
here.It's the Easter vacation,
anyway, but she isn't going back.Miss Maggie spoke with studied casualness, but there was an added color
in her cheeks--Miss Maggie always flushed a little when she mentioned
Mellicent's name to Mr.Smith, in spite of her indignant efforts not to
do so.Well, the Pennocks had a dance last night, and Mellicent went.She said she had to laugh to see Mrs.Pennock's efforts to keep Carl
away from her--the loss of the money is known everywhere now, and has
been greatly exaggerated, I've heard.She said that even Hibbard
Gaylord had the air of one trying to let her down easy.Mellicent was
immensely amused."He doesn't move in the Pennock crowd much.But
Mellicent sees him, and--and everything's all right there, now.That's
why Mellicent is so happy.""You mean--Has her mother given in?"You see, Jane was at the dance, too, and she saw Carl, and she
saw Hibbard Gaylord.She told Mellicent this
morning that she had her opinion of fellows who would show so plainly
as Carl Pennock and Hibbard Gaylord did that it was the money they were
after."Jane has changed her shoes again," murmured Mr.Miss Maggie's puzzled frown gave way to a laugh.Daniel travelled to the bathroom."Well, yes, perhaps the shoe is on the other foot again.But, anyway,
she doesn't love Carl or Hibbard any more, and she does love Donald
Gray.He HASN'T let the loss of the money make any difference to him,
you see.He's been even more devoted, if anything.She told Mellicent
this morning that he was a very estimable young man, and she liked him
very much.Perhaps you see now why Mellicent is--happy."I'm glad to know it," cried Mr."I'm glad--" His
face changed suddenly."I'm glad the LOSS of the
money brought them some happiness--if the possession of it didn't," he
finished moodily, turning to go to his own room.At the hall door he
paused and looked back at Miss Maggie, standing by the table, gazing
after him with troubled eyes."Did Mellicent say--whether Fred was
there?"He didn't come home for this vacation
at all.I suspect Mellicent doesn't know
anything about that wretched affair of his."So the young gentleman didn't show up at all?"Hattie didn't
go to the Pennocks' either.Hattie has--has been very different since
this affair of Fred's.I think it frightened her terribly--it was so
near a tragedy; the boy threatened to kill himself, you know, if his
father didn't help him out.""Yes, I know he did; and I'm afraid he found things in a pretty bad
mess--when he got there," sighed Miss Maggie."It was a bad mess all
around.""It is, indeed, a bad mess all around," he growled as he
disappeared through the door.Behind him, Miss Maggie still stood motionless, looking after him with
troubled eyes.As the spring days grew warmer, Miss Maggie had occasion many times to
look after Mr.One day he would be the old delightful companion, genial,
cheery, generously donating a box of chocolates to the center-table
bonbon dish or a dozen hothouse roses to the mantel vase.The next, he
would be nervous, abstracted, almost irritable.Yet she could see no
possible reason for the change.Sometimes she wondered fearfully if Mellicent could have anything to do
with it.Was it possible that he had cared for Mellicent, and to see
her now so happy with Donald Gray was more than he could bear?There was his own statement that he had devoted
himself to her solely and only to help keep the undesirable lovers away
and give Donald Gray a chance.Besides, had he not said that he was not a marrying man, anyway?To be
sure, that seemed a pity--a man so kind and thoughtful and so
delightfully companionable!But then, it was nothing to her, of
course--only she did hope he was not feeling unhappy over Mellicent!Smith would not bring flowers and
candy so often.She felt as if he were spending too
much money--and she had got the impression in some way that he did not
have any too much money to spend.And there were the expensive motor
trips, too--she feared Mr.Yet she could not
tell him so, of course.He never seemed to realize the value of a
dollar, anyway, and he very obviously did not know how to get the most
out of it.Look at his foolish generosity in regard to the board he
paid her!Miss Maggie wondered sometimes if it might not be worry over money
matters that was making him so nervous and irritable on occasions now.Plainly he was very near the end of his work there in Hillerton.He was
not getting so many letters on Blaisdell matters from away, either.For
a month now he had done nothing but a useless repetition of old work;
and of late, a good deal of the time, he was not even making that
pretense of being busy.For days at a time he would not touch his
records.That could mean but one thing, of course; his work was done.Yet he seemed to be making no move toward departure.Not that she
wanted him to go.She should miss him very much when he went, of
course.But she did not like to feel that he was staying simply because
he had nowhere to go and nothing to do.Miss Maggie did not believe in
able-bodied men who had nowhere to go and nothing to do--and she wanted
very much to believe in Mr.She had been under the impression that he was getting the Blaisdell
material together for a book, and that he was intending to publish it
himself.His book must be ready, but he was making no move to
publish it.To Miss Maggie this could mean but one thing: some
financial reverses had made it impossible for him to carry out his
plans, and had left him stranded with no definite aim for the future.She was so sorry!--but there seemed to be nothing that she could do.She HAD tried to help by insisting that he pay less for his board; but
he had not only scouted that idea, but had brought her more chocolates
and flowers than ever--for all the world as if he had divined her
suspicions and wished to disprove them.Smith was trying to keep something from her, Miss Maggie was
sure.She was the more sure, perhaps, because she herself had something
that she was trying to keep from Mr.Smith--and she thought she
recognized the symptoms.Meanwhile April budded into May, and May blossomed into June; and June
brought all the Blaisdells together again in Hillerton.CHAPTER XXII

WITH EVERY JIM A JAMES


Two days after Fred Blaisdell had returned from college, his mother
came to see Miss Maggie.Smith was rearranging the books on Miss
Maggie's shelves and trying to make room for the new ones he had
brought her through the winter.Hattie came in, red-eyed and
flushed-faced, he ceased his work at once and would have left the room,
but she stopped him with a gesture.You know all about it, anyway,--and I'd just as soon you
knew the rest.I just came down to talk
things over with Maggie.I--I'm sure I don't know w-what I'm going to
do--when I can't.""But you always can, dear," soothed Miss Maggie cheerily, handing her
visitor a fan and taking a chair near her.Smith, after a moment's hesitation, turned quietly back to his
bookshelves."Why, Hattie Blaisdell, where are you going?"I
guess we can still see each other.Now, tell me, what does all this
mean?""Well, of course, it began with Fred--his trouble, you know.""But I thought Jim fixed that all up, dear."He paid the money, and nobody there at college knew a
thing about it.Fred told us some of them
night before last.He says he's ashamed of himself, but that he
believes there's enough left in him to make a man of him yet.But he
says he can't do it--there.""You mean--he doesn't want to go back to college?"Miss Maggie's voice
showed her disappointment."Oh, he wants to go to college--but not there.""He says he's had too much money to spend--and that 't wouldn't be easy
not to spend it--if he was back there, in the old crowd."Well, that's all right, isn't it?"He's awfully happy over it, and--and I
guess I am."But now, what is this about Plainville?""Oh, that
grew out of it--all this.Hammond is going to open a new office in
Plainville and he's offered Jim--James--no, JIM--I'm not going to call
him 'James' any more!--the chance to manage it.""Well, that's fine, I'm sure.""Yes, of course that part is fine--splendid.He'll get a bigger salary,
and all that, and--and I guess I'm glad to go, anyway--I don't like
Hillerton any more.I haven't got any friends here, Maggie.Of course,
I wouldn't have anything to do with the Gaylords now, after what's
happened,--that boy getting my boy to drink and gamble, and--and
everything.And yet--YOU know how I've strained every nerve for years,
and worked and worked to get where my children could--COULD be with
them!""It didn't pay, did it, Hattie?"They're perfectly horrid--every one of them, and I
hate them!"Look at what they've done to Fred, and Bessie, too!I
shan't let HER be with them any more, either.There aren't any folks
here we can be with now.That's why I don't mind going away.All our
friends that we used to know don't like us any more, they're so jealous
on account of the money.Oh, yes, I know you think I'm to blame for
that," she went on aggrievedly."I can see you do, by your face.But it was just so I could get ahead.Miss Maggie looked as if she would like to say
something more--but she did not say it.Smith was abstractedly opening and shutting
the book in his hand.He had not
touched the books on the shelves for some time."And look at how I've tried and see what it has come to--Bessie so
high-headed and airy she makes fun of us, and Fred a gambler and a
drunkard, and'most a thief.And it's all that horrid hundred thousand
dollars!"Smith's hand slipped to the floor with a bang; but no
one was noticing Mr."Oh, Hattie, don't blame the hundred thousand dollars," cried Miss
Maggie."Jim says it was, and Fred does, too.Fred said it
was all just the same kind of a way that I'd tried to make folks call
Jim 'James.'He said I'd been trying to make every single 'Jim' we had
into a 'James,' until I'd taken away all the fun of living.And I
suppose maybe he's right, too.""Well,
anyhow, I'm not going to do it any more.There isn't any fun in it,
anyway.It doesn't make any difference how hard I tried to get ahead, I
always found somebody else a little 'aheader' as Benny calls it."There isn't any use--in that kind of trying, Hattie."Jim said I was like the little boy that
they asked what would make him the happiest of anything in the world,
and he answered, 'Everything that I haven't got.'And I suppose I have
been something like that.But I don't see as I'm any worse than other
folks.Everybody goes for money; but I'm sure I don't see why--if it
doesn't make them any happier than it has me!"We shall begin to pack the first of the
month.It looks like a mountain to me, but Jim and Fred say they'll
help, and--"

Mr.Smith did not hear any more, for Miss Maggie and her guest had
reached the hall and had closed the door behind them.But when Miss
Maggie returned, Mr.Smith was pacing up and down the room nervously."Well," he demanded with visible irritation, as soon as she appeared,
"will you kindly tell me if there is anything--desirable--that that
confounded money has done?""You mean--Jim Blaisdell's money?""I mean all the money--I mean the three hundred thousand dollars that
those three people received.Has it ever brought any good or
happiness--anywhere?""Oh, yes, I know," smiled Miss Maggie, a little sadly."But--" Her
countenance changed abruptly.A passionate earnestness came to her
eyes."Don't blame the money--blame the SPENDING of it!The dollar that will buy tickets to the movies will just as
quickly buy a good book; and if you're hungry, it's up to you whether
you put your money into chocolate eclairs or roast beef.Is the MONEY
to blame that goes for a whiskey bill or a gambling debt instead of for
shoes and stockings for the family?"Smith had apparently lost his own irritation in his
amazement at hers."Why, Miss Maggie, you--you seem worked up over this
matter."It's been money,
money, money, ever since I could remember!We're all after it, and we
all want it, and we strain every nerve to get it.We think it's going
to bring us happiness.But it won't--unless we do our part.And there
are some things that even money can't buy.Besides, it isn't the money
that does the things, anyway,--it's the man behind the money.What do
you think money is good for, Mr.Smith, now thoroughly dazed, actually blinked his eyes at the
question, and at the vehemence with which it was hurled into his face."Why, Miss Maggie, it--it--I--I--"

"It isn't good for anything unless we can exchange it for something we
want, is it?""Why, I--I suppose we can GIVE it--"

"But even then we're exchanging it for something we want, aren't we?We
want to make the other fellow happy, don't we?""But it doesn't
always work that way.Now, very likely
this--er--Mr.Fulton thought those three hundred thousand dollars were
going to make these people happy.Personification of happiness--that
woman was, a few minutes ago, wasn't she?"Smith had regained his
air of aggrieved irritation.She
didn't know how to spend it.And that's just what I mean when I say
we've got to do our part--money won't buy happiness, unless we exchange
it for the things that will bring happiness.If we don't know how to
get any happiness out of five dollars, we won't know how to get it out
of five hundred, or five thousand, or five hundred thousand, Mr.I don't mean that we'll get the same amount out of five dollars, of
course,--though I've seen even that happen sometimes!--but I mean that
we've got to know how to spend five dollars--and to make the most of
it.""I reckon--you're right, Miss Maggie.""I know I'm right, and 't isn't the money's fault when things go wrong.Oh, yes, I know--we're taught that the
love of money is the root of all evil.But I don't think it should be
so--necessarily.I think money's one of the most wonderful things in
the world.It's more than a trust and a gift--it's an opportunity, and
a test.It brings out what's strongest in us, every time.And it does
that whether it's five dollars or five hundred thousand dollars.If--if
we love chocolate eclairs and the movies better than roast beef and
good books, we're going to buy them, whether they're chocolate eclairs
and movies on five dollars, or or--champagne suppers and Paris gowns on
five hundred thousand dollars!"Miss Maggie gave a shamefaced laugh and sank back in her chair."You don't know what to think of me, of course; and no wonder," she
sighed."But I've felt so bad over this--this money business right here
under my eyes.I love them all, every one of them.And YOU know how
it's been, Mr.Hasn't it worked out to prove just what I say?She said that Fred declared she'd been
trying to make every one of her 'Jims' a 'James,' ever since the money
came.But he forgot that she did that very same thing before it came.All her life she's been trying to make five dollars look like ten; so
when she got the hundred thousand, it wasn't six months before she was
trying to make that look like two hundred thousand."Jane used to buy ingrain carpets and cheap
chairs and cover them with mats and tidies to save them.""They got on your nerves, too, didn't they?Such layers upon layers of
covers for everything!It brought me to such a pass that I went to the
other extreme.I wouldn't protect ANYTHING--which was very
reprehensible, of course.Well, now she has pretty dishes and solid
silver--but she hides them in bags and boxes, and never uses them
except for company.She doesn't take any more comfort with them than
she did with the ingrain carpets and cheap chairs.Of course, that's a
little thing.When you can't spend five
cents out of a hundred dollars for pleasure without wincing, you
needn't expect you're going to spend five dollars out of a hundred
thousand without feeling the pinch," laughed Miss Maggie."Poor Flora--and when she tried so hard to quiet her conscience because
she had so much money!She told me yesterday that she
hardly ever gets a begging letter now.""No; and those she does get she investigates," asserted Mr."So
the fakes don't bother her much these days.And she's doing a lot of
good, too, in a small way.""She is, and she's happy now," declared Miss Maggie, "except that she
still worries a little because she is so happy.She's dismissed the
maid and does her own work--I'm afraid Miss Flora never was cut out for
a fine-lady life of leisure, and she loves to putter in the kitchen.She says it's such a relief, too, not to keep dressed up in company
manners all the time, and not to have that horrid girl spying 'round
all day to see if she behaves proper.and I reckon it worked the best with her of any of them.""Er--that is, I mean, perhaps she's made the best use of the hundred
thousand," stammered Mr."She's been--er--the happiest.""Why, y-yes, perhaps she has, when you come to look at it that way.""But you wouldn't--er--advise this Mr.Fulton to leave her--his twenty
millions?"laughed Miss Maggie, throwing up both hands."She'd faint dead
away at the mere thought of it."Smith turned on his heel and resumed
his restless pacing up and down the room.From time to time he glanced
furtively at Miss Maggie.Miss Maggie, her hands idly resting in her
lap, palms upward, was gazing fixedly at nothing.he demanded at last, coming to a
pause at her side.Stanley G. Fulton," she answered, not looking
up.The odd something had increased, but Miss Maggie's eyes
were still dreamily fixed on space.I was wondering what he had done with them.""Yes, in the letter, I mean."There was a letter--a second letter to be opened
in two years' time.They said that that was to dispose of the remainder
of the property--his last will and testament.""Oh, yes, I remember," assented Mr.Smith was very carefully not
meeting Miss Maggie's eyes.Miss Maggie turned back to her meditative
gazing at nothing."The two years are nearly up, you know,--I was
talking with Jane the other day--just next November."The words were very near a groan, but at once Mr.Smith
hurriedly repeated, "I know--I know!"very lightly, indeed, with an
apprehensive glance at Miss Maggie."So it seems to me if he were alive that he'd be back by this time.And
so I was wondering--about those millions," she went on musingly."What
do YOU suppose he has done with them?"she asked, with sudden
animation, turning full upon him."Why, I--I--How should I know?"Smith, a swift crimson
dyeing his face."You wouldn't, of course--but that needn't make you look as if I'd
intimated that YOU had them!I was only asking for your opinion, Mr.Smith," she twinkled, with mischievous eyes.Smith laughed now, a little precipitately."But,
indeed, Miss Maggie, you turned so suddenly and the question was so
unexpected that I felt like the small boy who, being always blamed for
everything at home that went wrong, answered tremblingly, when the
teacher sharply demanded, 'Who made the world?''Please, ma'am, I did;
but I'll never do it again!'"Smith, when Miss Maggie had done laughing at his
little story, "suppose I turn the tables on you?Miss Maggie shifted her position, her
face growing intently interested again."I've been trying to remember
what I know of the man.""Yes, from the newspaper and magazine accounts of him.Of course, there
was quite a lot about him at the time the money came; and Flora let me
read some things she'd saved, in years gone.Flora was always
interested in him, you know.""Why, not much, really, about the man.Besides, very likely what I did
find wasn't true.But
I was trying to find out how he'd spent his money himself.I thought
that might give me a clue--about the will, I mean.""Yes; but I didn't find much.In spite of his reported eccentricities,
he seems to me to have done nothing very extraordinary.""He doesn't seem to have been very bad.""Nor very good either, for that matter.""Sort of a--nonentity, perhaps.""Perhaps--though I suppose he couldn't really be that--not very
well--with twenty millions, could he?But I mean, he wasn't very bad,
nor very good.He didn't seem to be dissipated, or mixed up in any
scandal, or to be recklessly extravagant, like so many rich men.On the
other hand, I couldn't find that he'd done any particular good in the
world.Some charities were mentioned, but they were perfunctory,
apparently, and I don't believe, from the accounts, that he ever really
INTERESTED himself in any one--that he ever really cared for--any one."If Miss Maggie had looked up, she would have met a
most disconcerting expression in the eyes bent upon her.But Miss
Maggie did not look up."Why, he didn't even have a wife and
children to stir him from his selfishness.He had a secretary, of
course, and he probably never saw half his begging letters.I can
imagine his tossing them aside with a languid 'Fix them up,
James,--give the creatures what they want, only don't bother me.'"Smith; then, hastily: "I'm sure he never
did."But when I think of what he might
do--Twenty millions!But he didn't
do--anything--worth while with them, so far as I can see, when he was
living, so that's why I can't imagine what his will may be.Probably
the same old perfunctory charities, however, with the Chicago law firm
instead of 'James' as disburser--unless, of course, Hattie's
expectations are fulfilled, and he divides them among the Blaisdells
here.""You think--there's something worth while he MIGHT have done with those
millions, then?"Smith, a sudden peculiar wistfulness in
his eyes."Something he MIGHT have done with them!""Why,
it seems to me there's no end to what he might have done--with twenty
millions."Smith came nearer, his face working with emotion."Miss
Maggie, if a man with twenty millions--that is, could you love a man
with twenty millions, if--if Mr.Fulton should ask you--if _I_ were Mr.Fulton--if--" His countenance changed suddenly.He drew himself up with
a cry of dismay."Oh, no--no--I've spoiled it all now.That isn't what
I meant to say first.I was going to find out--I mean, I was going to
tell--Oh, good Heavens, what a--That confounded money--again!"Smith, w-what--" Only the crisp shutting of the door answered
her.With a beseeching look and a despairing gesture Mr.Then, turning to sit down, she came face to face with her own
image in the mirror."Well, now you've done it, Maggie Duff," she whispered wrathfully to
the reflection in the glass.He was--was
going to say something--I know he was.You've talked money,
money, MONEY to him for an hour.You said you LOVED money; and you told
what you'd do--if you had twenty millions of dollars.And you know--you
KNOW he's as poor as Job's turkey, and that just now he's more than
ever plagued over--money!As
if that counted against--"

With a little sobbing cry Miss Maggie covered her face with her hands
and sat down, helplessly, angrily.CHAPTER XXIII

REFLECTIONS--MIRRORED AND OTHERWISE


Miss Maggie was still sitting in the big chair with her face in her
hands when the door opened and Mr.Miss Maggie, dropping her hands and starting up at his entrance, caught
a glimpse of his face in the mirror in front of her.With a furtive,
angry dab of her fingers at her wet eyes, she fell to rearranging the
vases and photographs on the mantel."Miss Maggie, I've got to face this thing out, of course.Even if I
had--made a botch of things at the very start, it didn't help any
to--to run away, as I did.It was only
because I--I--But never mind that.I'm coming now straight to the
point.Miss Maggie, will you--marry me?"The photograph in Miss Maggie's hand fell face down on the shelf.Miss
Maggie's fingers caught the edge of the mantel in a convulsive grip.A
swift glance in the mirror before her disclosed Mr.Smith's face just
over her shoulder, earnest, pleading, and still very white.She dropped
her gaze, and turned half away.She tried to speak, but only a half-choking little
breath came."Miss Maggie, please don't say no--yet.Let me--explain--about how I
came here, and all that.But first, before I do that, let me tell you
how--how I love you--how I have loved you all these long months.I
THINK I loved you from the first time I saw you.Whatever comes, I want
you to know that.And if you could care for me a little--just a little,
I'm sure I could make it more--in time, so you would marry me.Don't you believe I'd try to make you happy--dear?""Yes, oh, yes," murmured Miss Maggie, still with her head turned away.Then all you've got to say is that you'll let me try.Why, until I came here to this little house, I
didn't know what living, real living, was.And I HAVE been, just as
you said, a selfish old thing."Miss Maggie, with a start of surprise, faced the image in the mirror;
but Mr.Smith was looking at her, not at her reflection, so she did not
meet his ayes."Why, I never--" she stammered."Yes, you did, a minute ago.Oh, of course you
didn't realize--everything, and perhaps you wouldn't have said it if
you'd known.But you said it--and you meant it, and I'm glad you said
it.And, dear little woman, don't you see?That's only another reason
why you should say yes.You can show me how not to be selfish."Smith, I--I-" stammered Miss Maggie, still with puzzled eyes.You can show me how to make life really worth while, for
me, and for--for lots of others And NOW I have some one to care for.And, oh, little woman, I--I care so much, it can't be that you--you
don't care--any!"Miss Maggie caught her breath and turned away again.The red crept up Miss Maggie's neck to her forehead but still she was
silent."If I could only see your eyes," pleaded the man.Then, suddenly, he
saw Miss Maggie's face in the mirror.The next moment Miss Maggie
herself turned a little, and in the mirror their eyes met--and in the
mirror Mr."You DO care--a LITTLE!"he
breathed, as he took her in his arms.Miss Maggie shook her head vigorously against his
coat-collar."I care--a GREAT DEAL," whispered Miss Maggie to the coat-collar, with
shameless emphasis.triumphed the man, bestowing a rapturous kiss on the
tip of a small pink ear--the nearest point to Miss Maggie's lips that
was available, until, with tender determination, he turned her face to
his.A moment later, blushing rosily, Miss Maggie drew herself away."There, we've been quite silly enough--old folks like us."Love is never silly--not real love like ours.Besides,
we're only as old as we feel.I've
lost--YEARS since this morning.And you know I'm just beginning to
live--really live, anyway!"I'm afraid you act it," said Miss Maggie, with mock severity."YOU would--if you'd been through what _I_ have," retorted Mr."And when I think what a botch I made of it, to
begin with--You see, I didn't mean to start off with that, first thing;
and I was so afraid that--that even if you did care for John Smith, you
wouldn't for me--just at first.At arms' length he
held her off, his hands on her shoulders.His happy eyes searching her
face saw the dawn of the dazed, question."Wouldn't care for YOU if I did for John Smith!she demanded, her eyes slowly sweeping him
from head to foot and back again.Instinctively his tongue went back to the old manner of
address, but his hands still held her shoulders."You don't mean--you
can't mean that--that you didn't understand--that you DON'T understand
that I am--Oh, good Heavens!Well, I have made a mess of it this time,"
he groaned.Releasing his hold on her shoulders, he turned and began to
tramp up and down the room."Nice little John-Alden-Miles-Standish
affair this is now, upon my word!Miss Maggie, have I got to--to
propose to you all over again for--for another man, now?"I--I don't think I understand you.""Then you don't know--you didn't understand a few minutes ago, when
I--I spoke first, when I asked you about--about those twenty millions--"

She lifted her hand quickly, pleadingly.Smith, please, don't let's bring money into it at all.I don't
care--I don't care a bit if you haven't got any money.""If I HAVEN'T got any money!"Oh, yes, I know, I said I loved money."The rich red came back to
her face in a flood."But I didn't mean--And it's just as much of a
test and an opportunity when you DON'T have money--more so, if
anything.I never thought of--of how you
might take it--as if I WANTED it.Oh, can't
you--understand?""And I
thought I'd given myself away!He came to her and stood
close, but he did not offer to touch her."I thought, after I'd said
what I did about--about those twenty millions that you understood--that
you knew I was--Stanley Fulton himself."Miss Maggie stood motionless, her eyes looking
straight into his, amazed incredulous.Maggie, don't look at me
like that.She was backing away now, slowly, step by step.Anger, almost loathing,
had taken the place of the amazement and incredulity in her eyes.But--" "And you've been here all these months--yes,
years--under a false name, pretending to be what you weren't--talking
to us, eating at our tables, winning our confidence, letting us talk to
you about yourself, even pretending that--Oh, how could you?""Maggie, dearest," he begged, springing toward her, "if you'll only let
me--"

But she stopped him peremptorily, drawing herself to her full height."I am NOT your dearest," she flamed angrily."I did not give my
love--to YOU."I gave it to John Smith--gentleman, I supposed.A man--poor, yes,
I believed him poor; but a man who at least had a right to his NAME!Stanley G. Fulton, spy, trickster, who makes life
itself a masquerade for SPORT!Stanley G. Fulton,
and--I do not wish to."The words ended in a sound very like a sob; but
Miss Maggie, with her head still high, turned her back and walked to
the window.The man, apparently stunned for a moment, stood watching her, his eyes
grieved, dismayed, hopeless.Then, white-faced, he turned and walked
toward the door.With his hand almost on the knob he slowly wheeled
about and faced the woman again.He hesitated visibly, then in a dull,
lifeless voice he began to speak."Miss Maggie, before John Smith steps entirely out of your life, he
would like to say just this, please, not on justification, but on
explanation of----of Stanley G. Fulton.Fulton did not intend to be a
spy, or a trickster, or to make life a masquerade for--sport.He was a
lonely old man--he felt old.True, he had no
one to care for, but--he had no one to care for HIM, either.He did have a great deal of money--more than he knew what
to do with.Oh, he tried--various ways of spending it.They resulted, chiefly,
in showing him that he wasn't--as wise as he might be in that line,
perhaps."At the window Miss Maggie still stood,
with her back turned as before."The time came, finally," resumed the man, "when Fulton began to wonder
what would become of his millions when he was done with them.He had a
feeling that he would like to will a good share of them to some of his
own kin; but he had no nearer relatives than some cousins back East,
in--Hillerton."Miss Maggie at the window drew in her breath, and held it suspended,
letting it out slowly."He didn't know anything about these cousins," went on the man dully,
wearily, "and he got to wondering what they would do with the money.I
think he felt, as you said to-day that you feel, that one must know how
to spend five dollars if one would get the best out of five thousand.So Fulton felt that, before he gave a man fifteen or twenty millions,
he would like to know--what he would probably do with them.He had seen
so many cases where sudden great wealth had brought--great sorrow."And so then he fixed up a little scheme; he would give each one of
these three cousins of his a hundred thousand dollars apiece, and then,
unknown to them, he would get acquainted with them, and see which of
them would be likely to make the best use of those twenty millions.It
was a silly scheme, of course,--a silly, absurd foolishness from
beginning to end.It--"

He did not finish his sentence.There was a rush of swift feet, a swish
of skirts, then full upon him there fell a whirlwind of sobs, clinging
arms, and incoherent ejaculations."It wasn't silly--it wasn't silly.Oh, I think it was--WONDERFUL!And
I--I'm so ASHAMED!"Later--very much later, when something like lucid coherence had become
an attribute of their conversation, as they sat together upon the old
sofa, the man drew a long breath and said:--

"Then I'm quite forgiven?""And you consider yourself engaged to BOTH John Smith and Stanley G."It sounds pretty bad, but--yes," blushed Miss Maggie."And you must love Stanley G. Fulton just exactly as well--no, a little
better, than you did John Smith.""I'll--try to--if he's as lovable."Miss Maggie's head was at a saucy
tilt."He'll try to be; but--it won't be all play, you know, for you.You've
got to tell him what to do with those twenty millions.By the way, what
WILL you do with them?"Fulton, you HAVE got--And
I forgot all about--those twenty millions."They belong to
Fulton, if you please.Furthermore, CAN'T you call me anything but that
abominable 'Mr.You might--er--abbreviate
it to--er--' Stan,' now.""Perhaps so--but I shan't," laughed Miss Maggie,--"not yet.You may be
thankful I have wits enough left to call you anything--after becoming
engaged to two men all at once.""And with having the responsibility of spending twenty millions, too.""Oh, we can do so much with that money!Why, only think what is
needed right HERE--better milk for the babies, and a community house,
and the streets cleaner, and a new carpet for the church, and a new
hospital with--"

"But, see here, aren't you going to spend some of that money on
yourself?"I'm going to Egypt, and China, and
Japan--with you, of course; and books--oh, you never saw such a lot of
books as I shall buy.And--oh, I'll spend heaps on just my selfish
self--you see if I don't!But, first,--oh, there are so many things
that I've so wanted to do, and it's just come over me this minute that
NOW I can do them!And you KNOW how Hillerton needs a new hospital.""And I want to build a store
and run it so the girls can LIVE, and a factory, too, and decent homes
for the workmen, and a big market, where they can get their food at
cost; and there's the playground for the children, and--"

But Mr.Smith was laughing, and lifting both hands in mock despair."Look here," he challenged, "I THOUGHT you were marrying ME, but--ARE
you marrying me or that confounded money?""Yes, I know; but you see--" She stopped short.Suddenly she laughed again, and threw into his eyes a look so merry, so
whimsical, so altogether challenging, that he demanded:--

"Well, what is it now?""Oh, it's so good, I have--half a mind to tell you."Miss Maggie had left the sofa, and was standing, as if half-poised for
flight, midway to the door."I think--yes, I will tell you," she nodded, her cheeks very pink; "but
I wanted to be--over here to tell it."Do you remember those letters I got awhile ago,
and the call from the Boston; lawyer, that I--I wouldn't tell you
about?""Well; you know you--you thought they--they had something to do
with--my money; that I--I'd lost some.""Well, they--they did have something to do--with money.""Oh, why wouldn't you tell me
then--and let me help you some way?"She shook her head nervously and backed nearer the door.If you don't--I won't tell you.""Well, as I said, it did have something to do--with my money; but just
now, when you asked me if I--I was marrying you or your money--"

"But I was in fun--you know I was in fun!""Oh, yes, I knew that," nodded Miss Maggie."But it--it made me laugh
and remember--the letters.You see, they weren't as you thought.They
didn't tell me of--of money lost.That father's Cousin George in Alaska had died and left me--fifty
thousand dollars.""But, my dear woman, why in Heaven's name wouldn't you tell me that?""You see, I thought
you were poor--very poor, and I--I wouldn't even own up to it myself,
but I knew, in my heart, that I was afraid, if you heard I had this
money, you wouldn't--you wouldn't--ask me to--to--"

She was blushing so adorably now that the man understood and leaped to
his feet."Maggie, you--darling!"But the door had shut--Miss Maggie had fled.CHAPTER XXIV

THAT MISERABLE MONEY


In the evening, after the Martin girls had gone to their rooms, Miss
Maggie and Mr."Of course," he began with a sigh, "I'm really not out of the woods at
all.Blissfully happy as I am, I'm really deeper in the woods than
ever, for now I've got you there with me, to look out for.However
successfully John Smith might dematerialize into nothingness--Maggie
Duff can't.""No, I know she can't," admitted Miss Maggie soberly."Yet if she marries John Smith she'll have to--and if she doesn't marry
him, how's Stanley G. Fulton going to do his courting?Smith, you'll HAVE to tell them--who you are.You'll have to tell them
right away."The man made a playfully wry face."I shall be glad," he observed, "when I shan't have to be held off at
the end of a 'Mr.'!However, we'll let that pass--until we settle the
other matter.Have you given any thought as to HOW I'm going to tell
Cousin Frank and Cousin James and Cousin Flora that I am Stanley G."No--except that you must do it," she answered decidedly."I don't
think you ought to deceive them another minute--not another minute.""And had you thought--as to
what would happen when I did tell them?""Why, n-no, not particularly, except that--that they naturally wouldn't
like it, at first, and that you'd have to explain--just as you did to
me--why you did it.""And do you think they'll like it any better--when I do explain?Miss Maggie meditated; then, a little tremulously she drew in her
breath."Why, you'd have to tell them that--that you did it for a test,
wouldn't you?""And they'd know--they couldn't help knowing--that they had failed to
meet it adequately."And would that help matters any--make things any happier, all
around?""No--oh, no," she frowned despairingly."Would it do anybody any REAL good, now?"N-no," she admitted reluctantly, "except that--that you'd be doing
right."And another thing--aside from the
mortification, dismay, and anger of my good cousins, have you thought
what I'd be bringing on you?"In less than half a dozen hours after the Blaisdells knew that
Mr.John Smith was Stanley G. Fulton, Hillerton would know it.And in
less than half a dozen more hours, Boston, New York, Chicago,--to say
nothing of a dozen lesser cities,--would know it--if there didn't
happen to be anything bigger on foot.Headlines an inch high would
proclaim the discovery of the missing Stanley G. Fulton, and the fine
print below would tell everything that happened, and a great deal that
didn't happen, in the carrying-out of the eccentric multi-millionaire's
extraordinary scheme of testing his relatives with a hundred thousand
dollars apiece to find a suitable heir.Your picture would adorn the
front page of the yellowest of yellow journals, and--"

"MY picture!"Oh, yes, yes," smiled the man imperturbably.Aren't you the affianced bride of Mr.I can see them
now: 'In Search of an Heir and Finds a Wife.'--'Charming Miss Maggie
Duff Falls in Love with Plain John Smith,' and--"

"Oh, no, no," moaned Miss Maggie, shrinking back as if already the
lurid headlines were staring her in the face."Oh, well, it might not be so bad as that, of course.Undoubtedly there are elements for a pretty good story in the
case, and some man, with nothing more important to write up, is bound
to make the most of it somewhere.There's
sure to be unpleasant publicity, my dear, if the truth once leaks out.""But what--what HAD you planned to do?""Well, I HAD planned something like this: pretty quick, now, Mr.Smith
was to announce the completion of his Blaisdell data, and, with
properly grateful farewells, take his departure from Hillerton.There he would go inland on some sort of a
simple expedition with a few native guides and carriers, but no other
companion.Somewhere in the wilderness he would shed his beard and his
name, and would emerge in his proper person of Stanley G. Fulton and
promptly take passage for the States.Of course, upon the arrival in
Chicago of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, there would be a slight flurry at his
appearance, and a few references to the hundred-thousand-dollar gifts
to the Eastern relatives, and sundry speculations as to the why and how
of the exploring trip.There would be various rumors and alleged
interviews; but Mr.Stanley G. Fulton never was noted for his
communicativeness, and, after a very short time, the whole thing would
be dismissed as probably another of the gentleman's well-known
eccentricities."Oh, I see," murmured Miss Maggie, in very evident relief."That would
be better--in some ways; only it does seem terrible not to--to tell
them who you are.""But we have just proved that to do that wouldn't bring happiness
anywhere, and would bring misery everywhere, haven't we?""Then why do it?--particularly as by not doing it I am not defrauding
anybody in the least.No; that part isn't worrying me a bit now--but
there is one point that does worry me very much."My scheme gets Stanley G. Fulton back to life and Chicago
very nicely; but it doesn't get Maggie Duff there worth a cent!Maggie
Duff can't marry Mr.John Smith in Hillerton and arrive in Chicago as
the wife of Stanley G. Fulton, can she?""N-no, but he--he can come back and get her--if he wants her."(Miss Maggie blushed all the more at the
method and the fervor of Mr.Smith, smiling at Miss
Maggie's hurried efforts to smooth her ruffled hair.He'd look altogether too much like--like Mr."But your beard will be gone--I wonder how I shall like you without a
beard."Smith laughed and threw up his hands with a doleful shrug."That's what comes of courting as one man and marrying as another," he
groaned.Then, sternly: "I'll warn you right now, Maggie Duff, that
Stanley G. Fulton is going to be awfully jealous of John Smith if you
don't look out.""He should have thought of that before," retorted Miss Maggie, her eyes
mischievous."But, tell me, wouldn't you EVER dare to come--in your
proper person?""Never!--or, at least, not for some time.The beard would be gone, to
be sure; but there'd be all the rest to tattle--eyes, voice, size,
manner, walk--everything; and smoked glasses couldn't cover all that,
you know.They'd only result
in making me look more like John Smith than ever.John Smith, you
remember, wore smoked glasses for some time to hide Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton from the ubiquitous reporter.Stanley G. Fulton can't
come to Hillerton.So, as Mahomet can't go to the mountain, the
mountain must come to Mahomet."Miss Maggie's eyes were growing dangerously mutinous."That you will have to come to Chicago--yes.""I love you with your head tilted that way."(Miss Maggie promptly
tilted it the other.)"Or that, either, for that matter," continued Mr."However, speaking of courting--Mr.Fulton will do
that, all right, and endeavor to leave nothing lacking, either as to
quantity or quality.Haven't you got some friend that you can visit?"Miss Maggie's answer was prompt and emphatic--too prompt and too
emphatic for unquestioning acceptance."Oh, yes, you have," asserted the man cheerfully."I don't know her
name--but she's there.She's Waving a red flag from your face this
minute!Well, turn your head away, if you like--if you can
listen better that way," he went on tranquilly paying no attention to
her little gasp."Well, all you have to do is to write the lady you're
coming, and go.Stanley G. Fulton will find
a way to meet her.Then he'll call and meet
you--and be so pleased to see you!There'll be a
regular whirlwind courtship then--calls, dinners, theaters, candy,
books, flowers!You'll be immensely surprised, of course, but you'll accept.Then we'll
get married," he finished with a deep sigh of satisfaction."Say, CAN'T you call me anything--" he began wrathfully, but
interrupted himself."However, it's better that you don't, after all.But you wait
till you meet Mr.Now, what's her name,
and where does she live?"Miss Maggie laughed in spite of herself, as she said severely: "Her
name, indeed!Stanley G. Fulton is so in the habit of
having his own way that he forgets he is still Mr.However,
there IS an old schoolmate," she acknowledged demurely.Now, write her at once, and tell her you're
coming.""But she--she may not be there."I think you'd
better plan to go pretty soon after I go to South America.Stanley G. Fulton arrives in Chicago and can write
the news back here to Hillerton.Oh, they'll get it in the papers, in
time, of course; but I think it had better come from you first.You
see--the reappearance on this earth of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton is going
to be of--of some moment to them, you know.Hattie, for
instance, who is counting on the rest of the money next November.""Yes, I know, it will mean a good deal to them, of course.Still, I
don't believe Hattie is really expecting the money.At any rate, she
hasn't said anything about it very lately--perhaps because she's been
too busy bemoaning the pass the present money has brought them to.""No, no--I didn't mean to bring that up," apologized Miss Maggie
quickly, with an apprehensive glance into his face."And it wasn't
miserable money a bit!Besides, Hattie has--has learned her lesson, I'm
sure, and she'll do altogether differently in the new home.Smith, am I never to--to come back here?"Indeed we can--some time, by and by, when all this has blown over, and
they've forgotten how Mr.Meanwhile, you can come alone--a VERY little.I shan't let you leave me
very much.But I understand; you'll have to come to see your friends.Besides, there are all those playgrounds for the babies and cleaner
milk for the streets, and--"

"Cleaner milk for the streets, indeed!"Oh, yes, it WAS the milk for the babies, wasn't it?""Well, however that may be you'll have to come back to
superintend all those things you've been wanting to do so long.But"--his face grew a little wistful--"you don't want to spend too much
time here.You know--Chicago has a few babies that need cleaner milk."Her face grew softly luminous as it had grown
earlier in the afternoon."So you can bestow some of your charity there; and--"

"It isn't charity," she interrupted with suddenly flashing eyes."Oh,
how I hate that word--the way it's used, I mean.Of course, the real
charity means love.I suppose it was LOVE that made John
Daly give one hundred dollars to the Pension Fund Fair--after he'd
jewed it out of those poor girls behind his counters!Morse
went around everywhere telling how kind dear Mr.Daly was to give so
much to charity!Nobody wants charity--except a few lazy
rascals like those beggars of Flora's!And
if half the world gave the other half its rights there wouldn't BE any
charity, I believe."Smith
held up both hands in mock terror."I shall be petitioning her for my
bread and butter, yet!"Smith, when I think of all that
money"--her eyes began to shine again--"and of what we can do with it,
I--I just can't believe it's so!""But you aren't expecting that twenty millions are going to right all
the wrongs in the world, are you?""No, oh, no; but we can help SOME that we know about.But it isn't that
I just want to GIVE, you know.We must get behind things--to the
causes.We must--"

"We must make the Mr.Dalys pay more to their girls before they pay
anything to pension funds, eh?"Smith, as Miss Maggie came
to a breathless pause."Oh, can't you SEE what we can
do--with that twenty million dollars?"Smith, his gaze on Miss Maggie's flushed cheeks and shining eyes,
smiled tenderly."I see--that I'm being married for my money--after all!"sniffed Miss Maggie, so altogether bewitchingly that Mr.Smith
gave her a rapturous kiss.JOHN SMITH


Early in July Mr.He made a
farewell call upon each of the Blaisdell families, and thanked them
heartily for all their kindness in assisting him with his Blaisdell
book.The Blaisdells, one and all, said they were very sorry to have him go.Miss Flora frankly wiped her eyes, and told Mr.Smith she could never,
never thank him enough for what he had done for her.Mellicent, too,
with shy eyes averted, told him she should never forget what he had
done for her--and for Donald.James and Flora and Frank--and even Jane!--said that they would like to
have one of the Blaisdell books, when they were published, to hand down
in the family.Flora took out her purse and said that she would pay for
hers now; but Mr.Smith hastily, and with some evident embarrassment,
refused the money, saying that he could not tell yet what the price of
the book would be.All the Blaisdells, except Frank, Fred, and Bessie, went to the station
to see Mr.They told him he was
just like one of the family, anyway, and they declared they hoped he
would come back soon.Frank telephoned him that he would have gone,
too, if he had not had so much to do at the store.Smith seemed pleased at all this attention--he seemed, indeed,
quite touched; but he seemed also embarrassed--in fact, he seemed often
embarrassed during those last few days at Hillerton.Miss Maggie Duff did not go to the station to see Mr.Miss
Flora, on her way home, stopped at the Duff cottage and reproached Miss
Maggie for the delinquency."All the rest of us did,
'most."You're Blaisdells--but I'm not, you know.""You're just as good as one, Maggie Duff!Besides, hasn't that man
boarded here for over a year, and paid you good money, too?""Why, y-yes, of course.""Well, then, I don't think it would have hurt you any to show him this
last little attention.He'll think you don't like him, or--or are mad
about something, when all the rest of us went.""Well, then, if--Why, Maggie Duff, you're BLUSHING!"she broke off,
peering into Miss Maggie's face in a way that did not tend to lessen
the unmistakable color that was creeping to her forehead.I declare, if you were twenty years younger, and I didn't
know better, I should say that--" She stopped abruptly, then plunged
on, her countenance suddenly alight with a new idea."NOW I know why
you didn't go to the station, Maggie Duff!That man proposed to you,
and you refused him!"gasped Miss Maggie, her face scarlet.Hattie always said it would be a match--from
the very first, when he came here to your house."gasped Miss Maggie again, looking about her very much as if
she were meditating flight."Well, she did--but I didn't believe it.You refused
him--now, didn't you?"Miss Maggie caught her breath a little convulsively."Well, I suppose you didn't,
then, if you say so.And I don't need to ask if you accepted him.You
didn't, of course, or you'd have been there to see him off.And he
wouldn't have gone then, anyway, probably.So he didn't ask you, I
suppose.Well, I never did believe, like Hattie did, that--"

"Flora," interrupted Miss Maggie desperately, "WILL you stop talking in
that absurd way?Listen, I did not care to go to the station to-day.I'm going to see my old classmate, Nellie
Maynard--Mrs.It's lovely, of course, only--only I--I'm so
surprised!"All the more reason why I should, then.It's time I did," smiled Miss
Maggie.And I do hope you can DO it, and
that it won't peter out at the last minute, same's most of your good
times do.And you've had such a hard life--and your
boarder leaving, too!That'll make a lot of difference in your
pocketbook, won't it?But, Maggie, you'll have to have some new
clothes."I've got to have--oh,
lots of things."And, Maggie,"--Miss Flora's face grew
eager,--"please, PLEASE, won't you let me help you a little--about
those clothes?And get some nice ones--some real nice ones, for once.Please, Maggie, there's a good girl!""Thank you, no, dear," refused Miss Maggie, shaking her head with a
smile."But I appreciate your kindness just the same--indeed, I do!""If you wouldn't be so horrid proud," pouted Miss Flora.I was going to tell
you soon, anyway, and I'll tell it now.I HAVE money, dear,--lots of it
now."Father's Cousin George died two months ago.""Yes; and to father's daughter he left--fifty thousand dollars."But he loved father, you know, years ago,
and father loved him.""But had you ever heard from him--late years?"Father was very angry because he went to Alaska in the first
place, you know, and they haven't ever written very often."They sent me a thousand--just for pin money, they
said.The lawyer's written several times, and he's been here once.I
believe it's all to come next month.""Oh, I'm so glad, Maggie," breathed Flora.I don't know
of anybody I'd rather see take a little comfort in life than you!"At the door, fifteen minutes later, Miss Flora said again how glad she
was; but she added wistfully:--

"I'm sure I don't know, though, what I'm going to do all summer without
you.Just think how lonesome we'll be--you gone to Chicago, Hattie and
Jim and all their family moved to Plainville, and even Mr.And I think we're going to miss Mr."Indeed, I do think he was a very nice man!""Now, Flora, I shall want you to go shopping with me lots.And Miss Flora, eagerly entering into Miss Maggie's discussion of
frills and flounces, failed to notice that Miss Maggie had dropped the
subject of Mr.Hillerton had much to talk about during those summer days.Smith's
going had created a mild discussion--the "ancestor feller" was well
known and well liked in the town.But even his departure did not arouse
the interest that was bestowed upon the removal of the James Blaisdells
to Plainville; and this, in turn, did not cause so great an excitement
as did the news that Miss Maggie Duff had inherited fifty thousand
dollars and had gone to Chicago to spend it.And the fact that nearly
all who heard this promptly declared that they hoped she WOULD spend a
good share of it--in Chicago, or elsewhere--on herself, showed pretty
well just where Miss Maggie Duff stood in the hearts of Hillerton.It was early in September that Miss Flora had the letter from Miss
Maggie.Not but that she had received letters from Miss Maggie before,
but that the contents of this one made it at once, to all the
Blaisdells, "the letter."Miss Flora began to read it, gave a little cry, and sprang to her feet.Standing, her breath suspended, she finished it.Five minutes later,
gloves half on and hat askew, she was hurrying across the common to her
brother Frank's home."Jane, Jane," she panted, as soon as she found her sister-in-law."I've
had a letter from Maggie.She's just been living on having that money.And us, with all we've
lost, too!But, then, maybe we wouldn't have got it, anyway.And I never thought to bring it," ejaculated Miss Flora
vexedly.She said it would be in all the Eastern papers right away,
of course, but she wanted to tell us first, so we wouldn't be so
surprised.Walked into his lawyer's office without a
telegram, or anything.Tyndall
brought home the news that night in an 'Extra'; but that's all it
told--just that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the multi-millionaire who
disappeared nearly two years ago on an exploring trip to South America,
had come back alive and well.Then it told all about the two letters he
left, and the money he left to us, and all that, Maggie said; and it
talked a lot about how lucky it was that he got back just in time
before the other letter had to be opened next November.But it didn't
say any more about his trip, or anything.The morning papers will have
more, Maggie said, probably.""Yes, of course, of course," nodded Jane, rolling the corner of her
upper apron nervously.(Since the forty-thousand-dollar loss Jane had
gone back to her old habit of wearing two aprons.)"Where DO you
suppose he's been all this time?"Maggie said it wasn't known--that the paper didn't say.It was an
'Extra' anyway, and it just got in the bare news of his return.Besides, Maggie'll
write again about it, I'm sure.I'm so glad she's having
such a good time!""Yes, of course, of course," nodded Jane again nervously."Say, Flora,
I wonder--do you suppose WE'LL ever hear from him?He left us all that
money--he knows that, of course.He can't ask for it back--the lawyer
said he couldn't do that!But, I wonder--do you
suppose we ought to write him and--and thank him?"exclaimed Miss Flora, aghast.I'd be
scared to death to do such a thing as that.Oh, you don't think we've
got to do THAT?"We'd want to do what was right and proper, of course.But I don't see--" She paused helplessly.Miss Flora gave a sudden hysterical little laugh."Well, I don't see how we're going to find out what's proper, in this
case," she giggled."We can't write to a magazine, same as I did when I
wanted to know how to answer invitations and fix my knives and forks on
the table.We CAN'T write to them, 'cause nothing like this ever
happened before, and they wouldn't know what to say.How'd we look
writing, 'Please, dear Editor, when a man wills you a hundred thousand
dollars and then comes to life again, is it proper or not proper to
write and thank him?'They'd think we was crazy, and they'd have reason
to!For my part, I--"

The telephone bell rang sharply, and Jane rose to answer it.When she came back she was even more excited.she questioned, as Miss
Flora got hastily to her feet.I left everything just as it was and ran, when I got the
letter.I'll get a paper myself on the way home.I'm going to call up
Hattie, too, on the long distance.My, it's'most as exciting as it was
when it first came,--the money, I mean,--isn't it?"panted Miss Flora
as she hurried away.The Blaisdells bought many papers during the next few days.But even by
the time that the Stanley G. Fulton sensation had dwindled to a short
paragraph in an obscure corner of a middle page, they (and the public
in general) were really little the wiser, except for these bare facts:--

Stanley G. Fulton had arrived at a South American hotel, from the
interior, had registered as S. Fulton, frankly to avoid publicity, and
had taken immediate passage to New York.Arriving at New York, still to
avoid publicity, he had not telegraphed his attorneys, but had taken
the sleeper for Chicago, and had fortunately not met any one who
recognized him until his arrival in that city.He had brought home
several fine specimens of Incan textiles and potteries: and he declared
that he had had a very enjoyable and profitable trip.He did not care to talk of his experiences, he said.For a time, of course, his return was made much of.Fake interviews and
rumors of threatened death and disaster in impenetrable jungles made
frequent appearance; but in an incredibly short time the flame of
interest died from want of fuel to feed upon; and, as Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton himself had once predicted, the matter was soon dismissed as
merely another of the multi-millionaire's well-known eccentricities.All of this the Blaisdells heard from Miss Maggie in addition to seeing
it in the newspapers.But very soon, from Miss Maggie, they began to
learn more.Before a fortnight had passed, Miss Flora received another
letter from Chicago that sent her flying as before to her sister-in-law."Jane, Jane, Maggie's MET HIM!"she cried, breathlessly bursting into
the kitchen where Jane was paring the apples that she would not trust
to the maid's more wasteful knife.With a hasty twirl of a now reckless knife, Jane finished the
last apple, set the pan on the table before the maid, and hurried her
visitor into the living-room."Now, tell me quick--what did she say?"Yes--yes--everything," nodded Miss Flora, sinking into a chair."She
liked him real well, she said and he knows all about that she belongs
to us.Oh, I hope she didn't
tell him about--Fred!""And that awful gold-mine stock," moaned Jane."But she wouldn't--I
know she wouldn't!""Of course she wouldn't," cried Miss Flora."'Tisn't like Maggie one
bit!John went back to the kitchen.She'd only tell the nice things, I'm sure.And, of course, she'd
tell him how pleased we were with the money!"And to think she's met him--really met
him!"She turned an excited face to her
daughter, who had just entered the room.Aunt
Flora's just had a letter from Aunt Maggie, and she's met Mr.Fulton--actually TALKED with him!"Yes, he's real nice, your Aunt
Maggie says, and she likes him very much."Tyndall brought him home
one night and introduced him to his wife and Maggie; and since then
he's been very nice to them.He's taken them out in his automobile, and
taken them to the theater twice.""That's because she belongs to us, of course," nodded Jane wisely."Yes, I suppose so," agreed Flora."And I think it's very kind of him.""_I_ think he does it because he
WANTS to.I'll warrant she's
nicer and sweeter and--and, yes, PRETTIER than lots of those old
Chicago women.Aunt Maggie looked positively HANDSOME that day she left
here last July.Probably he LIKES
to take her to places.Anyhow, I'm glad she's having one good time
before she dies.""Yes, so am I, my dear."I only wish he'd marry her and--and give her a good time all her
life," avowed Mellicent, lifting her chin.She's good enough for him," bridled Mellicent."Aunt
Maggie's good enough for anybody!""Maggie's a saint--if
ever there was one.""Yes, but I shouldn't call her a MARRYING saint," smiled Jane."Well, I don't know about that," frowned Miss Flora thoughtfully."Hattie always declared there'd be a match between her and Mr."Well, then, I
shall stick to my original statement that Maggie Duff is a saint, all
right, but not a marrying one--unless some one marries her now for her
money, of course.""As if Aunt Maggie'd stand for that!""Besides, she
wouldn't have to!Aunt Maggie's good enough to be married for herself.""There, there, child, just because you are a love-sick little piece of
romance just now, you needn't think everybody else is," her mother
reproved her a little sharply.But Mellicent only laughed merrily as she disappeared into her own room.Smith, I wonder where he is, and if he'll ever come
back here," mused Miss Flora, aloud.He was a very
nice man, and I liked him.""Goodness, Flora, YOU aren't, getting romantic, too, are you?"teased
her sister-in-law.ejaculated Miss Flora sharply, buttoning up her coat."I'm no more romantic than--than poor Maggie herself is!"Two weeks later, to a day, came Miss Maggie's letter announcing her
engagement to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, and saying that she was to be
married in Chicago before Christmas.CHAPTER XXVI

REENTER MR.STANLEY G. FULTON


In the library of Mrs.Stanley G.
Fulton was impatiently awaiting the appearance of Miss Maggie Duff.In
a minute she came in, looking charmingly youthful in her new,
well-fitting frock.The man, quickly on his feet at her entrance, gave her a lover's ardent
kiss; but almost instantly he held her off at arms' length."Why, dearest, what's the matter?""You look as if--if something had happened--not exactly a bad
something, but--What is it?""That's one of the very nicest things about you, Mr.Stanley-G.-Fulton-John-Smith," she sighed, nestling comfortably into
the curve of his arm, as they sat down on the divan;--"that you NOTICE
things so.And it seems so good to me to have somebody--NOTICE."And to think of all these years I've wasted!""Oh, but I shan't be lonely any more now.John went back to the hallway.And, listen--I'll tell you
what made me look so funny.You know I
wrote them--about my coming marriage.""I believe--I'll let you read the letter for yourself, Stanley.It
tells some things, toward the end that I think you'll like to know,"
she said, a little hesitatingly, as she held out the letter she had
brought into the room with her.I'd like to read it," cried Fulton, whisking the closely written
sheets from the envelope.MY DEAR MAGGIE (Flora had written): Well, mercy me, you have given us a
surprise this time, and no mistake!Yet we're all real glad, Maggie,
and we hope you'll be awfully happy.You've had such an awfully hard time all your life!Well, when your letter came, we were just going out to Jim's for an
old-fashioned Thanksgiving dinner, so I took it along with me and read
it to them all.I kept it till we were all together, too, though I most
bursted with the news all the way out.Well, you ought to have heard their tongues wag!They were all struck
dumb first, for a minute, all except Mellicent.She spoke up the very
first thing, and clapped her hands.I knew Aunt Maggie was good
enough for anybody!"To explain that I'll have to go back a little.We were talking one day
about you--Jane and Mellicent and me--and we said you were a saint,
only not a marrying saint.But Mellicent thought you were, and it seems
she was right.Oh, of course, we'd all thought once Mr.Smith might
take a fancy to you, but we never dreamed of such a thing as this--Mr.Sakes alive--I can hardly sense it yet!Jane, for a minute, forgot how rich he was, and spoke right up real
quick--"It's for her money, of course.I KNEW some one would marry her
for that fifty thousand dollars!"But she laughed then, right off, with
the rest of us, at the idea of a man worth twenty millions marrying
ANYBODY for fifty thousand dollars.Benny says there ain't any man alive good enough for his Aunt Maggie,
so if Mr.Fulton gets to being too highheaded sometimes, you can tell
him what Benny says.But we're all real pleased, honestly, Maggie, and of course we're
terribly excited.We're so sorry you're going to be married out there
in Chicago.Why can't you make him come to Hillerton?Jane says she'd
be glad to make a real nice wedding for you--and when Jane says a thing
like that, you can know how much she's really saying, for Jane's
feeling awfully poor these days, since they lost all that money, you
know.Fulton, too--"Cousin Stanley," as Hattie
always calls him.Please give him our congratulations--but there, that
sounds funny, doesn't it?(But the etiquette editors in the magazines
say we must always give best wishes to the bride and congratulations to
the groom.)Only it seems funny here, to congratulate that rich Mr.I didn't mean it that way, Maggie.I
declare, if that sentence wasn't 'way in the middle of this third page,
and so awfully hard for me to write, anyway, I'd tear up this sheet and
begin another.But, after all, you'll understand, I'm sure.You KNOW we
all think the world of you, Maggie, and that I didn't mean anything
against YOU.Fulton is--is such a big man, and
all--But you know what I meant.Well, anyway, if you can't come here to be married, we hope you'll
bring him here soon so we can see him, and see you, too.We miss you
awfully, Maggie,--truly we do, especially since Jim's folks went, and
with Mr.Smith gone, too, Jane and I are real lonesome.Jim and Hattie like real well where they are.They've got a real pretty
home, and they're the biggest folks in town, so Hattie doesn't have to
worry for fear she won't live quite so fine as her neighbors--though
really I think Hattie's got over that now a good deal.That awful thing
of Fred's sobered her a lot, and taught her who her real friends were,
and that money ain't everything.Fred is doing splendidly now, just as steady as a clock.It does my
soul good to see him and his father together.And Bessie--she isn't near so disagreeable and airy as she was.Hattie
took her out of that school and put her into another where she's
getting some real learning and less society and frills and dancing.Jim
is doing well, and I think Hattie's real happy.Oh, of course, when we
first heard that Mr.Fulton had got back, I think she was kind of
disappointed.You know she always did insist we were going to have the
rest of that money if he didn't show up.But she told me just
Thanksgiving Day that she didn't know but 't was just as well, after
all, that they didn't have the money, for maybe Fred'd go wrong again,
or it would strike Benny this time.Anyhow, however much money she had,
she said, she'd never let her children spend so much again, and she'd
found out money didn't bring happiness, always, anyway.Mellicent and Donald are going to be married next summer.Donald don't
get a very big salary yet, but Mellicent says she won't mind a bit
going back to economizing again, now that for once she's had all the
chocolates and pink dresses she wanted.What a funny girl she is--but
she's a dear girl, just the same, and she's settled down real sensible
now.She and Donald are as happy as can be, and even Jane likes Donald
real well now.Jane's gone back to her tidies and aprons and skimping on everything.She says she's got to, to make up that forty thousand dollars.But she
enjoys it, I believe.Honestly, she acts'most as happy trying to save
five cents as Frank does earning it in his old place behind the
counter.And that's saying a whole lot, as you know.Jane knows very
well she doesn't have to pinch that way.They've got lots of the money
left, and Frank's business is better than ever.You complain because I don't tell you anything about myself in my
letters, but there isn't anything to tell.I am well and happy, and
I've just thought up the nicest thing to do.Mary Hicks came home from
Boston sick last September, and she's been here at my house ever since.Her own home ain't no place for a sick person, you know, with all those
children, and they're awfully poor, too.She works in a department store and was all
played out, but she's picked up wonderfully here and is going back next
week.Well, she was telling me about a girl that works with her at the same
counter, and saying how she wished she had a place like this to go to
for a rest and change, so I'm going to do it--give them one, I mean,
she and the other girls.Mary says there are a dozen girls that she
knows right there that are half-sick, but would get well in a minute if
they only had a few weeks of rest and quiet and good food.So I'm going
to take them, two at a time, so they'll be company for each other.Mary
is going to fix it up for me down there, and pick out the girls, and
she says she knows the man who owns the store will be glad to let them
off, for they are all good help, and he's been afraid he'd lose them.He'd offered them a month off, besides their vacation, but they
couldn't take it, because they didn't have any place to go or money to
pay.Of course, that part will be all right now.And I'm so glad and
excited I don't know what to do.Oh, I do hope you'll tell Mr.Fulton
some time how happy he's made me, and how perfectly splendid that
money's been for me.Well, Maggie, this is a long letter, and I must close.Tell me all
about the new clothes you are getting, and I hope you will get a lot.Lovingly yours,

FLORA.Maggie Duff, for pity's sake, never, never tell that man
that I ever went into mourning for him and put flowers before his
picture.Fulton folded the letter and handed
it back to Miss Maggie."I didn't feel that I was betraying confidences--under the
circumstances," murmured Miss Maggie."And there was a good deal in the letter that I DID want you to see,"
added Miss Maggie."Hm-m; the congratulations, for one thing, of course," twinkled the
man."I wanted you to see how really, in the end, that money was not doing
so much harm, after all," asserted Miss Maggie, with some dignity,
shaking her head at him reprovingly."I thought you'd be GLAD, sir!"I'm so glad that, when I come to make my will now, I
shouldn't wonder if I remembered them all again--a little--that is, if
I have anything left to will," he teased shamelessly."Oh, by the way,
that makes me think.I've just been putting up a monument to John
Smith.""But, my dear Maggie, something was due the man," maintained Fulton,
reaching for a small flat parcel near him and placing it in Miss
Maggie's hands."But--oh, Stanley, how could you?"she shivered, her eyes on the words
the millionaire had penciled on the brown paper covering of the parcel.With obvious reluctance Miss Maggie loosened the paper covers and
peered within.In her hands lay a handsome brown leather volume with gold letters,
reading:--

     The Blaisdell Family
           By
        John Smith

"And you--did that?"I shall send a copy each to Frank and Jim and Miss Flora, of
course.Poor
man, it's the least I can do for him--and the most--unless--" He
hesitated with an unmistakable look of embarrassment."Well, unless--I let you take me to Hillerton one of these days and see
if--if Stanley G. Fulton, with your gracious help, can make peace for
John Smith with those--er--cousins of mine.You see, I still feel
confoundedly like that small boy at the keyhole, and I'd like--to open
that door!And, oh, Stanley, it's the one thing needed
to make me perfectly happy," she sighed blissfully.THE END









End of Project Gutenberg's Oh, Money!He was taken to the guillotine, and I was again left.... Joseph
Lebon, one of the vilest characters that ever existed, and who made the
streets of Arras run with blood, was my _suppleant_ as member of the
Convention for the Pas de Calais.When I was put out of the Convention
he came and took my place.When I was liberated from prison and voted
again into the Convention, he was sent to the same prison and took
my place there, and he was sent to the guillotine instead of me.He
supplied my place all the way through."One hundred and sixty-eight persons were taken out of the Luxembourg
in one night, and a hundred and sixty of them guillotined next day,
of which I knew I was to be one; and the manner I escaped that fate is
curious, and has all the appearance of accident.The room in which I
lodged was on the ground floor, and one of a long range of rooms under a
gallery, and the door of it opened outward and flat against the wall; so
that when it was open the inside of the door appeared outward, and the
contrary when it was shut.I had three comrades, fellow prisoners with
me, Joseph Vanhuile of Bruges, since president of the municipality of
that town, Michael and Robbins Bastini of Louvain.When persons by
scores and by hundreds were to be taken out of the prison for the
guillotine it was always done in the night, and those who performed that
office had a private mark or signal by which they knew what rooms to go
to, and what number to take.We, as I have-said, were four, and the door
of our room was marked, unobserved by us, with that number in chalk; but
it happened, if happening is the proper word, that the mark was put on
when the door was open and flat against the wall, and thereby came on
the inside when we shut it at night; and the destroying angel passed by
it."Paine did not hear of this chalk mark until afterwards.In his letter to
Washington he says:

"I had been imprisoned seven months, and the silence of the executive
part of the government of America (Mr.Washington) upon the case, and
upon every thing respecting me, was explanation enough to Robespierre
that he might proceed to extremities.A violent fever which had nearly
terminated my existence was, I believe, the circumstance that preserved
it.I was not in a condition to be removed, or to know of what was
passing, or of what had passed, for more than a month.It makes a blank
in my remembrance of life.The first thing I was informed of was the
fall of Robespierre."The probabilities are that the prison physician Marhaski, whom Paine
mentions with gratitude, was with him when the chalk mark was made,
and that there was some connivance in the matter.In the same letter he
says:

"From about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Robespierre,
July 29, (9th of Thermidor,) the state of things in the prisons was a
continued scene of horror.No man could count upon life for twenty-four
hours.To such a pitch of rage and suspicion were Robespierre and his
committee arrived, that it seemed as if they feared to leave a man to
live.Scarcely a night passed in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty
or more were not taken out of the prison, carried before a pretended
tribunal in the morning, and guillotined before night.One hundred and
sixty-nine were taken out of the Luxembourg one night in the month
of July, and one hundred and sixty of them guillotined.A list of two
hundred more, according to the report in the prison, was preparing a few
days before Robespierre fell.In this last list I have good reason to
believe I was included."To this Paine adds the memorandum for his accusation found in
Robespierre's note-book.Of course it was natural, especially with the
memorandum, to accept the Robespierre mythology of the time without
criticism.The massacres of July were not due to Robespierre, who during
that time was battling with the Committee of Public Safety, at whose
hands he fell on the 29th.At the close of June there was an alarm at
preparations for an insurrection in Luxembourg prison, which caused a
union of the Committee of Public Safety and the police, resulting in
indiscriminate slaughter of prisoners.Barrere, long after, apologized to him for
having signed "the warrant," by saying he felt himself in danger and
was obliged to do it Paine accepted the apology, and when Barrere
had returned to France, after banishment, Paine introduced him to the
English author, Lewis Goldsmith.* As Barrere did not sign the warrant
for Paine's imprisonment, it must have been a warrant for his death, or
for accusation at a moment when it was equivalent to a death sentence.Whatever danger Barrere had to fear, so great as to cause him to
sacrifice Paine, it was not from Robespierre; else it would not have
continued to keep Paine in prison three months after Robespierre's
death.* "Memoires de B. Barrere," t. i., p.Lewis Goldsmith was
     the author of "Crimes of the Cabinets."As Robespierre's memorandum was for a "decree of accusation" against
Paine, separately, which might not have gone against him, but possibly
have dragged to light the conspiracy against him, there would seem to be
no ground for connecting that "demand" with the warrant signed by a
Committee he did not attend.Paine had good cause for writing as he did in praise of "Forgetfulness."During the period in which he was unconscious with fever the horrors of
the prison reached their apogee.On June 19th the kindly gaoler, Benoit,
was removed and tried; he was acquitted but not restored.His place was
given to a cruel fellow named Gayard, who instituted a reign of terror
in the prison.There are many evidences that the good Benoit, so warmly remembered
by Paine, evaded the rigid police regulations as to communications of
prisoners with their friends outside, no doubt with precaution against
those of a political character.It is pleasant to record an instance
of this which was the means of bringing beautiful rays of light into
Paine's cell.Shortly before his arrest an English lady had called on
him, at his house in the Faubourg St.Denis, to ask his intervention in
behalf of an Englishman of rank who had been arrested.Paine had now,
however, fallen from power, and could not render the requested service.This lady was the last visitor who preceded the officers who
arrested him.But while he was in prison there was brought to him a
communication, in a lady's handwriting, signed "A little corner of the
World."So far as can be gathered, this letter was of a poetical
character, perhaps tinged with romance.It was followed by others, all
evidently meant to beguile the weary and fearful hours of a prisoner
whom she had little expectation of ever meeting again.Paine, by the aid
of Benoit, managed to answer his "contemplative correspondent," as he
called her, signing, "The Castle in the Air."These letters have never
seen the light, but the sweetness of this sympathy did, for many an
hour, bring into Paine's _oubliette_ the oblivion of grief described in
the letter on "Forgetfulness," sent to the lady after his liberation."Memory, like a beauty that is always present to hear herself
flattered, is flattered by every one.But the absent and silent goddess,
Forgetfulness, has no votaries, and is never thought of: yet we owe her
much.She is the goddess of ease, though not of pleasure.When the mind
is like a room hung with black, and every corner of it crowded with the
most horrid images imagination can create, this kind, speechless maid,
Forgetfulness, is following us night and day with her opium wand, and
gently touching first one and then another, benumbs them into rest, and
then glides away with the silence of a departing shadow."Paine was not forgotten by his old friends in France.So soon as the
excitement attending Robespierre's execution had calmed a little,
Lan-thenas (August 7th) sent Merlin de Thionville a copy of the "Age of
Reason," which he had translated, and made his appeal."I think it would be in the well-considered interest of the Republic,
since the fall of the tyrants we have overthrown, to re-examine the
motives of Thomas Paine's imprisonment.That re-examination is suggested
by too many and sensible grounds to be related in detail.Every friend
of liberty familiar with the history of our Revolution, and feeling the
necessity of repelling the slanders with which despots are loading it in
the eyes of nations, misleading them against us, will understand these
grounds.Should the Committee of Public Safety, having before it no
founded charge or suspicion against Thomas Paine, retain any scruples,
and think that from my occasional conversation with that foreigner, whom
the people's suffrage called to the national representation, and some
acquaintance with his language, I might perhaps throw light upon their
doubt, I would readily communicate to them all that I know about him.I
request Merlin de Thionville to submit these considerations to the
Committee."Merlin was now a leading member of the Committee.On the following day
Paine sent (in French) the following letters:

"Citizens, Representatives, and Members of the Committee of Public
Safety: I address you a copy of a letter which I have to-day written to
the Convention.The singular situation in which I find myself determines
me to address myself to the whole Convention, of which you are a part

"Thomas Paine.Maison d'Arret du Luxembourg, Le 19 Thermidor, l'an 2 de
la Republique, une et indivisible.""Citizen Representatives: If I should not express myself with the energy
I used formerly to do, you will attribute it to the very dangerous
illness I have suffered in the prison of the Luxembourg.For several
days I was insensible of my own existence; and though I am much
recovered, it is with exceeding great difficulty that I find power to
write you this letter."But before I proceed further, I request the Convention to observe: that
this is the first line that has come from me, either to the Convention,
or to any of the Committees, since my imprisonment,--which is
approaching to Eight months.--Ah, my friends, eight months' loss of
Liberty seems almost a life-time to a man who has been, as I have been,
the unceasing defender of Liberty for twenty years."I have now to inform the Convention of the reason of my not having
written before.It is a year ago that I had strong reason to believe
that Robespierre was my inveterate enemy, as he was the enemy of every
man of virtue and humanity.The address that was sent to the Convention
some time about last August from Arras, the native town of Robespierre,
I have always been informed was the work of that hypocrite and the
partizans he had in the place.The intention of that address was to
prepare the way for destroying me, by making the People declare (though
without assigning any reason) that I had lost their confidence; the
Address, however, failed of success, as it was immediately opposed by
a counter-address from St.But
the strange power that Robespierre, by the most consummate hypocrisy
and the most hardened cruelties, had obtained rendered any attempt on
my part to obtain justice not only useless but even dangerous; for it
is the nature of Tyranny always to strike a deeper blow when any attempt
has been made to repel a former one.This being my situation I submitted
with patience to the hardness of my fate and waited the event of
brighter days.I hope they are now arrived to the nation and to me."Citizens, when I left the United States in the year 1787, I promised to
all my friends that I would return to them the next year; but the hope
of seeing a Revolution happily established in France, that might serve
as a model to the rest of Europe, and the earnest and disinterested
desire of rendering every service in my power to promote it, induced me
to defer my return to that country, and to the society of my friends,
for more than seven years.This long sacrifice of private tranquillity,
especially after having gone through the fatigues and dangers of the
American Revolution which continued almost eight years, deserved a
better fate than the long imprisonment I have silently suffered.But it
is not the nation but a faction that has done me this injustice, and it
is to the national representation that I appeal against that injustice.Parties and Factions, various and numerous as they have been, I have
always avoided.My heart was devoted to all France, and the object to
which I applied myself was the Constitution.The Plan which I proposed
to the Committee, of which I was a member, is now in the hands of
Barrere, and it will speak for itself."It is perhaps proper that I inform you of the cause assigned in the
order for my imprisonment It is that I am 'a Foreigner'; whereas, the
_Foreigner_ thus imprisoned was invited into France by a decree of the
late national Assembly, and that in the hour of her greatest danger,
when invaded by Austrians and Prussians.He was, moreover, a citizen of
the United States of America, an ally of France, and not a subject of
any country in Europe, and consequently not within the intentions of
any of the decrees concerning Foreigners.But any excuse can be made to
serve the purpose of malignity when it is in power."I will not intrude on your time by offering any apology for the broken
and imperfect manner in which I have expressed myself.I request you to
accept it with the sincerity with which it comes from my heart; and I
conclude with wishing Fraternity and prosperity to France, and union and
happiness to her representatives."Citizens, I have now stated to you my situation, and I can have no
doubt but your justice will restore me to the Liberty of which I have
been deprived."Luxembourg, Thermidor 19th, 2d year of the French Republic, one and
indivisible."No doubt this touching letter would have been effectual had it reached
the Convention.But the Committee of Public Safety took care that no
whisper even of its existence should be heard.Paine's participation in
their fostered dogma, that _Robespierre le veut_ explained all crimes,
probably cost him three more months in prison.The lamb had confided its
appeal to the wolf.Barrere, Bil-laud-Varennes, and Collot d'Herbois,
by skilful use of the dead scapegoat, maintained their places on the
Committee until September 1st, and after that influenced its counsels.At the same time Morris, as we shall see, was keeping Monroe out of his
place.There might have been a serious reckoning for these men had Paine
been set free, or his case inquired into by the Convention.And Thuriot
was now on the Committee of Public Safety; he was eager to lay his own
crimes on Robespierre, and to conceal those of the Committee.Paine's
old friend, Achille Audibert, unsuspicious as himself of the real
facts, sent an appeal (August 20th) to "Citizen Thuriot, member of the
Committee of Public Safety.""Representative:--A friend of mankind is groaning in chains,--Thomas
Paine, who was not so politic as to remain silent in regard to a man
unlike himself, but dared to say that Robespierre was a monster to be
erased from the list of men.From that moment he became a criminal;
the despot marked him as his victim, put him into prison, and doubtless
prepared the way to the scaffold for him, as for others who knew him and
were courageous enough to speak out.*

     * It most be remembered that at this time it seemed the
     strongest recommendation of any one to public favor to
     describe him as a victim of Robespierre; and Paine's friends
     could conceive no other cause for the detention of a man
     they knew to be innocent."Thomas Paine is an acknowledged citizen of the United States.He was
the secretary of the Congress for the department of foreign affairs
during the Revolution.He has made himself known in Europe by his
writings, and especially by his 'Rights of Man.'The electoral
assembly of the department of Pas-de-Calais elected him one of its
representatives to the Convention, and commissioned me to go to London,
inform him of his election, and bring him to France.I hardly escaped
being a victim to the English Government with which he was at open war;
I performed my mission; and ever since friendship has attached me to
Paine.This is my apology for soliciting you for his liberation."I can assure you, Representative, that America was by no means
satisfied with the imprisonment of a strong column of its Revolution.But for Robespierre's
villainy this friend of man would now be free.Do not permit liberty
longer to see in prison a victim of the wretch who lives no more but by
his crimes; and you will add to the esteem and veneration I feel for
a man who did so much to save the country amidst the most tremendous
crisis of our Revolution."Greeting, respect, and brotherhood,

"Achille Audibert, of Calais.216 Rue de Bellechase, Fauborg St Germaine."Audibert's letter, of course, sank under the burden of its Robespierre
myth to a century's sleep beside Paine's, in the Committee's closet.Meanwhile, the regulation against any communication of prisoners with
the outside world remaining in force, it was some time before Paine
could know that his letter had been suppressed on its way to the
Convention.He was thus late in discovering his actual enemies.An interesting page in the annals of diplomacy remains to be written
on the closing weeks of Morris in France.On August 14th he writes to
Robert Morris: "I am preparing for my departure, but as yet can take no
step, as there is a kind of interregnum in the government and Mr.Monroe
is not yet received, at which he grows somewhat impatient."There was
no such interregnum, and no such explanation was given to Monroe, who
writes:

"I presented my credentials to the commissary of foreign affairs soon
after my arrival [August 2d]; but more than a week had elapsed, and I
had obtained no answer, when or whether I should be received.A delay
beyond a few days surprised me, because I could discern no adequate or
rational motive for it."*

     * "View of the Conduct of the Executive in the Foreign
     Affairs of the United States," by James Monroe, p.It is plain that the statement of Paine, who was certainly in
communication with the Committees a year later, is true, that Morris was
in danger on account of the interception of compromising letters written
by him.He needed time to dispose of his house and horses, and ship his
wines, and felt it important to retain his protecting credentials.At
any moment his friends might be expelled from the Committee, and their
papers be examined.While the arrangements for Monroe's reception rested
with Morris and this unaltered Committee, there was little prospect
of Monroe's being installed at all.The new Minister was therefore
compelled, as other Americans had been, to appeal directly to the
Convention.That assembly responded at once, and he was received
(August 28th) with highest honors.Morris had nothing to do with
the arrangement.The historian Frederic Masson, alluding to the
"unprecedented" irregularity of Morris in not delivering or receiving
letters of recall, adds that Monroe found it important to state that he
had acted without consultation with his predecessor.* This was necessary
for a cordial reception by the Convention, but it invoked the cordial
hatred of Morris, who marked him for his peculiar guillotine set up in
Philadelphia.* "Le Departement des Affaires Etrangeres," etc., p.So completely had America and Congress been left in the dark about Paine
that Monroe was surprised to find him a prisoner.When at length the new
Minister was in a position to consult the French Minister about Paine,
he found the knots so tightly tied around this particular victim--almost
the only one left in the Luxembourg of those imprisoned during the
Terror--that it was difficult to untie them.The Minister of Foreign
Affairs was now M. Bouchot, a weak creature who, as Morris said, would
not wipe his nose without permission of the Committee of Public Safety.When Monroe opened Paine's case he was asked whether he had brought
instructions.Of course he had none, for the administration had no
suspicion that Morris had not, as he said, attended to the case.When Paine recovered from his fever he heard that Monroe had superseded
Morris."As soon as I was able to write a note legible enough to be read,
I found a way to convey one to him [Monroe] by means of the man who
lighted the lamps in the prison, and whose unabated friendship to me,
from whom he never received any service, and with difficulty accepted
any recompense, puts the character of Mr.In a few
days I received a message from Mr.Monroe, conveyed in a note from an
intermediate person, with assurance of his friendship, and expressing
a desire that I should rest the case in his hands.After a fortnight
or more had passed, and hearing nothing farther, I wrote to a friend
[Whiteside], a citizen of Philadelphia, requesting him to inform me what
was the true situation of things with respect to me.I was sure
that something was the matter; I began to have hard thoughts of Mr.Washington, but I was unwilling to encourage them.In about ten days I
received an answer to my letter, in which the writer says: 'Mr.Monroe
told me he had no order (meaning from the president, Mr.Washington)
respecting you, but that he (Mr.Monroe) will do everything in his
power to liberate you, but, from what I learn from the Americans
lately arrived in Paris, you are not considered, either by the American
government or by individuals, as an American citizen.'"As the American government did regard Paine as an American citizen,
and approved Monroe's demanding him as such, there is no difficulty in
recognizing the source from which these statements were diffused among
Paine's newly arriving countrymen.On the receipt of Whiteside's note, Paine wrote a Memorial to Monroe,
of which important parts--amounting to eight printed pages--are omitted
from American and English editions of his works.In quoting this
Memorial, I select mainly the omitted portions.*

     * The whole is published in French: "Memoire de Thomas
     Payne, autographe et signe de sa main: addresse a M. Monroe,
     ministre des Etats-unis en France, pour reclamer sa mise en
     liberte comme Citoyen Americain, zo Septembre, 1794.Paine says that before leaving London for the Convention, he consulted
Minister Pinckney, who agreed with him that "it was for the interest of
America that the system of European governments should be changed and
placed on the same principle with her own"; and adds: "I have wished to
see America the mother church of government, and I have done my utmost
to exalt her character and her condition."He points out that he had not
accepted any title or office under a foreign government, within the
meaning of the United States Constitution, because there was no
government in France, the Convention being assembled to frame one; that
he was a citizen of France only in the honorary sense in which others in
Europe and America were declared such; that no oath of allegiance was
required or given.The following paragraphs are from various parts of
the Memorial."They who propagate the report of my not being considered as a citizen
of America by government, do it to the prolongation of my imprisonment,
and without authority; for Congress, as a government, has neither
decided upon it, nor yet taken the matter into consideration; and I
request you to caution such persons against spreading such reports....

"I know not what opinions have been circulated in America.It may have
been supposed there, that I had voluntarily and intentionally abandoned
America, and that my citizenship had ceased by my own choice.I can
easily conceive that there are those in that Country who would take such
a proceeding on my part somewhat in disgust.The idea of forsaking
old friendships for new acquaintances is not agreeable.I am a little
warranted in making this supposition by a letter I received some time
ago from the wife of one of the Georgia delegates, in which she says,
'your friends on this side the water cannot be reconciled to the idea
of your abandoning America.'I have never abandoned America in thought,
word, or deed, and I feel it incumbent upon me to give this assurance
to the friends I have in that country, and with whom I have always
intended, and am determined, if the possibility exists, to close the
scene of my life.It is there that I have made myself a home.It is
there that I have given the services of my best days.America never
saw me flinch from her cause in the most gloomy and perilous of her
situations: and I know there are those in that Country who will not
flinch from me.If I have Enemies (and every man has some) I leave them
to the enjoyment of their ingratitude....

"It is somewhat extraordinary, that the Idea of my not being a Citizen
of America should have arisen only at the time that I am imprisoned
in France because, or on the pretence that, I am a foreigner.The case
involves a strange contradiction of Ideas.None of the Americans who
came to France whilst I was in liberty, had conceived any such idea or
circulated any such opinion; and why it should arise now is a matter
yet to be explained.However discordant the late American Minister,
Gouverneur Morris, and the late French Committee of Public Safety were,
it suited the purpose of both that I should be continued in arrestation.The former wished to prevent my return to America, that I should not
expose his misconduct; and the latter, lest I should publish to the
world the history of its wickedness.Whilst that Minister and that
Committee continued, I had no expectation of liberty.I speak here of
the Committee of which Robespierre was a member....

"I here close my Memorial and proceed to offer to you a proposal, that
appears to me suited to all the circumstances of the case; which is,
that you reclaim me conditionally, until the opinion of Congress can
be obtained upon the subject of my Citizenship of America, and that I
remain in liberty under your protection during that time.I found this
proposal upon the following grounds:

"First, you say you have no orders respecting me; consequently you
have no orders _not_ to reclaim me; and in this case you are left
discretionary judge whether to reclaim or not.My proposal therefore
unites a consideration of your situation with my own."Secondly, I am put in arrestation because I am a foreigner.It is
therefore necessary to determine to what Country I belong.The right of
determining this question cannot appertain exclusively to the committee
of public safety or general surety; because I appear to the Minister of
the United States, and shew that my citizenship of that Country is good
and valid, referring at the same time, through the agency of the
Minister, my claim of Right to the opinion of Congress,--it being a
matter between two governments."Thirdly, France does not claim me for a citizen; neither do I set up
any claim of citizenship in France.The question is simply, whether I am
or am not a citizen of America.I am imprisoned here on the decree for
imprisoning Foreigners, because, say they, I was born in England.I
say in answer, that, though born in England, I am not a subject of the
English Government any more than any other American is who was born, as
they all were, under the same government, or that the citizens of France
are subjects of the French monarchy, under which they were born.I have
twice taken the oath of abjuration to the British king and government,
and of Allegiance to America.Once as a citizen of the State of
Pennsylvania in 1776; and again before Congress, administered to me by
the President, Mr.Hancock, when I was appointed Secretary in the office
of foreign affairs in 1777....

"Painful as the want of liberty may be, it is a consolation to me to
believe that my imprisonment proves to the world that I had no share in
the murderous system that then reigned.That I was an enemy to it, both
morally and politically, is known to all who had any knowledge of
me; and could I have written French as well as I can English, I would
publicly have exposed its wickedness, and shown the ruin with which it
was pregnant.They who have esteemed me on former occasions, whether
in America or England, will, I know, feel no cause to abate that esteem
when they reflect, that imprisonment with preservation of character, is
preferable to liberty with disgrace."In a postscript Paine adds that "as Gouverneur Morris could not inform
Congress of the cause of my arrestation, as he knew it not himself, it
is to be supposed that Congress was not enough acquainted with the case
to give any directions respecting me when you left."Which to the reader
of the preceding pages will appear sufficiently naive.To this Monroe responded (September 18th) with a letter of warm
sympathy, worthy of the high-minded gentleman that he was.After
ascribing the notion that Paine was not an American to mental confusion,
and affirming his determination to maintain his rights as a citizen of
the United States, Monroe says:

"It is unnecessary for me to tell you how much all your countrymen, I
speak of the great mass of the people, are interested in your welfare.They have not forgotten the history of their own revolution, and the
difficult scenes through which they passed; nor do they review its
several stages without reviving in their bosoms a due sensibility of the
merits of those who served them in that great and arduous conflict.The
crime of ingratitude has not yet stained, and I trust never will stain,
our national character.You are considered by them, as not only having
rendered important services in our own revolution, but as being on a
more extensive scale, the friend of human rights, and a distinguished
and able advocate in favor of public liberty.To the welfare of Thomas
Paine the Americans are not and cannot be indifferent.Of the sense
which the President has always entertained of your merits, and of his
friendly disposition towards you, you are too well assured to require
any declaration of it from me.That I forward his wishes in seeking your
safety is what I well know; and this will form an additional obligation
on me to perform what I should otherwise consider as a duty."You are, in my opinion, menaced by no kind of danger.To liberate you,
will be an object of my endeavors, and as soon as possible.But you
must, until that event shall be accomplished, face your situation with
patience and fortitude; you will likewise have the justice to recollect,
that I am placed here upon a difficult theatre, many important objects
to attend to, and with few to consult.It becomes me in pursuit of
those, to regulate my conduct in respect to each, as to the manner and
the time, as will, in my judgment, be best calculated to accomplish the
whole."With great esteem and respect consider me personally your friend,

"James Monroe."Monroe was indeed "placed upon a difficult theatre."Morris was showing
a fresh letter from the President expressing unabated confidence in him,
apologizing for his recall; he still had friends in the Committee of
Public Safety, to which Monroe had appealed in vain.The continued dread
the conspirators had of Paine's liberation appears in the fact that
Monroe's letter, written September 18th, did not reach Paine until
October 18th, when Morris had reached the boundary line of Switzerland,
which he entered on the 19th.He had left Paris (Sainport) October 14th,
when Barrere, Billaud-Varennes, and Collot d'Herbois, no longer on
the Committee, were under accusation, and their papers under
investigation,--a search that resulted in their exile.Morris got across
the line on an irregular passport.While Monroe's reassuring letter to Paine was taking a month to
penetrate his prison walls, he vainly grappled with the subtle
obstacles.All manner of delays impeded the correspondence, the
principal one being that he could present no instructions from the
President concerning Paine.Of course he was fighting in the dark,
having no suspicion that the imprisonment was due to his predecessor.At length, however, he received from Secretary Randolph a letter (dated
July 30th), from which, though Paine was not among its specifications,
he could select a sentence as basis of action: "We have heard with
regret that several of our citizens have been thrown into prison in
France, from a suspicion of criminal attempts against the government.If
they are guilty we are extremely sorry for it; if innocent we must
protect them."What Paine had said in his Memorial of collusion between
Morris and the Committee of Public Safety probably determined Monroe to
apply no more in that quarter; so he wrote (November 2d) to the
Committee of General Surety.After stating the general principles and
limitations of ministerial protection to an imprisoned countryman, he
adds:

"The citizens of the United States cannot look back upon the time of
their own revolution without recollecting among the names of their most
distinguished patriots that of Thomas Paine; the services he rendered to
his country in its struggle for freedom have implanted in the hearts of
his countrymen a sense of gratitude never to be effaced as long as they
shall deserve the title of a just and generous people."The above-named citizen is at this moment languishing in prison,
affected with a disease growing more intense from his confinement.I
beg, therefore, to call your attention to his condition and to request
you to hasten the moment when the law shall decide his fate, in case of
any accusation against him, and if none, to restore him to liberty."Greeting and fraternity,

"Monroe."At this the first positive assertion of Paine's American citizenship the
prison door flew open.He had been kept there solely "pour les interets
de l'Amerique," as embodied in Morris, and two days after Monroe
undertook, without instructions, to affirm the real interests of America
in Paine he was liberated.Third year of the French Republic.--The Committee of
General Surety orders that the Citizen Thomas Paine be set at liberty,
and the seals taken from his papers, on sight of these presents."Members of the Committee (signed): Clauzel, Lesage, Senault, Bentabole,
Reverchon, Goupilleau de Fontenai, Rewbell."Delivered to Clauzel, as Commissioner."*

There are several interesting points about this little decree.It
is signed by Bentabole, who had moved Paine's expulsion from the
Convention.It orders that the seals be removed from Paine's papers,
whereas none had been placed on them, the officers reporting them
innocent.This same authority, which had ordered Paine's arrest, now,
in ordering his liberation, shows that the imprisonment had never been
a subject of French inquiry.It had ordered the seals but did not know
whether they were on the papers or not.It was no concern of France,
but only of the American Minister.It is thus further evident that when
Monroe invited a trial of Paine there was not the least trace of any
charge against him.And there was precisely the same absence of any
accusation against Paine in the new Committee of Public Safety, to which
Monroe's letter was communicated the same day.Writing to Secretary Randolph (November 7th) Monroe says:

"He was actually a citizen of the United States, and of the United
States only; for the Revolution which parted us from Great Britain broke
the allegiance which was before due to the Crown, of all who took our
side.He was, of course, not a British subject; nor was he strictly a
citizen of France, for he came by invitation for the temporary purpose
of assisting in the formation of their government only, and meant to
withdraw to America when that should be completed.And what confirms
this is the act of the Convention itself arresting him, by which he is
declared a foreigner."I told him I had hoped getting him enlarged without it; but, if I did
interfere, it could only be by requesting that he be tried, in case
there was any charge against him, and liberated in case there was
not.His correspondence with me is lengthy and
interesting, and I may probably be able hereafter to send you a copy
of it.After some time had elapsed, without producing any change in his
favor, I finally resolved to address the Committee of General Surety in
his behalf, resting my application on the above principle.My letter was
delivered by my Secretary in the Committee to the president, who assured
him he would communicate its contents immediately to the Committee of
Public Safety, and give me an answer as soon as possible.The conference
took place accordingly between the two Committees, and, as I presume,
on that night, or on the succeeding day; for on the morning of the day
after, which was yesterday, I was presented by the Secretary of the
Committee of General Surety with an order for his enlargement.I
forwarded it immediately to the Luxembourg, and had it carried into
effect; and have the pleasure now to add that he is not only released to
the enjoyment of liberty, but is in good spirits."In reply, the Secretary of State (Randolph) in a letter to Monroe of
March 8, 1795, says: "Your observations on our commercial relations
to France, and your conduct as to Mr.Gardoqui's letter, prove your
judgment and assiduity.Paine, and the
lady of our friend [Lafayette] less approved."Daniel travelled to the kitchen.Thus, after an imprisonment of ten months and nine days, Thomas Paine
was liberated from the prison into which he had been cast by a Minister
of the United States.A RESTORATION

As in 1792 Paine had left England with the authorities at his heels,
so in 1794 escaped Morris from France.The ex-Minister went off to
play courtier to George III.the despotic
proclamation with which monarchy was to be restored in France*; Paine
sat in the house of a real American Minister, writing proclamations of
republicanism to invade the empires.While the American Minister in Paris and his wife were nursing their
predecessor's victim back into life, a thrill of joy was passing
through European courts, on a rumor that the dreaded author had
been guillotined.Paine had the satisfaction of reading, at Monroe's
fireside, his own last words on the scaffold,** and along with it an
invitation of the 27th of December 1792.* Morris' royal proclamations are printed in full in his
     biography by Jared Sparks.** "The last dying words of Thomas Paine.Executed at the
     Guillotine in France on the 1st of September, 1794."The
     dying speech begins: "Ye numerous spectators gathered
     around, pray give ear to my last words; I am determined to
     speak the Truth in these my last moments, altho' I have
     written and spoke nothing but lies all my life."There is
     nothing in the witless leaflet worth quoting.When Paine was
     burnt in effigy, in 1792, it appears to have been with
     accompaniments of the same kind.Before me is a small
     placard, which reads thus: "The Dying Speech and Confession
     of the Arch-Traitor Thomas Paine.Who was executed at Oakham
     on Thursday.""This morning the Officers usually attending on such
     occasions went in procession on Horseback to the County
     Gaol, and demanded the Body of the Arch-Traitor, and from
     thence proceeded with the Criminal drawn in a Cart by an Ass
     to the usual place of execution with his Pamphlet called the
     'Rights of Man' in his right hand."On December 7, 1794, Thibaudeau had spoken to that assembly in the
following terms:

"It yet remains for the Convention to perform an act of justice.I
reclaim one of the most zealous defenders of liberty'--Thomas Paine.My reclamation is for a man who has honored his
age by his energy in defence of the rights of humanity, and who is
so gloriously distinguished by his part in the American revolution.A
naturalized Frenchman* by a decree of the legislative assembly, he was
nominated by the people.It was only by an intrigue that he was driven
from the Convention, the pretext being a decree excluding foreigners
from representing the French people.There were only two foreigners in
the Convention; one [Anacharsis Clootz] is dead, and I speak not of him,
but of Thomas Paine, who powerfully contributed to establish liberty in
a country allied with the French Republic.I demand that he be recalled
to the bosom of the Convention."(_Applause._)

"The _Moniteur_, from which I translate, reports the unanimous adoption
of Thibaudeau's motion.The Committee of Public
Instruction, empowered to award pensions for literary services, reported
(January 3, 1795) as the first name on their list, Thomas Paine.Chenier, in reading the report, claimed the honor of having originally
suggested Paines name as an honorary citizen of France, and denounced,
amid applause, the decree against foreigners under which the great
author had suffered.In the next sentence but one
     he rightly describes Paine as a foreigner.The allusion to
     "an intrigue" is significant.You have revoked that inhospitable decree, and we again see Thomas
Paine, the man of genius without fortune, our colleague, dear to all
friends of humanity,--a cosmopolitan, persecuted equally by Pitt and by
Robespierre.Notable epoch in the life of this philosopher, who opposed
the arms of Common Sense to the sword of Tyranny, the Rights of Man to
the machiavelism of English politicians; and who, by two immortal works,
has deserved well of the human race, and consecrated liberty in the two
worlds."Poor as he was, Paine declined this literary pension.He accepted
the honors paid him by the Convention, no doubt with a sorrow at the
contrasted silence of those who ruled in America.Monroe, however,
encouraged him to believe that he was still beloved there, and, as he
got stronger, a great homesickness came upon him.The kindly host
made an effort to satisfy him.On January 4th he (Monroe) wrote to the
Committee of Public Safety:

"Citizens: The Decree just passed, bearing on the execution of Articles
23 and 24 of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between the two
Republics, is of such great importance to my country, that I think it
expedient to send it there officially, by some particularly confidential
hand; and no one seems to be better fitted for this errand than Thomas
Paine, Having resided a long time in France, and having a perfect
knowledge of the many vicissitudes which the Republic has passed, he
will be able to explain and compare the happy lot she now enjoys.As he
has passed the same himself, remaining faithful to his principles, his
reports will be the more trustworthy, and consequently produce a better
effect.But as Citizen Paine is a member of the Convention, I thought it
better to submit this subject to your consideration.If this affair
can be arranged, the Citizen will leave for America immediately, via
Bordeaux, on an American vessel which will be prepared for him.As he
has reason to fear the persecution of the English government, should he
be taken prisoner, he desires that his departure may be kept a secret.The Convention alone could give a passport to one of its members, and
as an application to it would make Paine's mission known, the Committee
returned next day a negative answer."Citizen: We see with satisfaction and without surprise, that you attach
some interest to sending officially to the United States the Decree
which the National Convention has just made, in which are recalled and
confirmed the reports of Friendship and Commerce existing between the
two Republics."As to the design you express of confiding this errand to Citizen Thomas
Paine, we must observe to you that the position he holds will not permit
him to accept it."*

Liberty's great defender gets least of it!The large seal of the
Committee--mottoed "Activity, Purity, Attention"--looks like a wheel of
fortune; but one year before it had borne from the Convention to prison
the man it now cannot do without.France now especially needs the
counsel of shrewd and friendly American heads.There are indications
that Jay in London is carrying the United States into Pitt's combination
against the Republic, just as it is breaking up on the Continent.Monroe's magnanimity towards Paine found its reward.He brought to his
house, and back into life, just the one man in France competent to
give him the assistance he needed.Comprehending the history of the
Revolution, knowing the record of every actor in it, Paine was able to
revise Monroe's impressions, and enable him to check calumnies
circulated in America.The despatches of Monroe are of high historic
value, largely through knowledge derived from Paine.Monroe
     dates his letter, "19th year of the American Republic."In Monroe's instructions emphasis was laid on
the importance to the United States of the free navigation of the
Mississippi and its ultimate control.* Paine's former enthusiasm in this
matter had possibly been utilized by Gouverneur Morris to connect him,
as we have seen, with Genet's proceedings.The Kentuckians consulted
Paine at a time when expulsion of the Spaniard was a patriotic American
scheme.This is shown in a letter written by the Secretary of State
(Randolph) to the President, February 27, 1794.Brown [Senator of Kentucky] has shown me a letter from the famous
Dr.O'Fallon to Captain Herron, dated Oct 18, 1793.It was intercepted,
and he has permitted me to take the following extract:--'This plan
(an attack on Louisiana) was digested between Gen.I framed the whole of the correspondence in the General's
name, and corroborated it by a private letter of my own to Mr.Thomas
Paine, of the National Assembly, with whom during the late war I was
very intimate.His reply reached me but a few days since, enclosed in
the General's despatches from the Ambassador."**

     * "The conduct of Spain towards us is unaccountable and
     injurious.Pinckney is by this time gone over to Madrid
     as our envoy extraordinary to bring matters to a conclusion
     some way or other.But you will seize any favorable moment
     to execute what has been entrusted to you respecting the
     Mississippi."--Randolph to Monroe, February 15, 1795.** Two important historical works have recently appeared
     relating to the famous Senator Brown.The first is a
     publication of the Filson Club: "The Political Beginnings of
     Kentucky," by John Mason Brown.The second is: "The Spanish
     Conspiracy," by Thomas Marshall Green (Cincinnati, Robert
     Clarke & Co., 1891).The intercepted letter quoted above has
     some bearing on the controversy between these authors.Apparently, Senator Brown, like many other good patriots,
     favored independent action in Kentucky when that seemed for
     the welfare of the United States, but, when the situation
     had changed, Brown is found co-operating with Washington and
     Randolph.That such letters (freely written as they were at the beginning of 1793)
were now intercepted indicates the seriousness of the situation time had
brought on.The administration had soothed the Kentuckians by pledges
of pressing the matter by negotiations.Hence Monroe's instructions, in
carrying out which Paine was able to lend a hand.{1795}

In the State Archives at Paris (Etats Unis, vol.there are two
papers marked "Thomas Payne."The first urges the French Ministry to
seize the occasion of a treaty with Spain to do a service to the United
States: let the free navigation of the Mississippi be made by France a
condition of peace.The second paper (endorsed "3 Ventose, February 21,
1795") proposes that, in addition to the condition made to Spain, an
effort should be made to include American interests in the negotiation
with England, if not too late.The negotiation with England was
then finished, but the terms unpublished.Paine recommended that the
Convention should pass a resolution that freedom of the Mississippi
should be a condition of peace with Spain, which would necessarily
accept it; and that, in case the arrangement with England should
prove unsatisfactory, any renewed negotiations should support the just
reclamations of their American ally for the surrender of the frontier
posts and for depredations on their trade.Paine points out that such a
declaration could not prolong the war a day, nor cost France an obole;
whereas it might have a decisive effect in the United States, especially
if Jay's treaty with England should be reprehensible, and should be
approved in America.That generosity "would certainly raise the reputation of the French
Republic to the most eminent degree of splendour, and lower in
proportion that of her enemies."It would undo the bad effects of the
depredations of French privateers on American vessels, which rejoiced
the British party in the United States and discouraged the friends of
liberty and humanity there.It would acquire for France the merit
which is her due, supply her American friends with strength against the
intrigues of England, and cement the alliance of the Republics.This able paper might have been acted on, but for the anger in France at
the Jay treaty.While writing in Monroe's house, the invalid, with an abscess in his
side and a more painful sore in his heart--for he could not forget that
Washington had forgotten him,--receives tidings of new events through
cries in the street.In the month of his release they had been resonant
with yells as the Jacobins were driven away and their rooms turned to
a Normal School.Then came shouts, when, after trial, the murderous
committeemen were led to execution or exile.In the early weeks of 1795
the dread sounds of retribution subside, and there is a cry from the
street that comes nearer to Paine's heart--"Bread and the Constitution
of Ninety-three!"He knows that it is his Constitution for which
they are really calling, for they cannot understand the Robespierrian
adulteration of it given out, as one said, as an opiate to keep the
country asleep.These are the
people in whom Paine has ever believed,--the honest hearts that summoned
him, as author of "The Rights of Man," to help form their Constitution.They, he knows, had to be deceived when cruel deeds were done, and
heard of such deeds with as much horror as distant peoples.Over that
Constitution for which they were clamoring he and his lost friend
Condorcet had spent many a day of honest toil.Of the original Committee
of Nine appointed for the work, six had perished by the revolution,
one was banished, and two remained--Sieyes and Paine.That original
Committee had gradually left the task to Paine and Condorcet,--Sieyes,
because he had no real sympathy with republicanism, though he honored
Paine.* When afterwards asked how he had survived the Terror, Sieyes
answered, "I lived."He lived by bending, and now leads a Committee of
Eleven on the Constitution, while Paine, who did not bend, is
disabled.The people will vainly try for the
"Constitution of Ninety-three."They shall have no Constitution but
of Sieyes' making, and in it will be some element of monarchy.Sieyes
presently seemed to retire from the Committee, but old republicans did
not doubt that he was all the more swaying it.Thomas Paine is one of those men who have contributed
     the most to establish the liberty of America.His ardent
     love of humanity, and his hatred of every sort of tyranny,
     have induced him to take up in England the defence of the
     French revolution, against the amphigorical declamation of
     Mr.His work has been translated into our language,
     and is universally known.What French patriot is there who
     has not already, from the bottom of his heart, thanked this
     foreigner for having strengthened our cause by all the
     powers of his reason and reputation?It is with pleasure
     that I observe an opportunity of offering him the tribute of
     my gratitude and my esteem for the truly philosophical
     application of talents so distinguished as his own."--Sieyes
     in the Moniteur, July 6, 1791.So once more Paine seizes his pen; his hand is feeble, but His intellect
has lost no fibre of force, nor his heart its old faith.His trust in
man has passed through the ordeal of seeing his friends--friends of
man--murdered by the people's Convention, himself saved by accident; it
has survived the apparent relapse of Washington into the arms of
George the Third.The ingratitude of his faithfully-served America
is represented by an abscess in his side, which may strike into his
heart--in a sense has done so--but will never reach his faith in
liberty, equality, and humanity.Early in July the Convention is reading Paine's "Dissertation on First
Principles of Government" His old arguments against hereditary right,
or investing even an elective individual with extraordinary power, are
repeated with illustrations from the passing Revolution."Had a Constitution been established two years ago, as ought to have
been done, the violences that have since desolated France and injured
the character of the revolution, would, in my opinion, have been
prevented.The nation would have had a bond of union, and every
individual would have known the line of conduct he was to follow.But,
instead of this, a revolutionary government, a thing without either
principle or authority, was substituted in its place; virtue or crime
depended upon accident; and that which was patriotism one day, became
treason the next.All these things have followed from the want of a
Constitution; for it is the nature and intention or a Constitution to
prevent governing by party, by establishing a common principle that
shall limit and control the power and impulse of party, and that says
to all parties, _Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther_.But in the
absence of a Constitution men look entirely to party; and instead of
principle governing party, party governs principle."An avidity to punish is always dangerous to liberty.It leads men to
stretch, to misinterpret and to misapply even the best of laws.He
that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from
oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent
that will reach himself."Few of Paine's pamphlets better deserve study than this.In writing it,
he tells us, he utilized the fragment of a work begun at some time
not stated, which he meant to dedicate to the people of Holland,
then contemplating a revolution.It is a condensed statement of the
principles underlying the Constitution written by himself and Condorcet,
now included among Condorcet's works.They who imagine that Paine's
political system was that of the democratic demagogues may undeceive
themselves by pondering this pamphlet.It has been pointed out, on a
previous page of this work, that Paine held the representative to be
not the voter's mouthpiece, but his delegated sovereignty.The
representatives of a people are therefore its supreme power.The
executive, the ministers, are merely as chiefs of the national police
engaged in enforcing the laws.They are mere employes, without any
authority at all, except of superintendence."The executive department
is official, and is subordinate to the legislative as the body is to
the mind."The chief of these official departments is the judicial.In
appointing officials the most important rule is, "never to invest any
individual with extraordinary power; for besides being tempted to
misuse it, it will excite contention and commotion in the nation for
the office."All of this is in logical conformity with the same author's
"Rights of Man," which James Madison declared to be an exposition of the
principles on which the United States government is based.It would be
entertaining to observe the countenance of a President should our House
of Representatives address him as a chief of national police.Soon after the publication of Paine's "Dissertation" a new French
Constitution was textually submitted for popular consideration.Although
in many respects it accorded fairly well with Paine's principles, it
contained one provision which he believed would prove fatal to the
Republic.This was the limitation of citizenship to payers of direct
taxes, except soldiers who had fought in one or more campaigns for the
Republic, this being a sufficient qualification.This revolutionary
disfranchisement of near half the nation brought Paine to the Convention
(July 7th) for the first time since the fall of the Brissotins, two
years before.A special motion
was made by Lan-thenas and unanimously adopted, "that permission be
granted Thomas Paine to deliver his sentiments on the declaration of
rights and the Constitution."With feeble step he ascended the tribune,
and stood while a secretary read his speech.Of all present this man had
suffered most by the confusion of the mob with the people, which caused
the reaction on which was floated the device he now challenged.It is
an instance of idealism rare in political history.The speech opens with
words that caused emotion."Citizens, The effects of a malignant fever, with which I was afflicted
during a rigorous confinement in the Luxembourg, have thus long
prevented me from attending at my post in the bosom of the Convention;
and the magnitude of the subject under discussion, and no other
consideration on earth, could induce me now to repair to my station.A recurrence to the vicissitudes I have experienced, and the critical
situations in which I have been placed in consequence of the French
Revolution, will throw upon what I now propose to submit to the
Convention the most unequivocal proofs of my integrity, and the
rectitude of those principles which have uniformly influenced my
conduct.In England I was proscribed for having vindicated the French
Revolution, and I have suffered a rigorous imprisonment in France for
having pursued a similar line of conduct.During the reign of terrorism
I was a prisoner for eight long months, and remained so above three
months after the era of the 10th Thermidor.I ought, however, to state,
that I was not persecuted by the _people_, either of England or France.The proceedings in both countries were the effects of the despotism
existing in their respective governments.But, even if my persecution
had originated in the people at large, my principles and conduct would
still have remained the same.Principles which are influenced and
subject to the control of tyranny have not their foundation in the
heart."Though they slay him Paine will trust in the people.There seems a
slight slip of memory; his imprisonment, by revolutionary calendar,
lasted ten and a half months, or 315 days; but there is no failure
of conviction or of thought.He points out the inconsistency of the
disfranchisement of indirect tax-payers with the Declaration of Rights,
and the opportunity afforded partisan majorities to influence
suffrage by legislation on the mode of collecting taxes.The soldier,
enfranchised without other qualification, would find his children
slaves."If you subvert the basis of the Revolution, if you dispense with
principles and substitute expedients, you will extinguish that
enthusiasm which has hitherto been the life and soul of the revolution;
and you will substitute in its place nothing but a cold indifference and
self-interest, which will again degenerate into intrigue, cunning, and
effeminacy."There was an educational test of suffrage to which he did not object."Where knowledge is a duty, ignorance is a crime."But in his appeal to
pure principle simple-hearted Paine knew nothing of the real test of the
Convention's votes.This white-haired man was the only eminent member
of the Convention with nothing in his record to cause shame or fear.He
almost alone among them had the honor of having risked his head rather
than execute Louis, on whom he had looked as one man upon another.He
alone had refused to enter the Convention when it abandoned the work for
which it was elected and became a usurping tribunal.During two fearful
years the true Republic had been in Paine's house and garden, where he
conversed with his disciples; or in Luxembourg prison, where he won all
hearts, as did imprisoned George Fox, who reappeared in him, and where,
beneath the knife whose fall seemed certain, he criticised consecrated
dogmas.With this record Paine spoke that day to men who feared to face
the honest sentiment of the harried peasantry.Some of the members had
indeed been terrorized, but a majority shared the disgrace of the old
Convention.The heart of France was
throbbing again, and what would become of these "Conventionnels," when
their assembly should die in giving birth to a government?They must
from potentates become pariahs.Their aim now was to prolong their
political existence.The constitutional narrowing of the suffrage was
in anticipation of the decree presently appended, that two thirds of the
new legislature should be chosen from the Convention.Paine's speech was
delivered against a foregone conclusion.This was his last appearance
in the Convention.Out of it he naturally dropped when it ended (October
26, 1795), with the organization of the Directory.Being an American he
would not accept candidature in a foreign government.CHAPTER X. THE SILENCE OF WASHINGTON

Monroe, in a letter of September 15th to his relative, Judge Joseph
Jones, of Fredericksburg, Virginia, after speaking of the Judge's son
and his tutor at St.Germain, adds:

"As well on his account as that of our child, who is likewise at St.Germain, we had taken rooms there, with the intention of occupying for a
month or two in the course of the autumn, but fear it will not be in our
power to do so, on account of the ill-health of Mr.Paine, who has lived
in my house for about ten months past.He was upon my arrival confined
in the Luxembourg, and released on my application; after which, being
ill, he has remained with me.For some time the prospect of his recovery
was good; his malady being an abscess in his side, the consequence of a
severe fever in the Luxembourg.Latterly his symptoms have become worse,
and the prospect now is that he will not be able to hold out more than a
month or two at the furthest.I shall certainly pay the utmost attention
to this gentleman, as he is one of those whose merits in our Revolution
were most distinguished."*

     * I am indebted to Mrs.Gouverneur, of Washington, for this
     letter, which is among the invaluable papers of her
     ancestor, President Monroe, which surely should be secured
     for our national archives.Paine's speech in the Convention told sadly on his health.As when, in 1793, the guillotine rising over him, he had
set about writing his last bequest, the "Age of Reason," he now devoted
himself to its completion.The manuscript of the second part, begun in
prison, had been in the printer's hands some time before Monroe wrote
of his approaching end.When the book appeared, he was so low that his
death was again reported.So far as France was concerned, there was light about his eventide."Almost as suddenly," so he wrote, "as the morning light dissipates
darkness, did the establishment of the Constitution change the face of
affairs in France.Security succeeded to terror, prosperity to distress,
plenty to famine, and confidence increased as the days multiplied."This
may now seem morbid optimism, but it was shared by the merry youth, and
the pretty dames, whose craped arms did not prevent their sandalled feet
and Greek-draped forms from dancing in their transient Golden Age.Of
all this, we may be sure, the invalid hears many a beguiling story from
Madame Monroe.But there is a grief in his heart more cruel than death.The months have
come and gone,--more than eighteen,--since Paine was cast into prison,
but as yet no word of kindness or inquiry had come from Washington.Early in the year, on the President's sixty-third birthday, Paine had
written him a letter of sorrowful and bitter reproach, which Monroe
persuaded him not to send, probably because of its censures on the
ministerial failures of Morris, and "the pusillanimous conduct of Jay
in England."It now seems a pity that Monroe did not encourage Paine to
send Washington, in substance, the personal part of his letter, which
was in the following terms:

"As it is always painful to reproach those one would wish to respect, it
is not without some difficulty that I have taken the resolution to write
to you.The danger to which I have been exposed cannot have been
unknown to you, and the guarded silence you have observed upon that
circumstance, is what I ought not to have expected from you, either as a
friend or as a President of the United States."You knew enough of my character to be assured that I could not have
deserved imprisonment in France, and, without knowing anything more
than this, you had sufficient ground to have taken some interest for my
safety.Every motive arising from recollection ought to have suggested
to you the consistency of such a measure.But I cannot find that you
have so much as directed any enquiry to be made whether I was in prison
or at liberty, dead or alive; what the cause of that imprisonment was,
or whether there was any service or assistance you could render.Is this
what I ought to have expected from America after the part I had acted
towards her?Or, will it redound to her honor or to your's that I tell
the story?"I do not hesitate to say that you have not served America with more
fidelity, or greater zeal, or greater disinterestedness, than myself,
and perhaps with not better effect After the revolution of America had
been established, you rested at home to partake its advantages, and I
ventured into new scenes of difficulty to extend the principles which
that revolution had produced.In the progress of events you beheld
yourself a president in America and me a prisoner in France: you folded
your arms, forgot your friend, and became silent."As everything I have been doing in Europe was connected with my wishes
for the prosperity of America, I ought to be the more surprised at this
conduct on the part of her government.It leaves me but one mode of
explanation, which is, that everything is not as it ought to be amongst
you, and that the presence of a man who might disapprove, and who had
credit enough with the country to be heard and believed, was not
wished for.This was the operating motive of the despotic faction
that imprisoned me in France (though the pretence was that I was a
foreigner); and those that have been silent towards me in America,
appear to me to have acted from the same motive.It is impossible for me
to discover any other."Unwilling as all are to admit anything disparaging to Washington,
justice requires the fair consideration of Paine's complaint There were
in his hands many letters proving Washington's friendship, and his great
appreciation of Paine's services.Paine had certainly done nothing to
forfeit his esteem.The "Age of Reason" had not appeared in America
early enough to affect the matter, even should we suppose it offensive
to a deist like Washington.The dry approval, forwarded by the Secretary
of State, of Monroe's reclamation of Paine, enhanced the grievance.It
admitted Paine's American citizenship.It was not then an old friend
unhappily beyond his help, but a fellow-citizen whom he could legally
protect, whom the President had left to languish in prison, and in
hourly danger of death.During six months he saw no visitor, he heard no
word, from the country for which he had fought.To Paine it could appear
only as a sort of murder.And, although he kept back the letter, at his
friend's desire, he felt that it might yet turn out to be murder.Even
so it seemed, six months later, when the effects of his imprisonment,
combined with his grief at Washington's continued silence (surely Monroe
must have written on the subject), brought him to death's door.One must
bear in mind also the disgrace, the humiliation of it, for a man who had
been reverenced as a founder of the American Republic, and its apostle
in France.This, indeed, had made his last three months in prison, after
there had been ample time to hear from Washington, heavier than all the
others.After the fall of Robespierre the prisons were rapidly
emptied--from twenty to forty liberations daily,--the one man apparently
forgotten being he who wrote, "in the times that tried men's souls," the
words that Washington ordered to be read to his dispirited soldiers.If there can be any explanation of this long
neglect and silence, knowledge of it would soothe the author's dying
pillow; and though there be little probability that he can hold out so
long, a letter (September 20th) is sent to Washington, under cover to
Franklin Bache."Sir,--I had written you a letter by Mr.Letombe, French consul, but, at
the request of Mr.Monroe, I withdrew it, and the letter is still by
me.I was the more easily prevailed upon to do this, as it was then my
intention to have returned to America the latter end of the present year
(1795;) but the illness I now suffer prevents me.In case I had come, I
should have applied to you for such parts of your official letters (and
your private ones, if you had chosen to give them) as contained any
instructions or directions either to Mr.Morris, or
to any other person, respecting me; for after you were informed of my
imprisonment in France it was incumbent on you to make some enquiry
into the cause, as you might very well conclude that I had not the
opportunity of informing you of it.I cannot understand your silence
upon this subject upon any other ground, than as connivance at my
imprisonment; and this is the manner in which it is understood here,
and will be understood in America, unless you will give me authority for
contradicting it.I therefore write you this letter, to propose to you
to send me copies of any letters you have written, that I may remove
this suspicion.In the Second Part of the "Age of Reason," I have given
a memorandum from the handwriting of Robespierre, in which he proposed a
decree of accusation against me 'for the interest of America as well as
of France.'He could have no cause for putting America in the case, but
by interpreting the silence of the American government into connivance
and consent.I was imprisoned on the ground of being born in England;
and your silence in not inquiring the cause of that imprisonment, and
reclaiming me against it, was tacitly giving me up.I ought not to have
suspected you of treachery; but whether I recover from the illness I now
suffer, or not, I shall continue to think you treacherous, till you give
me cause to think otherwise.I am sure you would have found yourself
more at your ease had you acted by me as you ought; for whether your
desertion of me was intended to gratify the English government, or to
let me fall into destruction in France that you might exclaim the louder
against the French Revolution; or whether you hoped by my extinction to
meet with less opposition in mounting up the American government; either
of these will involve you in reproach you will not easily shake off.This is a bitter letter, but it is still more a sorrowful one.In view
of what Washington had written of Paine's services, and for the sake
of twelve years of _camaraderie_, Washington should have overlooked the
sharpness of a deeply wronged and dying friend, and written to him what
his Minister in France had reported.My reader already knows, what the
sufferer knew not, that a part of Paine's grievance against Washington
was unfounded.Washington could not know that the only charge against
Paine was one trumped up by his own Minister in France.Had he
considered the letter just quoted, he must have perceived that Paine was
laboring under an error in supposing that no inquiry had been made into
his case.There are facts antecedent to the letter showing that his
complaint had a real basis.For instance, in a letter to Monroe
(July 30th), President's interest was expressed in two other American
prisoners in France--Archibald Hunter and Shubael Allen,--but no word
was said of Paine.There was certainly a change in Washington towards
Paine, and the following may have been its causes.Paine had introduced Genet to Morris, and probably to public men in
America.Genet had put an affront on Morris, and taken over a demand for
his recall, with which Morris connected Paine.In a letter to Washington
(private) Morris falsely insinuated that Paine had incited the actions
of Genet which had vexed the President.Morris, perhaps in fear that Jefferson, influenced by Americans in
Paris, might appoint Paine to his place, had written to Robert Morris in
Philadelphia slanders of Paine, describing him as a sot and an object of
contempt.This he knew would reach Washington without passing under the
eye of Paine's friend, Jefferson.In a private letter Morris related that Paine had visited him with
Colonel Oswald, and treated him insolently.Washington particularly
disliked Oswald, an American journalist actively opposing his
administration.Morris had described Paine as intriguing against him, both in Europe
and America, thus impeding his mission, to which the President attached
great importance.The President had set his heart on bribing England with a favorable
treaty of commerce to give up its six military posts in America.The
most obnoxious man in the world to England was Paine.Any interference
in Paine s behalf would not only have offended England, but appeared as
a sort of repudiation of Morris' intimacy with the English court.The (alleged) reclamation of Paine by Morris had been kept secret by
Washington even from friends so intimate (at the time) as Madison, who
writes of it as having never been done.So carefully was avoided the
publication of anything that might vex England.Morris had admonished the Secretary of State that if Paine's
imprisonment were much noticed it might endanger his life.So conscience
was free to jump with policy.What else Morris may have conveyed to Washington against Paine can be
only matter for conjecture; but what he was capable of saying about
those he wished to injure may be gathered from various letters of his.In one (December 19, 1795) he tells Washington that he had heard from a
trusted informant that his Minister, Monroe, had told various Frenchmen
that "he had no doubt but that, if they would do what was proper here,
he and his friends would turn out Washington."Liability to imposition is the weakness of strong natures.Many an Iago
of canine cleverness has made that discovery.But, however Washington's
mind may have been poisoned towards Paine, it seems unaccountable that,
after receiving the letter of September 20th, he did not mention to
Monroe, or to somebody, his understanding that the prisoner had been
promptly reclaimed.In my first edition it was suggested that the letter
might have been intercepted by Secretary Pickering, Paine's enemy, who
had withheld from Washington important documents in Randolph's case.Unfortunately my copyist in the State Department sent me only Bache's
endorsement: "Jan.Franklin Bache, and by him
forwarded immediately upon receipt."But there is also an endorsement by
Washington: "From Mr.(Addressed outside:
"George Washington, President of the United States.")The President was
no longer visited by his old friends, Madison and others, and they could
not discuss with him the intelligence they were receiving about Paine.Madison, in a letter to Jefferson (dated at Philadelphia, January 10,
1796), says:

"I have a letter from Thomas Paine which breathes the same sentiments,
and contains some keen observations on the administration of the
government here.It appears that the neglect to claim him as an American
citizen when confined by Robespierre, or even to interfere in any way
whatever in his favor, has filled him with an indelible rancor against
the President, to whom it appears he has written on the subject
[September 20, 1795].His letter to me is in the style of a dying one,
and we hear that he is since dead of the abscess in his side, brought on
by his imprisonment.His letter desires that he may be remembered to
you."Whatever the explanation may be, no answer came from Washington.After
waiting a year Paine employed his returning strength in embodying the
letters of February 22d and September 20th, with large additions, in a
printed _Letter to George Washington_.The story of his imprisonment
and death sentence here for the first time really reached the
American people.His personal case is made preliminary to an attack on
Washington's whole career.The most formidable part of the pamphlet was
the publication of Washington's letter to the Committee of Public
Safety, which, departing from its rule of secrecy (in anger at the
British Treaty), thus delivered a blow not easily answerable.The
President's letter was effusive, about the "alliance," "closer bonds of
friendship," and so forth,--phrases which, just after the virtual
transfer of our alliance to the enemy of France, smacked of perfidy.Paine attacks the treaty, which is declared to have put American
commerce under foreign dominion.Her right
to navigate is reduced to the right of escaping; that is, until some
ship of England or France stops her vessels and carries them into port."The ministerial misconduct of Gouverneur Morris, and his neglect of
American interests, are exposed in a sharp paragraph.Washington's
military mistakes are relentlessly raked up, with some that he did not
commit, and the credit given him for victories won by others heavily
discounted.{1796}

That Washington smarted under this pamphlet appears by a reference to it
in a letter to David Stuart, January 8, 1797.Speaking of himself in the
third person, he says: "Although he is soon to become a private citizen,
his opinions are to be knocked down, and his character reduced as low
as they are capable of sinking it, even by resorting to absolute
falsehoods.As an evidence whereof, and of the plan they are pursuing,
I send you a letter of Mr.Paine to me, printed in this city
[Philadelphia], and disseminated with great industry."In the same
letter he says: "Enclosed you will receive also a production of Peter
Porcupine, alias William Cobbett.Making allowances for the asperity of
an Englishman, for some of his strong and coarse expressions, and a
want of official information as to many facts, it is not a bad thing."*
Cobbett's answer to Paine's personal grievance was really an arraignment
of the President.He undertakes to prove that the French Convention was
a real government, and that by membership in it Paine had forfeited
his American citizenship.But Monroe had formally claimed Paine as an
American citizen, and the President had officially endorsed that claim.That this approval was unknown to Cobbett is a remarkable fact, showing
that even such small and tardy action in Paine's favor was kept secret
from the President's new British and Federalist allies.* "Porcupine's Political Censor, for December, 1796.A
     Letter to the Infamous Tom.Paine, in answer to his letter
     to General Washington."For the rest it is a pity that Washington did not specify the "absolute
falsehoods" in Paine's pamphlet, if he meant the phrase to apply to
that.It might assist us in discovering just how the case stood in his
mind.He may have been indignant at the suggestion of his connivance
with Paine's imprisonment; but, as a matter of fact, the President had
been brought by his Minister into the conspiracy which so nearly cost
Paine his life.On a review of the facts, my own belief is that the heaviest part of
Paine's wrong came indirectly from Great Britain.It was probably one
more instance of Washington's inability to weigh any injustice against
an interest of this country.He ignored compacts of capitulation in the
cases of Burgoyne and Asgill, in the Revolution; and when convinced
that this nation must engage either in war or commercial alliance with
England he virtually broke faith with France.*

     * In a marginal note on Monroe's "View, etc.," found among
     his papers, Washington writes: "Did then the situation of
     our affairs admit of any other alternative than negotiation
     or war?"(Sparks' "Washington," xi., P- 505).Since writing
     my "Life of Randolph," in which the history of the British
     treaty is followed, I found in the French Archives ( Etats-
     Unis, vol.12) Minister Fauchet's report of a
     conversation with Secretary Randolph in which he (Randolph)
     said: "What would you have us do?We could not end our
     difficulties with the English but by a war or a friendly
     treaty.We were not prepared for war; it was necessary to
     negotiate."It is now tolerably certain that there was
     "bluff" on the part of the British players, in London and
     Philadelphia, but it won.To the new alliance he sacrificed his most faithful friends Edmund
Randolph and James Monroe; and to it, mainly, was probably due his
failure to express any interest in England's outlaw, Paine.For this
might gain publicity and offend the government with which Jay was
negotiating.Let justice add that he
included himself in the list of patriotic martyrdoms.he lost his old friends, lost the
confidence of his own State, incurred denunciations that, in his own
words, "could scarcely be applied to a Nero, a notorious defaulter,
or even to a common pickpocket."So he wrote before Paine's pamphlet
appeared, which, save in the personal matter, added nothing to
the general accusations.It is now forgotten that with one
exception--Johnson--no President ever went out of office so loaded with
odium as Washington.It was the penalty of Paine's power that, of the
thousand reproaches, his alone survived to recoil on his memory when
the issues and the circumstances that explain if they cannot justify
his pamphlet, are forgotten.It is easy for the Washington worshipper
of to-day to condemn Paine's pamphlet, especially as he is under no
necessity of answering it.But could he imagine himself abandoned to
long imprisonment and imminent death by an old friend and comrade, whose
letters of friendship he cherished, that friend avowedly able to protect
him, with no apparent explanation of the neglect but deference to an
enemy against whom they fought as comrades, an unprejudiced reader
would hardly consider Paine's letter unpardonable even where unjust.Its
tremendous indignation is its apology so far as it needs apology.A man
who is stabbed cannot be blamed for crying out.It is only in poetry
that dying Desdemonas exonerate even their deluded slayers.Paine, who
when he wrote these personal charges felt himself dying of an abscess
traceable to Washington's neglect, saw not Iago behind the President.His private demand for explanation, sent through Bache, was answered
only with cold silence."I have long since resolved," wrote Washington
to Governor Stone (December 6, 1795), "for the present time at least,
to let my calumniators proceed without any notice being taken of
their invectives by myself, or by any others with my participation or
knowledge."But now, nearly a year later, comes Paine's pamphlet, which
is not made up of invectives, but of statements of fact.If, in this
case, Washington sent, to one friend at least, Cobbett's answer to
Paine, despite its errors which he vaguely mentions, there appears no
good reason why he should not have specified those errors, and Paine's
also.By his silence, even in the confidence of friendship, the truth
which might have come to light was suppressed beyond his grave.For such
silence the best excuse to me imaginable is that, in ignorance of
the part Morris had acted, the President's mind may have been in
bewilderment about the exact facts.As for Paine's public letter, it was an answer to Washington's
unjustifiable refusal to answer his private one.It was the natural
outcry of an ill and betrayed man to one whom we now know to have been
also betrayed.Its bitterness and wrath measure the greatness of the
love that was wounded.The mutual personal services of Washington and
Paine had continued from the beginning of the American revolution to the
time of Paine's departure for Europe in 1787.Although he recognized, as
Washington himself did, the commander's mistakes Paine had magnified
his successes; his all-powerful pen defended him against loud charges
on account of the retreat to the Delaware, and the failures near
Philadelphia.In those days what "Common Sense" wrote was accepted
as the People's verdict.It is even doubtful whether the proposal to
supersede Washington might not have succeeded but for Paine's fifth
_Crisis_.*

     * "When a party was forming, in the latter end of seventy-
     seven and beginning of seventy-eight, of which John Adams
     was one, to remove Mr.Washington from the command of the
     army, on the complaint that he did nothing, I wrote the
     fifth number of the Crisis, and published it at Lancaster
     (Congress then being at Yorktown, in Pennsylvania), to ward
     off that meditated blow; for though I well knew that the
     black times of seventy-six were the natural consequence of
     his want of military judgment in the choice of positions
     into which the army was put about New York and New Jersey, I
     could see no possible advantage, and nothing but mischief,
     that could arise by distracting the army into parties, which
     would have been the case had the intended motion gone on."--
     Paine's Letter iii to the People of the United States
     (1802).The personal relations between the two had been even affectionate.We
find Paine consulting him about his projected publications at little
oyster suppers in his own room; and Washington giving him one of his
two overcoats, when Paine's had been stolen.Such incidents imply many
others never made known; but they are represented in a terrible epigram
found among Paine's papers,--"Advice to the statuary who is to execute
the statue of Washington."Take from the mine the coldest, hardest stone,
     It needs no fashion: it is Washington.But if you chisel, let the stroke be rude,
     And on his heart engrave--Ingratitude."Washington being dead, old memories may
have risen to restrain him; and he had learned more of the treacherous
influences around the great man which had poisoned his mind towards
other friends besides himself.For his pamphlet he had no apology to
make.It was a thing inevitable, volcanic, and belongs to the history of
a period prolific in intrigues, of which both Washington and Paine were
victims."THE AGE OF REASON"

The reception which the "Age of Reason" met is its sufficient
justification.The chief priests and preachers answered it with personal
abuse and slander, revealing by such fruits the nature of their tree,
and confessing the feebleness of its root, either in reason or human
affection.Lucian, in his "[--Greek--]" represents the gods as invisibly present
at a debate, in Athens, on their existence.Damis, who argues from the
evils of the world that there are no gods, is answered by Timocles, a
theological professor with large salary.The gods feel doleful, as the
argument goes against them, until their champion breaks out against
Damis,--"You blasphemous villain, you!The
chief of the gods takes courage, and exclaims: "Well done, Timocles!Begin, to reason and you
will be dumb as a fish."So was it in the age when the Twilight of the Gods was brought on by
faith in the Son of Man.Not very different was it when this Son of
Man, dehumanized by despotism, made to wield the thunderbolts of Jove,
reached in turn his inevitable Twilight.The man who pointed out the
now admitted survivals of Paganism in the despotic system then called
Christianity, who said, "the church has set up a religion of pomp and
revenue in the pretended imitation of a person whose life was
humility and poverty," was denounced as a sot and an adulterer.These
accusations, proved in this work unquestionably false, have accumulated
for generations, so that a mountain of prejudice must be tunnelled
before any reader can approach the "Age of Reason" as the work of an
honest and devout mind.It is only to irrelevant personalities that allusion is here made.Paine
was vehement in his arraignment of Church and Priesthood, and it was
fair enough for them to strike back with animadversions on Deism and
Infidelity.But it was no answer to an argument against the antiquity of
Genesis to call Paine a drunkard, had it been true.This kind of reply
was heard chiefly in America.In England it was easy for Paine's chief
antagonist, the Bishop of Llandaff, to rebuke Paine's strong language,
when his lordship could sit serenely in the House of Peers with
knowledge that his opponent was answered with handcuffs for every
Englishman who sold his book.But in America, slander had to take the
place of handcuffs.Paine is at times too harsh and militant.But in no case does he attack
any person's character.Nor is there anything in his language, wherever
objectionable, which I have heard censured when uttered on the side of
orthodoxy.It is easily forgotten that Luther desired the execution of
a rationalist, and that Calvin did burn a Socinian.The furious language
of Protestants against Rome, and of Presbyterians against the English
Church, is considered even heroic, like the invective ascribed to
Christ, "Generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of
hell!"Although vehement language grates on the ear of an age that
understands the real forces of evolution, the historic sense remembers
that moral revolutions have been made with words hard as cannon-balls.It was only when soft phrases about the evil of slavery, which
"would pass away in God's good time," made way for the abolitionist
denunciation of the Constitution as "an agreement with hell," that the
fortress began to fall.In other words, reforms are wrought by those who
are in earnest.* It is difficult in our time to place one's self in
the situation of a heretic of Paine's time.Darwin, who is buried
in Westminster, remembered the imprisonment of some educated men for
opinions far less heretical than his own.egoistic insanity
appears (1892) to have been inherited by an imperial descendant, and
should Germans be presently punished for their religion, as Paine's
early followers were in England, we shall again hear those words that
are the "half-battles" preceding victories.* "In writing upon this, as upon every other subject, I
     speak a language plain and intelligible.I deal not in hints
     and intimations.I have several reasons for this: first,
     that I may be clearly understood; secondly, that it may be
     seen I am in earnest; and thirdly, because it is an affront
     to truth to treat falsehood with complaisance."--Paine's
     reply to Bishop Watson.There is even greater difficulty in the appreciation by one generation
of the inner sense of the language of a past one.The common notion
that Paines "Age of Reason" abounds in "vulgarity" is due to the lack
of literary culture in those--probably few--who have derived that
impression from its perusal.It is the fate of all genius potent enough
to survive a century that its language will here and there seem coarse.The thoughts of Boccaccio, Rabelais, Shakespeare,--whose works are
commonly expurgated,--are so modern that they are not generally granted
the allowances conceded to writers whose ideas are as antiquated as
their words.Only the instructed minds can set their classic nudities in
the historic perspective that reveals their innocency and value.Paine's
book has done as much to modify human belief as any ever written.It is
one of the very few religious works of the last century which survives
in unsectarian circulation.It requires a scholarly perception to
recognize in its occasional expressions, by some called "coarse," the
simple Saxon of Nor-folkshire.Similar expressions abound in pious
books of the time; they are not censured, because they are not read.Priestley--found no
fault with Paine's words, though the former twice accuses his assertions
as "indecent."In both cases, however, Paine is pointing out some
biblical triviality or indecency--or what he conceived such.I have
before me original editions of both Parts of the "Age of Reason" printed
from Paine's manuscripts.Part First may be read by the most prudish
parent to a daughter, without an omission.In Part Second six or seven
sentences might be omitted by the parent, where the writer deals,
without the least prurience, with biblical narratives that can hardly be
daintily touched.Paine would have been astounded at the suggestion of
any impropriety in his expressions.He passes over four-fifths of the
passages in the Bible whose grossness he might have cited in support of
his objection to its immorality."Obscenity," he says, "in matters of
faith, however wrapped up, is always a token of fable and imposture; for
it is necessary to our serious belief in God that we do not connect it
with stories that run, as this does, into ludicrous interpretations.The
story [of the miraculous conception] is, upon the face of it, the same
kind of story as that of Jupiter and Leda."By R. Llandaff" [Dr.Another fostered prejudice supposes "The Age of Reason" largely made up
of scoffs.The Bishop of Llandaff, in his reply to Paine, was impressed
by the elevated Theism of the work, to portions of which he ascribed
"a philosophical sublimity."Watson apparently tried to constrain
his ecclesiastical position into English fair play, so that his actual
failures to do so were especially misleading, as many knew Paine only as
represented by this eminent antagonist.For instance, the Bishop says,
"Moses you term a coxcomb, etc."But Paine, commenting on Numbers xii.,
3, "Moses was very meek, above all men," had argued that Moses could
not have written the book, for "If Moses said this of himself he was a
coxcomb."Again the Bishop says Paine terms Paul "a fool."But Paine had
quoted from Paul, "'Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened
except it die.'To which [he says] one might reply in his own language,
and say, 'Thou fool, Paul, that which thou sowest is not quickened
except it die not.'"No intellect that knows the law of literature, that deep answers only
unto deep, can suppose that the effect of Paine's "Age of Reason," on
which book the thirty years' war for religious freedom in England was
won, after many martyrdoms, came from a scoffing or scurrilous work.It
is never Paine's object to raise a laugh; if he does so it is because
of the miserable baldness of the dogmas, and the ignorant literalism,
consecrated in the popular mind of his time.Through page after page he
peruses the Heavens, to him silently declaring the glory of God, and it
is not laughter but awe when he asks, "From whence then could arise the
solitary and strange conceit, that the Almighty, who had millions of
worlds equally dependent on his protection, should quit the care of all
the rest, and come to die in our world, because, they say, one man and
one woman had eaten an apple!"In another work Paine finds allegorical truth in the legend of Eden.The
comparative mythlogists of to-day, with many sacred books of the East,
can find mystical meaning and beauty in many legends of the Bible
wherein Paine could see none, but it is because of their liberation by
the rebels of last century from bondage to the pettiness of literalism.Paine sometimes exposes an absurdity with a taste easily questionable by
a generation not required like his own to take such things under foot
of the letter.But his spirit is never flippant, and the sentences that
might so seem to a casual reader are such as Browning defended in his
"Christmas Eve.""If any blames me,
     Thinking that merely to touch in brevity
     The topics I dwell on, were unlawful--
     Or, worse, that I trench, with undue levity,
     On the bounds of the Holy and the awful,
     I praise the heart, and pity the head of him,
     And refer myself to Thee, instead of him;
     Who head and heart alike discernest,
     Looking below light speech we utter,
     When the frothy spume and frequent sputter
     Prove that the soul's depths boil in earnest!"James Martineau, whose reverential spirit no one can question,
once raised a smile in his audience, of which the present writer was
one, by saying that the account of the temptation of Jesus, if true,
must have been reported by himself, or "by the only other party
present."Any allusion to the devil in our day excites a smile.But it
was not so in Paine's day, when many crossed themselves while speaking
of this dark prince.Paine has "too much respect for the moral character
of Christ" to suppose that he told the story of the devil showing him
all the kingdoms of the world."How happened it that he did not discover
America; or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any
interest?"This is not flippancy; it was by following the inkstand
Luther threw at the devil with equally vigorous humor that the grotesque
figure was eliminated, leaving the reader of to-day free to appreciate
the profound significance of the Temptation.How free Paine is from any disposition to play to pit or gallery, any
more than to dress circle, is shown in his treatment of the Book of
Jonah.It is not easy to tell the story without exciting laughter;
indeed the proverbial phrases for exaggeration,--"a whale," a "fish
story,"--probably came from Jonah.He says,
"it would have approached nearer to the idea of a miracle if Jonah had
swallowed the whale"; but this is merely in passing to an argument that
miracles, in the early world, would hardly have represented Divinity.Had the fish cast up Jonah in the streets of Nineveh the people would
probably have been affrighted, and fancied them both devils.But in the
second Part of the work there is a very impressive treatment of the Book
of Jonah.This too is introduced with a passing smile--"if credulity
could swallow Jonah and the whale it could swallow anything."But it
is precisely to this supposed "scoffer" that we owe the first
interpretation of the profound and pathetic significance of the book,
lost sight of in controversies about its miracle.Paine anticipates Baur
in pronouncing it a poetical work of Gentile origin.He finds in it the
same lesson against intolerance contained in the story of the reproof of
Abraham for piously driving the suffering fire-worshipper from his tent.(This story is told by the Persian Saadi, who also refers to Jonah: "And
now the whale swallowed Jonah: the sun set.")In the prophet mourning
for his withered gourd, while desiring the destruction of a city, Paine
finds a satire; in the divine rebuke he hears the voice of a true
God, and one very different from the deity to whom the Jews ascribed
massacres.The same critical acumen is shown in his treatment of the
Book of Job, which he believes to be also of Gentile origin, and much
admires.The large Paine Mythology cleared aside, he who would learn the
truth about this religious teacher will find in his way a misleading
literature of uncritical eulogies.Indeed the pious prejudices against
Paine have largely disappeared, as one may see by comparing the earlier
with the later notices of him in religious encyclopaedias.But though he
is no longer placed in an infernal triad as in the old hymn--"The world,
the devil, and Tom Paine"--and his political services are now candidly
recognized, he is still regarded as the propagandist of a bald
illiterate deism.This, which is absurdly unhistorical, Paine having
been dealt with by eminent critics of his time as an influence among the
educated, is a sequel to his long persecution.For he was relegated to
the guardianship of an unlearned and undiscriminating radicalism, little
able to appreciate the niceties of his definitions, and was gilded by
its defensive commonplaces into a figurehead.Paine therefore has now
to be saved from his friends more perhaps than from his enemies.It has
been shown on a former page that his governmental theories were of a
type peculiar in his time.Though such writers as Spencer, Frederic
Harrison, Bagehot, and Dicey have familiarized us with his ideas, few of
them have the historic perception which enables Sir George Trevelyan
to recognize Paine's connection with them.It must now be added that
Paine's religion was of a still more peculiar type.He cannot be classed
with deists of the past or theists of the present.Instead of being
the mere iconoclast, the militant assailant of Christian beliefs, the
"infidel" of pious slang, which even men who should know better suppose,
he was an exact thinker, a slow and careful writer, and his religious
ideas, developed through long years, require and repay study.The dedication of "The Age of Reason" places the work under the
"protection" of its authors fellow-citizens of the United States.To-day
the trust comes to many who really are such as Paine supposed all of his
countrymen to be,--just and independent lovers of truth and right.We shall see that his trust was not left altogether unfulfilled by
a multitude of his contemporaries, though they did not venture to do
justice to the man.Paine had idealized his countrymen, looking from
his prison across three thousand miles.But, to that vista of space, a
century of time had to be added before the book which fanatical Couthon
suppressed, and the man whom murderous Barrere sentenced to death, could
both be fairly judged by educated America."The Age of Reason" is in two Parts, published in successive years.These divisions are interesting as memorials of the circumstances
under which they were written and published,--in both cases with death
evidently at hand.But taking the two Parts as one work, there appears
to my own mind a more real division: a part written by Paine's century,
and another originating from himself.Each of these has an important and
traceable evolution.I. The first of these divisions may be considered, fundementally, as
a continuation of the old revolution against arbitrary authority.Carlyle's humor covers a profound insight when he remarks that Paine,
having freed America with his "Common Sense," was resolved to free this
whole world, and perhaps the other!All the authorities were and are
interdependent."If thou release this man thou art not Caesar's friend,"
cried the Priest to Pilate.The proconsul must face the fact that in
Judea Caesarism rests on the same foundation with Jahvism.Authority
leans on authority; none can stand alone.It is still a question whether
political revolutions cause or are caused by religious revolutions.Buckle maintained that the French Revolution was chiefly due to the
previous overthrow of spiritual authority; Rocquain, that the political
_regime_ was shaken before the philosophers arose.* In England religious
changes seem to have usually followed those of a political character,
not only in order of time, but in character.In beginning the "Age of
Reason," Paine says:

     * Felix Rocquain's fine work,  L'Esprit revolutionnaire
     avant la Revolution," though not speculative, illustrates
     the practical nature of revolution,--an uncivilized and
     often retrograde form of evolution."Soon after I had published the pamphlet 'Common Sense' in America I saw
the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government
would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion.The
adulterous connection of church and state, wherever it had taken place,
whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, had so effectually prohibited by
pains and penalties every discussion upon established creeds, and upon
first principles of religion, that until the system of government should
be changed those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before
the world; but that whenever this should be done a revolution in the
system of religion would follow.Human inventions and priestcraft
would be detected; and man would return to the pure, unmixed, and
unadulterated belief of one God and no more."The historical continuity of the critical negations of Paine with the
past is represented in his title.The Revolution of 1688,--the secular
arm transferring the throne from one family to another,--brought the
monarchical superstition into doubt; straightway the Christian authority
was shaken.One hundred years before Paine's book, appeared Charles Blount's
"Oracles of Reason."Macaulay describes Blount as the head of a small
school of "infidels," troubled with a desire to make converts; his
delight was to worry the priests by asking them how light existed before
the sun was made, and where Eve found thread to stitch her fig-leaves.But to this same Blount, Macaulay is constrained to attribute
emancipation of the press in England.Blount's title was taken up in America by Ethan Allen, leader of the
"Green Mountain Boys."Allen's "Oracles of Reason" is forgotten; he is
remembered by his demand (1775) for the surrender of Fort Ticonderoga,
"in the name of Jehovah and the Continental Congress."The last five
words of this famous demand would have been a better title for the
book.It introduces the nation to a Jehovah qualified by the
Continental Congress.Ethan Allen's deity is no longer a King of kings:
arbitrariness has disappeared; men are summoned to belief in a governor
administering laws inherent in the constitution of a universe co-eternal
with himself, and with which he is interdependent.His administration
is not for any divine glory, but, in anticipation of our constitutional
preamble, to "promote the general welfare."The old Puritan alteration
in the Lord's Prayer, "Thy Commonwealth come!"would in Allen's church
have been "Thy Republic come!"That is, had he admitted prayer, which
to an Executive is of course out of place.It must not, however, be
supposed that Ethan Allen is conscious that his system is inspired
by the Revolution.His book is a calm, philosophical analysis of New
England theology and metaphysics; an attempt to clear away the ancient
biblical science and set Newtonian science in its place; to found what
he conceives "Natural Religion."In editing his "Account of Arnold's Campaign in Quebec," John Joseph
Henry says in a footnote that Paine borrowed from Allen.But the aged
man was, in his horror of Paine's religion, betrayed by his memory.The
only connection between the books runs above the consciousness of either
writer.There was necessarily some resemblance between negations dealing
with the same narratives, but a careful comparison of the books leaves
me doubtful whether Paine ever read Allen.His title may have been
suggested by Blount, whose "Oracles of Reason" was in the library of
his assistant at Bor-dentown, John Hall.The works are distinct in aim,
products of different religious climes.Allen is occupied mainly with
the metaphysical, Paine with quite other, aspects of their common
subject.There is indeed a conscientious originality in the freethinkers
who successively availed themselves of the era of liberty secured by
Blount.Collins, Bolingbroke, Hume, Toland, Chubb, Woolston, Tindal,
Middleton, Annet, Gibbon,--each made an examination for himself, and
represents a distinct chapter in the religious history of England.Annet's "Free Inquirer," aimed at enlightenment of the lower classes,
proved that free thought was tolerated only as an aristocratic
privilege; the author was pilloried, just thirty years before the
cheapening of the "Rights of Man" led to Paine's prosecution.Probably
Morgan did more than any of the deists to prepare English ground for
Paine's sowing, by severely criticising the Bible by a standard
of civilized ethics, so far as ethics were civilized in the early
eighteenth century.But none of these writers touched the deep chord of
religious feeling in, the people.The English-speaking people were timid
about venturing too much on questions which divided the learned, and
were content to express their protest against the worldliness of the
Church and faithlessness to the lowly Saviour, by following pietists and
enthusiasts.The learned clergy, generally of the wealthy classes, were
largely deistical, but conservative.They gradually perceived that the
political and the theological authority rested on the same foundation.So between the deists and the Christians there was, as Leslie Stephen
says, a "comfortable compromise, which held together till Wesley from
one side, and Thomas Paine from another, forced more serious thoughts on
the age."*

     * "History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century."While "The Age of Reason" is thus, in one aspect, the product of its
time, the renewal of an old siege--begun far back indeed as Celsus,--its
intellectual originality is none the less remarkable.Paine is
more complete master of the comparative method than Tindal in his
"Christianity as old as the Creation."In his studies of "Christian
Mythology" (his phrase), one is surprised by anticipations of Baur
and Strauss.These are all the more striking by reason of his
homely illustrations.Thus, in discussing the liabilities of ancient
manuscripts to manipulation, he mentions in his second Part that in the
first, printed less than two years before, there was already a sentence
he never wrote; and contrasts this with the book of nature wherein
no blade of grass can be imitated or altered.* He distinguishes the
historical Jesus from the mythical Christ with nicety, though none had
previously done this.He is more discriminating than the early deists
in his explanations of the scriptural marvels which he discredits.There
was not the invariable alternative of imposture with which the orthodoxy
of his time had been accustomed to deal.He does indeed suspect Moses
with his rod of conjuring, and thinks no better of those who pretended
knowledge of future events; but the incredible narratives are
traditions, fables, and occasionally "downright lies."* The sentence imported into Paine's Part First is: "The
     book of Luke was carried by one voice only."I find the
     words added as a footnote in the Philadelphia edition, 1794,
     p.While Paine in Paris was utilizing the ascent of the
     footnote to his text, Dr.Priestley in Pennsylvania was
     using it to show Paine's untrustworthiness.("Letters to a
     Philosophical Unbeliever," p.But it would appear,
     though neither discovered it, that Paine's critic was the
     real offender.In quoting the page, before answering it,
     Priestley incorporated in the text the footnote of an
     American editor.Priestley could not of course imagine such
     editorial folly, but all the same the reader may here see
     the myth-insect already building the Paine Mythology."It is not difficult to discover the progress by which even simple
supposition, with the aid of credulity, will in time grow into a lie,
and at last be told as a fact; and wherever we can find a charitable
reason for a thing of this kind we ought not to indulge a severe one."Paine's use of the word "lies" in this connection is an archaism.Carlyle told me that his father always spoke of such tales as "The
Arabian Nights" as "downright lies"; by which he no doubt meant fables
without any indication of being such, and without any moral.Elsewhere
Paine uses "lie" as synonymous with "fabulous"; when he means by the
word what it would now imply, "wilful" is prefixed.In the Gospels he
finds "inventions" of Christian Mythologists--tales founded on
vague rumors, relics of primitive works of imagination mistaken for
history,--fathered upon disciples who did not write them.His treatment of the narrative of Christ's resurrection may be selected
as an example of his method.He rejects Paul's testimony, and his five
hundred witnesses to Christ's reappearance, because the evidence did not
convince Paul himself, until he was struck by lightning, or otherwise
converted.He finds disagreements in the narratives of the gospels,
concerning the resurrection, which, while proving there was no concerted
imposture, show that the accounts were not written by witnesses of the
events; for in this case they would agree more nearly.He finds in the
narratives of Christ's reappearances,--"suddenly coming in and going out
when doors are shut, vanishing out of sight and appearing again,"--and
the lack of details, as to his dress, etc., the familiar signs of a
ghost-story, which is apt to be told in different ways."Stories of this
kind had been told of the assassination of Julius Caesar, not many years
before, and they generally have their origin in violent deaths, or in
the execution of innocent persons.In cases of this kind compassion
lends its aid, and benevolently stretches the story.It goes on a little
and a little further, till it becomes a most certain truth.Once start
a ghost, and credulity fills up its life and assigns the cause of its
appearance."The moral and religious importance of the resurrection
would thus be an afterthought.The secrecy and privacy of the alleged
appearances of Christ after death are, he remarks, repugnant to the
supposed end of convincing the world.*

     * In 1778 Lessing set forth his "New Hypothesis of the
     Evangelists," that they had independently built on a basis
     derived from some earlier Gospel of the Hebrews,--a theory
     now confirmed by the recovered fragments of that lost
     Memoir, collected by Dr.It is tolerably certain that Paine was unacquainted with
     Lessing's work, when he became convinced, by variations in
     the accounts of the resurrection, that some earlier
     narrative "became afterwards the foundation of the four
     books ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,"--these
     being, traditionally eye-witnesses.Paine admits the power of the deity to make a revelation.He therefore
deals with each of the more notable miracles on its own evidence,
adhering to his plan of bringing the Bible to judge the Bible.Such an
investigation, written with lucid style and quaint illustration, without
one timid or uncandid sentence, coming from a man whose services and
sacrifices for humanity were great, could not have failed to give the
"Age of Reason" long life, even had these been its only qualities.Four
years before the book appeared, Burke said in Parliament: "Who, born
within the last forty years, has read one word of Collins, and
Toland, and Tindal, and Chubb, and Morgan, and the whole race who call
themselves freethinkers?"Paine was, in one sense, of this intellectual
pedigree; and had his book been only a digest and expansion of previous
negative criticisms, and a more thorough restatement of theism, these
could have given it but a somewhat longer life; the "Age of Reason" must
have swelled Burke's list of forgotten freethinking books.But there was
an immortal soul in Paine's book.It is to the consideration of this its
unique life, which has defied the darts of criticism for a century, and
survived its own faults and limitations, that we now turn.Paine's book is the uprising of the human heart against the
Religion of Inhumanity.This assertion may be met with a chorus of denials that there was, or
is, in Christendom any Religion of Inhumanity.And, if Thomas Paine is
enjoying the existence for which he hoped, no heavenly anthem would
be such music in his ears as a chorus of stormiest denials from earth
reporting that the Religion of Inhumanity is so extinct as to be
incredible.Nevertheless, the Religion of Inhumanity did exist, and
it defended against Paine a god of battles, of pomp, of wrath; an
instigator of race hatreds and exterminations; an establisher of
slavery; a commander of massacres in punishment of theological beliefs;
a sender of lying spirits to deceive men, and of destroying angels to
afflict them with plagues; a creator of millions of human beings under
a certainty of their eternal torture by devils and fires of his own
creation.This apotheosis of Inhumanity is here called a religion,
because it managed to survive from the ages of savagery by violence of
superstition, to gain a throne in the Bible by killing off all who did
not accept its authority to the letter, and because it was represented
by actual inhumanities.The great obstruction of Science and
Civilization was that the Bible was quoted in sanction of war, crusades
against alien religions, murders for witchcraft, divine right of
despots, degradation of reason, exaltation of credulity, punishment of
opinion and unbiblical discovery, contempt of human virtues and human
nature, and costly ceremonies before an invisible majesty, which,
exacted from the means of the people, were virtually the offering of
human sacrifices.There had been murmurs against this consecrated Inhumanity through the
ages, dissentients here and there; but the Revolution began with Paine.He was just the one man in the world who had
undergone the training necessary for this particular work.The higher clergy, occupied with the old textual controversy, proudly
instructing Paine in Hebrew or Greek idioms, little realized their
ignorance in the matter now at issue.Their ignorance had been too
carefully educated to even imagine the University in which words are
things, and things the word, and the many graduations passed between
Thetford Quaker meeting and the French Convention.What to scholastics,
for whom humanities meant ancient classics, were the murders and
massacres of primitive tribes, declared to be the word and work of God?But Paine had seen that
war-god at his work.In childhood he had seen the hosts of the Defender
of the Faith as, dripping with the blood of Culloden and Inverness, they
marched through Thetford; in manhood he had seen the desolations wrought
"by the grace of" that deity to the royal invader of America; he
had seen the massacres ascribed to Jahve repeated in France, while
Robespierre and Couthon were establishing worship of an infra-human
deity.By sorrow, poverty, wrong, through long years, amid revolutions
and death-agonies, the stay-maker's needle had been forged into a pen of
lightning.No Oxonian conductor could avert that stroke, which was
not at mere irrationalities, but at a huge idol worshipped with human
sacrifices.The creation of the heart of Paine, historically traceable,
is so wonderful, its outcome seems so supernatural, that in earlier ages
he might have been invested with fable, like some Avatar.Of some such
man, no doubt, the Hindu poets dreamed in their picture of young Arguna
(in the _Bhagavatgita_).The warrior, borne to the battlefield in his
chariot, finds arrayed against him his kinsmen, friends, preceptors.He bids his charioteer pause; he cannot fight those he loves.His
charioteer turns: 't is the radiant face of divine Chrishna, his
Saviour!Even He has led him to this grievous contention with kinsmen,
and those to whose welfare he was devoted.Chrishna instructs his
disciple that the war is an illusion; it is the conflict by which,
from age to age, the divine life in the world is preserved."This
imperishable devotion I declared to the sun, the sun delivered it to
Manu, Manu to Ikshaku; handed down from one to another it was studied by
the royal sages.In the lapse of time that devotion was lost.It is even
the same discipline which I this day communicate to thee, for thou
art my servant and my friend.Both thou and I have passed through many
births.Mine are known to me; thou knowest not of thine.I am made
evident by my own power: as often as there is a decline of virtue, and
an insurrection of wrong and injustice in the world, I appear."Paine could not indeed know his former births; and, indeed, each former
self of his--Wycliffe, Fox, Roger Williams--was sectarianized beyond
recognition.He could hardly see kinsmen in the Unitarians, who were
especially eager to disown the heretic affiliated on them by opponents;
nor in the Wesleyans, though in him was the blood of their apostle, who
declared salvation a present life, free to all.In a profounder sense,
Paine was George Fox.Here was George Fox disowned, freed from his
accidents, naturalized in the earth and humanized in the world of men.Paine is explicable only by the intensity of his Quakerism, consuming
its own traditions as once the church's ceremonies and sacraments.On
him, in Thetford meeting-house, rolled the burden of that Light that
enlighteneth every man, effacing distinctions of rank, race, sex, making
all equal, clearing away privilege, whether of priest or mediator,
subjecting all scriptures to its immediate illumination.This faith was a fearful heritage to carry, even in childhood, away from
the Quaker environment which, by mixture with modifying "survivals," in
habit and doctrine, cooled the fiery gospel for the average tongue.The intermarriage of Paine's father with a family in the English Church
brought the precocious boy's Light into early conflict with his kindred,
his little lamp being still fed in the meeting-house.A child brought up
without respect for the conventional symbols of religion, or even with
pious antipathy to them, is as if born with only one spiritual skin; he
will bleed at a touch."I well remember, when about seven or eight years of age, hearing
a sermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great devotee of the
Church, upon the subject of what is called _redemption by the death of
the Son of God_.After the sermon was ended I went into the garden,
and as I was going down the garden steps, (for I perfectly remember the
spot), I revolted at the recollection of what I had heard, and thought
to myself that it was making God Almighty act like a passionate man,
that killed his son when he could not revenge himself in any other way;
and, as I was sure a man would be hanged that did such a thing, I could
not see for what purpose they preached such sermons.This was not one of
that kind of thoughts that had anything in it of childish levity; it was
to me a serious reflection, arising from the idea I had, that God was
too good to do such an action, and also too almighty to be under any
necessity of doing it.I believe in the same manner at this moment; and
I moreover believe that any system of religion that has anything in it
which shocks the mind of a child, cannot be a true system."The child took his misgivings out into the garden; he would not by a
denial shock his aunt Cocke's faith as his own had been shocked.For
many years he remained silent in his inner garden, nor ever was drawn
out of it until he found the abstract dogma of the death of God's Son an
altar for sacrificing men, whom he reverenced as all God's sons.What he
used to preach at Dover and Sandwich cannot now be known.His ignorance
of Greek and Latin, the scholastic "humanities," had prevented his
becoming a clergyman, and introduced him to humanities of another kind.His mission was then among the poor and ignorant.*

     * "Old John Berry, the late Col.Hay's servant, told me he
     knew Paine very well when he was at Dover--had heard him
     preach there--thought him a staymaker by trade."--W.Weedon,
     of Glynde, quoted in Notes and Queries (London), December
     29, 1866.Sixteen years later he is in Philadelphia, attending the English Church,
in which he had been confirmed.There were many deists in that Church,
whose laws then as now were sufficiently liberal to include them.In his
"Common Sense" (published January 10, 1776) Paine used the reproof of
Israel (I. Samuel) for desiring a King.John Adams, a Unitarian and
monarchist, asked him if he really believed in the inspiration of the
Old Testament.Paine said he did not, and intended at a later period to
publish his opinions on the subject.There was nothing inconsistent in
Paine's believing that a passage confirmed by his own Light was a
divine direction, though contained in a book whose alleged inspiration
throughout he did not accept.Before
that, soon after his arrival in the country, when he found African
Slavery supported by the Old Testament, Paine had repudiated the
authority of that book; he declares it abolished by "Gospel light,"
which includes man-stealing among the greatest crimes.When, a year
later, on the eve of the Revolution, he writes "Common Sense," he has
another word to say about religion, and it is strictly what the human
need of the hour demands.Whatever his disbeliefs, he could never
sacrifice human welfare to them, any more than he would, suffer dogmas
to sacrifice the same.It would have been a grievous sacrifice of the
great cause of republican independence, consequently, of religious
liberty, had he introduced a theological controversy at the moment
when it was of vital importance that the sects should rise above their
partition-walls and unite for a great common end.The Quakers, deistical
as they were, preserved religiously the separatism once compulsory; and
Paine proved himself the truest Friend among them when he was "moved"
by the Spirit of Humanity, for him at length the Holy Spirit, to utter
(1776) his brave cheer for Catholicity."As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of all
governments to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know
of no other business which government hath to do therewith.Let a man
throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle,
which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and
he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head.Suspicion is the
companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society.For myself,
I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty
that there should be a diversity of religious opinions amongst us: it
affords a larger field for our Christian kindness.Were we all of
one way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter
for probation; and, on this liberal principle, I look on the various
denominations among us to be like children of the same family, differing
only in what is called their Christian names."There was no pedantry whatever about Paine, this obedient son of
Humanity.He would defend Man against men, against sects and parties;
he would never quarrel about the botanical label of a tree bearing such
fruits as the Declaration of Independence.But no man better knew the
power of words, and that a botanical error may sometimes result in
destructive treatment of the tree.For this reason he censured the
Quakers for opposing the Revolution on the ground that, in the words
of their testimony (1776), "the setting up and putting down kings and
governments is God's peculiar prerogative."Kings, he answers, are not
removed by miracles, but by just such means as the Americans were using.Mary travelled to the garden.Charles, then, died not by the hands of
man; and should the present proud imitator of him come to the same
untimely end, the writers and publishers of the Testimony are bound, by
the doctrine it contains, to applaud the fact."In his "Epistle to Quakers" he speaks of the
dispersion of the Jews as "foretold by our Saviour."In his famous first
_Crisis_ he exhorts the Americans not to throw "the burden of the day
upon Providence, but'show your faith by your works,' that God may bless
you."For in those days there was visible to such eyes as his, as to
anti-slavery eyes in our civil war,

     "A fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel."The Republic, not American but Human, became Paine's religion."Divine
Providence intends this country to be the asylum of persecuted
virtue from every quarter of the globe."So he had written before the
Declaration of Independence.In 1778 he finds that there still survives
some obstructive superstition among English churchmen in America about
the connection of Protestant Christianity with the King.In his seventh
_Crisis_(November 21, 1778) he wrote sentences inspired by his new
conception of religion."In a Christian and philosophical sense, mankind seem to have stood
still at individual civilization, and to retain as nations all the
original rudeness of nature.... As individuals we profess ourselves
Christians, but as nations we are heathens, Romans, and what not.I
remember the late Admiral Saunders declaring in the House of Commons,
and that in the time of peace, 'That the city of Madrid laid in ashes
was not a sufficient atonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder
of an English sloop of war.'...The arm of Britain has been spoken of as
the arm of the Almighty, and she has lived of late as if she thought
the whole world created for her diversion.Her politics, instead
of civilizing, has tended to brutalize mankind, and under the vain
unmeaning title of 'Defender of the Faith,' she has made war like an
Indian on the Religion of Humanity."'Thus, forty years before Auguste Comte sat, a youth of twenty, at the
feet of Saint Simon, learning the principles now known as "The Religion
of Humanity,"* Thomas Paine had not only minted the name, but with it
the idea of international civilization, in which nations are to treat
each other as gentlemen in private life.National honor was, he said,
confused with "bullying"; but "that which is the best character for an
individual is the best character for a nation."The great and pregnant
idea was, as in the previous instances, occasional.It was a sentence
passed upon the "Defender-of-the-Faith" superstition, which detached
faith from humanity, and had pressed the Indian's tomahawk into the
hands of Jesus.Thaddeus B. Wakeman, an eminent representative of the
     "Religion of Humanity," writes me that he has not found this
     phrase in any work earlier than Paine's _Crisis_, vii.At the close of the American Revolution there appeared little need for
a religious reformation.The people were happy, prosperous, and, there
being no favoritism toward any sect under the new state constitutions,
but perfect equality and freedom, the Religion of Humanity meant
sheathing of controversial swords also.It summoned every man to lend a
hand in repairing the damages of war, and building the new nationality.Paine therefore set about constructing his iron bridge of thirteen
symbolic ribs, to overleap the ice-floods and quicksands of rivers.His
assistant in this work, at Bordentown, New Jersey, John Hall, gives us
in his journal, glimpses of the religious ignorance and fanaticism of
that region.But Paine showed no aggressive spirit towards them."My
employer," writes Hall (1786), "has _Common Sense_ enough to disbelieve
most of the common systematic theories of Divinity, but does not seem
to establish any for himself."In all of his intercourse with Hall (a
Unitarian just from England), and his neighbors, there is no trace
of any disposition to deprive any one of a belief, or to excite any
controversy.Humanity did not demand it, and by that direction he left
the people to their weekly toils and Sunday sermons.But when (1787) he was in England, Humanity gave another command.It was
obeyed in the eloquent pages on religious liberty and equality in "The
Rights of Man."Burke had alarmed the nation by pointing out that the
Revolution in France had laid its hand on religion.The cry was raised
that religion was in danger.Paine then uttered his impressive paradox:

"Toleration is not the opposite of intoleration, but the counterfeit
of it.The one assumes the right of withholding
liberty of conscience, and the other of granting it.The one is the pope
armed with fire and <DW19>, the other is the pope selling or granting
indulgences.... Toleration by the same assumed authority by which it
tolerates a man to pay his worship, presumptuously and blasphemously
sets itself up to tolerate the Almighty to receive it.... Who then art
thou, vain dust and ashes, by whatever name thou art called, whether a
king, a bishop, a church or a state, a parliament or anything else, that
obtrudest thine insignificance between the soul of man and his maker?If he believes not as thou believest, it is a
proof that thou believest not as he believeth, and there is no earthly
power can determine between you.... Religion, without regard to names,
as directing itself from the universal family of mankind to the divine
object of all adoration, is man bringing to his maker the fruits of his
heart; and though these fruits may differ like the fruits of the earth,
the grateful tribute of every one is accepted."This, which I condense with reluctance, was the affirmation which the
Religion of Humanity needed in England.But when he came to sit in the
French Convention a new burden rolled upon him.There was Marat with the
Bible always before him, picking out texts that justified his murders;
there were Robespierre and Couthon invoking the God of Nature to
sanction just such massacres as Marat found in his Bible; and there were
crude "atheists" consecrating the ferocities of nature more dangerously
than if they had named them Siva, Typhon, or Satan.Paine had published
the rights of man for men; but here human hearts and minds had been
buried under the superstitions of ages.The great mischief had ensued,
to use his own words, "by the possession of power before they understood
principles: they earned liberty in words but not in fact" Exhumed
suddenly, as if from some Nineveh, resuscitated into semi-conscious
strength, they remembered only the methods of the allied inquisitors and
tyrants they were overthrowing; they knew no justice but vengeance; and
when on crumbled idols they raised forms called "Nature" and "Reason,"
old idols gained life in the new forms.These were the gods which had
but too literally created, by the slow evolutionary force of human
sacrifices, the new revolutionary priesthood.Their massacres could not
be questioned by those who acknowledged the divine hand in the slaughter
of Canaanites.*

     * On August 10, 1793, there was a sort of communion of the
     Convention around the statue of Nature, whose breasts were
     fountains of water.Herault de Sechelles, at that time
     president, addressed the statue: "Sovereign of the savage
     and of the enlightened nations, O Nature, this great people,
     gathered at the first beam of day before thee, is free!It
     is in thy bosom, it is in thy sacred sources, that it has
     recovered its rights, that it has regenerated itself after
     traversing so many ages of error and servitude: it must
     return to the simplicity of thy ways to rediscover liberty
     and equality.receive the expression of the
     eternal attachment of the French people for thy laws; and
     may the teeming waters gushing from thy breasts, may this
     pure beverage which refreshed the first human beings,
     consecrate in this Cup of Fraternity and Equality the vows
     that France makes thee this day,--the most beautiful that
     the sun has illumined since it was suspended in the
     immensity of space."The cup passed around from lip to lip,
     amid fervent ejaculations.Next year Nature's breasts
     issued Herault's blood.The Religion of Humanity again issued its command to its minister.The
"Age of Reason" was written, in its first form, and printed in French."Couthon," says Lanthenas, "to whom I sent it, seemed offended with me
for having translated it"* Couthon raged against the priesthood, but
could not tolerate a work which showed vengeance to be atheism, and
compassion--not merely for men, but for animals--true worship of God.*  The letter of Lanthenas to Merlin de Thionville, of which
     the original French is before me, is quoted in an article in
     Scribner, September, 1880, by Hon.E. B. Washbarne (former
     Minister to France); it is reprinted in Remsburg's
     compilation of testimonies: "Thomas Paine, the Apostle of
     Religions and Political Liberty" (1880).135
     of this volume.On the other hand, Paine's opposition to atheism would appear to have
brought him into danger from another quarter, in which religion could
not be distinguished from priestcraft.In a letter to Samuel Adams Paine
says that he endangered his life by opposing the king's execution, and
"a second time by opposing atheism."Those who denounce the "Age of
Reason" may thus learn that red-handed Couthon, who hewed men to pieces
before his Lord, and those who acknowledged no Lord, agreed with
them.Under these menaces the original work was as I have inferred,
suppressed.But the demand of Humanity was peremptory, and Paine
re-wrote it all, and more.When it appeared he was a prisoner; his
life was in Couthon's hands.He had personally nothing to gain by its
publication--neither wife, child, nor relative to reap benefit by its
sale.It was published as purely for the good of mankind as any work
ever written.Nothing could be more simply true than his declaration,
near the close of life:

"As in my political works my motive and object have been to give man an
elevated sense of his own character, and free him from the slavish and
superstitious absurdity of monarchy and hereditary government, so, in my
publications on religious subjects, my endeavors have been directed
to bring man to a right use of the reason that God has given him; to
impress on him the great principles of divine morality, justice, and
mercy, and a benevolent disposition to all men, and to all creatures;
and to inspire in him a spirit of trust, confidence and consolation, in
his Creator, unshackled by the fables of books pretending to be the word
of God."It is misleading at the present day to speak of Paine as an opponent
of Christianity.This would be true were Christianity judged by the
authorized formulas of any church; but nothing now acknowledged as
Christianity by enlightened Christians of any denomination was known
to him.In our time, when the humanizing wave, passing through all
churches, drowns old controversies, floats the dogmas, till it seems
ungenerous to quote creeds and confessions in the presence of our
"orthodox" lovers of man--even "totally depraved" and divinely doomed
man--the theological eighteenth century is inconceivable.Could one
wander from any of our churches, unless of the Christian Pagans or
remote villagers (_pagani_), into those of the last century, he would
find himself moving in a wilderness of cinders, with only the plaintive
song of John and Charles Wesley to break the solitude.If he would hear
recognition of the human Jesus, on whose credit the crowned Christ is
now maintained, he would be sharply told that it were a sin to "know
Christ after the flesh," and must seek such recognition among those
stoned as infidels.Three noble and pathetic tributes to the Man of
Nazareth are audible from the last century--those of Rousseau, Voltaire,
and Paine.From its theologians and its pulpits not one!Should the
tribute of Paine be to-day submitted, without his name, to our most
eminent divines, even to leading American and English Bishops, beside
any theological estimate of Christ from the same century, the Jesus of
Paine would be surely preferred.Should our cultured Christian of to-day press beyond those sectarian,
miserable controversies of the eighteenth century, known to him now as
cold ashes, into the seventeenth century, he would find himself in a
comparatively embowered land; that is, in England, and in a few oases
in America--like that of Roger Williams in Rhode Island.In England he
would find brain and heart still in harmony, as in Tillotson and South;
still more in Bishop Jeremy Taylor, "Shakespeare of divines."He would
hear this Jeremy reject the notions of original sin and transmitted
guilt, maintain the "liberty of prophesying," and that none should
suffer for conclusions concerning a book so difficult of interpretation
as the Bible.In those unsophisticated years Jesus and the disciples
and the Marys still wore about them the reality gained in miracle-plays.What Paine need arise where poets wrote the creed, and men knew the
Jesus of whom Thomas Dekker wrote:

                    "The best of men
     That e'er wore earth about him was a sufferer;
     A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit,
     The first true gentleman that ever breathed."Dean Swift, whose youth was nourished in that living age, passed into
the era of dismal disputes, where he found the churches "dormitories of
the living as well as of the dead."Some ten years before Paine's birth
the Dean wrote: "Since the union of Divinity and Humanity is the great
Article of our Religion, 't is odd to see some clergymen, in their
writings of Divinity, wholly devoid of Humanity."Men have, he said,
enough religion to hate, but not to love.Had the Dean lived to the
middle of the eighteenth century he might have discovered exceptions
to this holy heartlessness, chiefly among those he had traditionally
feared--the Socinians.These, like the Magdalene, were seeking the lost
humanity of Jesus.He would have sympathized with Wesley, who escaped
from "dormitories of the living" far enough to publish the Life of a
Socinian (Firmin), with the brave apology, "I am sick of opinions, give
me the life."But Socianism, in eagerness to disown its bolder children,
presently lost the heart of Jesus, and when Paine was recovering it the
best of them could not comprehend his separation of the man from the
myth.So came on the desiccated Christianity of which Emerson said,
even among the Unitarians of fifty years ago, "The prayers and even the
dogmas of our church are like the zodiac of Denderah, wholly insulated
from anything now extant in the life and business of the people."Emerson may have been reading Paine's idea that Christ and the Twelve
were mythically connected with Sun and Zodiac, this speculation being
an indication of their distance from the Jesus he tenderly revered.If
Paine rent the temple-veils of his time, and revealed the stony images
behind them, albeit with rudeness, let it not be supposed that those
forms were akin to the Jesus and the Marys whom skeptical criticism is
re-incarnating, so that they dwell with us.Outside Paine's heart the
Christ of his time was not more like the Jesus of our time than Jupiter
was like the Prometheus he bound on a rock.The English Christ was not
the Son of Man, but a Prince of Dogma, bearing handcuffs for all who
reasoned about him; a potent phantasm that tore honest thinkers
from their families and cast them into outer darkness, because they
circulated the works of Paine, which reminded the clergy that the Jesus
even of their own Bible sentenced those only who ministered not to the
hungry and naked, the sick and in prison.There the brain had retreated to deistic caves, the heart had
gone off to "Salvationism" of the time; the churches were given over
to the formalist and the politician, who carried divine sanction to the
repetition of biblical oppressions and massacres by Burke and Pitt.And
in all the world there had not been one to cry _Sursum Corda_ against
the consecrated tyranny until that throb of Paine's heart which
brought on it the vulture.But to-day, were we not swayed by names and
prejudices, it would bring on that prophet of the divine humanity, even
the Christian dove.Soon after the appearance of Part First of the "Age of Reason" it
was expurgated of its negative criticisms, probably by some English
Unitarians, and published as a sermon, with text from Job xi., 7: "Canst
thou by searching find out God?Canst thou find out the Almighty to
perfection?"It was printed anonymously; and were its sixteen pages
read in any orthodox church to-day it would be regarded as admirable.It might be criticised by left wings as somewhat old-fashioned in the
warmth of its theism.It is fortunate that Paine's name was not appended
to this doubtful use of his work, for it would have been a serious
misrepresentation.*

     * "A Lecture on the Existence and Attributes of the Deity,
     as Deduced from a Contemplation of His Works.The copy in my possession is inscribed with pen: "This was
     J. Joyce's copy, and noticed by him as Paine's work."It is probable that the
     suppression of Paine's name was in deference to his
     outlawry, and to the dread, by a sect whose legal position
     was precarious, of any suspicion of connection with
     "Painite" principles.That his Religion of Humanity took the deistical form was an
evolutionary necessity.English deism was not a religion, but at first a
philosophy, and afterwards a scientific generalization.Its founder, as
a philosophy, Herbert of Cherbury, had created the matrix in which
was formed the Quaker religion of the "inner light," by which Paine's
childhood was nurtured; its founder as a scientific theory of creation,
Sir Isaac Newton, had determined the matrix in which all unorthodox
systems should originate.The real issue was between a sanctified
ancient science and a modern science.The utilitarian English race,
always the stronghold of science, had established the freedom of the
new deism, which thus became the mould into which all unorthodoxies ran.From the time of Newton, English and American thought and belief have
steadily become Unitarian.The dualism of Jesus, the thousand years
of faith which gave every soul its post in a great war between God
and Satan, without which there would have been no church, has steadily
receded before a monotheism which, under whatever verbal disguises,
makes the deity author of all evil.English Deism prevailed only to be
reconquered into alliance with a tribal god of antiquity, developed
into the tutelar deity of Christendom.And this evolution involved the
transformation of Jesus into Jehovah, deity of a "chosen" or "elect"
people.It was impossible for an apostle of the international republic,
of the human brotherhood, whose Father was degraded by any notion of
favoritism to a race, or to a "first-born son," to accept a name in
which foreign religions had been harried, and Christendom established on
a throne of thinkers' skulls.The philosophical and scientific deism of
Herbert and Newton had grown cold in Paine's time, but it was detached
from all the internecine figure-heads called gods; it appealed to the
reason of all mankind; and in that manger, amid the beasts, royal and
revolutionary, was cradled anew the divine humanity.Paine wrote "Deism" on his banner in a militant rather than an
affirmative way.He was aiming to rescue the divine Idea from
traditional degradations in order that he might with it confront a
revolutionary Atheism defying the celestial monarchy.In a later work,
speaking of a theological book, "An Antidote to Deism," he remarks: "An
antidote to Deism must be Atheism."So far as it is theological, the
"Age of Reason" was meant to combat Infidelity.It raised before the
French the pure deity of Herbert, of Newton, and other English deists
whose works were unknown in France.But when we scrutinize Paine's
positive Theism we find a distinctive nucleus forming within the
nebulous mass of deistical speculations.Paine recognizes a deity only
in the astronomic laws and intelligible order of the universe, and in
the corresponding reason and moral nature of man.Like Kant, he was
filled with awe by the starry heavens and man's sense of right*.The
first part of the "Age of Reason" is chiefly astronomical; with those
celestial wonders he contrasts such stories as that of Samson and the
foxes."When we contemplate the immensity of that Being who directs and
governs the incomprehensible Whole, of which the utmost ken of human
sight can discover but a part, we ought to feel shame at calling such
paltry stories the word of God."Then turning to the Atheist he says:
"We did not make ourselves; we did not make the principles of science,
which we discover and apply but cannot alter."The only revelation of
God in which he believes is "the universal display of himself in the
works of creation, and that repugnance we feel in ourselves to bad
actions, and disposition to do good ones.""The only idea we can have
of serving God, is that of contributing to the happiness of the living
creation that God has made."* Astronomy, as we know, he had studied profoundly.In early
     life he had studied astronomic globes, purchased at the cost
     of many a dinner, and the orrery(sp), and attended lectures
     at the Royal Society.In the "Age of Reason" he writes,
     twenty-one years before Herschel's famous paper on the
     Nebulae: "The probability is that each of those fixed stars
     is also a sun, round which another system of worlds or
     planets, though too remote for as to discover, performs its
     revolutions."It thus appears that in Paine's Theism the deity is made manifest, not
by omnipotence, a word I do not remember in his theories, but in this
correspondence of universal order and bounty with rcason and conscience,
and the humane heart In later works this speculative side of his Theism
presented a remarkable Zoroastrian variation.When pressed with Bishop
Butler's terrible argument against previous Deism,--that the God of
the Bible is no more cruel than the God of Nature,--Paine declared his
preference for the Persian religion, which exonerated the deity from
responsibility for natural evils, above the Hebrew which attributed
such things to God.He was willing to sacrifice God's omnipotence to
his humanity.He repudiates every notion of a devil, but was evidently
unwilling to ascribe the unconquered realms of chaos to the divine Being
in whom he believed.Thus, while theology was lowering Jesus to a mere King, glorying in
baubles of crown and throne, pleased with adulation, and developing
him into an authorizor of all the ills and agonies of the world, so
depriving him of his humanity, Paine was recovering from the universe
something like the religion of Jesus himself."Why even of yourselves
judge ye not what is right" In affirming the Religion of Humanity, Paine
did not mean what Comte meant, a personification of the continuous life
of our race*; nor did he merely mean benevolence towards all living
creatures.* Paine's friend and fellow-prisoner, Anacharsis Clootz, was
     the first to describe Humanity as "L'Etre Supreme."He affirmed a Religion based on the authentic divinity of that which
is supreme in human nature and distinctive of it The sense of right,
justice, love, mercy, is God himself in man; this spirit judges all
things,--all alleged revelations, all gods.In affirming a deity too
good, loving, just, to do what is ascribed to Jahve, Paine was animated
by the same spirit that led the early believer to turn from heartless
elemental gods to one born of woman, bearing in his breast a human
heart.Pauline theology took away this human divinity, and effected a
restoration, by making the Son of Man Jehovah, and commanding the heart
back from its seat of judgment, where Jesus had set it."Shall the clay
say to the potter, why hast thou formed me thus?""Yes," answered
Paine, "if the thing felt itself hurt, and could speak."He knew as did
Emerson, whom he often anticipates, that "no god dare wrong a worm."The force of the "Age of Reason" is not in its theology, though this
ethical variation of Deism in the direction of humanity is of exceeding
interest to students who would trace the evolution of avatars and
incarnations.Paine's theology was but gradually developed, and in this
work is visible only as a tide beginning to rise under the fiery orb of
his religious passion."If the
belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief, it would make no part
of the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them."He evinces regret
that the New Testament, containing so many elevated moral precepts,
should, by leaning on supposed prophecies in the Old Testament, have
been burdened with its barbarities."It must follow the fate of its
foundation."This fatal connection, he knows, is not the work of Jesus;
he ascribes it to the church which evoked from the Old Testament a
crushing system of priestly and imperial power reversing the benign
principles of Jesus.It is this oppression, the throne of all
oppressions, that he assails.His affirmations of the human deity are
thus mainly expressed in his vehement denials.This long chapter must now draw to a close.It would need a volume to
follow thoroughly the argument of this epoch-making book, to which
I have here written only an introduction, calling attention to its
evolutionary factors, historical and spiritual.Such then was the new
Pilgrim's Progress.As in that earlier prison, at Bedford, there shone
in Paine's cell in the Luxembourg a great and imperishable vision, which
multitudes are still following.The Christian teacher of to-day may well ponder this fact.The atheists
and secularists of our time are printing, reading, revering a work that
opposes their opinions.For above its arguments and criticisms they see
the faithful heart contending with a mighty Apollyon, girt with all the
forces of revolutionary and Royal Terrorism.Just this one Englishman,
born again in America, confronting George III.and Robespierre on earth
and tearing the like of them from the throne of the universe!Were it
only for the grandeur of this spectacle in the past Paine would maintain
his hold on thoughtful minds.But in America the hold is deeper than that.In this self-forgetting
insurrection of the human heart against deified Inhumanity there is an
expression of the inarticulate wrath of humanity against continuance of
the same wrong.In the circulation throughout the earth of the Bible as
the Word of God, even after its thousand serious errors of translation
are turned, by exposure, into falsehoods; in the deliverance to savages
of a scriptural sanction of their tomahawks and poisoned arrows; in the
diffusion among cruel tribes of a religion based on human sacrifice,
after intelligence has abandoned it; in the preservation of costly
services to a deity who "needs nothing at men's hands," beside hovels
of the poor who need much; in an exemption of sectarian property from
taxation which taxes every man to support the sects, and continues the
alliance of church and state; in these things, and others--the list is
long--there is still visible, however refined, the sting and claw of the
Apollyon against whom Paine hurled his far-reaching dart.The "Age of
Reason" was at first published in America by a religious house, and as
a religious book.It was circulated in Virginia by Washington's old
friend, Parson Weems.It is still circulated, though by supposed
unbelievers, as a religious book, and such it is.Its religion is expressed largely in those same denunciations which
theologians resent.I have explained them; polite agnostics apologize
for them, or cast Paine over as a Jonah of the rationalistic ship.But
to make one expression more gentle would mar the work.As it stands,
with all its violences and faults, it represents, as no elaborate or
polite treatise could, the agony and bloody sweat of a heart breaking in
the presence of crucified Humanity.What dear heads, what noble hearts
had that man seen laid low; what shrieks had he heard in the desolate
homes of the Condorcets, the Brissots; what Canaanite and Midianite
massacres had he seen before the altar of Brotherhood, erected by
himself!And all because every human being had been taught from his
cradle that there is something more sacred than humanity, and to which
man should be sacrificed.Of all those mas-sacred thinkers not one voice
remains: they have gone silent: over their reeking guillotine sits
the gloating Apollyon of Inhumanity.But here is one man, a prisoner,
preparing for his long silence.He alone can speak for those slain
between the throne and the altar.In these outbursts of laughter and
tears, these outcries that think not of literary style, these appeals
from surrounding chaos to the starry realm of order, from the tribune of
vengeance to the sun shining for all, this passionate horror of cruelty
in the powerful which will brave a heartless heaven or hell with its
immortal indignation,--in all these the unfettered mind may hear the
wail of enthralled Europe, sinking back choked with its blood, under the
chain it tried to break.So long as a link remains of the same chain,
binding reason or heart, Paine's "Age of Reason" will live.It is not a
mere book--it is a man's heart.FRIENDSHIPS

Baron Pichon, who had been a sinuous Secretary of Legation in America
under Genet and Fauchet, and attached to the Foreign Office in France
under the Directory, told George Ticknor, in 1837, that "Tom Paine, who
lived in Monroe's house at Paris, had a great deal too much influence
over Monroe."*

     *  "Life of George Ticknor," ii., p.223

The Baron, apart from his prejudice against republicanism (Talleyrand
was his master), knew more about American than French politics at the
time of Monroe's mission in France.The agitation caused in France
by Jay's negotiations in England, and rumors set afloat by their
secrecy,--such secrecy being itself felt as a violation of good
faith--rendered Monroe's position unhappy and difficult.After Paine's
release from prison, his generous devotion to France, undiminished
by his wrongs, added to the painful illness that reproached the
Convention's negligence, excited a chivalrous enthusiasm for him.Monroe for him, the fact that this faithful
friend of France was in their house, were circumstances of international
importance.Of Paine's fidelity to republican principles, and his
indignation at their probable betrayal in England, there could be no
doubt in any mind.He was consulted by the French Executive, and was
virtually the most important _attache_ of the United States Legation.The "intrigue" of which Thibaudeau had spoken, in Convention, as having
driven Paine from that body, was not given to the public, but it was
well understood to involve the American President.If Paine's suffering
represented in London Washington's deference to England, all the more
did he stand to France as a representative of those who in America
were battling for the Alliance.He was therefore a tower of strength
to Monroe.It will be seen by the subjoined letter that while he was
Monroe's guest it was to him rather than the Minister that the Foreign
Office applied for an introduction of a new Consul to Samuel Adams,
Governor of Massachusetts--a Consul with whom Paine was not personally
acquainted.The general feeling and situation in France at the date of
this letter (March 6th), and the anger at Jay's secret negotiations in
England, are reflected in it:

"My Dear Friend,--Mr.Mozard, who is appointed Consul, will present you
this letter.He is spoken of here as a good sort of man, and I can have
no doubt that you will find him the same at Boston.When I came from
America it was my intention to return the next year, and I have intended
the same every year since.The case I believe is, that as I am embarked
in the revolution, I do not like to leave it till it is finished,
notwithstanding the dangers I have run.I am now almost the only
survivor of those who began this revolution, and I know not how it is
that I have escaped.I know however that I owe nothing to the government
of America.The executive department has never directed either the
former or the present Minister to enquire whether I was dead or alive,
in prison or in liberty, what the cause of the imprisonment was, and
whether there was any service or assistance it could render.Monroe
acted voluntarily in the case, and reclaimed me as an American citizen;
for the pretence for my imprisonment was that I was a foreigner, born in
England."The internal scene here from the 31 of May 1793 to the fall of
Robespierre has been terrible.I was shut up in the prison of the
Luxembourg eleven months, and I find by the papers of Robespierre
that have been published by the Convention since his death, that I
was designed for a worse fate.The following memorandum is in his own
handwriting; 'Demander que Thomas Paine soit decrete d'accusation pour
les interets de l'Amerique autant que de la France.'"You will see by the public papers that the successes of the French arms
have been and continue to be astonishing, more especially since the fall
of Robespierre, and the suppression of the system of Terror.They
have fairly beaten all the armies of Austria, Prussia, England, Spain,
Sardignia, and Holland.Holland is entirely conquered, and there is now
a revolution in that country."I know not how matters are going on your side the water, but I think
everything is not as it ought to be.The appointment of G. Morris to
be Minister here was the most unfortunate and the most injudicious
appointment that could be made.Jefferson at
the time, and I said the same to Morris.Had he not been removed at
the time he was I think the two countries would have been involved in a
quarrel, for it is a fact, that he would either have been ordered away
or put in arrestation; for he gave every reason to suspect that he was
secretly a British Emissary.Jay is about in England I know not; but is it possible that
any man who has contributed to the Independence of America, and to free
her from the tyranny of the British Government, can read without shame
and indignation the note of Jay to Grenville?That the _United States
has no other resource than in the justice and magnanimity of his
Majesty_, is a satire upon the Declaration of Independence, and exhibits
[such] a spirit of meanness on the part of America, that, were it true,
I should be ashamed of her.Such a declaration may suit the spaniel
character of Aristocracy, but it cannot agree with manly character of a
Republican.Mozard is this moment come for this letter, and he sets off
directly.--God bless you, remember me among the circle of our friends,
and tell them how much I wish to be once more among them."*

     * Mr.Spofford, Librarian of Congress, has kindly copied
     this letter for me from the original, among the papers of
     George Bancroft.There are indications of physical feebleness as well as haste in this
letter.The spring and summer brought some vigor, but, as we have seen
by Monroe's letter to Judge Jones, he sank again and in the autumn
seemed nearing his end.Once more the announcement of his death appeared
in England, this time bringing joy to the orthodox.From the same
quarter, probably, whence issued, in 1793, "Intercepted Correspondence
from Satan to Citizen Paine," came now ( 1795 ) a folio sheet: "Glorious
News for Old England.The British Lyon rous'd; or John Bull for ever."The Fox has lost his Tail
     The Ass has done his Braying,
     The Devil has got Tom Paine."Good-hearted as Paine was, it must be admitted that he was cruelly
persistent in disappointing these British obituaries.Despite anguish,
fever, and abscess--this for more than a year eating into his side,--he
did not gratify those prayerful expectations by becoming a monument of
divine retribution.Nay, amid all these sufferings he had managed to
finish Part Second of the "Age of Reason," write the "Dissertation on
Government," and give the Address before the Convention, Nevertheless
when, in November, he was near death's door, there came from England
tidings grievous enough to crush a less powerful constitution.It was
reported that many of his staunchest old friends had turned against
him on account of his heretical book.This report seemed to find
confirmation in the successive volumes of Gilbert Wakefield in reply to
the two Parts of Paine's book.Wakefield held Unitarian opinions, and
did not defend the real fortress besieged by Paine.He was enraged that
Paine should deal with the authority of the Bible, and the orthodox
dogmas, as if they were Christianity, ignoring unorthodox versions
altogether.This, however, hardly explains the extreme and coarse
vituperation of these replies, which shocked Wakefield's friends.*

     * "The office of 'castigation' was unworthy of our friend's
     talents, and detrimental to his purpose of persuading
     others.Such a contemptuous treatment, even of an unfair
     disputant, was also too well calculated to depredate in the
     public estimation that benevolence of character by which Mr.--"Life of Gilbert
     Wakefield," 1804, ii., p.Although in his thirty-eighth year at this time, Wakefield was not old
enough to escape the _sequelae_ of his former clericalism.He had been a
Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, afterwards had a congregation, and
had continued his connection with the English Church after he was
led, by textual criticism, to adopt Unitarian opinions.He had
great reputation as a linguist, and wrote Scriptural expositions and
retranslations.But few read his books, and he became a tutor in a
dissenting college at Hackney, mainly under influence of the Unitarian
leaders, Price and Priestley.Wakefield would not condescend to any
connection with a dissenting society, and his career at Hackney was
marked by arrogant airs towards Unitarians, on account of a university
training, then not open to dissenters.He attacked Price and Priestley,
his superiors in every respect, apart from their venerable position
and services, in a contemptuous way; and, in fact, might be brevetted a
prig, with a fondness for coarse phrases, sometimes printed with blanks.He flew at Paine as if he had been waiting for him; his replies, not
affecting any vital issue, were displays of linguistic and textual
learning, set forth on the background of Paine's page, which he
blackened.He exhausts his large vocabulary of vilification on a book
whose substantial affirmations he concedes; and it is done in the mean
way of appropriating the credit of Paine's arguments.Gilbert Wakefield was indebted to the excitement raised by Paine for
the first notice taken by the general public of anything he ever
wrote.Paine, however, seems to have been acquainted with a sort of
autobiography which he had published in 1792.In this book Wakefield
admitted with shame that he had subscribed the Church formulas when he
did not believe them, while indulging in flings at Price, Priestley, and
others, who had suffered for their principles.At the same time there
were some things in Wakefield's autobiography which could not fail to
attract Paine: it severely attacked slavery, and also the whole course
of Pitt towards France.It
was consequently a shock when Gilbert Wakefield's outrageous abuse
of himself came to the invalid in his sick-room.It appeared to be an
indication of the extent to which he was abandoned by the Englishmen
who had sympathized with his political principles, and to a large extent
with his religious views.This acrimonious repudiation added groans to
Paine's sick and sinking heart, some of which were returned upon his
Socinian assailant, and in kind.This private letter my reader must
see, though it was meant for no eye but that of Gilbert Wakefield.It is
dated at Paris, November 19, 1795."Dear Sir,--When you prudently chose, like a starved apothecary,
to offer your eighteenpenny antidote to those who had taken my
two-and-sixpenny Bible-purge,* you forgot that although my dose
was rather of the roughest, it might not be the less wholesome for
possessing that drastick quality; and if I am to judge of its salutary
effects on your infuriate polemic stomach, by the nasty things it has
made you bring away, I think you should be the last man alive to take
your own panacea.As to the collection of words of which you boast the
possession, nobody, I believe, will dispute their amount, but every one
who reads your answer to my 'Age of Reason' will wish there were not so
many scurrilous ones among them; for though they may be very usefull
in emptying your gallbladder they are too apt to move the bile of other
people.* These were the actual prices of the books."Those of Greek and Latin are rather foolishly thrown away, I think, on
a man like me, who, you are pleased to say, is 'the greatest ignoramus
in nature': yet I must take the liberty to tell you, that wisdom does
not consist in the mere knowledge of language, but of things."You recommend me to _know myself_--a thing very easy to advise, but
very difficult to practice, as I learn from your own book; for you take
yourself to be a meek disciple of Christ, and yet give way to passion
and pride in every page of its composition."You have raised an ant-hill about the roots of my sturdy oak, and it
may amuse idlers to see your work; but neither its body nor its branches
are injured by you; and I hope the shade of my Civic Crown may be able
to preserve your little contrivance, at least for the season."When you have done as much service to the world by your writings, and
suffered as much for them, as I have done, you will be better entitled
to dictate: but although I know you to be a keener politician than Paul,
I can assure you, from my experience of mankind, that you do not much
commend the Christian doctrines to them by announcing that it requires
the labour of a learned life to make them understood."May I be permitted, after all, to suggest that your truly vigorous
talents would be best employed in teaching men to preserve their
liberties exclusively,--leaving to that God who made their immortal
souls the care of their eternal welfare."I am, dear Sir,

"Your true well-wisher,

"Tho.After a first perusal of this letter has made its unpleasant impression,
the reader will do well to read it again.Paine has repaired to his
earliest Norfolk for language appropriate to the coarser tongue of his
Nottinghamshire assailant; but it should be said that the offensive
paragraph, the first, is a travesty of one written by Wakefield.In his
autobiography, after groaning over his books that found no buyers,
a veritable "starved apothecary," Wakefield describes the uneasiness
caused by his pamphlet on "Religious Worship" as proof that the disease
was yielding to his "potion."He says that "as a physician of spiritual
maladies" he had seconded "the favourable operation of the first
prescription,"--and so forth.Paine, in using the simile, certainly
allows the drugs and phials of his sick-room to enter it to a
disagreeable extent, but we must bear in mind that we are looking over
his shoulder.We must also, by the same consideration of its privacy,
mitigate the letter's egotism.Wakefield's ant-hill protected by
the foliage, the "civic crown," of Paine's oak which it has
attacked,--gaining notice by the importance of the work it
belittles,--were admirable if written by another; and the egotism is
not without some warrant.It is the rebuke of a scarred veteran of the
liberal army to the insults of a subaltern near twenty years his junior.It was no doubt taken to heart For when the agitation which Gilbert
Wakefield had contributed to swell, and to lower, presently culminated
in handcuffs for the circulators of Paine's works, he was filled with
anguish.He vainly tried to resist the oppression, and to call back the
Unitarians, who for twenty-five years continued to draw attention from
their own heresies by hounding on the prosecution of Paine's adherents.*

     * "But I would not forcibly suppress this book ["Age of
     Reason"]; much less would I punish (O my God, be such
     wickedness far from me, or leave me destitute of thy favour
     in the midst of this perjured and sanguinary generation!)much less would I punish, by fine or imprisonment, from any
     possible consideration, the publisher or author of these
     pages."--Letter of Gilbert Wakefield to Sir John Scott,
     Attorney General, 1798.For evidence of Unitarian
     intolerance see the discourse of W, J. Fox on "The Duties of
     Christians towards Deists" (Collected Works, vol.In
     this discourse, October 24, 1819, on the prosecution of
     Carlile for publishing the "Age of Reason," Mr.Fox
     expresses his regret that the first prosecution should have
     been conducted by a Unitarian."Goaded," he says, "by the
     calumny which would identify them with those who yet reject
     the Saviour, they have, in repelling so unjust an
     accusation, caught too much of the tone of their opponents,
     and given the most undesirable proof of their affinity to
     other Christians by that unfairness towards the disbeliever
     which does not become any Christian."Fox
     became the champion of all the principles of "The Age of
     Reason" and "The Rights of Man."The prig perished; in his place stood a martyr of the freedom bound up
with the work he had assailed.Paine's other assailant, the Bishop of
Llandaff, having bent before Pitt, and episcopally censured the humane
side he once espoused, Gilbert Wakefield answered him with a boldness
that brought on him two years' imprisonment When he came out of prison
(1801) he was received with enthusiasm by all of Paine's friends, who
had forgotten the wrong so bravely atoned for.Had he not died in the
same year, at the age of forty-five, Gilbert Wakefield might have become
a standard-bearer of the freethinkers.Paine's recovery after such prolonged and perilous suffering was a
sort of resurrection.In April (1796) he leaves Monroe's house for the
country, and with the returning life of nature his strength is steadily
recovered.What to the man whose years of anguish, imprisonment,
disease, at last pass away, must have been the paths and hedgerows of
Versailles, where he now meets the springtide, and the more healing
sunshine of affection!Risen from his thorny bed of pain--

     "The meanest floweret of the vale,
     The simplest note that swells the gale,
     The common sun, the air, the skies,
     To him are opening paradise."So had it been even if nature alone had surrounded him.But Paine had
been restored by the tenderness and devotion of friends.Had it not been
for friendship he could hardly have been saved.We are little able, in
the present day, to appreciate the reverence and affection with which
Thomas Paine was regarded by those who saw in him the greatest apostle
of liberty in the world.Elihu Palmer spoke a very general belief when
he declared Paine "probably the most useful man that ever existed upon
the face of the earth."This may sound wild enough on the ears of those
to whom Liberty has become a familiar drudge.There was a time when she
was an ideal Rachel, to win whom many years of terrible service were
not too much; but now in the garish day she is our prosaic Leah,--a
serviceable creature in her way, but quite unromantic.In Paris there
were ladies and gentlemen who had known something of the cost of
Liberty,--Colonel and Mrs.Monroe, Sir Robert and Lady Smith, Madame
Lafayette, Mr.Barlow, M. and Madame De Bonneville.They
had known what it was to watch through anxious nights with terrors
surrounding them.He who had suffered most was to them a sacred person.He had come out of the succession of ordeals, so weak in body, so
wounded by American ingratitude, so sore at heart, that no delicate
child needed more tender care.Set those ladies and their charge a
thousand years back in the poetic past, and they become Morgan le Fay,
and the Lady Nimue, who bear the wounded warrior away to their Avalon,
there to be healed of his grievous hurts.Men say their Arthur is dead,
but their love is stronger than death.And though the service of
these friends might at first have been reverential, it had ended with
attachment, so great was Paine's power, so wonderful and pathetic his
memories, so charming the play of his wit, so full his response to
kindness.One especially great happiness awaited him when he became convalescent.Sir Robert Smith, a wealthy banker in Paris, made his acquaintance, and
he discovered that Lady Smith was no other than "The Little Corner of
the World," whose letters had carried sunbeams into his prison.* An
intimate friendship was at once established with Sir Robert and his
lady, in whose house, probably at Versailles, Paine was a guest after
leaving the Monroes.To Lady Smith, on discovering her, Paine addressed
a poem,--"The Castle in the Air to the Little Corner of the World":

     * Sir Robert Smith (Smythe in the Peerage List) was born in
     1744, and married, first, Miss Blake of London (1776).The
     name of the second Lady Smith, Paine's friend, before her
     marriage I have not ascertained."In the region of clouds, where the whirlwinds arise,
     My Castle of Fancy was built;
     The turrets reflected the blue from the skies,
     And the windows with sunbeams were gilt."The rainbow sometimes, in its beautiful state,
     Enamelled the mansion around;
     And the figures that fancy in clouds can create
     Supplied me with gardens and ground."I had grottos, and fountains, and orange-tree groves,
     I had all that enchantment has told;
     I had sweet shady walks for the gods and their loves,
     I had mountains of coral and gold."But a storm that I felt not had risen and rolled,
     While wrapped in a slumber I lay;
     And when I looked out in the morning, behold,
     My Castle was carried away.Mary went to the office."It passed over rivers and valleys and groves,
     The world it was all in my view;
     I thought of my friends, of their fates, of their loves,
     And often, full often, of you."At length it came over a beautiful scene,
     That nature in silence had made;
     The place was but small, but't was sweetly serene,
     And chequered with sunshine and shade."I gazed and I envied with painful good will,
     And grew tired of my seat in the air;
     When all of a sudden my Castle stood still,
     As if some attraction were there."Like a lark from the sky it came fluttering down,
     And placed me exactly in view,
     When whom should I meet in this charming retreat
     This corner of calmness, but--you."Delighted to find you in honour and ease,
     I felt no more sorrow nor pain;
     But the wind coming fair, I ascended the breeze,
     And went back with my Castle again."The kindness that rescued him from death was
followed by the friendship that beguiled him from horrors of the past.From gentle ladies he learned that beyond the Age of Reason lay the
forces that defeat Giant Despair."To reason [so he writes to Lady Smith] against feelings is as vain as
to reason against fire: it serves only to torture the torture, by adding
reproach to horror.All reasoning with ourselves in such cases acts upon
us like the reasoning of another person, which, however kindly done,
serves but to insult the misery we suffer.If Reason could remove the
pain, Reason would have prevented it.If she could not do the one, how
is she to perform the other?In all such cases we must look upon Reason
as dispossessed of her empire, by a revolt of the mind.She retires to a
distance to weep, and the ebony sceptre of Despair rules alone.All that
Reason can do is to suggest, to hint a thought, to signify a wish, to
cast now and then a kind of bewailing look, to hold up, when she
can catch the eye, the miniature shaded portrait of Hope; and though
dethroned, and can dictate no more, to wait upon us in the humble
station of a handmaid."The mouth of the rescued and restored captive was filled with song.Several little poems were circulated among his friends, but not printed;
among them the following:

"Contentment; or, if you please, Confession.Barlow, on
her pleasantly telling the author that, after writing against the
superstition of the Scripture religion, he was setting up a religion
capable of more bigotry and enthusiasm, and more dangerous to its
votaries--that of making a religion of Love._

     "O could we always live and love,
     And always be sincere,
     I would not wish for heaven above,
     My heaven would be here."Though many countries I have seen,
     And more may chance to see,
     My Little Corner of the World
     Is half the world to me."The other half, as you may guess,
     America contains;
     And thus, between them, I possess
     The whole world for my pains."I'm then contented with my lot,
     I can no happier be;
     For neither world I'm sure has got
     So rich a man as me."Then send no fiery chariot down
     To take me off from hence,
     But leave me on my heavenly ground--
     This prayer is _common sense_."Let others choose another plan,
     I mean no fault to find;
     The true theology of man
     Is happiness of mind."Paine gained great favor with the French government and fame throughout
Europe by his pamphlet, "The Decline and Fall of the English System of
Finance," in which he predicted the suspension of the Bank of England,
which followed the next year.He dated the pamphlet April 8th, and the
Minister of Foreign Affairs is shown, in the Archives of that office, to
have ordered, on April 27th, a thousand copies.It was translated in all
the languages of Europe, and was a terrible retribution for the forged
assignats whose distribution in France the English government had
considered a fair mode of warfare.This translation "into all the
languages of the continent" is mentioned by Ralph Broome, to whom the
British government entrusted the task of answering the pamphlet.* As
Broome's answer is dated June 4th, this circulation in six or seven
weeks is remarkable, The proceeds were devoted by Paine to the relief of
prisoners for debt in Newgate, London.**

     * "Observations on Mr.Broome
     escapes the charge of prejudice by speaking of "Mr.Paine,
     whose abilities I admire and deprecate in a breath."Paine's
     pamphlet was also replied to by George Chalmers ("Oldys")
     who had written the slanderous biography.** Richard Carlile's sketch of Paine, p.This large
     generosity to English sufferers appears the more
     characteristic beside the closing paragraph of Paine's
     pamphlet, "As an individual citizen of America, and as far
     as an individual can go, I have revenged (if I may use the
     expression without any immoral meaning) the piratical
     depredations committed on American commerce by the English
     government.I have retaliated for France on the subject of
     finance: and I conclude with retorting on Mr.Pitt the
     expression he used against France, and say, that the English
     system of finance 'is en the verge, nay even in the gulf of
     bankruptcy.'"Concerning the false French assignats forged in  England,
     see  Louis Blanc's "History of the Revolution," vol.xii.,
     p.The concentration of this pamphlet on its immediate subject, which made
it so effective, renders it of too little intrinsic interest in the
present day to delay us long, especially as it is included in all
editions of Paine's works.It possesses, however, much biographical
interest as proving the intellectual power of Paine while still but a
convalescent.He never wrote any work involving more study and mastery
of difficult details.It was this pamphlet, written in Paris, while
"Peter Porcupine," in America, was rewriting the slanders of "Oldys,"
which revolutionized Cobbett's opinion of Paine, and led him to try and
undo the injustice he had wrought.It now so turned out that Paine was able to repay all the kindnesses he
had received.The relations between the French government and Monroe,
already strained, as we have seen, became in the spring of 1796 almost
intolerable.The Jay treaty seemed to the French so incredible that,
even after it was ratified, they believed that the Representatives would
refuse the appropriation needed for its execution.But when tidings came
that this effort of the House of Representatives had been crushed by a
menaced _coup d'etat_, the ideal America fell in France, and was broken
in fragments.Monroe could now hardly have remained save on the credit
of Paine with the French.There was, of course, a fresh accession of
wrath towards England for this appropriation of the French alliance.Paine had been only the first sacrifice on the altar of the new
alliance; now all English families and all Americans in Paris except
himself were likely to become its victims.The English-speaking
residents there made one little colony, and Paine was sponsor for them
all.His fatal blow at English credit proved the formidable power of the
man whom Washington had delivered up to Robespierre in the interest of
Pitt.So Paine's popularity reached its climax; the American Legation
found through him a _modus vivendi_ with the French government; the
families which had received and nursed him in his weakness found in his
intimacy their best credential.Joel Barlow especially, while her
husband was in Algeria, on the service of the American government, might
have found her stay in Paris unpleasant but for Paine s friendship.The
importance of his guarantee to the banker, Sir Robert Smith, appears by
the following note, written at Versailles, August 13th:

"Citizen Minister: The citizen Robert Smith, a very particular friend
of mine, wishes to obtain a passport to go to Hamburg, and I will be
obliged to you to do him that favor.Himself and family have lived
several years in France, for he likes neither the government nor the
climate of England.He has large property in England, but his Banker
in that country has refused sending him remittances.This makes it
necessary for him to go to Hamburg, because from there he can draw his
money out of his Banker's hands, which he cannot do whilst in France.His family remains in France.--_Salut et fraternite._

"Thomas Paine."Amid his circle of cultured and kindly friends Paine had dreamed of a
lifting of the last cloud from his life, so long overcast.His eyes were
strained to greet that shining sail that should bring him a response to
his letter of September to Washington, in his heart being a great hope
that his apparent wrong would be explained as a miserable mistake,
and that old friendship restored.As the reader knows, the hope was
grievously disappointed.The famous public letter to Washington (August
3d), which was not published in France, has already been considered, in
advance of its chronological place.It will be found, however, of more
significance if read in connection with the unhappy situation, in which
all of Paine's friends, and all Americans in Paris, had been brought
by the Jay treaty.From their point of view the deliverance of Paine to
prison and the guillotine was only one incident in a long-planned and
systematic treason, aimed at the life of the French republic.Jefferson
in America, and Paine in France, represented the faith and hope of
republicans that the treason would be overtaken by retribution and
reversal.* Soon after Jefferson became President Paine wrote to him,
     suggesting that Sir Robert's firm might be safely depended
     on as the medium of American financial transactions in
     Europe.THEOPHILANTHROPY

In the ever-recurring controversies concerning Paine and his "Age
of Reason" we have heard many triumphal claims.Christianity and
the Church, it is said, have advanced and expanded, unharmed by such
criticisms.But there are several fallacies implied in
this mode of dealing with the religious movement caused by Paine's work.It assumes that Paine was an enemy of all that now passes under the name
of Christianity--a title claimed by nearly a hundred and fifty different
organizations, with some of which (as the Unitarians, Universalists,
Broad Church, and Hick-site Friends) he would largely sympathize.It
further assumes that he was hostile to all churches, and desired or
anticipated their destruction.Paine desired and
anticipated their reformation, which has steadily progressed.At the
close of the "Age of Reason" he exhorts the clergy to "preach something
that is edifying, and from texts that are known to be true.""The Bible of the creation is inexhaustible in texts.Every part of
science, whether connected with the geometry of the universe, with
the systems of animal and vegetable life, or with the properties of
inanimate matter, is a text for devotion as well as for philosophy--for
gratitude as for human improvement.It will perhaps be said, that, if
such a revolution in the system of religion takes place, every preacher
ought to be a philosopher.And every house of devotion
a school of science.It has been by wandering, from the immutable laws
of science, and the right use of reason, and setting up an invented
thing called revealed religion, that so many wild and blasphemous
conceits nave been formed of the Almighty.The Jews have made him the
assassin of the human species, to make room for the religion of the
Jews.The Christians have made him the murderer of himself, and the
founder of a new religion, to supersede and expel the Jewish religion.And to find pretence and admission for these things they must have
supposed his power and his wisdom imperfect, or his will changeable; and
the changeableness of the will is the imperfection of the judgment.The
philosopher knows that the laws of the Creator have never changed
with respect either to the principles of science, or the properties of
matter.Why then is it to be supposed they have changed with respect to
man?"To the statement that Christianity has not been impeded by the "Age of
Reason," it should be added that its advance has been largely due to
modifications rendered necessary by that work.The unmodified dogmas
are represented in small and eccentric communities.The advance has
been under the Christian name, with which Paine had no concern; but
to confuse the word "Christianity" with the substance it labels is
inadmissible.George and the Dragon; but
English culture has reduced the saint and dragon to a fable.The special wrath with which Paine is still visited, above all other
deists put together, or even atheists is a tradition from a so-called
Christianity which his work compelled to capitulate.That system is
now nearly extinct, and the vendetta it bequeathed should now end.The
capitulation began immediately with the publication of the Bishop of
Llandaff's "Apology for the Bible," a title that did not fail to attract
notice when it appeared (1796).There were more than thirty replies to
Paine, but they are mainly taken out of the Bishop's "Apology," to which
they add nothing.It is said in religious encyclopedias that Paine was
"answered" by one and another writer, but in a strict sense Paine was
never answered, unless by the successive surrenders referred to.As Bishop Watson's "Apology" is adopted by most authorities as the
sufficient "answer," it may be here accepted as a representative of the
rest.Whether Paine's points dealt with by the Bishop are answerable
or not, the following facts will prove how uncritical is the prevalent
opinion that they were really answered.Watson concedes generally to Paine the discovery of some "real
difficulties" in the Old Testament, and the exposure, in the Christian
grove, of "a few unsightly shrubs, which good men had wisely concealed
from public view" (p.* It is not Paine that here calls some
"sacred" things unsightly, and charges the clergy with concealing
them--it is the Bishop.Among the particular and direct concessions made
by the Bishop are the following:

     * Corey's edition.That Moses may not have written every part of the Pentateuch.Some
passages were probably written by later hands, transcribers or editors
(pp.[If human reason and scholarship are admitted to detach
any portions, by what authority can they be denied the right to bring
all parts of the Pentateuch, or even the whole Bible, under their human
judgment?]The law in Deuteronomy giving parents the right, under certain
circumstances, to have their children stoned to death, is excused only
as a "humane restriction of a power improper to be lodged with any
parent" (p.[Granting the Bishop's untrue assertion, that the same
"improper" power was arbitrary among the Romans, Gauls, and Persians,
why should it not have been abolished in Israel?Watson
possessed the right to call any law established in the Bible "improper,"
how can Paine be denounced for subjecting other things in the book
to moral condemnation?The moral sentiment is not an episcopal
prerogative.]The Bishop agrees that it is "the opinion of many learned men and
good Christians" that the Bible, though authoritative in religion, is
fallible in other respects, "relating the ordinary history of the times"
(p.[What but human reason, in the absence of papal authority, is
to draw the line between the historical and religious elements in the
Bible?]It is conceded that "Samuel did not write any part of the second book
bearing his name, and only a part of the first" (p.[One of many
blows dealt by this prelate at confidence in the Bible.]It is admitted that Ezra contains a contradiction in the estimate
of the numbers who returned from Babylon; it is attributed to a
transcriber's mistake of one Hebrew figure for another (p.[Paine's
question here had been: "What certainty then can there be in the Bible
for anything"?It is no answer to tell him how an error involving a
difference of 12,542 people may perhaps have occurred.]It is admitted that David did not write some of the Psalms ascribed
to him (p."It is acknowledged that the order of time is not everywhere
observed" [in Jeremiah]; also that this prophet, fearing for his life,
suppressed the truth [as directed by King Zedekiah]."He was under
no obligation to tell the whole [truth] to men who were certainly his
enemies and no good subjects of the king" (pp.[But how can it
be determined how much in Jeremiah is the "word of God," and how much
uttered for the casual advantage of himself or his king?]It is admitted that there was no actual fulfilment of Ezekie's
prophecy, "No foot of man shall pass through it [Egypt], nor foot of
beast shall pass through it, for forty years" (p.The discrepancies between the genealogies of Christ, in Matthew and
Luke, are admitted: they are explained by saying that Matthew gives the
genealogy of Joseph, and Luke that of Mary; and that Matthew commits "an
error" in omitting three generations between Joram and Ozias (p.[Paine had asked, why might not writers mistaken in the natural
genealogy of Christ be mistaken also in his celestial genealogy?Such are some of the Bishop's direct admissions.There are other admissions in his silences and evasions.For instance,
having elaborated a theory as to how the error in Ezra might occur, by
the close resemblance of Hebrew letters representing widely different
numbers, he does not notice Nehemiah's error in the same matter, pointed
out by Paine,--a self-contradiction, and also a discrepancy with Ezra,
which could not be explained by his theory.He says nothing about
several other contradictions alluded to by Paine.The Bishop's evasions
are sometimes painful, as when he tries to escape the force of Paine's
argument, that Paul himself was not convinced by the evidences of the
resurrection which he adduces for others.The Bishop says: "That Paul
had so far resisted the evidence which the apostles had given of the
resurrection and ascension of Jesus, as to be a persecutor of the
disciples of Christ, is certain; but I do not remember the place where
he declares that he had not believed them."But when Paul says, "I
verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to
the name of Jesus of Nazareth," surely this is inconsistent with his
belief in the resurrection and ascension.Paul declares that when it
was the good pleasure of God "to reveal his Son in me," immediately he
entered on his mission.He "was not disobedient to the heavenly vision."Clearly then Paul had not been convinced of the resurrection and
ascension until he saw Christ in a vision.In dealing with Paine's moral charges against the Bible the Bishop has
left a confirmation of all that I have said concerning the Christianity
of his time.An "infidel" of to-day could need no better moral arguments
against the Bible than those framed by the Bishop in its defence.He
justifies the massacre of the Canaanites on the ground that they were
sacrificers of their own children to idols, cannibals, addicted to
unnatural lust Were this true it would be no justification; but as no
particle of evidence is adduced in support of these utterly unwarranted
and entirely fictitious accusations, the argument now leaves the
massacre without any excuse at all.The extermination is not in the
Bible based on any such considerations, but simply on a divine command
to seize the land and slay its inhabitants.No legal right to the land
is suggested in the record; and, as for morality, the only persons
spared in Joshua's expedition were a harlot and her household, she
having betrayed her country to the invaders, to be afterwards exalted
into an ancestress of Christ.Of the cities destroyed by Joshua it is
said: "It was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel
in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have
no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses"
(Joshua xi., 20).As their hearts were thus in Jehovah's power for
hardening, it may be inferred that they were equally in his power for
reformation, had they been guilty of the things alleged by the Bishop.With these things before him, and the selection of Rahab for mercy
above all the women in Jericho--every woman slain save the harlot who
delivered them up to slaughter--the Bishop says: "The destruction of the
Canaanites exhibits to all nations, in all ages, a signal proof of God's
displeasure against sin."The Bishop rages against Paine for supposing that the commanded
preservation of the Midianite maidens, when all males and married women
were slain, was for their "debauchery.""Prove this, and I will allow that Moses was the horrid monster you make
him--prove this, and I will allow that the Bible is what you call it--'a
book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy'--prove this, or excuse my
warmth if I say to you, as Paul said to Elymas the sorcerer, who sought
to turn away Sergius Paulus from the faith, 'O full of all subtilty,
and of all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all
righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the
Lord?'--I did not, when I began these letters, think that I should
have been moved to this severity of rebuke, by anything you could
have written; but when so gross a misrepresentation is made of God's
proceedings, coolness would be a crime."And what does my reader suppose is the alternative claimed by the
prelate's foaming mouth?The maidens, he declares, were not reserved for
debauchery, but for slavery!Little did the Bishop foresee a time when, of the two suppositions,
Paine's might be deemed the more lenient.The subject of slavery was
then under discussion in England, and the Bishop is constrained to add,
concerning this enslavement of thirty-two thousand maidens, from
the massacred families, that slavery is "a custom abhorrent from our
manners, but everywhere practised in former times, and still practised
in countries where the benignity of the Christian religion has not
softened the ferocity of human nature."Thus, Jehovah is represented
as not only ordering the wholesale murder of the worshippers of another
deity, but an adoption of their "abhorrent" and inhuman customs.This connection of the deity of the Bible with "the ferocity of human
nature" in one place, and its softening in another, justified Paine's
solemn rebuke to the clergy of his time."Had the cruel and murderous orders with which the Bible is filled,
and the numberless torturing executions of men, women, and children, in
consequence of those orders, been ascribed to some friend whose memory
you revered, you would have glowed with satisfaction at detecting the
falsehood of the charge, and gloried in defending his injured fame.It is because ye are sunk in the cruelty of superstition, or feel no
interest in the honor of your Creator, that ye listen to the horrid
tales of the Bible, or hear them with callous indifference."This is fundamentally what the Bishop has to answer, and of course he
must resort to the terrible _Tu quoque_ of Bishop Butler, Dr.Watson
says he is astonished that "so acute a reasoner" should reproduce the
argument."You profess yourself to be a deist, and to believe that there is a God,
who created the universe, and established the laws of nature, by which
it is sustained in existence.You profess that from a contemplation
of the works of God you derive a knowledge of his attributes; and you
reject the Bible because it ascribes to God things inconsistent (as you
suppose) with the attributes which you have discovered to belong to
him; in particular, you think it repugnant to his moral justice that
he should doom to destruction the crying and smiling infants of the
Canaanites.Why do you not maintain it to be repugnant to his moral
justice that he should suffer crying or smiling infants to be swallowed
up by an earthquake, drowned by an inundation, consumed by fire, starved
by a famine, or destroyed by a pestilence?"Watson did not, of course, know that he was following Bishop Butler
in laying the foundations of atheism, though such was the case.As was
said in my chapter on the "Age of Reason," this dilemma did not really
apply to Paine, His deity was inferred, despite all the disorders in
nature, exclusively from its apprehensible order without, and from the
reason and moral nature of man.He had not dealt with the problem of
evil, except implicitly, in his defence of the divine goodness, which is
inconsistent with the responsibility of his deity for natural evils, or
for anything that would be condemned by reason and conscience if done by
man.It was thus the Christian prelate who had abandoned the primitive
faith in the divine humanity for a natural deism, while the man he calls
a "child of the devil" was defending the divine humanity.This then was the way in which Paine was "answered," for I am not aware
of any important addition to the Bishop's "Apology" by other opponents.I cannot see how any Christian of the present time can regard it
otherwise than as a capitulation of the system it was supposed to
defend, however secure he may regard the Christianity of to-day.It
subjects the Bible to the judgment of human reason for the determination
of its authorship, the integrity of its text, and the correction of
admitted errors in authorship, chronology, and genealogy; it admits the
fallibility of the writers in matters of fact; it admits that some of
the moral laws of the Old Testament are "improper" and others, like
slavery, belonging to "the ferocity of human nature"; it admits the
non-fulfilment of one prophet's prediction, and the self-interested
suppression of truth by another; and it admits that "good men" were
engaged in concealing these "unsightly" things.Here are gates thrown
open for the whole "Age of Reason."The unorthodoxy of the Bishop's "Apology" does not rest on the judgment
of the present writer alone.If Gilbert Wakefield presently had to
reflect on his denunciations of Paine from the inside of a prison, the
Bishop of Llandaff had occasion to appreciate Paine's ideas on "mental
lying" as the Christian infidelity.The Bishop, born in the same year
(1737) with the two heretics he attacked--Gibbon and Paine--began his
career as a professor of chemistry at Cambridge (1764), but seven years
later became Regius professor of divinity there.His posthumous papers
present a remarkable picture of the church in his time.In replying to
Gibbon he studied first principles, and assumed a brave stand against
all intellectual and religious coercion.On the episcopal bench he
advocated a liberal policy toward France.In undertaking to answer Paine
he became himself unsettled; and at the very moment when unsophisticated
orthodoxy was hailing him as its champion, the sagacious magnates of
Church and State proscribed him.He learned that the king had described
him as "impracticable"; with bitterness of soul he saw prelates of
inferior rank and ability promoted over his head.He tried the effect
of a political recantation, in one of his charges; and when Williams was
imprisoned for publishing the "Age of Reason," and Gilbert Wakefield
for rebuking his "Charge," this former champion of free speech dared not
utter a protest.He seems to
have at length made up his mind that if he was to be punished for his
liberalism he would enjoy it.While preaching on "Revealed Religion" he
saw the Bishop of London shaking his head.In 18111, five years before
his death, he writes this significant note: "I have treated my divinity
as I, twenty-five years ago, treated my chemical papers: I have lighted
my fire with the labour of a great portion of my life."*

     * Patrick Henry's Answer to the "Age of Reason" shared the
     like fate."When, during the first two years of his
     retirement, Thomas Paine's 'Age of Reason' made its
     appearance, the old statesman was moved to write out a
     somewhat elaborate treatise in defence of the truth of
     Christianity.This treatise it was his purpose to have
     published.'He read the manuscript to his family as he
     progressed with it, and completed it a short time before his
     death' (1799).When it was finished, however, 'being
     diffident about his own work,' and impressed also by the
     great ability of the replies to Paine which were then
     appearing in England, 'he directed his wife to destroy' what
     he had written.She 'complied literally with his
     directions,' and thus put beyond the chance of publication a
     work which seemed, to some who heard it, 'the most eloquent
     and unanswerable argument in defence of the Bible which was
     ever written.'"quoted in Tyler's "Patrick
     Henry."Next to the "Age of Reason," the book that did most to advance Paine's
principles in England was, as I believe, Dr.Watson's "Apology for the
Bible."Dean Swift had warned the clergy that if they began to reason
with objectors to the creeds they would awaken skepticism.He pointed out, as Gilbert Wakefield did,
some exegetical and verbal errors in Paine's book, but they no more
affected its main purpose and argument than the grammatical mistakes in
"Common Sense" diminished its force in the American Revolution.David
Dale, the great manufacturer at Paisley, distributed three thousand
copies of the "Apology" among his workmen.The books carried among them
extracts from Paine, and the Bishop's admissions.Robert Owen married
Dale's daughter, and presently found the Paisley workmen a ripe harvest
for his rationalism and radicalism.Thus, in the person of its first clerical assailant, began the march
of the "Age of Reason" in England.In the Bishop's humiliations for
his concessions to truth, were illustrated what Paine had said of his
system's falsity and fraudulence.After the Bishop had observed the
Bishop of London manifesting disapproval of his sermon on "Revealed
Religion" he went home and wrote: "What is this thing called Orthodoxy,
which mars the fortunes of honest men?It is a sacred thing to which
every denomination of Christians lays exclusive claim, but to which no
man, no assembly of men, since the apostolic age, can prove a title."There is now a Bishop of London who might not acknowledge the claim
even for the apostolic age.The principles, apart from the particular
criticisms, of Paine's book have established themselves in the
English Church.They were affirmed by Bishop Wilson in clear language:
"Christian duties are founded on reason, not on the sovereignty of God
commanding what he pleases: God cannot command us what is not fit to be
believed or done, all his commands being founded in the necessities of
our nature."It was on this principle that Paine declared that things
in the Bible, "not fit to be believed or done," could not be divine
commands.His book, like its author, was outlawed, but men more heretical are
now buried in Westminster Abbey, and the lost bones of Thomas Paine are
really reposing in those tombs.It was he who compelled the hard and
heartless Bibliolatry of his time to repair to illiterate conventicles,
and the lovers of humanity, true followers of the man of Nazareth, to
abandon the crumbling castle of dogma, preserving its creeds as archaic
bric-a-brac.As his "Rights of Man" is now the political constitution
of England, his "Age of Reason" is in the growing constitution of its
Church,--the most powerful organization in Christendom because the
freest and most inclusive.The excitement caused in England by the "Age of Reason," and the large
number of attempted replies to it, were duly remarked by the _Moniteur_
and other French journals.The book awakened much attention in France,
and its principles were reproduced in a little French book entitled:
"Manuel des Theoantropophiles."In
January, 1797, Paine, with five families, founded in Paris the church
of Theo-philanthropy,--a word, as he stated in a letter to Erskine
"compounded of three Greek words, signifying God, Love, and Man.The
explanation given to this word is _Lovers of God and Man, or Adorers of
God and Friends of Man._" The society opened "in the street Denis, No."The Theophilanthropists believe in
the existence of God, and the immortality of the soul."The inaugural
discourse was given by Paine.It opens with these words: "Religion
has two principal enemies, Fanaticism and Infidelity, or that which
is called atheism.The first requires to be combated by reason and
morality, the other by natural philosophy."The discourse is chiefly an
argument for a divine existence based on motion, which, he maintains,
is not a property of matter.It proves a Being "at the summit of all
things."At the close he says:

"The society is at present in its infancy, and its means are small; but
I wish to hold in view the subject I allude to, and instead of teaching
the philosophical branches of learning as ornamental branches only, as
they have hitherto been taught, to teach them in a manner that shall
combine theological knowledge with scientific instruction.To do this to
the best advantage, some instruments will be necessary for the purpose
of explanation, of which the society is not yet possessed.But as the
views of the Society extend to public good, as well as to that of the
individual, and as its principles can have no enemies, means may be
devised to procure them.If we unite to the present instruction a series
of lectures on the ground I have mentioned, we shall, in the first
place, render theology the most entertaining of all studies.In the
next place, we shall give scientific instruction to those who could
not otherwise obtain it.The mechanic of every profession will there be
taught the mathematical principles necessary to render him proficient
in his art.The cultivator will there see developed the principles of
vegetation; while, at the same time, they will be led to see the hand of
God in all these things."A volume of 214 pages put forth at the close of the year shows that the
Theophilanthropists sang theistic and humanitarian hymns, and read Odes;
also that ethical readings were introduced from the Bible, and from
the Chinese, Hindu, and Greek authors.A library was established
(rue Neuve-Etienne-l'Estrapade, No.25) at which was issued (1797),
"Instruction Elementaire sur la Morale religieuse,"--this being declared
to be morality based on religion.{1797}

Thus Paine, pioneer in many things, helped to found the first theistic
and ethical society.It may now be recognized as a foundation of the Religion of Humanity.It
was a great point with Paine that belief in the divine existence was the
one doctrine common to all religions.On this rock the Church of Man was
to be built Having vainly endeavored to found the international Republic
he must repair to an ideal moral and human world.Robespierre and Pitt
being unfraternal he will bring into harmony the sages of all races.It is a notable instance of Paine's unwillingness to bring a personal
grievance into the sacred presence of Humanity that one of the four
festivals of Theophilanthropy was in honor of Washington, while its
catholicity was represented in a like honor to St.The
others so honored were Socrates and Rousseau.These selections were no
doubt mainly due to the French members, but they could hardly have been
made without Paine's agreement.It is creditable to them all that, at a
time when France believed itself wronged by Washington, his services to
liberty should alone have been remembered.The flowers of all races, as
represented in literature or in history, found emblematic association
with the divine life in nature through the flowers that were heaped on
a simple altar, as they now are in many churches and chapels.The walls
were decorated with ethical mottoes, enjoining domestic kindness and
public benevolence.Paine's pamphlet of this year (1797) on "Agrarian Justice" should be
considered part of the theophil-anthropic movement.It was written as a
proposal to the French government, at a time when readjustment of landed
property had been rendered necessary by the Revolution.*

     * "Thomas Payne a la Legislature et au Directoire: ou la
     Justice Agraire Opposee a la Loi et aux Privileges
     Agraires."It was suggested by a sermon printed by the Bishop of Llandaff, on "The
wisdom and goodness of God in having made both rich and poor."Paine
denies that God made rich and poor: "he made only male and female, and
gave them the earth for their inheritance."The earth, though naturally
the equal possession of all, has been necessarily appropriated by
individuals, because their improvements, which alone render its
productiveness adequate to human needs, cannot be detached from the
soil.Paine maintains that these private owners do nevertheless owe
mankind ground-rent.He therefore proposes a tithe,--not for God,
but for man.He advises that at the time when the owner will feel
it least,--when property is passing by inheritance from one to
another,--the tithe shall be taken from it.Personal property also owes
a debt to society, without which wealth could not exist,--as in the case
of one alone on an island.By a careful estimate he estimates that a
tithe on inheritances would give every person, on reaching majority,
fifteen pounds, and after the age of fifty an annuity of ten pounds,
leaving a substantial surplus for charity.The practical scheme
submitted is enforced by practical rather than theoretical
considerations.Property is always imperilled by poverty, especially
where wealth and splendor have lost their old fascinations, and awaken
emotions of disgust."To remove the danger it is necessary to remove the antipathies, and
this can only be done by making property productive of a national
blessing, extending to every individual When the riches of one man above
another shall increase the national fund in the same proportion; when it
shall be seen that the prosperity of that fund depends on the prosperity
of individuals; when the more riches a man acquires, the better it shall
be for the general mass; it is then that antipathies will cease, and
property be placed on the permanent basis of national interest and
protection."I have no property in France to become subject to the plan I propose.What I have, which is not much, is in the United States of America.But
I will pay one hundred pounds sterling towards this fund in France, the
instant it shall be established; and I will pay the same sum in England,
whenever a similar establishment shall take place in that country."The tithe was to be given to rich and poor alike, including owners of
the property tithed, in order that there should be no association of
alms with this "agrarian justice."About this time the priesthood began to raise their heads again.A
report favorable to a restoration to them of the churches, the raising
of bells, and some national recognition of public worship, was made by
Camille Jordan for a committee on the subject The Jesuitical report was
especially poetical about church bells, which Paine knew would ring the
knell of the Republic.He wrote a theophilanthropic letter to Camille
Jordan, from which I quote some paragraphs."You claim a privilege incompatible with the Constitution, and with
Rights.The Constitution protects equally, as it ought to do, every
profession of religion; it gives no exclusive privilege to any.The
churches are the common property of all the people; they are national
goods, and cannot be given exclusively to any one profession, because
the right does not exist of giving to any one that which appertains to
all.It would be consistent with right that the churches should be sold,
and the money arising therefrom be invested as a fund for the education
of children of poor parents of every profession, and, if more than
sufficient for this purpose, that the surplus be appropriated to the
support of the aged poor.After this every profession can erect its own
place of worship, if it choose--support its own priests, if it choose to
have any--or perform its worship without priests, as the Quakers do.""It is a want of feeling to talk of priests and bells whilst so many
infants are perishing in the hospitals, and aged and infirm poor in the
streets.The abundance that France possesses is sufficient for every
want, if rightly applied; but priests and bells, like articles of
luxury, ought to be the least articles of consideration.""No man ought to make a living by religion.Religion is not an act that can be performed by proxy.Every person must perform it for himself; and
all that a priest can do is to take from him; he wants nothing but his
money, and then to riot in the spoil and laugh at his credulity.The
only people who, as a professional sect of Christians, provide for the
poor of their society, are people known by the name of Quakers.They assemble quietly in their places of worship,
and do not disturb their neighbors with shows and noise of bells.Religion does not unite itself to show and noise."One good schoolmaster is of more use than a hundred priests.If we look
back at what was the condition of France under the _ancien regime_ we
cannot acquit the priests of corrupting the morals of the nation.""Why has the Revolution of France been stained with crimes, while the
Revolution of the United States of America was not?Men are physically
the same in all countries; it is education that makes them different.Accustom a people to believe that priests, or any other class of men,
can forgive sins, and you will have sins in abundance."While Thomas Paine was thus founding; in Paris a religion of love to God
expressed in love to man, his enemies in England were illustrating
by characteristic fruits the dogmas based on a human sacrifice.The
ascendency of the priesthood of one church over others, which he
was resisting in France, was exemplified across the channel in the
prosecution of his publisher, and the confiscation of a thousand pounds
which had somehow fallen due to Paine.* The "Age of Reason," amply
advertised by its opponents, had reached a vast circulation, and a
prosecution of its publisher, Thomas Williams, for blasphemy, was
instituted in the King's Bench.Williams being a poor man, the defence
was sustained by a subscription.**

     * This loss, mentioned by Paine in a private note, occurred
     about the time when he had devoted the proceeds of his
     pamphlet on English Finance, a very large sum, to prisoners
     held for debt in Newgate.I suppose the thousand pounds were
     the proceeds of the "Age of Reason."** Subscriptions (says his circular) will be received by J.
     Ashley, Shoemaker, No.6 High Holborn; C. Cooper, Grocer,
     New Compton St., Soho; G. Wilkinson, Printer, No.115
     Shoreditch; J. Rhynd, Printer, Ray St., Clerkenwell; R.
     Hodgson, Hatter, No.It will be
     observed that the defence of free printing had fallen to
     humble people.The extent to which the English reign
of terror had gone was shown in the fact that Erskine was now the
prosecutor; he who five years before had defended the "Rights of Man,"
who had left the court in a carriage drawn by the people, now stood
in the same room to assail the most sacred of rights.He began with a
menace to the defendant's counsel (S. Kyd) on account of a notice served
on the prosecution, foreshadowing a search into the Scriptures.*

     * "The King v. Thomas Williams for Blasphemy.--Take notice
     that the Prosecutors of the Indictment against the above
     named Defendant will upon the Trial of this cause be
     required to produce a certain Book described in the said
     Indictment to be the Holy Bible.--John Martin.Solicitor for
     the Defendant.Dated the 17th day of June 1797.""No man," he cried, "deserves to be upon the Rolls of the Court who
dares, as an Attorney, to put his name to such a notice.It is an insult
to the authority and dignity of the Court of which he is an officer;
since it seems to call in question the very foundations of its
jurisdiction."So soon did Erskine point the satire of the fable he
quoted from Lucian, in Paine's defence, of Jupiter answering arguments
with thunderbolts.Erskine's argument was that the King had taken a
solemn oath "to maintain the Christian Religion as it is promulgated by
God in the Holy Scriptures.""Every man has a right to investigate, with
modesty and decency, controversial points of the Christian religion; but
no man, consistently with a law which only exists under its sanction,
has a right not only broadly to deny its very existence, but to pour
forth a shocking and insulting invective, etc."The law, he said,
permits, by a like principle, the intercourse between the sexes to
be set forth in plays and novels, but punishes such as "address the
imagination in a manner to lead the passions into dangerous excesses."Erskine read several passages from the "Age of Reason," which, their
main point being omitted, seemed mere aimless abuse.In his speech, he
quoted as Paine's words of his own collocation, representing the author
as saying, "The Bible teaches nothing but 'lies, obscenity, cruelty,
and injustice.'"This is his entire and inaccurate rendering of
what Paine,--who always distinguishes the "Bible" from the "New
Testament,"--says at the close of his comment on the massacre of the
Midianites and appropriation of their maidens:

"People in general know not what wickedness there is in this pretended
word of God.Brought up in habits of superstition, they take it for
granted that the Bible [Old Testament] is true, and that it is good;
they permit themselves not to doubt it; and they carry the ideas they
form of the benevolence of the Almighty to the book they have been
taught to believe was written by his authority.it is a book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy;
for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man
to the orders of the Almighty?"Erskine argued that the sanction of Law was the oath by which judges,
juries, witnesses administered law and justice under a belief in
"the revelation of the unutterable blessings which shall attend their
observances, and the awful punishments which shall await upon their
transgressions."The rest of his opening argument was, mainly, that
great men had believed in Christianity.Kyd, in replying, quoted from the Bishop of Llandaff's "Answer to
Gibbon": "I look upon the right of private judgment, in every respect
concerning God and ourselves, as superior to the control of human
authority"; and his claim that the Church of England is distinguished
from Mahometanism and Romanism by its permission of every man to utter
his opinion freely.Waddington,
the Bishop of Chichester, who declared that Woolston "ought not to be
punished for being an infidel, nor for writing against the Christian
religion."He quoted Paine's profession of faith on the first page of
the incriminated book: "I believe in one God and no more; I hope for
happiness, beyond this life; I believe in the equality of men, and I
believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy,
and endeavouring to make our fellow creatures happy."He also quoted
Paine's homage to the character of Jesus.He defied the prosecution to
find in the "Age of Reason" a single passage "inconsistent with the
most chaste, the most correct system of morals," and declared the very
passages selected for indictment pleas against obscenity and cruelty.Kyd pointed out fourteen narratives in the Bible (such as Sarah
giving Hagar to Abraham, Lot and his daughters, etc.)which, if found in
any other book, would be pronounced obscene.He was about to enumerate
instances of cruelty when the judge, Lord Kenyon, indignantly
interrupted him, and with consent of the jury said he could only allow
him to cite such passages without reading them.Kyd gratefully
acknowledged this release from the "painful task" of reading such
horrors from the "Word of God"!)One of the interesting things about
this trial was the disclosure of the general reliance on Butler's
"Analogy," used by Bishop Watson in his reply to Paine,--namely, that
the cruelties objected to in the God of the Bible are equally found
in nature, through which deists look up to their God.When Kyd, after
quoting from Bishop Watson, said, "Gentlemen, observe the weakness of
this answer," Lord Kenyon exclaimed: "I cannot sit in this place and
hear this kind of discussion."Kyd said: "My Lord, I stand here on the
privilege of an advocate in an English Court of Justice: this man has
applied to me to defend him; I have undertaken his defence; and I have
often heard your Lordship declare, that every man had a right to be
defended.I know no other mode by which I can seriously defend him
against this charge, than that which I am now pursuing; if your Lordship
wish to prevent me from pursuing it, you may as well tell me to abandon
my duty to my client at once."Lord Kenyon said: "Go on, Sir."Returning
to the analogy of the divinely ordered massacres in the Bible with the
like in nature, Kyd said:

"Gentlemen, this is reasoning by comparison; and reasoning by comparison
is often fallacious.On the present occasion the fallacy is this: that,
in the first case, the persons perish by the operation of the general
laws of nature, not suffering punishment for a crime; whereas, in the
latter, the general laws of nature are suspended or transgressed, and
God commands the slaughter to avenge his offended will.Is this then
a satisfactory answer to the objection?I think it is not; another may
think so too; which it may be fairly supposed the Author did; and then
the objection, as to him, remains in full force, and he cannot, from
insisting upon it, be fairly accused of malevolent intention."In his answer Erskine said: "The history of man is the history of man's
vices and passions, which could not be censured without adverting to
their existence; many of the instances that have been referred to were
recorded as memorable warnings and examples for the instruction of
mankind."But for this argument Erskine was indebted to his old client,
Paine, who did not argue against the things being recorded, but against
the belief "that the inhuman and horrid butcheries of men, women, and
children, told of in those books, were done, as those books say they
were done, at the command of God."Paine says: "Those accounts are
nothing to us, nor to any other persons, unless it be to the Jews, as
a part of the history of their nation; and there is just as much of
the word of God in those books as there is in any of the histories of
France, or Rapin's 'History of England,' or the history of any other
country."As in Paines own trial in 1792, the infallible scheme of a special jury
was used against Williams.Lord Kenyon closed his charge with the words:
"Unless it was for the most malignant purposes, I cannot conceive how it
was published.It is, however, for you to judge of it, and to do justice
between the Public and the Defendant.""The jury instantly found the Defendant--Guilty."Paine at once wrote a letter to Erskine, which was first printed in
Paris.He calls attention to the injustice of the special jury system,
in which all the jurymen are nominated by the crown.In London a special
jury generally consists of merchants."Talk to some London merchants
about scripture, and they will understand you mean scrip, and tell you
how much it is worth at the Stock Exchange.Ask them about Theology,
and they will say they know no such gentleman upon 'Change."He also
declares that Lord Kenyon's course in preventing Mr.Kyd from reading
passages from the Bible was irregular, and contrary to words, which he
cites, used by the same judge in another case.This Letter to Erskine contains some effective passages.In one of these
he points out the sophistical character of the indictment in declaring
the "Age of Reason" a blasphemous work, tending to bring in contempt
the holy scriptures."The charge should have stated that the work was
intended to prove certain books not the holy scriptures.It is one
thing if I ridicule a work as being written by a certain person; but it
is quite a different thing if I write to prove that such a work was not
written by such person.In the first case I attack the person through
the work; in the other case I defend the honour of the person against
the work."After alluding to the two accounts in Genesis of the creation
of man, according to one of which there was no Garden of Eden and no
forbidden tree, Paine says:

"Perhaps I shall be told in the cant language of the day, as I have
often been told by the Bishop of Llandaff and others, of the great and
laudable pains that many pious and learned men have taken to explain the
obscure, and reconcile the contradictory, or, as they say, the seemingly
contradictory passages of the Bible.It is because the Bible needs such
an undertaking, that is one of the first causes to suspect it is _not_
the word of God: this single reflection, when carried home to the mind,
is in itself a volume.does not the Creator of the Universe, the
Fountain of all Wisdom, the Origin of all Science, the Author of all
Knowledge, the God of Order and of Harmony, know how to write?When
we contemplate the vast economy of the creation, when we behold the
unerring regularity of the visible solar system, the perfection with
which all its several parts revolve, and by corresponding assemblage
form a whole;--when we launch our eye into the boundless ocean of space,
and see ourselves surrounded by innumerable worlds, not one of which
varies from its appointed place--when we trace the power of a Creator,
from a mite to an elephant, from an atom to an universe, can we suppose
that the mind [which] could conceive such a design, and the power
that executed it with incomparable perfection, cannot write without
inconsistence; or that a book so written can be the work of such a
power?The writings of Thomas Paine, even of Thomas Paine, need no
commentator to explain, compound, arrange, and re-arrange their several
parts, to render them intelligible--he can relate a fact, or write an
essay, without forgetting in one page what he has written in another;
certainly then, did the God of all perfection condescend to write or
dictate a book, that book would be as perfect as himself is perfect: The
Bible is not so, and it is confessedly not so, by the attempts to mend
it."Paine admonishes Erskine that a prosecution to preserve God's word, were
it really God's word, would be like a prosecution to prevent the sun
from falling out of heaven; also that he should be able to comprehend
that the motives of those who declare the Bible not God's word
are religious.He then gives him an account of the new church of
Theophilanthropists in Paris, and appends his discourse before that
society.In the following year, Paine's discourse to the Theophilanthropists was
separately printed by Clio Rickman, with a sentence from Shakespeare
in the title-page: "I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the
morality of imprisonment" There was also the following dedication:

"The following little Discourse is dedicated to the enemies of Thomas
Paine, by one who has known him long and intimately, and who is
convinced that he is the enemy of no man.It is printed to do good, by
a well wisher to the world.By one who thinks that discussion should
be unlimited, that all coercion is error; and that human beings should
adopt no other conduct towards each other but an appeal to truth and
reason."Paine wrote privately, in the same sense as to Erskine, to his
remonstrating friends.In one such letter (May 12th) he goes again
partly over the ground."You," he says, "believe in the Bible from the
accident of birth, and the Turks believe in the Koran from the same
accident, and each calls the other _infidel_.This answer to your letter
is not written for the purpose of changing your opinion.It is written
to satisfy you, and some other friends whom I esteem, that my disbelief
of the Bible is founded on a pure and religious belief in God.""All
are infidels who believe falsely of God.""Belief in a cruel God makes a
cruel man."Paine had for some time been attaining unique fame in England.Some
publisher had found it worth while to issue a book, entitled "Tom
Paine's Jests: Being an entirely new and select Collection of Patriotic
Bon Mots, Repartees, Anecdotes, Epigrams, &c, on Political Subjects.There are hardly a half dozen items by Paine in the book
(72 pages), which shows that his name was considered marketable.The
government had made the author a cause.Erskine, who had lost his office
as Attorney-General for the Prince of Wales by becoming Paine's counsel
in 1792, was at once taken back into favor after prosecuting the "Age of
Reason," and put on his way to become Lord Erskine.The imprisonment of
Williams caused a reaction in the minds of those who had turned
against Paine.The terror
manifested at the name of Paine--some were arrested even for showing his
portrait--was felt to be political.None of the aristocratic deists, who
wrote for the upper classes, were dealt with in the same way.Paine had
proclaimed from the housetops what, as Dr.Watson confessed, scholars
were whispering in the ear.There were lampoons of Paine, such as
those of Peter Pindar (Rev.John Wolcott), but they only served to
whet popular curiosity concerning him.* The "Age of Reason" had passed
through several editions before it was outlawed, and every copy of it
passed through many hands.From the prosecution and imprisonment of
Williams may be dated the consolidation of the movement for the
"Rights of Man," with antagonism to the kind of Christianity which
that injustice illustrated.Political liberalism and heresy thenceforth
progressed in England, hand in hand.* "I have preserved," says Royall Tyler, "an epigram of
     Peter Pindar's, written originally in a blank leaf of a copy
     of Paine's 'Age of Reason,' and not inserted in any of his
     works."'Tommy Paine wrote this book to prove that the bible Was an old woman's
dream of fancies most idle; That Solomon's proverbs were made by low
livers, That prophets were fellows who sang semiquavers; That religion
and miracles all were a jest, And the devil in torment a tale of the
priest.Though Beelzebub's absence from hell I 'll maintain!Yet we all
must allow that the Devil's in Paine.'"THE REPUBLICAN ABDIEL

The sight of James Monroe and Thomas Paine in France, representing
Republican America, was more than Gouverneur Morris could stand.He sent
to Washington the abominable slander of Monroe already quoted (ii., p.173), and the Minister's recall came at the close of 1796.* Monroe
could not sail in midwinter with his family, so they remained until
the following spring.Paine made preparations to return to America
with them, and accompanied them to Havre; but he found so many "british
frigates cruising in sight" (so he writes Jefferson) that he did not
"trust [himself] to their discretion, and the more so as [he] had no
confidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet" Sure enough this Captain
Clay was friendly enough with the British cruiser which lay in wait
to catch Paine, but only succeeded in finding his letter to Jefferson.Before returning from Havre to Paris he wrote another letter to
Vice-President Jefferson.* This sudden recall involved Monroe in heavy expenses,
     which Congress afterwards repaid.Frederick McGuire, of Washington, for the manuscript of
     Monroe's statement of his expenses and annoyances caused by
     his recall, which he declares due to "the representations
     which were made to him [Washington] by those in whom he
     confided."He states that Paine remained in his house a year
     and a half, and that be advanced him 250 louis d'or.For
     these services to Paine, he adds, "no claims were ever
     presented on my part, nor is any indemnity now desired."This money was repaid ($1,188) to Monroe by an Act of
     Congress, April 7, 1831.The advances are stated in the Act
     to have been made "from time to time," and were no doubt
     regarded by both Paine and Monroe as compensated by the many
     services rendered by the author to the Legation."Havre, May 14th, 1797."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you by the Ship Dublin Packet, Captain Clay,
mentioning my intention to have returned to America by that Vessel, and
to have suggested to some Member of the House of Representatives the
propriety of calling Mr.Monroe before them to have enquired into the
state of their affairs in France.This might have laid the foundation
for some resolves on their part that might have led to an accommodation
with France, for that House is the only part of the American Government
that have any reputation here.Monroe of my design, and
he wishes to be called up."You will have heard before this reaches you that the Emperor has been
obliged to sue for peace, and to consent to the establishment of the new
republic in Lombardy.How France will proceed with respect to England,
I am not, at this distance from Paris, in the way of knowing, but am
inclined to think she meditates a descent upon that Country, and a
revolution in its Government.If this should be the plan, it will keep
me in Europe at least another year."As the british party has thrown the American commerce into wretched
confusion, it is necessary to pay more attention to the appointment of
Consuls in the ports of france, than there was occasion to do in time
of peace; especially as there is now no Minister, and Mr.Skipwith,
who stood well with the Government here, has resigned.Cutting, the
Consul for Havre, does not reside at it, and the business is altogether
in the hands of De la Motte, the Vice Consul, who is a frenchman, [and]
cannot have the full authority proper for the office in the difficult
state matters are now in.I do not mention this to the disadvantage of
Mr.Cutting, for no man is more proper than himself if he thought it an
object to attend to."I know not if you are acquainted with Captain Johnson of
Massachusetts--he is a staunch man and one of the oldest American
Captains in the American employ.He is now settled at Havre and is a
more proper man for a Vice Consul than La Motte.He has written to some of his friends to have
the appointment and if you can see an opportunity of throwing in a
little service for him, you will do a good thing.He would be well received as an
individual, but as an Envoy of John Adams he could do nothing.The following, in Paine's handwriting, is copied from the original in
the Morrison papers, at the British Museum.It was written in the summer
of 1797, when Lord Malmsbury was at Lille in negotiation for peace.The negotiations were broken off because the English commissioners were
unauthorized to make the demanded restorations to Holland and Spain.Paine's essay was no doubt sent to the Directory in the interests of
peace, suggesting as it does a compromise, as regards the Cape of Good
Hope."Cape of Good Hope.--It is very well known that Dun-das, the English
Minister for Indian affairs, is tenacious of holding the Cape of Good
Hope, because it will give to the English East India Company a monopoly
of the commerce of India; and this, on the other hand, is the very
reason that such a claim is inadmissible by France, and by all the
nations trading in India and to Canton, and would also be injurious to
Canton itself.--We pretend not to know anything of the negociations at
Lille, but it is very easy to see, from the nature of the case, what
ought to be the condition of the Cape.It ought to be a free port open
to the vessels of all nations trading to any part of the East Indias.It
ought also to be a neutral port at all times, under the guarantee of
all nations; the expense of keeping the port in constant repair to
be defrayed by a tonnage tax to be paid by every vessel, whether
of commerce or of war, and in proportion to the time of their
stay.--Nothing then remains but with respect to the nation who shall be
the port-master; and this ought to be the Dutch, because they understand
the business best.As the Cape is a half-way stage between Europe and
India, it ought to be considered as a tavern, where travellers on a long
journey put up for rest and refreshment.--T.The suspension of peace negotiations,* and the bloodless defeat of
Pichigru's conspiracy of 18 Fructidor (September 4th) were followed by a
pamphlet addressed to "The People of France and the French Armies."This
little work is of historical value, in connection with 18 Fructidor, but
it was evidently written to carry two practical points.The first was,
that if the war with England must continue it should be directed to the
end of breaking the Anglo-Germanic compact.England has the right to
her internal arrangements, but this is an external matter.While "with
respect to England it has been the cause of her immense national debt,
the ruin of her finances, and the insolvency of her bank," English
intrigues on the continent "are generated by, and act through, the
medium of this Anglo-Germanic compound.Let the elector retire to his electorate, and the world will have
peace."Paine's other main point is, that the neutral nations should
secure, in time of war, an unarmed neutrality.* In a letter to Duane, many years later, Paine relates the
     following story concerning the British Union: "When Lord
     Malmsbury arrived in Paris, in the time of the Directory
     Government, to open a negociation for a peace, his
     credentials ran in the old style of 'George, by the grace of
     God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, king.'Malmsbury
     was informed that although the assumed title of king of
     France, in his credentials, would not prevent France opening
     a negociation, yet that no treaty of peace could be
     concluded until that assumed title was removed.Pitt then
     hit on the Union.Bill, under which the assumed title of
     king of France was discontinued.""Were the neutral nations to associate, under an honorable injunction of
fidelity to each other, and publickly declare to the world, that if any
belligerent power shall seize or molest any ship or vessel belonging
to the citizens or subjects of any of the powers composing that
association, that the whole association will shut its ports against the
flag of the offending nation, and will not permit any goods, wares,
or merchandize, produced or manufactured in the offending nation, or
appertaining thereto, to be imported into any of the ports included
in the association, until reparation be made to the injured party; the
reparation to be three times the value of the vessel and cargo; and
moreover that all remittances in money, goods, and bills of exchange, do
cease to be made to the offending nation, until the said reparation be
made.Were the neutral nations only to do this, which it is their
direct interest to do, England, as a nation depending on the commerce of
neutral nations in time of war, dare not molest them, and France would
not But whilst, from want of a common system, they individually permit
England to do it, because individually they cannot resist it, they put
France under the necessity of doing the same thing.The supreme of all
laws, in all cases, is that of self-preservation."It is a notable illustration of the wayward course of political
evolution, that the English republic--for it is such--grew largely out
of the very parts of its constitution once so oppressive.The foreign
origin of the royal family helped to form its wholesome timidity about
meddling with politics, allowing thus a development of ministerial
government.The hereditary character of the throne, which George
III.'s half-insane condition associated with the recklessness of
irresponsibility, was by his complete insanity made to serve ministerial
independence.Regency is timid about claiming power, and childhood
cannot exercise it.The decline of royal and aristocratic authority in
England secured freedom to commerce, which necessarily gave hostages to
peace.The protection of neutral commerce at sea, concerning which Paine
wrote so much, ultimately resulted from English naval strength, which
formerly scourged the world.To Paine, England, at the close of 1797, could appear only as a
dragon-guarded prison of fair Humanity.The press was paralyzed,
thinkers and publishers were in prison, some of the old orators like
Erskine were bought up, and the forlorn hope of liberty rested only with
Fox and his fifty in Parliament, overborne by a majority made brutal by
strength.The groans of imprisoned thought in his native land reached
its outlawed representative in Paris.And at the same time the inhuman
decree went forth from that country that there should be no peace with
France.It had long been his conviction that the readiness of Great
Britain to go to war was due to an insular position that kept the
horrors at a distance.This conviction,
which we have several times met in these pages, returned to him with new
force when England now insisted on more bloodshed.He was convinced that
the right course of France would be to make a descent on England, ship
the royal family to Hanover, open the political prisons, and secure the
people freedom to make a Constitution.These views, freely expressed
to his friends of the Directory and Legislature, reached the ears of
Napoleon on his triumphal return from Italy.The great man called upon Paine in his little room, and invited him
to dinner.He made the eloquent professions of republicanism so
characteristic of Napoleons until they became pretenders.He told Paine
that he slept with the "Rights of Man" under his pillow, and that its
author ought to have a statue of gold.*

     * Rickman, p.He consulted Paine about a descent on England, and adopted the plan.He
invited the author to accompany the expedition, which was to consist of
a thousand gun-boats, with a hundred men each.Paine consented, "as
[so he wrote Jefferson] the intention of the expedition was to give the
people of England an opportunity of forming a government for themselves,
and thereby bring about peace."One of the points to be aimed at was
Norfolk, and no doubt Paine indulged a happy vision of standing once
more in Thetford and proclaiming liberty throughout the land!The following letter (December 29, 1797) from Paine to Barras is in the
archives of the Directory, with a French translation:

"Citizen President,--A very particular friend of mine, who had a
passport to go to London upon some family affairs and to return in three
months, and whom I had commissioned upon some affairs of my own (for
I find that the English government has seized upon a thousand pounds
sterling which I had in the hands of a friend), returned two days ago
and gave me the memorandum which I enclose:--the first part relates only
to my publication on the event of the 18 Fructidor, and to a letter to
Erskine (who had been counsel for the prosecution against a former
work of mine the 'Age of Reason') both of which I desired my friend to
publish in London.The other part of the memorandum respects the state
of affairs in that country, by which I see they have little or no idea
of a descent being made upon them; tant mieux--but they will be guarded
in Ireland, as they expect a descent there."I expect a printed copy of the letter to Erskine in a day or two.As
this is in English, and on a subject that will be amusing to the Citizen
Revelliere Le Peaux, I will send it to him.The friend of whom I speak
was a pupil of Dessault the surgeon, and whom I once introduced to
you at a public audience in company with Captain Cooper on his plan
respecting the Island of Bermuda.--Salut et Respect."{1798}

Thus once again did the great hope of a liberated, peaceful, and
republican Europe shine before simple-hearted Paine.He was rather poor
now, but gathered up all the money he had, and sent it to the Council of
Five Hundred.The accompanying letter was read by Coupe at the sitting
of January 28, 1798:

"Citizens Representatives,--Though it is not convenient to me, in the
present situation of my affairs, to subscribe to the loan towards the
descent upon England, my economy permits me to make a small patriotic
donation.I send a hundred livres, and with it all the wishes of my
heart for the success of the descent, and a voluntary offer of any
service I can render to promote it."There will be no lasting peace for France, nor for the world, until
the tyranny and corruption of the English government be abolished, and
England, like Italy, become a sister republic.As to those men, whether
in England, Scotland, or Ireland, who, like Robespierre in France, are
covered with crimes, they, like him, have no other resource than in
committing more.But the mass of the people are the friends of liberty:
tyranny and taxation oppress them, but they deserve to be free."Accept, Citizens Representatives, the congratulations of an old
colleague in the dangers we have passed, and on the happy prospect
before us.Coupe added: "The gift which Thomas Paine offers you appears very
trifling, when it is compared with the revolting injustice which this
faithful friend of liberty has experienced from the English government;
but compare it with the state of poverty in which our former colleague
finds himself, and you will then think it considerable."He moved that
the notice of this gift and Thomas Paine's letter be printed."Mention
honorable et impression," adds the Moniteur.The President of the Directory at this time was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, a
friend of the Theophilanthropic Society.To him Paine gave, in English,
which the president understood, a plan for the descent, which was
translated into French, and adopted by the Directory.Two hundred and
fifty gun-boats were built, and the expedition abandoned.To Jefferson,
Paine intimates his suspicion that it was all "only a feint to cover the
expedition to Egypt, which was then preparing."He also states that the
British descent on Ostend, where some two thousand of them were made
prisoners, "was in search of the gun-boats, and to cut the <DW18>s, to
prevent their being assembled."This he was told by Vanhuile, of Bruges,
who heard it from the British officers.After the failure of his attempt to return to America with the Monroes,
Paine was for a time the guest of Nicolas de Bonneville, in Paris,
and the visit ended in an arrangement for his abode with that family.Bonneville was an editor, thirty-seven years of age, and had been one of
the five members of Paine's Republican Club, which placarded Paris with
its manifesto after the king's flight in 1791.An enthusiastic
devotee of Paine's principles from youth, he had advocated them in
his successive journals, _Le Tribun du Peuple, Bouche de Fer, and
Bien Informe_.He had resisted Marat and Robespierre, and suffered
imprisonment during the Terror.He spoke English fluently, and was
well known in the world of letters by some striking poems, also by his
translation into French of German tales, and parts of Shakespeare.He
had set up a printing office at No.4 Rue du Theatre-Francais, where he
published liberal pamphlets, also his _Bien Informe_.Then, in 1794, he
printed in French the "Age of Reason."He also published, and probably
translated into French, Paine's letter to the now exiled Camille
Jordan,--"Lettre de Thomas Paine, sur les Cultes."Paine, unable to
converse in French, found with the Bonnevilles a home he needed.M. and
Madame Bonneville had been married three years, and their second child
had been named after Thomas Paine, who stood as his godfather.Paine,
as we learn from Rickman, who knew the Bonnevilles, paid board, but no
doubt he aided Bonneville more by his pen.With public affairs, either in France or America, Paine now mingled but
little.The election of John Adams to the presidency he heard of with
dismay.He wrote to Jefferson that since he was not president, he was
glad he had accepted the vice-presidency, "for John Adams has such a
talent for blundering and offending, it will be necessary to keep an eye
over him."Finding, by the abandonment of a descent on.England for
one on Egypt, that Napoleon was by no means his ideal missionary of
republicanism, he withdrew into his little study, and now remained so
quiet that some English papers announced his arrival and cool reception
in America.He was, however, fairly bored with visitors from all parts
of the world, curious to see the one international republican left.It became necessary for Madame Bonneville, armed with polite
prevarications, to defend him from such sight-seers.For what with
his visits to and from the Barlows, the Smiths, and his friends of the
Directory, Paine had too little time for the inventions in which he was
again absorbed,--his "Saints."Among his intimate friends at this time
was Robert Fulton, then residing in Paris.Paine's extensive studies
of the steam-engine, and his early discovery, of its adaptability to
navigation, had caused Rumsey to seek him in England, and Fitch to
consult him both in America and Paris.Paine's connection with the
invention of the steamboat was recognized by Fulton, as indeed by all of
his scientific contemporaries.* To Fulton he freely gave his ideas,
and may perhaps have had some hope that the steamboat might prove a
missionary of international republicanism, though Napoleon had failed.* Sir Richard Phillips says: "In 1778 Thomas Paine proposed,
     in America, this application of steam."("Million of Facts,"
     p.As Sir Richard assisted Fulton in his experiments
     on the Thames, he probably heard from him the fact about
     Paine, though, indeed, in the controversy between Rumsey and
     Fitch, Paine's priority to both was conceded.In America,
     however, the priority really belonged to the eminent
     mechanician William Henry, of Lancaster, Pa.When Fitch
     visited Henry, in 1785, he was told by him that he was not
     the first to devise steam-navigation; that he himself had
     thought of it in 1776, and mentioned it to Andrew Ellicott;
     and that Thomas Paine, while a guest at his house in 1778,
     had spoken to him on the subject I am indebted to Mr.John
     W. Jordan, of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, for
     notes from the papers of Henry, his ancestor, showing that
     Paine's scheme was formed without knowledge of others, and
     that it contemplated a turbine application of steam to a
     wheel.Both he and Henry, as they had not published their
     plans, agreed to leave Fitch the whole credit.Fitch
     publicly expressed his gratitude to Paine.Thurston adds
     that Paine, in 1788, proposed that Congress should adopt the
     whole matter for the national benefit.("History of the
     Growth of the Steam Engine," pp.It will not be forgotten that in the same year in which Paine startled
William Henry with a plan for steam-navigation, namely in 1778, he wrote
his sublime sentence about the "Religion of Humanity."The steamships,
which Emerson described as enormous shuttles weaving the races of
men into the woof of humanity, have at length rendered possible that
universal human religion which Paine foresaw.In that old Lancaster
mansion of the Henrys, which still stands, Paine left his spectacles,
now in our National Museum; they are strong and far-seeing; through them
looked eyes held by visions that the world is still steadily following.One cannot suppress some transcendental sentiment in view of
the mystical harmony of this man's inventions for human
welfare,--mechanical, political, religious.Of his gunpowder motor,
mention has already been made (i., p.On this he was engaged
about the time that he was answering Bishop Watson's book on the "Age of
Reason."He could not believe, he said,
that the qualities of gunpowder--the small and light grain with maximum
of force--were meant only for murder, and his faith in the divine
humanity is in the sentence.To supersede destroying gunpowder with
beneficent gunpowder, and to supersede the god of battles with the God
of Love, were kindred aims in Paine's heart Through the fiery furnaces
of his time he had come forth with every part of his being welded and
beaten and shaped together for this Human Service.Patriotism, in the
conventional sense, race-pride, sectarianism, partizanship, had been
burnt out of his nature.The universe could not have wrung from his
tongue approval of a wrong because it was done by his own country.It might be supposed that there were no heavier trials awaiting Paine's
political faith than those it had undergone.But it was becoming evident
that liberty had not the advantage he once ascribed to truth over
error,--"it cannot be unlearned."The United States had unlearned it as
far as to put into the President's hands a power of arbitrarily crushing
political opponents, such as even George III.The
British Treaty had begun to bear its natural fruits.Washington signed
the Treaty to avoid war, and rendered war inevitable with both France
and England.The affair with France was happily a transient squall, but
it was sufficient to again bring on Paine the offices of an American
Minister in France.Many an American in that country had occasion to
appreciate his powerful aid and unfailing kindness.Among these was
Captain Rowland Crocker of Massachusetts, who had sailed with a letter
of marque.'His vessel was captured by the French, and its wounded
commander brought to Paris, where he was more agreeably conquered by
kindness.Freeman's "History of Cape Cod" (of which region Crocker was a
native) has the following:

"His [Captain Crocker's] reminiscences of his residence in that country,
during the most extraordinary period of its history, were of a highly
interesting character.He had taken the great Napoleon by the hand; he
had familiarly known Paine, at a time when his society was sought for
and was valuable.Of this noted individual, we may in passing say, with
his uniform and characteristic kindness, he always spoke in terms which
sounded strange to the ears of a generation which has been taught, with
or without justice, to regard the author of 'The Age of Reason' with
loathing and abhorrence.He remembered Paine as a well-dressed and most
gentlemanly man, of sound and orthodox republican principles, of a good
heart, a strong intellect, and a fascinating address."{1799}

The _coup d'etat_ in America, which made President Adams virtual
emperor, pretended constitutionality, and was reversible.That which
Napoleon and Sieves--who had his way at last--effected in France
(November 9, 1799) was lawless and fatal.The peaceful Bonneville home
was broken up.Bonneville, in his _Bien Informe_ described Napoleon as
"a Cromwell," and was promptly imprisoned.Paine, either before or soon
after this catastrophe, went to Belgium, on a visit to his old friend
Vanhuile, who had shared his cell in the Luxembourg prison.Vanhuile
was now president of the municipality of Bruges, and Paine got from him
information about European affairs.On his return he found Bonneville
released from prison, but under severe surveillance, his journal being
suppressed.The family was thus reduced to penury and anxiety, but there
was all the more reason that Paine should stand by them.He continued
his abode in their house, now probably supported by drafts on his
resources in America, to which country they turned their thoughts.{1800}

The European Republic on land having become hopeless, Paine turned
his attention to the seas.He wrote a pamphlet on "Maritime Compact,"
including in it ten articles for the security of neutral commerce, to
be signed by the nations entering the "Unarmed Association," which he
proposed.This scheme was substantially the same as that already quoted
from his letter "To the People of France, and to the French Armies."It was translated by Bonneville, and widely circulated in Europe.Paine
sent it in manuscript to Jefferson, who at once had it printed.His
accompanying letter to Jefferson (October i, 1800) is of too much
biographical interest to be abridged.* Oliver Ellsworth, William V. Murray, and William R. Davie,
     were sent by President Adams to France to negotiate a
     treaty.There is little doubt that the famous letter of Joel
     Barlow to Washington, October 2, 1798, written in the
     interest of peace, was composed after consultation with
     Paine.Adams, on reading the letter, abused Barlow."Tom
     Paine," he said, "is not a more worthless fellow."But he
     obeyed the letter.The Commissioners he sent were associated
     with the anti-French and British party in America, but peace
     with America was of too much importance to the new despot of
     France for the opportunity to be missed of forming a Treaty."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you from Havre by the ship Dublin Packet in the
year 1797.It was then my intention to return to America; but there were
so many British frigates cruising in sight of the port, and which after
a few days knew that I was at Havre waiting to go to America, that I did
not think it best to trust myself to their discretion, and the more so,
as I had no confidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet (Clay).I
mentioned to you in that letter, which I believe you received thro'
the hands of Colonel [Aaron] Burr, that I was glad since you were not
President that you had accepted the nomination of Vice President.have been here about eight months,
and three more useless mortals never came upon public business.Their
presence appears to me to have been rather an injury than a benefit They
set themselves up for a faction as soon as they arrived.Upon my return to Paris I learned they had made a point of not
returning the visits of Mr.Skipwith and Barlow, because, they said,
they had not the confidence of the executive.Every known republican was
treated in the same manner.Miller of Philadelphia,
who had occasion to see them upon business, that they did not intend to
return my visit, if I made one.This I supposed it was intended I should
know, that I might not make one.I told him, I did not come to see him as a
commissioner, nor to congratulate him upon his mission; that I came to
see him because I had formerly known him in Congress.I mean not, said
I, to press you with any questions, or to engage you in any conversation
upon the business you are come upon, but I will nevertheless candidly
say that I know not what expectations the Government or the people of
America may have of your mission, or what expectations you may have
yourselves, but I believe you will find you can do but little.The
treaty with England lies at the threshold of all your business.The
American Government never did two more foolish things than when it
signed that Treaty and recalled Mr.Monroe, who was the only man could
do them any service.Ellsworth put on the dull gravity of a Judge,
and was silent.I added, you may perhaps make a treaty like that you
have made with England, which is a surrender of the rights of the
American flag; for the principle that neutral ships make neutral
property must be general or not at all.I then changed the subject, for
I had all the talk to myself upon this topic, and enquired after Sam.Adams, (I asked nothing about John,) Mr.Monroe, and
others of my friends, and the melancholy case of the yellow fever,--of
which he gave me as circumstantial an account as if he had been summing
up a case to a Jury.Ellsworth been as
cunning as a statesman, or as wise as a Judge, he would have returned my
visit that he might appear insensible of the intention of mine."I now come to the affairs of this country and of Europe.You will, I
suppose, have heard before this arrives to you, of the battle of
Marengo in Italy, where the Austrians were defeated--of the armistice
in consequence thereof, and the surrender of Milan, Genoa, etc., to
the french--of the successes of the french army in Germany--and the
extension of the armistice in that quarter--of the preliminaries of
peace signed at Paris--of the refusal of the Emperor [of Austria] to
ratify these preliminaries--of the breaking of the armistice by the
french Government in consequence of that refusal--of the 'gallant'
expedition of the Emperor to put himself at the head of his Army--of his
pompous arrival there--of his having made his will--of prayers being put
in all his churches for the preservation of the life of this Hero--of
General Moreau announcing to him, immediately on his arrival at the
Army, that hostilities would commence the day after the next at sunrise,
unless he signed the treaty or gave security that he would sign within
45 days--of his surrendering up three of the principal keys of Germany
(Ulm, Philipsbourg, and Ingolstad), as security that he would sign them.This is the state things [they] are now in, at the time of writing this
letter; but it is proper to add that the refusal of the Emperor to sign
the preliminaries was motived upon a note from the King of England to be
admitted to the Congress for negociating Peace, which was consented to
by the french upon the condition of an armistice at Sea, which England,
before knowing of the surrender the Emperor had made, had refused.From
all which it appears to me, judging from circumstances, that the Emperor
is now so compleatly in the hands of the french, that he has no way of
getting out but by a peace.The Congress for the peace is to be held
at Luneville, a town in france.Since the affair of Rastadt the french
commissioners will not trust themselves within the Emperor's territory.I know not what the Commissioners have
done, but from a paper I enclose to you, which appears to have
some authority, it is not much.The paper as you will perceive is
considerably prior to this letter.I knew that the Commissioners before
this piece appeared intended setting off.It is therefore probable that
what they have done is conformable to what this paper mentions, which
certainly will not atone for the expence their mission has incurred,
neither are they, by all the accounts I hear of them, men fitted for the
business."But independently of these matters there appears to be a state of
circumstances rising, which if it goes on, will render all partial
treaties unnecessary.In the first place I doubt if any peace will be
made with England; and in the second place, I should not wonder to see a
coalition formed against her, to compel her to abandon her insolence on
the seas.This brings me to speak of the manuscripts I send you.1, without any title, was written in consequence of
a question put to me by Bonaparte.As he supposed I knew England
and English Politics he sent a person to me to ask, that in case of
negociating a Peace with Austria, whether it would be proper to include
England.Julian was in Paris, on the part of the
Emperor negociating the preliminaries:--which as I have before said the
Emperor refused to sign on the pretence of admitting England.2, entitled _On the Jacobinism of the English at
Sea_, was written when the English made their insolent and impolitic
expedition to Denmark, and is also an auxiliary to the politic of No.I shewed it to a friend [Bonneville] who had it translated into french,
and printed in the form of a Pamphlet, and distributed gratis among the
foreign Ministers, and persons in the Government.It was immediately
copied into several of the french Journals, and into the official Paper,
the Moniteur.It appeared in this paper one day before the last
dispatch arrived from Egypt; which agreed perfectly with what I had said
respecting Egypt.It hit the two cases of Denmark and Egypt in the exact
proper moment.3, entitled _Compact Maritime_, is the sequel of No.It is translating at the time I write this letter,
and I am to have a meeting with the Senator Garat upon the subject.The pieces 2 and 3 go off in manuscript to England, by a confidential
person, where they will be published."By all the news we get from the North there appears to be something
meditating against England.It is now given for certain that Paul has
embargoed all the English vessels and English property in Russia till
some principle be established for protecting the Rights of neutral
Nations, and securing the liberty of the Seas.The preparations in
Denmark continue, notwithstanding the convention that she has made with
England, which leaves the question with respect to the right set up by
England to stop and search Neutral vessels undecided.I send you the
paragraphs upon the subject."The tumults are great in all parts of England on account of the
excessive price of corn and bread, which has risen since the harvest.I attribute it more to the abundant increase of paper, and the
non-circulation of cash, than to any other cause, People in trade
can push the paper off as fast as they receive it, as they did by
continental money in America; but as farmers have not this opportunity
they endeavor to secure themselves by going considerably in advance."I have now given you all the great articles of intelligence, for I
trouble not myself with little ones, and consequently not with the
Commissioners, nor any thing they are about, nor with John Adams,
otherwise than to wish him safe home, and a better and wiser man in his
place."In the present state of circumstances and the prospects arising from
them, it may be proper for America to consider whether it is worth her
while to enter into any treaty at this moment, or to wait the event of
those circumstances which, if they go on will render partial treaties
useless by deranging them.But if, in the mean time, she enters into
any treaty it ought to be with a condition to the following purpose:
Reserving to herself the right of joining in an association of Nations
for the protection of the Rights of Neutral Commerce and the security of
the liberty of the Seas."The pieces 2, 3, may go to the press.They will make a small pamphlet
and the printers are welcome to put my name to it.It is best it should
be put from thence; they will get into the newspapers.I know that the
faction of John Adams abuses me pretty heartily.It
does not disturb me, and they lose their labour; and in return for it I
am doing America more service, as a neutral nation, than their expensive
Commissioners can do, and she has that service from me for nothing.1 is only for your own amusement and that of your friends."I come now to speak confidentially to you on a private subject.Ellsworth and Davie return to America, Murray will return to
Holland, and in that case there will be nobody in Paris but Mr.Skipwith
that has been in the habit of transacting business with the french
Government since the revolution began.He is on a good standing with
them, and if the chance of the day should place you in the presidency
you cannot do better than appoint him for any purpose you may have
occasion for in France.He is an honest man and will do his country
Justice, and that with civility and good manners to the government he
is commissioned to act with; a faculty which that Northern Bear Timothy
Pickering wanted, and which the Bear of that Bear, John Adams, never
possessed.Murray, otherwise than of his unfriendliness to
every American who is not of his faction, but I am sure that Joel Barlow
is a much fitter man to be in Holland than Mr.It is upon
the fitness of the man to the place that I speak, for I have not
communicated a thought upon the subject to Barlow, neither does he
know, at the time of my writing this (for he is at Havre), that I have
intention to do it."I will now, by way of relief, amuse you with some account of the
progress of Iron Bridges.Burke's attack
upon it, drew me off from any pontifical Works.Since my coming from
England in '92, an Iron Bridge of a single arch 236 feet span versed
sine 34 feet, has been cast at the Iron Works of the Walkers where my
model was, and erected over the river Wear at Sunderland in the county
of Durham in England.The two members in Parliament for the County,
Mr.Milbank, were the principal subscribers; but the
direction was committed to Mr.A very sincere friend of mine,
Sir Robert Smyth, who lives in france, and whom Mr.Monroe well knows,
supposing they had taken their plan from my model wrote to Mr.Milbank answered the letter, which answer I have
by me and I give you word for word the part concerning the Bridge: 'With
respect to the Bridge over the river Wear at Sunderland it certainly is
a Work well deserving admiration both for its structure, durability
and utility, and I have good grounds for saying that the first Idea was
taken from Mr.Paine's bridge exhibited at Paddington.But with respect
to any compensation to Mr.Paine, however desirous of rewarding the
labours of an ingenious man, I see not how it is in my power, having had
nothing to do with his bridge after the payment of my subscription, Mr.But if you can point out
any mode by which I can be instrumental in procuring for Mr.P. any
compensation for the advantages which the public may have derived from
his ingenious model, from which certainly the outlines of the Bridge
at Sunderland was taken, be assured it will afford me very great
satisfaction.'"I have now made two other models, one is pasteboard, five feet span
and five inches of height from the cords.It is in the opinion of every
person who has seen it one of the most beautiful objects the eye can
behold.I then cast a model in Metal following the construction of that
in pasteboard and of the same dimensions.The whole was executed in my
own Chamber.It is far superior in strength, elegance, and readiness in
execution to the model I made in America, and which you saw in Paris.I
shall bring those Models with me when I come home, which will be as soon
as I can pass the seas in safety from the piratical John Bulls."I suppose you have seen, or have heard of the Bishop of Landaff's
answer to my second part of the Age of reason.As soon as I got a
copy of it I began a third part, which served also as an answer to the
Bishop; but as soon as the clerical Society for promoting _Christian
Knowledge_ knew of my intention to answer the Bishop, they prosecuted,
as a Society, the printer of the first and second parts, to prevent that
answer appearing.No other reason than this can be assigned for their
prosecuting at the time they did, because the first part had been in
circulation above three years and the second part more than one, and
they prosecuted immediately on knowing that I was taking up their
Champion.Burke's attack on the french
revolution; served me as a back-ground to bring forward other subjects
upon, with more advantage than if the background was not there.This is
the motive that induced me to answer him, otherwise I should have gone
on without taking any notice of him.I have made and am still making
additions to the manuscript, and shall continue to do so till an
opportunity arrive for publishing it."If any American frigate should come to france, and the direction of
it fall to you, I will be glad you would give me the opportunity of
returning.The abscess under which I suffered almost two years is
entirely healed of itself, and I enjoy exceeding good health.This is
the first of October, and Mr.Skipwith has just called to tell me the
Commissioners set off for Havre tomorrow.This will go by the frigate
but not with the knowledge of the Commissioners.Remember me with much
affection to my friends and accept the same to yourself."As the Commissioners did not leave when they expected, Paine added
several other letters to Jefferson, on public affairs.In one (October
1st) he says he has information of increasing aversion in the English
people to their government."It was the hope of conquest, and is now the
hope of peace that keeps it [Pitt's administration] up."When
suspicion wakes the credit vanishes as the dream would.""England has a
large Navy, and the expense of it leads to her ruin."The English nation
is tired of war, longs for peace, "and calculates upon defeat as
it would upon victory."On October 4th, after the Commissioners had
concluded a treaty, Paine alludes to an article said to be in it,
requiring certain expenditures in France, and says that if he,
Jefferson, be "in the chair, and not otherwise," he should offer himself
for this business, should an agent be required "It will serve to defray
my expenses until I can return, but I wish it may be with the condition
of returning.I am not tired of working for nothing, but I cannot afford
it.This appointment will aid me in promoting the object I am now upon
of a law of nations for the protection of neutral commerce."On October
6th he reports to Jefferson that at an entertainment given the American
envoys, Consul Le Brun gave the toast: "A l'union de l'Amerique avec les
puissances du Nord pour faire respecter la liberte des mers."On October
15th the last of his enclosures to Jefferson is written.He says that
Napoleon, when asked if there would be more war, replied: "Nous
n'aurions plus qu'une guerre d'ecritoire."In all of Paine's writing
about Napoleon, at this time, he seems as if watching a thundercloud,
and trying to make out meteorologically its drift, and where it will
strike.{1801}

On July 15, 1801, Napoleon concluded with Pius VII.Naturally, the first victim offered on the restored altar was
Theophilan-thropy.I have called Paine the founder of this Society,
because it arose amid the controversy excited by the publication of "Le
Siecle de la Raison," its manual and tracts reproducing his ideas and
language; and because he gave the inaugural discourse.Theism was little
known in France save as iconoclasm, and an assault on the Church: Paine
treated it as a Religion.But, as he did not speak French, the practical
organization and management of the Society were the work of others, and
mainly of a Russian named Hauey.There had been a good deal of odium
incurred at first by a society which satisfied neither the pious nor the
freethinkers, but it found a strong friend on the Directory.This
was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, whose secretary, Antoine Vallee, and young
daughter, had become interested in the movement.This statesman never
joined the Society, but he had attended one of its meetings, and, when
a distribution of religious edifices was made, Theophilanthropy was
assigned ten parish churches.It is said that when Larevelliere-Lepeaux
mentioned to Talleyrand his desire for the spread of this Society, the
diplomat said: "All you have to do is to get yourself hanged, and revive
the third day."Paine, who had pretty nearly fulfilled that requirement,
saw the Society spread rapidly, and he had great hopes of its future.also had an interested eye on it, and though the
Concordat did not go into legal operation until 1802, Theophilanthropy
was offered as a preliminary sacrifice in October, 1801.The description of Paine by Walter Savage Landor, and representations
of his talk, in the "Imaginary Conversations," so mix up persons, times,
and places, that I was at one time inclined to doubt whether the two had
met.J. M. Wheeler, a valued correspondent in London, writes
me: "Landor told my friend Mr.Birch of Florence that he particularly
admired Paine, and that he visited him, having first obtained an
interview at the house of General Dumouriez.Landor declared that Paine
was always called 'Tom,' not out of disrespect, but because he was a
jolly good fellow."An interview with Paine at the house of Dumouriez
could only have occurred when the General was in Paris, in 1793.This
would account for what Landor says of Paine taking refuge from trouble
in brandy.There had been, as, Rickman testifies, and as all the facts
show, nothing of this kind since that period.It would appear therefore
that Landor must have mixed up at least two interviews with Paine, one
in the time of Dumouriez, the other in that of Napoleon.Not even
such an artist as Landor could invent the language ascribed to Paine
concerning the French and Napoleon."The whole nation may be made as enthusiastic about a salad as about a
constitution; about the colour of a cockade as about a consul or a king.You will shortly see the real strength and figure of Bonaparte.He is
wilful, headstrong, proud, morose, presumptuous; he will be guided no
longer; he has pulled the pad from his forehead, and will break his nose
or bruise his cranium against every table, chair, and brick in the room,
until at last he must be sent to the hospital."Paine prophesies that Napoleon will make himself emperor, and that "by
his intemperate use of power and thirst of dominion" he will cause the
people to "wish for their old kings, forgetting what beasts they were."Normandy" Landor disguises Thomas Poole,
referred to on a preceding page.Normandy's sufferings on account of one
of Paine's books are not exaggerated.Sanford's work is printed
a letter from Paris, July 20, 1802, in which Poole says: "I called one
Morning on Thomas Paine.Striking,
strong physiognomy.Said a great many quaint things, and read us part of
a reply which he intends to publish to Watson's 'Apology.'"* "Thomas Poole and His Friends," ii., p.Paine seems to have had no relation with the ruling powers at this time,
though an Englishman who visited him is quoted by Rickman (p.198) as
remarking his manliness and fearlessness, and that he spoke as freely as
ever after Bonaparte's supremacy.One communication only to any member
of the government appears; this was to the Minister of the Interior
concerning a proposed iron bridge over the Seine.* Political France and
Paine had parted.Under date of March 18, 1801, President Jefferson informs Paine that he
had sent his manuscripts (Maritime Compact) to the printer to be made
into a pamphlet, and that the American people had returned from their
frenzy against France.He adds:

"You expressed a wish to get a passage to this country in a public
vessel.Dawson is charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland
to receive and accommodate you back if you can be ready to depart
at such short warning.R. Livingston is appointed minister
plenipotentiary to the republic of France, but will not leave this till
we receive the ratification of the convention by Mr.** I am in
hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments worthy of former
times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily labored, and with
as much effect as any man living.That you may long live to continue
your useful labors and to reap the reward in the thankfulness of
nations, is my sincere prayer.Accept assurances of my high esteem and
affectionate attachment."*  "The Minister of the Interior to Thomas Paine: I have
     received, Citizen, the observations that you have been so
     good as to address to me upon the construction of iron
     bridges.They will be of the greatest utility to us when the
     new kind of construction goes to be executed for the first
     time.With pleasure I assure you, Citizen, that you have
     rights of more than one kind to the gratitude of nations,
     and I give you, cordially, the expression of my particular
     esteem.--Chaptal."It is rather droll, considering the appropriation of his
     patent in England, and the confiscation of a thousand pounds
     belonging to him, to find Paine casually mentioning that at
     this time a person came from London with plans and drawings
     to consult with him about an iron arch of 600 feet, over the
     Thames, then under consideration by a committee of the House
     of Commons.**  "Beau Dawson," an eminent Virginia Congressman.The subjoined notes are from letters of Paine to Jefferson:

_Paris, June 9, 1801_.Dawson gave me
the real sensation of happy satisfaction, and what served to increase
it was that he brought it to me himself before I knew of his arrival.There has been no circumstance
with respect to America since the times of her revolution that excited
so much attention and expectation in France, England, Ireland, and
Scotland as the pending election for President of the United States, nor
any of which the event has given more general joy:

"I thank you for the opportunity you give me of returning by the
Maryland, but I shall wait the return of the vessel that brings Mr."The Parliamentaire, from America to Havre,
was taken in going out, and carried into England.The pretence, as the
papers say, was that a Swedish Minister was on board for America.If
I had happened to have been there, I suppose they would have made no
ceremony in conducting me on shore."*




{1802}

_Paris, March 17,1802_."As it is now Peace, though the definitive
Treaty is not yet signed, I shall set off by the first opportunity from
Havre or Dieppe, after the equinoctial gales are over.I continue in
excellent health, which I know your friendship will be glad to hear
of.--Wishing you and America every happiness, I remain your former
fellow-labourer and much obliged fellow-citizen."Paine's determination not to return to America in a national vessel was
owing to a paragraph he saw in a Baltimore paper, headed "Out at Last."It stated that Paine had written to the President, expressing a wish to
return by a national ship, and that "permission was given."There was
here an indication that Jefferson's invitation to Paine by the Hon.John
Dawson had become known to the President's enemies, and that Jefferson,
on being attacked, had apologized by making the matter appear an act
of charity.Paine would not believe that the President was personally
responsible for the apologetic paragraph, which seemed inconsistent with
the cordiality of the letter brought by Dawson; but, as he afterwards
wrote to Jefferson, "it determined me not to come by a national ship."*
His request had been made at a time when any other than a national
American ship was pretty certain to land him in an English prison.There
was evidently no thought of any _eclat_ in the matter, but no doubt a
regard for economy as well as safety.Jefferson had been charged
     with sending a national ship to France for the sole purpose
     of bringing Paine home, and Paine himself would have been
     the first to condemn such an assumption of power.Although
     the President's adherents thought it right to deny this,
     Jefferson wrote to Paine that he had nothing to do with the
     paragraph."With respect to the letter [offering the ship] I
     never hesitate to avow and justify it in conversation.In no
     other way do I trouble myself to contradict anything which
     is said.At that time, however, there were anomalies in the
     motions of some of our friends which events have at length
     reduced to regularity."The following to the eminent deist lecturer in New York, Elihu Palmer,
bears the date, "Paris, February 21, 1802, since the Fable of Christ":

"Dear Friend, I received, by Mr.Livingston, the letter you wrote me,
and the excellent work you have published ["The Principles of Nature"].I see you have thought deeply on the subject, and expressed your
thoughts in a strong and clear style.The hinting and intimating manner
of writing that was formerly used on subjects of this kind, produced
skepticism, but not conviction.Some people
can be reasoned into sense, and others must be shocked into it.Say a
bold thing that will stagger them, and they will begin to think."There is an intimate friend of mine, Colonel Joseph Kirk-bride of
Bordentown, New Jersey, to whom I would wish you to send your work.He
is an excellent man, and perfectly in our sentiments.You can send it by
the stage that goes partly by land and partly by water, between New York
and Philadelphia, and passes through Bordentown."I expect to arrive in America in May next.I have a third part of the
Age of Reason to publish when I arrive, which, if I mistake not, will
make a stronger impression than any thing I have yet published on the
subject."I write this by an ancient colleague of mine in the French Convention,
the citizen Lequinio, who is going [as] Consul to Rhode Island, and who
waits while I write.The following, dated July 8, 1802, to Consul Rotch, is the last letter I
find written by Paine from Paris:

"My Dear Friend,--The bearer of this is a young man that wishes to go
to America.He is willing to do anything on board a ship to lesson the
expense of his passage.If you know any captain to whom such a person
may be usefull I will be obliged to you to speak to him about it.Otte was to come to Paris in order to go to America, I wanted
to take a passage with him, but as he stays in England to negociate some
arrangements of Commerce, I have given up that idea.I wait now for the
arrival of a person from England whom I want to see,** after which, I
shall bid adieu to restless and wretched Europe.I am with affectionate
esteem to you and Mrs.Rotch,

"Yours,

"Thomas Paine."* J. M. Lequinio, author of "Prejudices Destroyed," and
     other rationalistic works, especially dealt with in
     Priestley's "Letters to the Philosophers of France."The President's cordial letter had raised a happy vision before the eyes
of one sitting amid the ruins of his republican world.As he said of
Job, he had "determined, in the midst of accumulating ills, to impose
upon himself the hard duty of contentment."Of the comrades with whom he
began the struggle for liberty in France but a small circle remained.As he wrote to Lady Smith,--from whom he must now part,--"I might almost
say like Job's servant, 'and I only am escaped.'"Of the American and
English friends who cared for him when he came out of prison few remain.The President's letter came to a poor man in a small room, furnished
only with manuscripts and models of inventions.Here he was found by
an old friend from England, Henry Redhead Yorke, who, in 1795, had been
tried in England for sedition.Yorke has left us a last glimpse of the
author in "wretched and restless Europe."The "rights of man" had become
so antiquated in Napoleon's France, that Yorke found Paine's name odious
on account of his antislavery writings, the people "ascribing to his
espousal of the rights of the <DW64>s of St.Domingo the resistance
which Leclercq had experienced from them."A "jolly-looking woman" (in whom we recognize
Madame Bonneville) scrutinized Yorke severely, but was smiling enough
on learning that he was Paine's old friend.He was ushered into a little
room heaped with boxes of documents, a chaos of pamphlets and journals.While Yorke was meditating on the contrast between this habitation of a
founder of two great republics and the mansions of their rulers, his old
friend entered, dressed in a long flannel gown."Time seemed to have made dreadful ravages over his whole frame, and a
settled melancholy was visible on his countenance.He desired me to be
seated, and although he did not recollect me for a considerable time,
he conversed with his usual affability.I confess I felt extremely
surprised that he should have forgotten me; but I resolved not to make
myself known to him, as long as it could be avoided with propriety.In
order to try his memory, I referred to a number of circumstances which
had occurred while we were in company, but carefully abstained from
hinting that we had ever lived together.He would frequently put his
hand to his forehead, and exclaim, 'Ah!I know that voice, but my
recollection fails!'At length I thought it time to remove his suspense,
and stated an incident which instantly recalled me to his mind.It
is impossible to describe the sudden change which this effected; his
countenance brightened, he pressed me by the hand, and a silent tear
stole down his cheek.For some
time we sat without a word escaping from our lips.'Thus are we met once
more, Mr.Paine,' I resumed, 'after a long separation of ten years,
and after having been both of us severely weather-beaten.''Aye,' he
replied, 'and who would have thought that we should meet in Paris?'He then enquired what motive had brought me here, and on my explaining
myself, he observed with a smile of contempt, 'They have shed blood
enough for liberty, and now they have it in perfection.This is not a
country for an honest man to live in; they do not understand any thing
at all of the principles of free government, and the best way is to
leave them to themselves.You see they have conquered all Europe, only
to make it more miserable than it was before.'Upon this, I remarked
that I was surprised to hear him speak in such desponding language of
the fortune of mankind, and that I thought much might yet be done for
the Republic.he exclaimed, 'do you call this a Republic?Why they are worse off than the slaves of Constantinople; for there,
they expect to be bashaws in heaven by submitting to be slaves below,
but here they believe neither in heaven nor hell, and yet are slaves by
choice.I know of no Republic in the world except America, which is the
only country for such men as you and I. It is my intention to get away
from this place as soon as possible, and I hope to be off in the autumn;
you are a young man and may see better times, but I have done with
Europe, and its slavish politics.'"I have often been in company with Mr.Paine, since my arrival here, and
I was not a little surprised to find him wholly indifferent about the
public spirit in England, or the remaining influence of his doctrines
among its people.Indeed he seemed to dislike the mention of the
subject; and when, one day, in order to provoke discussion, I told him
I had altered my opinions upon many of his principles, he answered, 'You
certainly have the right to do so; but you cannot alter the nature
of things; the French have alarmed all honest men; but still truth is
truth.Though you may not think that my principles are practicable in
England, without bringing on a great deal of misery and confusion, you
are, I am sure, convinced of their justice.'Here he took occasion to
speak in terms of the utmost severity of Mr------, who had obtained
a seat in parliament, and said that 'parsons were always mischievous
fellows when they turned politicians.'This gave rise to an observation
respecting his 'Age of Reason,' the publication of which I said had
lost him the good opinion of numbers of his English advocates.He
became uncommonly warm at this remark, and in a tone of singular energy
declared that he would not have published it if he had not thought it
calculated to 'inspire mankind with a more exalted idea of the Supreme
Architect of the Universe, and to put an end to villainous imposture.'He then broke out with the most violent invectives against our received
opinions, accompanying them at the same time with some of the most grand
and sublime conceptions of an Omnipotent Being, that I ever heard or
read of.In the support of his opinion, he avowed himself ready to
lay down his life, and said 'the Bishop of Llandaff may roast me in
Smithfield if he likes, but human torture cannot shake my conviction.'He reached down a copy of the Bishop's work, interleaved with remarks
upon it, which he read me; after which he admitted the liberality of
the Bishop, and regretted that in all controversies among men a similar
temper was not maintained.But in proportion as he appeared listless in
politics, he seemed quite a zealot in his religious creed; of which the
following is an instance.An English lady of our acquaintance, not less
remarkable for her talents than for elegance of manners, entreated me to
contrive that she might have an interview with Mr.In consequence
of this I invited him to dinner on a day when we were to be favoured
with her company.But as she is a very rigid Roman Catholic I cautioned
Mr.Paine, beforehand, against touching upon religious subjects,
assuring him at the same time that she felt much interested to make his
acquaintance.With much good nature he promised to be _discreet_.... For
above four hours he kept every one in astonishment and admiration of
his memory, his keen observation of men and manners, his numberless
anecdotes of the American Indians, of the American war, of Franklin,
Washington, and even of his Majesty, of whom he told several curious
facts of humour and benevolence.His remarks on genius and taste can
never be forgotten by those present.Thus far everything went on as I
could wish; the sparkling champagne gave a zest to his conversation,
and we were all delighted.an expression relating to his
'Age of Reason' having been mentioned by one of the company, he broke
out immediately.He began with Astronomy,--addressing himself to Mrs.Y.,--he declared that the least inspection of the motion of the stars
was a convincing proof that Moses was a liar.In
vain I attempted to change the subject, by employing every artifice in
my power, and even attacking with vehemence his political principles.He returned to the charge with unabated ardour.I called upon him for a
song though I never heard him sing in my life.He struck up one of
his own composition; but the instant he had finished it he resumed his
favourite topic.I felt extremely mortified, and remarked that he had
forgotten his promise, and that it was not fair to wound so deeply the
opinions of the ladies.said he, 'they 'll come again.What a pity
it is that people should be so prejudiced!'To which I retorted that
their prejudices might be virtues.'If so,' he replied, 'the blossoms
may be beautiful to the eye, but the root is weak.'One of the most
extraordinary properties belonging to Mr.Paine is his power of
retaining everything he has written in the course of his life.It is
a fact that he can repeat word for word every sentence in his 'Common
Sense,' 'Rights of Man,' etc., etc.The Bible is the only book which he
has studied, and there is not a verse in it that is not familiar to him.In shewing me one day the beautiful models of two bridges he had devised
he observed that Dr.Franklin once told him that 'books are written to
please, houses built for great men, churches for priests, but no bridges
for the people.'These models exhibit an extraordinary degree not only
of skill but of taste; and are wrought with extreme delicacy entirely
by his own hands.The largest is nearly four feet in length; the iron
works, the chains, and every other article belonging to it, were forged
and manufactured by himself.It is intended as the model of a bridge
which is to be constructed across the Delaware, extending 480 feet with
only one arch.The other is to be erected over a lesser river,
whose name I forget, and is likewise a single arch, and of his own
workmanship, excepting the chains, which, instead of iron, are cut out
of pasteboard, by the fair hand of his correspondent the 'Little Corner
of the World,' whose indefatigable perseverance is extraordinary.He was
offered L3000 for these models and refused it.The iron bars, which
I before mentioned that I noticed in a corner of his room, were also
forged by himself, as the model of a crane, of a new description.He put
them together, and exhibited the power of the lever to a most surprising
degree."'*"Letters from France," etc., London, 1804, 2 vols., 8vo.Thirty-three pages of the last letter are devoted to Paine.About this time Sir Robert Smith died, and another of the ties to Paris
was snapped.His beloved Bonnevilles promised to follow him to the New
World.His old friend Rickman has come over to see him off, and observed
that "he did not drink spirits, and wine he took moderately; he even
objected to any spirits being laid in as a part of his sea-stock."These
two friends journeyed together to Havre, where, on September 1st, the
way-worn man begins his homeward voyage.Poor Rickman, the perpetually
prosecuted, strains his eyes till the sail is lost, then sits on the
beach and writes his poetical tribute to Jefferson and America for
recalling Paine, and a touching farewell to his friend:

     "Thus smooth be thy waves, and thus gentle the breeze,
     As thou bearest my Paine far away;
     O waft him to comfort and regions of ease,
     Each blessing of freedom and friendship to seize,
     And bright be his setting sun's ray."Who can imagine the joy of those eyes when they once more beheld the
distant coast of the New World!Fifteen years have passed,--years
in which all nightmares became real, and liberty's sun had turned to
blood,--since he saw the happy land fading behind him.Oh, America,
thine old friend who first claimed thy republican independence, who laid
aside his Quaker coat and fought for thy cause, believing it sacred, is
returning to thy breast!This is the man of whom Washington wrote: "His
writings certainly had a powerful effect on the public mind,--ought they
not then to meet an adequate return?It is
not money he needs now, but tenderness, sympathy; for he comes back from
an old world that has plundered, outlawed, imprisoned him for his love
of mankind.He has seen his dear friends sent to the guillotine, and
others are pining in British prisons for publishing his "Rights of
Man,"--principles pronounced by President Jefferson and Secretary
Madison to be those of the United States.Heartsore, scarred,
white-haired, there remains to this veteran of many struggles for
humanity but one hope, a kindly welcome, a peaceful haven for his
tempest-tossed life.Never for an instant has his faith in the heart
of America been shaken.Already he sees his friend Jefferson's arms
extended; he sees his old comrades welcoming him to their hearths; he
sees his own house and sward at Bordentown, and the beautiful Kirk-bride
mansion beside the Delaware,--river of sacred memories, soon to be
spanned by his graceful arch.How the ladies he left girls,--Fanny.Kitty, Sally,--will come with their husbands to greet him!How will they
admire the latest bridge-model, with Lady Smith's delicate chain-work
for which (such is his estimate of friendship) he refused three thousand
pounds, though it would have made his mean room palatial!Ah, yes, poor
heart, America will soothe your wounds, and pillow your sinking head on
her breast!America, with Jefferson in power, is herself again.They do
not hate men in America for not believing in a celestial Robespierre.Thou stricken friend of man, who hast appealed from the god of wrath
to the God of Humanity, see in the distance that Maryland coast, which
early voyagers called Avalon, and sing again your song when first
stepping on that shore twenty-seven years ago:

      "I come to sing that summer is at hand,
      The summer time of wit, you 'll understand;
      Plants, fruits, and flowers, and all the smiling race
      That can the orchard or the garden grace;
      The Rose and Lily shall address the fair,
      And whisper sweetly out, 'My dears, take care:'
      With sterling worth the Plant of Sense shall rise,
      And teach the curious to philosophize.We 'll garnish out the scenes
      With stately rows of Evergreens,
      Trees that will bear the frost, and deck their tops
      With everlasting flowers, like diamond drops."* "The Snowdrop and Critic," Pennsylvania Magazine, 1775.THE AMERICAN INQUISITION

On October 30th Paine landed at Baltimore.More than two and a half
centuries had elapsed since the Catholic Lord Baltimore appointed a
Protestant Governor of Maryland, William Stone, who proclaimed in that
province (1648) religious freedom and equality.The Puritans, crowding
thither, from regions of oppression, grew strong enough to exterminate
the religion of Lord Baltimore who had given them shelter, and
imprisoned his Protestant Governor.So, in the New World, passed the
Inquisition from Catholic to Protestant hands.In Paine's first American pamphlet, he had repeated and extolled the
principle of that earliest proclamation of religious liberty."Diversity
of religious opinions affords a larger field for Christian kindness."The Christian kindness now consists in a cessation of sectarian strife
that they may unite in stretching the author of the "Age of Reason"
on their common rack, so far as was possible under a Constitution
acknowledging no deity.Soon after landing Paine wrote to President Jefferson:

"I arrived here on Saturday from Havre, after a passage of sixty days.I have several cases of models, wheels, etc., and as soon as I can get
them from the vessel and put them on board the packet for Georgetown
I shall set off to pay my respects to you.Your much obliged
fellow-citizen,--Thomas Paine."On reaching Washington City Paine found his dear friend Monroe starting
off to resume his ministry in Paris, and by him wrote to Mr.Este,
banker in Paris (Sir Robert Smith's son-in-law), enclosing a letter to
Rickman, in London."You can have no idea," he tells Rickman, "of the
agitation which my arrival occasioned."Every paper is "filled with
applause or abuse.""My property in this country has been taken care of by my friends, and
is now worth six thousand pounds sterling; which put in the funds will
bring me L400 sterling a year.Remember me in friendship and affection
to your wife and family, and in the circle of our friends.I am but just
arrived here, and the minister sails in a few hours, so that I have just
time to write you this.If he should not sail this tide I will write to
my good friend Col.Bosville, but in any case I request you to wait on
him for me.* Paine still had faith in Bosville.He was slow in
     suspecting any man who seemed enthusiastic for liberty.In
     this connection it may be mentioned that it is painful to
     find in the "Diary and Letters of Gouverneur Morris," (ii.,
     p.426) a confidential letter to Robert R. Livingston,
     Minister in France, which seems to assume that Minister's
     readiness to receive slanders of Jefferson, who appointed
     him, and of Paine whose friendship he seemed to value.Speaking of the President, Morris says: "The employment of
     and confidence in adventurers from abroad will sooner or
     later rouse the pride and indignation of this country."Morris' editor adds: "This was probably an allusion to
     Thomas Paine, who had recently returned to America and was
     supposed to be an intimate friend of Mr.Jefferson, who, it
     was said, received him warmly, dined him at the White House,
     and could be seen walking arm in arm with him on the street
     any fine afternoon."The allusion to "adventurers" was no
     doubt meant for Paine, but not to his reception by
     Jefferson, for Morris' letter was written on August 27th,
     some two months before Paine's arrival.It was probably
     meant by Morris to damage Paine in Paris, where it was known
     that he was intimate with Livingston, who had been
     introduced by him to influential men, among others to Sir
     Robert Smith and Este, bankers.It is to be hoped that
     Livingston resented Morris' assumption of his treacherous
     character.Morris, who had shortly before dined at the White
     House, tells Livingston that Jefferson is "descending to a
     condition which I find no decent word to designate."Surely
     Livingston's descendants should discover his reply to that
     letter.The defeated Federalists had already prepared their batteries to assail
the President for inviting Paine to return on a national ship, under
escort of a Congressman.It required some skill for these adherents of
John Adams, a Unitarian, to set the Inquisition in motion.It had to be
done, however, as there was no chance of breaking down Jefferson but
by getting preachers to sink political differences and hound the
President's favorite author.Out of the North, stronghold of the
"British Party," came this partisan crusade under a pious flag.In
Virginia and the South the "Age of Reason" was fairly discussed, its
influence being so great that Patrick Henry, as we have seen, wrote and
burnt a reply.In Virginia, Deism, though largely prevailing, had not
prevented its adherents from supporting the Church as an institution.It had become their habit to talk of such matters only in private.Jefferson had not ventured to express his views in public, and was
troubled at finding himself mixed up with the heresies of Paine.*

     * To the Rev.Waterhouse (Unitarian) who had asked
     permission to publish a letter of his, Jefferson, with a
     keen remembrance of Paine's fate, wrote (July 19, 1822):
     "No, my dear Sir, not for the world.Into what a hornet's
     nest would it thrust my head!--The genus irritabile vatmm,
     on whom argument is lost, and reason is by themselves
     disdained in matters of religion.Don Quixote undertook to
     redress the bodily wrongs of the world, but the redressaient
     of mental vagaries would be an enterprise more than Quixotic
     I should as soon undertake to bring the crazy skulls of
     Bedlam to sound understanding as to inculcate reason into
     that of an Athanasian.I am old, and tranquillity is now my
     summum bonum.Keep me therefore from the fire
