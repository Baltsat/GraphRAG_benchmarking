When he saw the two, he rose expectantly,
and went forward to meet them.John went back to the office."Pa," she said, "is it true that you have borrowed money from this man?"Carvel angry once, and his soul had quivered.Terror, abject terror, seized him now, so that his knees smote together.Mary moved to the bathroom.As well stare into the sun as into the Colonel's face.John journeyed to the hallway.In one stride
he had a hand in the collar of Eliphalet's new coat, the other pointing
down the path."It takes just a minute to walk to that fence, sir," he said sternly."If you are any longer about it, I reckon you'll never get past it.Hopper's gait down the flagstones was
an invention of his own.John went to the bathroom.It was neither a walk, nor a trot, nor a run,
but a sort of sliding amble, such as is executed in nightmares.Singing
in his head was the famous example of the eviction of Babcock from the
store,--the only time that the Colonel's bullet had gone wide.And down
in the small of his back Eliphalet listened for the crack of a pistol,
and feared that a clean hole might be bored there any minute.Once
outside, he took to the white road, leaving a trail of dust behind him
that a wagon might have raised.Fear lent him wings, but neglected to
lift his feet.The Colonel passed his arm around his daughter, and pulled his goatee
thoughtfully.And Virginia, glancing shyly upward, saw a smile in the
creases about his mouth: She smiled, too, and then the tears hid him
from her.Strange that the face which in anger withered cowards and made men look
grave, was capable of such infinite tenderness,--tenderness and sorrow.Sandra went to the garden.The Colonel took Virginia in his arms, and she sobbed against his
shoulder, as of old.Sandra went back to the office."Yes--"

"Lige was right, and--and you, Jinny--I should never have trusted him.The sun was slanting in yellow bars through
the branches of the great trees, and a robin's note rose above the bass
chorus of the frogs.In the pauses, as she listened, it seemed as if she
could hear the silver sound of the river over the pebbles far below."Honey," said the Colonel,--"I reckon we're just as poor as white
trash.""Honey," he said again, after a pause, "I must keep my word and let him
have the business.""There is a little left, a very little," he continued slowly, painfully.It was left you by Becky--by your mother.It is in a railroad company in New York, and safe, Jinny.""Oh, Pa, you know that I do not care," she cried.She sighed, then smiled and took the word:
    "You see the guardian champion's sword;
    As light it trembles in his hand,
    As in my grasp a hazel wand;
    My sire's tall form might grace the part
    Of Ferragus, or Ascabart;[69]
    But in the absent giant's hold
    Are women now, and menials old."[69] Ferragus and Ascabart were two giants of romantic fable.The
former appears in Ariosto's Orlando Furioso; the latter in the History
of Bevis of Hampton.His effigy may be seen guarding the gate at
Southampton.The mistress of the mansion came,
    Mature of age, a graceful dame;
    Whose easy step and stately port
    Had well become a princely court;
    To whom, though more than kindred knew,[70]
    Young Ellen gave a mother's due.Meet welcome to her guest she made,
    And every courteous rite was paid
    That hospitality could claim,
    Though all unask'd his birth and name.Such then the reverence to a guest,
    That fellest[71] foe might join the feast,
    And from his deadliest foeman's door
    Unquestion'd turn, the banquet o'er.At length his rank the stranger names,
    "The Knight of Snowdoun,[72] James Fitz-James;[73]
    Lord of a barren heritage,[74]
    Which his brave sires, from age to age,
    By their good swords had held with toil;
    His sire had fall'n in such turmoil,
    And he, God wot,[75] was forced to stand
    Oft for his right with blade in hand.This morning with Lord Moray's[76] train
    He chased a stalwart stag in vain,
    Outstripp'd his comrades, miss'd the deer,
    Lost his good steed, and wander'd here."[70] Dame Margaret was Roderick Dhu's mother, but had acted as mother
to Ellen, and held a higher place in her affections than the ties of
blood would warrant.[72] An old name of Stirling Castle.[73] Fitz means "son" in Norman French.[74] "By the misfortunes of the earlier Jameses and the internal feuds
of the Scottish chiefs, the kingly power had become little more than a
name."[76] A half-brother of James V.Fain would the Knight in turn require
    The name and state of Ellen's sire.Well show'd the elder lady's mien
    That courts and cities she had seen;
    Ellen, though more her looks display'd
    The simple grace of silvan maid,
    In speech and gesture, form and face,
    Show'd she was come of gentle race.'Twere strange in ruder rank to find
    Such looks, such manners, and such mind.Each hint the Knight of Snowdoun gave,
    Dame Margaret heard with silence grave;
    Or Ellen, innocently gay,
    Turn'd all inquiry light away:--
    "Weird women we!by dale and down[77]
    We dwell, afar from tower and town.We stem the flood, we ride the blast,
    On wandering knights our spells we cast;
    While viewless minstrels touch the string,
    'Tis thus our charmed rhymes we sing."She sung, and still a harp unseen
    Fill'd up the symphony between.[77] Hilly or undulating land.thy warfare o'er,
      Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking:
    Dream of battled fields no more,
      Days of danger, nights of waking.In our isle's enchanted hall,
      Hands unseen thy couch are strewing,
    Fairy strains of music fall,
      Every sense in slumber dewing.[78]
    Soldier, rest!thy warfare o'er,
    Dream of fighting fields no more:
    Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,
    Morn of toil, nor night of waking."No rude sound shall reach thine ear,
