          I love to live.There are ten thousand cords
          Which bind my soul to life, ten thousand sweets
          Mixed with the bitter of existence’ cup
          Which make me love to quaff its mingled wine.There are sweet looks and tones through all the earth
          That win my heart.Love-looks are in the lily’s bell
          And violet’s eye, and love-tones on the winds
          And waters.There are forms of grace which all
          The while are gliding by, enrapturing
          My vision.O, I can not guess how one
          Can weary of the earth, when ev’ry year
          To me it seems more and more beautiful;
          When each succeeding spring the flowers wear
          A fairer hue, and ev’ry autumn on
          The forest top are richer tints.When each
          Succeeding day the sunlight brighter seems,
          And ev’ry night a fairer beauty shines
          From all the stars....

Likewise, this rather melancholy effusion, entitled “Waiting”:

                Love, sweet Love, I’m waiting for thee,
                And my heart is wildly beating
                At the joyous thought of meeting
                With its kindred heart so dear.Love, I’m waiting for thee here.Love, _now_ I am waiting for thee._Soon_ I shall not wait thee more,
                Neither by the open casement,
                Nor beside the open door
                Shall I sit and wait thee more.Daniel travelled to the bathroom.Love, I shall not wait long for thee,
                Not upon Time’s barren shore,
                For I see my cheek is paling,
                And I feel my strength is failing.Love, I shall not wait here for thee.When I ope the golden door
                I will ask to wait there for thee,
                Close beside Heaven’s open door.There I’ll stand and watch and listen
                Till I see thy white plumes glisten,
                Hear thy angel-pinions sweeping
                Upward through the ether clear;
                Then, beloved, at Heaven’s gate meeting,
                This shall be my joyous greeting,
                “Love, I’m waiting for thee here.”

                         ASAPH HALL, CARPENTER.Mary went to the hallway.Like many other impecunious Americans (Angeline Stickney included),
Asaph Hall, carpenter, and afterwards astronomer, came of excellent
family.He was descended from John Hall, of Wallingford, Conn., who
served in the Pequot War.The same John Hall was the progenitor of Lyman
Hall, signer of the Declaration of Independence and Governor of Georgia.The carpenter’s great-grandfather, David Hall, an original proprietor of
Goshen, Conn., was killed in battle near Lake George on that fatal 8th
of September, 1755.[1] His grandfather, Asaph Hall 1st, saw service in
the Revolution as captain of Connecticut militia.This Asaph and his
sister Alice went from Wallingford about 1755, to become Hall pioneers
in Goshen, Conn., where they lived in a log house.Alice married; Asaph
prospered, and in 1767 built himself a large house.He was a friend of
Ethan Allen, was with him at the capture of Ticonderoga, and was one of
the chief patriots of Goshen.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.He saw active service as a soldier, served
twenty-four times in the State legislature, and was a member of the
State convention called to ratify the Federal Constitution.Hall Meadow,
a fertile valley in the town of Goshen, still commemorates his name.Mary went to the garden.He
accumulated considerable property, so that his only child, the second
Asaph Hall, born in 1800 a few months after his death, was brought up a
young gentleman, and fitted to enter Yale College.But the mother
refused to be separated from her son, and before he became of age she
set him up in business.His inheritance rapidly slipped away; and in
1842 he died in Georgia, where he was selling clocks, manufactured in
his Goshen factory.Footnote 1:

Asaph Hall 3rd, born October 15, 1829, was the eldest of six children.His early boyhood was spent in easy circumstances, and he early acquired
a taste for good literature.But at thirteen he was called upon to help
his mother rescue the wreckage of his father’s property.Fortunately,
the Widow, Hannah (Palmer) Hall, was a woman of sterling character, a
daughter of Robert Palmer, first of Stonington, then of Goshen, Conn.To
her Asaph Hall 3rd owed in large measure his splendid physique; and who
can say whether his mental powers were inherited from father or mother?For three years the widow and her children struggled to redeem a
mortgaged farm.During one of these years they made and sold ten
thousand pounds of cheese, at six cents a pound.It was a losing fight,
so the widow retired to a farm free from mortgage, and young Asaph, now
sixteen, was apprenticed to Herrick and Dunbar, carpenters.He served an
apprenticeship of three years, receiving his board and five dollars a
