I should think Eddy Tousley would be an awful good boy with his father
in the house with him all the while, but probably he has to be away part
of the time preaching to other children._Sunday._--Uncle David Dudley Field and his daughter, Mrs.Brewer, of
Stockbridge, Mass., are visiting us.Brewer has a son, David
Josiah, who is in Yale College.After he graduates he is going to be a
lawyer and study in his Uncle David Dudley Field's office in New York.He was born in Smyrna, Asia Minor, where his father and mother were
missionaries to the Greeks, in 1837.Sandra went back to the garden.He is a very old man and left his sermon at home
and I had to go back after it.His brother, Timothy, was the first
minister in our church, about fifty years ago.Grandmother says she
came all the way from Connecticut with him on horseback on a pillion
behind him.I heard her and Uncle
David talking about their childhood and how they lived in Guilford,
Conn., in a house that was built upon a rock.Sandra went to the hallway.That was some time in the
last century like the house that it tells about in the Bible that was
built on a rock._Sunday, August 10, 1854._--Rev.Daggett's text this morning was,
"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy."Grandmother said she thought
the sermon did not do us much good for she had to tell us several times
this afternoon to stop laughing.Grandmother said we ought to be good
Sundays if we want to go to heaven, for there it is one eternal Sabbath.Daniel went back to the garden.Anna said she didn't want to be an angel just yet and I don't think
there is the least danger of it, as far as I can judge.Grandmother said
there was another verse, "If we do not have any pleasure on the Sabbath,
or think any thoughts, we shall ride on the high places of the earth,"
and Anna said she liked that better, for she would rather ride than do
anything else, so we both promised to be good.Grandfather told us they
used to be more strict about Sunday than they are now.Then he told us a
story, how he had to go to Geneva one Saturday morning in the stage and
expected to come back in the evening, but there was an accident, so the
stage did not come till Sunday morning.Church had begun and he told the
stage driver to leave him right there, so he went in late and the stage
drove on.The next day he heard that he was to come before the minister,
Rev.Johns, and the deacons and explain why he had broken the fourth
commandment.Johns asked him what he
had to say, and he explained about the accident and asked them to read a
verse from the 8th chapter of John, before they made up their minds what
to do to him.The verse was, "Let him that is without sin among you cast
the first stone."Grandfather said they all smiled, and the minister
said the meeting was out.Grandfather says that shows it is better to
know plenty of Bible verses, for some time they may do you a great deal
of good.We then recited the catechism and went to bed.[Illustration: First Congregational Church]

_August 21._--Anna says that Alice Jewett feels very proud because she
has a little baby brother.They have named him John Harvey Jewett after
his father, and Alice says when he is bigger she will let Anna help her
take him out to ride in his baby-carriage.I suppose they will throw
away their dolls now._Tuesday, September_ 1.--I am sewing a sheet over and over for
Grandmother and she puts a pin in to show me my stint, before I can go
out to play.I am always glad when I get to it.I am making a sampler,
too, and have all the capital letters worked and now will make the small
ones.It is done in cross stitch on canvas with different color silks.I
am going to work my name, too.I am also knitting a tippet on some
wooden needles that Henry Carr made for me.Grandmother has raveled it
out several times because I dropped stitches.It is rather tedious, but
she says, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."Some military
soldiers went by the house to-day and played some beautiful music.Grandfather has a teter and swing for us in the back yard and we enjoy
them usually, but to-night Anna slid off the teter board when she was on
the ground and I was in the air and I came down sooner than I expected.There was a hand organ and monkey going by and she was in a hurry to get
to the street to see it.She got there a good while before I did.The
other day we were swinging and Grandmother called us in to dinner, but
Anna said we could not go until we "let the old cat die."Grandmother
said it was more important that we should come when we are called._October._--Grandmother's name is Abigail, but she was always called
"Nabby" at home.Some of the girls call me "Carrie," but Grandmother
prefers "Caroline."She told us to-day, how when she was a little girl,
down in Connecticut in 1794, she was on her way to school one morning
and she saw an Indian coming and was so afraid, but did not dare run for
fear he would chase her.So she thought of the word sago, which means
"good morning," and when she got up close to him she dropped a curtesy
and said "Sago," and he just went right along and never touched her at
all.She says she hopes we will always be polite to every one, even to
strangers._November._--Abbie Clark's father has been elected Governor and she is
going to Albany to live, for a while.Sandra moved to the kitchen.We all congratulated her when she
came to school this morning, but I am sorry she is going away.We will
write to each other every week.She wrote a prophecy and told the girls
what they were going to be and said I should be mistress of the White
House.I think it will happen, about the same time that Anna goes to be
a missionary._December._--There was a moonlight sleigh-ride of boys and girls last
night, but Grandfather did not want us to go, but to-night he said he
was going to take us to one himself.Piser
to harness the horse to the cutter and bring it around to the front
gate.Piser takes care of our horse and the Methodist Church.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Grandfather sometimes calls him Shakespeare to
us, but I don't know why.He doesn't look as though he wrote poetry.Grandfather said he was going to take us out to Mr.Mary journeyed to the garden.John went to the kitchen.Mary travelled to the office.Waterman Powers' in
Farmington and he did.They were quite surprised to see us, but very
glad and gave us apples and doughnuts and other good things.We saw Anne
and Imogene and Morey and one little girl named Zimmie.They wanted us
to stay all night, but Grandmother was expecting us.We got home safe
about ten o'clock and had a very nice time.1855


_Wednesday, January_ 9.--I came downstairs this morning at ten minutes
after seven, almost frozen.I never spent such a cold night before in
