The most disturbing thing was the need of a new
cooking-stove, the cost of which added greatly to the bill.The
younger children were entered at the public school, but it was decided
that George must find some employment.Both Jennie and her mother felt
the injustice of this keenly, but knew no way of preventing the
sacrifice."We will let him go to school next year if we can," said
Jennie.Auspiciously as the new life seemed to have begun, the closeness
with which their expenses were matching their income was an
ever-present menace.Bass, originally very generous in his
propositions, soon announced that he felt four dollars a week for his
room and board to be a sufficient contribution from himself.Jennie
gave everything she earned, and protested that she did not stand in
need of anything, so long as the baby was properly taken care of.George secured a place as an overgrown cash-boy, and brought in two
dollars and fifty cents a week, all of which, at first, he gladly
contributed.Later on he was allowed the fifty cents for himself as
being meet and just.Gerhardt, from his lonely post of labor,
contributed five dollars by mail, always arguing that a little money
ought to be saved in order that his honest debts back in Columbus
might be paid.Out of this total income of fifteen dollars a week all
of these individuals had to be fed and clothed, the rent paid, coal
purchased, and the regular monthly instalment of three dollars paid on
the outstanding furniture bill of fifty dollars.How it was done, those comfortable individuals, who frequently
discuss the social aspects of poverty, might well trouble to inform
themselves.Rent, coal, and light alone consumed the goodly sum of
twenty dollars a month; food, another unfortunately necessary item,
used up twenty-five more; clothes, instalments, dues, occasional items
of medicine and the like, were met out of the remaining eleven
dollars--how, the ardent imagination of the comfortable reader
can guess.It was done, however, and for a time the hopeful members
considered that they were doing fairly well.During this period the little family presented a picture of
honorable and patient toil, which was interesting to contemplate.Gerhardt, who worked like a servant and who received
absolutely no compensation either in clothes, amusements, or anything
else, arose in the morning while the others slept, and built the fire.Then she took up the task of getting the breakfast.Often as she moved
about noiselessly in her thin, worn slippers, cushioned with pieces of
newspaper to make them fit, she looked in on Jennie, Bass, and George,
wrapped in their heavy slumbers, and with that divine sympathy which
is born in heaven she wished that they did not need to rise so early
or to work so hard.Sometimes she would pause before touching her
beloved Jennie, gaze at her white face, so calm in sleep, and lament
that life had not dealt more kindly with her.Then she would lay her
hand gently upon her shoulder and whisper, "Jennie, Jennie," until the
weary sleeper would wake.When they returned at
night supper was waiting.Each of the children received a due share of
Mrs.The little baby was closely looked after by
her.She protested that she needed neither clothes nor shoes so long
as one of the children would run errands for her.Jennie, of all the children, fully understood her mother; she alone
strove, with the fullness of a perfect affection, to ease her
burden."Now, ma, I'll 'tend to that."Sandra went to the hallway.These were the every-day expressions of the enduring affection that
existed between them.Always there was perfect understanding between
Jennie and her mother, and as the days passed this naturally widened
and deepened.Jennie could not bear to think of her as being always
confined to the house.Daily she thought as she worked of that humble
home where her mother was watching and waiting.How she longed to give
her those comforts which she had always craved!CHAPTER XIV


The days spent in the employ of the Bracebridge household were of a
broadening character.This great house was a school to Jennie, not
only in the matter of dress and manners, but as formulating a theory
of existence.Bracebridge and her husband were the last word in
the matter of self-sufficiency, taste in the matter of appointments,
care in the matter of dress, good form in the matter of reception,
entertainment, and the various usages of social life.Now and then,
apropos of nothing save her own mood, Mrs.Bracebridge would indicate
her philosophy of life in an epigram.If you gain anything you will have to
fight for it.""In my judgment it is silly not to take advantage of any aid which
will help you to be what you want to be."(This while applying a faint
suggestion of rouge.)They are exactly what they are capable
of being.I despise lack of taste; it is the worst crime."Most of these worldly-wise counsels were not given directly to
Jennie.She overheard them, but to her quiet and reflective mind they
had their import.Like seeds fallen upon good ground, they took root
and grew.She began to get a faint perception of hierarchies and
powers.They were not for her, perhaps, but they were in the world,
and if fortune were kind one might better one's state.She worked on,
wondering, however, just how better fortune might come to her.Who
would have her to wife knowing her history?Daniel went back to the kitchen.How could she ever explain
the existence of her child?Her child, her child, the one transcendent, gripping theme of joy
and fear.If she could only do something for it--sometime,
somehow!By the closest
economy the children were clothed and kept in school, the rent paid,
and the instalments met.Mary travelled to the garden.John moved to the garden.Once it looked as though there might be some
difficulty about the continuance of the home life, and that was when
Gerhardt wrote that he would be home for Christmas.The mill was to
close down for a short period at that time.He was naturally anxious
to see what the new life of his family at Cleveland was like.Gerhardt would have welcomed his return with unalloyed
pleasure had it not been for the fear she entertained of his creating
a scene.Jennie talked it over with her mother, and Mrs.Gerhardt in
turn spoke of it to Bass, whose advice was to brave it out."Don't worry," he said; "he won't do anything about it.I'll talk
to him if he says anything."The scene did occur, but it was not so unpleasant as Mrs.Gerhardt came home during the afternoon, while Bass,
Jennie, and George were at work.Two of the younger children went to
the train to meet him.Gerhardt greeted him
affectionately, but she trembled for the discovery which was sure to
come.Gerhardt opened the front bedroom
door only a few minutes after he arrived.John went to the bathroom.On the white counterpane of
the bed was a pretty child, sleeping.He could not but know on the
instant whose it was, but he pretended ignorance."It's Jennie's," said Mrs.John went to the garden."Not so very long ago," answered the mother, nervously."I guess she is here, too," he declared, contemptuously, refusing
to pronounce her name, a fact which he had already
