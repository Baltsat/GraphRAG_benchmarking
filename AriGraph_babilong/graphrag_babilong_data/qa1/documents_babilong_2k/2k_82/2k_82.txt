I was passing
and thought I'd come in."He's well, thank you," returned the mother."He's out working
to-day."Gerhardt, who hesitated, like Jennie, to say
what it was."The children are all well now, and in school, I hope?"She had now unfastened her apron, and
was nervously turning it in her lap."That's good, and where is Jennie?"The latter, who had been ironing, had abandoned the board and had
concealed herself in the bedroom, where she was busy tidying herself
in the fear that her mother would not have the forethought to say that
she was out, and so let her have a chance for escape."What did you tell him I was here for?"Together they hesitated while the Senator surveyed the room.He
felt sorry to think that such deserving people must suffer so; he
intended, in a vague way, to ameliorate their condition if
possible."Good-morning," the Senator said to Jennie, when finally she came
hesitatingly into the room.Jennie came forward, extending her hand and blushing.She found
herself so much disturbed by this visit that she could hardly find
tongue to answer his questions."I thought," he said, "I'd come out and find where you live."You'll have to excuse the looks this morning.We've been ironing, and it's all upset.""I know," said Brander, gently."Don't you think I understand,
Jennie?She noticed the comforting, personal tone he always used with her
when she was at his room, and it helped to subdue her flustered
senses."You mustn't think it anything if I come here occasionally."Oh," said Jennie, "he's out to-day."While they were talking, however, the honest woodcutter was coming
in at the gate with his buck and saw.Brander saw him, and at once
recognized him by a slight resemblance to his daughter."There he is now, I believe," he said.Gerhardt, who was given to speculation these days, passed by the
window without looking up.He put his wooden buck down, and, hanging
his saw on a nail on the side of the house, came in."Mother," he called, in German, and, then not seeing her, he came
to the door of the front room and looked in.The knotted and weather-beaten
German came forward, and took it with a very questioning expression of
countenance.Brander," said Jennie, all her diffidence
dissolved by sympathy."This is the gentleman from the hotel, papa,
Mr."Oh yes," he said, with a considerable German accent."Since I had the fever I don't hear good.My wife, she spoke to me
of you.""Yes," said the Senator, "I thought I'd come out and make your
acquaintance."Yes," said the father, who was conscious of his very poor garments
and anxious to get away.Gerhardt now came back, and Gerhardt, seeing his chance, said
hurriedly:

"Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll go.I broke my saw, and so I had
to stop work.""Certainly," said Brander, graciously, realizing now why Jennie had
never wanted to explain.He half wished that she were courageous
enough not to conceal anything.Gerhardt," he said, when the mother was stiffly seated,
"I want to tell you that you mustn't look on me as a stranger.Hereafter I want you to keep me informed of how things are going with
you."Yes," she answered, humbly grateful.They talked for a few minutes, and then the Senator rose."Tell your husband," he said, "to come and see me next Monday at my
office in the hotel."I'll not stay any longer now," he added."Don't forget to have him
come."John journeyed to the bedroom.Daniel moved to the kitchen."Oh, he'll come," she returned.Adjusting a glove on one hand, he extended the other to Jennie."Well, I don't know," said her mother, "whether I could spare her
or not.""Well," said the Senator, going toward the door, and giving Mrs.Gerhardt his hand, "good-morning."He nodded and walked out, while a half-dozen neighbors, who had
observed his entrance, peeked from behind curtains and drawn blinds at
the astonishing sight."See what he gave me," said the innocent mother to her daughter the
moment he had closed the door.He had placed it softly in her hand as he
said good-by.CHAPTER V


Having been led by circumstances into an attitude of obligation
toward the Senator, it was not unnatural that Jennie should become
imbued with a most generous spirit of appreciation for everything he
had done and now continued to do.The Senator gave her father a letter
to a local mill owner, who saw that he received something to do.It
was not much, to be sure, a mere job as night-watchman, but it helped,
and old Gerhardt's gratitude was extravagant.Never was there such a
great, such a good man!Mary journeyed to the garden.Once Brander sent her a dress,
and at another time a shawl.Daniel went back to the hallway.All these benefactions were made in a
spirit of mingled charity and self-gratification, but to Mrs.Gerhardt
they glowed with but one motive.As for Jennie, he drew nearer to her in every possible way, so that
at last she came to see him in a light which would require
considerable analysis to make clear.This fresh, young soul, however,
had too much innocence and buoyancy to consider for a moment the
world's point of view.Since that one notable and halcyon visit upon
which he had robbed her her original shyness, and implanted a tender
kiss upon her cheek, they had lived in a different atmosphere.Jennie
was his companion now, and as he more and more unbended, and even
joyously flung aside the habiliments of his dignity, her perception of
him grew clearer.They laughed and chatted in a natural way, and he
keenly enjoyed this new entrance into the radiant world of youthful
happiness.One thing that disturbed him, however, was the occasional thought,
which he could not repress, that he was not doing right.Sandra went back to the kitchen.Other people
must soon discover that he was not confining himself strictly to
conventional relations with this washer-woman's daughter.He suspected
that the housekeeper was not without knowledge that Jennie almost
invariably lingered from a quarter to three-quarters of an hour
whenever she came for or returned his laundry.He knew that it might
come to the ears of the hotel clerks, and so, in a general way, get
about town and work serious injury, but the reflection did not cause
him to modify his conduct.Sometimes he consoled himself with the
thought that he was not doing her any actual harm, and at other times
he would argue that he could not put this one delightful tenderness
out of his life.Did he not wish honestly to do her much good?John travelled to the garden.He thought of these things occasionally, and decided that he could
not stop.The self-approval which such a resolution might bring him
was hardly worth the inevitable pain of the abnegation.He had not so
very many more years to live.One evening he put his arm around her and strained her to his
breast.Another time he drew her to his knee, and told her
