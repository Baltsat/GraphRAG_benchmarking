No doubt the
little god scored a point when Asaph Hall saw Angeline Stickney solemnly
parading in the “bloomer” costume.Good humor was one of the young man’s
characteristics, and no doubt he had a hearty laugh at the young lady’s
expense.Daniel moved to the bedroom.But Dan Cupid contrived to have him pursue a course in geometry
taught by Miss Stickney; and, to make it all the merrier, entangled him
in a plot to down the teacher by asking hard questions.The teacher did
not down, admiration took the place of mischief, and Cupid smiled upon a
pair of happy lovers.Sandra went to the garden.The love-scenes, the tender greetings and affectionate farewells, the
ardent avowals and gracious answers—all these things, so essential to
the modern novel, are known only in heaven.The lovers have lived their
lives and passed away.Some words of endearment are preserved in their
old letters—but these, gentle reader, are none of your business.However, I may state with propriety a few facts in regard to Angeline
Stickney’s courtship and marriage.It was characteristic of her that
before she became engaged to marry she told Asaph Hall all about her
father.He, wise lover, could distinguish between sins of the stomach
and sins of the heart, and risked the hereditary taint pertaining to the
former—and this although she emphasized the danger by breaking down and
becoming a pitiable invalid.Just before her graduation she wrote:

    I believe God sent you to love me just at this time, that I might
    not get discouraged.How very good and beautiful you seemed to me that Saturday night
    that I was sick at Mr.Porter’s, and you still seem just the same.I
    hope I may sometime repay you for all your kindness and love to me.If I have already brightened your hopes and added to your joy I am
    thankful.I hope we may always be a blessing to each other and to
    all around us; and that the great object of our lives may be the
    good that we can do.There are a great many things I wish to say to
    you, but I will not try to write them now.I hope I shall see you
    again soon, and then I can tell you all with my own lips.Do not
    study too hard, Love, and give yourself rest and sleep as much as
    you need.Yours truly,

                A. HALL.C. A. S.

After her graduation, Mr.Hall accompanied her to Rodman, where he
visited her people a week or ten days—a procedure always attended with
danger to Dan Cupid’s plans.Mary moved to the bedroom.In this case, it is said the young
carpenter was charmed with the buxom sister Ruth, who was, in fact, a
much more marriageable woman than Angeline.But he went about to get the
engagement ring, which, in spite of a Puritanical protest against such
adornment, was faithfully worn for twenty years.At last the busy
housewife burned her fingers badly washing lamp-chimneys with carbolic
acid, and her astronomer husband filed asunder the slender band of gold.That the Puritan maiden disdained the feminine display by which less
manly lovers are ensnared is illustrated by the following extract from a
letter to Mr.Hall:

    Last week Wednesday I went to Saratoga.Staid there till the
    afternoon of the next day.Antoinette L. Brown, Lucy Stone Blackwell,
    Ernestine Rose, Samuel J. May, and T. W. Higginson.The streets of Saratoga were thronged with fashionables.I never saw
    before such a display of dress.Poor gilded butterflies, no object
    in life but to make a display of their fine colors.I could not help
    contrasting those ladies of fashion with the earnest, noble, working
    women who stood up there in that Convention, and with words of
    eloquence urged upon their sisters the importance of awaking to
    usefulness.John went to the bathroom.This letter was written in August, 1855, when Angeline Stickney was
visiting friends and relatives in quest of health.In the same letter
she sent directions for Mr.Hall to meet her in Albany on his way to
McGrawville; but for some reason he failed her, although he passed
through the city while she was there.This was a grievous
disappointment, of which she used to speak in after years.But in a few days they were together at McGrawville, where she remained
ten weeks—visiting friends, of course.November 13 she set out for
Wisconsin, hoping to find employment as a teacher near her sister
Charlotte Ingalls.At depots and
hotels, during the journey westward, she thought of the absent lover,
and sent him long messages.John travelled to the kitchen.Thou wert born when the conjunction of the
planets did augur a life of perfect beatitude.As the years roll
away the inhabitants of the city will multiply with great rapidity.John went to the bathroom.Questions of great import regarding the welfare of the people will
often come before thee for adjustment.To be successful In thy calling
thou must never be guilty of having decided convictions on any
subject, as thy friends will sometimes be pitted against each other in
the advocacy of their various schemes.Thou must not antagonize either
side by espousing the other's cause, but must always keep the rod and
the gun close by thy side, so that when these emergencies arise and
thou doth scent danger in the air thou canst quietly withdraw from the
scene of action and chase the festive bison over the distant prairies
or revel in piscatorial pleasure on the placid waters of a secluded
lake until the working majority hath discovered some method of
relieving thee of the necessity of committing thyself, and then, O
Robert.thou canst return and complacently inform the disappointed
party that the result would have been far different had not thou been
called suddenly away.Thou canst thus preserve the friendship of all
parties, and their votes are more essential to thee than the mere
adoption of measures affecting the prosperity of thy people.When the
requirements of the people of thy city become too great for thee alone
to administer to all their wants, the great family of Okons, the
lineal descendants of the sea kings from the bogs of Tipperary, will
come to thy aid.Take friendly counsel with them, as to incur their
displeasure will mean thy downfall.Let all the ends thou aimest at be
to so dispose of the offices within thy gift that the Okons, and the
followers of the Okons, will be as fixed in their positions as are the
stars in their orbits."After delivering this strange astrological exhortation the dusky
maiden slowly retreated toward the entrance of a nearby cavern, the
paleface meandered forth to survey the ground of his future greatness
and the voyageur resumed his lonely journey toward the setting sun.*       *       *       *       *

frigid North returned
