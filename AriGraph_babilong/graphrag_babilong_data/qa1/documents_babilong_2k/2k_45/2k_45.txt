During his first year as a journeyman he earned twenty-two
dollars a month and board; and as he was still under age he gave one
hundred dollars of his savings to his mother.Her house was always home
to him; and when cold weather put a stop to carpentry, he returned
thither to help tend cattle or to hunt gray squirrels.For the young
carpenter was fond of hunting.One winter he studied geometry and algebra with a Mr.Sandra travelled to the hallway.Rice, principal of
the Norfolk Academy.But he found he was a better mathematician than his
teacher.Indeed, he had hardly begun his studies at McGrawville when he
distinguished himself by solving a problem which up to that time had
baffled students and teachers alike.Mary moved to the office.Massachusetts educators would have us believe that a young man of
twenty-five should have spent nine years in primary and grammar schools,
four years more in a high school, four years more at college, and three
years more in some professional school.Supposing the victim to have
begun his career in a kindergarten at the age of three, and to have
pursued a two-years’ course there, at twenty-five his education would be
completed.He would have finished his education, provided his education
had not finished him.Now at the age of twenty-four or twenty-five Asaph Hall 3rd only began
serious study.He brought to his tasks the vigor of an unspoiled youth,
spent in the open air.He worked as only a man of mature strength can
work, and he comprehended as only a man of keen, undulled intellect can
comprehend.His ability as a scholar called forth the admiration of
fellow-students and the encouragement of teachers.The astronomer
Brünnow, buried in the wilds of Michigan, far from his beloved Germany,
recognized in this American youth a worthy disciple, and Dr.Benjamin
Apthorp Gould, father of American astronomy, promptly adopted Asaph Hall
into his scientific family.If our young American’s experience puts conventional theories of
education to the blush, much more does his manhood reflect upon the
theory that unites intellectuality with personal impurity.The historian
Lecky throws a glamor over the loathesomeness of what is politely known
as the social evil, and calls the prostitute a modern priestess.And it
is well known that German university students of these degenerate days
consider continence an absurdity.Asaph Hall was as pure as Sir
Gallahad, who sang:

                My good blade carves the casques of men,
                My tough lance thrusteth sure,
                My strength is as the strength of ten,
                Because my heart is pure.Let it be conceded that this untutored American youth had had an
excellent course in manual training—anticipating the modern fad in
education by half a century.However, he had never belonged to an Arts
and Crafts Movement, and had never made dinky little what-nots or other
useless and fancy articles.He had spent eight years at carpenter work;
three years as an apprentice and five years as a journeyman, and he was
a skilful and conscientious workman.He handled his tools as only
carpenters of his day and generation were used to handle them, making
doors, blinds, and window-sashes, as well as hewing timbers for the
frames of houses.Monuments of his handiwork, in the shape of well-built
houses, are to be seen in Connecticut and Massachusetts to this day.Like other young men of ability, he was becomingly modest, and his boss,
old Peter Bogart, used to say with a twinkle in his eye, that of all the
men in his employ, Asaph Hall was the only one who didn’t know more than
Peter Bogart.And yet it was Asaph Hall who showed his fellow carpenters how to
construct the roof of a house scientifically.“Cut and try” was their
rule; and if the end of a joist was spoilt by too frequent application
of the rule, they took another joist.But the young carpenter knew the
thing could be done right the first time; and so, without the aid of
text-book or instructor, he worked the problem out, by the principles of
projection.John went back to the kitchen.The timbers sawed according to his directions fitted
perfectly, and his companions marveled.To himself the incident meant much, for he had proved himself more than
a carpenter.His ambition was aroused, and he resolved to become an
architect.But a kindly Providence led him on to a still nobler calling.John went to the office.In 1854 he set out for McGrawville thinking that by the system of manual
labor there advertised he could earn his way as he studied.When the
stage rolled into town, whom should he see but Angeline Stickney,
dressed in her “bloomer” costume!------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              CHAPTER IX.––––––
                        COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE.President Eliot of Harvard University is quoted as saying that marriage
ought to unite two persons of the same religious faith: otherwise it is
likely to prove unhappy.President Eliot has said many wise things, but
this is not one of them—unless he is shrewdly seeking to produce
bachelors and spinsters to upbuild his university.One of Angeline
Stickney’s girl friends had a suitor of the Universalist denomination,
and a very fine man he was; but the girl and her mother belonged to the
Baptist denomination, which was the denomination of another suitor, whom
she married for denominational reasons.Abbreviating the word, her
experience proves the following principle: If a young woman belonging to
the Baptist demnition rejects an eligible suitor because he belongs to
the Universalist demnition, she is likely to go to the demnition
bow-wows.For religious tolerance even in matrimony there is the best of reasons:
We are Protestants before we are Baptists or Universalists, Christians
before we are Catholics or Protestants, moralists before we are Jews or
Christians, theists before we are Mohammedans or Jews, and human before
every thing else.Angeline Stickney, like her girl friend, was a sincere Baptist.Had
joined the church at the age of sixteen.One of her classmates, a person
of deeply religious feeling like herself, was a suitor for her hand.But
she married Asaph Hall, who was outside the pale of any religious sect,
disbelieved in woman-suffrage, wasted little sympathy on <DW64>s, and
played cards!And her marriage was infinitely more fortunate than her
friend’s.To be sure she labored to convert her splendid Pagan, and
partially succeeded; but in the end he converted her, till the Unitarian
church itself was too narrow for her.Cupid’s ways are strange, and sometimes whimsical.There was once a
young man who made fun of a red-haired woman and used to say to his
companions, “Get
