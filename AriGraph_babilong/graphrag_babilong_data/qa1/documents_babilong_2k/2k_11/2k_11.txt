"She's working in a family," returned his wife in a pleading tone.Gerhardt had received a light since he had been away.Certain
inexplicable thoughts and feelings had come to him in his religious
meditations.In his prayers he had admitted to the All-seeing that he
might have done differently by his daughter.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Yet he could not make up
his mind how to treat her for the future.She had committed a great
sin; it was impossible to get away from that.When Jennie came home that night a meeting was unavoidable.Gerhardt saw her coming, and pretended to be deeply engaged in a
newspaper.Gerhardt, who had begged him not to ignore Jennie
entirely, trembled for fear he would say or do something which would
hurt her feelings."She is coming now," she said, crossing to the door of the front
room, where he was sitting; but Gerhardt refused to look up.Mary journeyed to the office."Speak to
her, anyhow," was her last appeal before the door opened; but he made
no reply.When Jennie came in her mother whispered, "He is in the front
room."Jennie paled, put her thumb to her lip and stood irresolute, not
knowing how to meet the situation.Jennie paused as she realized from her mother's face and nod that
Gerhardt knew of the child's existence.Jennie finally went to the door, and, seeing her father, his brow
wrinkled as if in serious but not unkindly thought, she hesitated, but
made her way forward."Papa," she said, unable to formulate a definite sentence.Gerhardt looked up, his grayish-brown eyes a study under their
heavy sandy lashes.John journeyed to the garden.At the sight of his daughter he weakened
internally; but with the self-adjusted armor of resolve about him he
showed no sign of pleasure at seeing her.All the forces of his
conventional understanding of morality and his naturally sympathetic
and fatherly disposition were battling within him, but, as in so many
cases where the average mind is concerned, convention was temporarily
the victor."Won't you forgive me, Papa?"John went to the bedroom.She hesitated a moment, and then stepped forward, for what purpose
he well understood."There," he said, pushing her gently away, as her lips barely
touched his grizzled cheek.Daniel went back to the hallway.When Jennie went out into the kitchen after this very trying ordeal
she lifted her eyes to her waiting mother and tried to make it seem as
though all had been well, but her emotional disposition got the better
of her.her mother was about to ask; but the words
were only half out of her mouth before her daughter sank down into one
of the chairs close to the kitchen table and, laying her head on her
arm, burst forth into soft, convulsive, inaudible sobs.It was some time before Jennie recovered herself sufficiently to
answer.John travelled to the office."I wouldn't feel bad," she said.CHAPTER XV


The return of Gerhardt brought forward the child question in all
its bearings.He could not help considering it from the standpoint of
a grandparent, particularly since it was a human being possessed of a
soul."No, not yet," said his wife, who had not forgotten this duty, but
had been uncertain whether the little one would be welcome in the
faith."No, of course not," sneered Gerhardt, whose opinion of his wife's
religious devotion was not any too great.He thought it over a few moments, and felt that this evil should be
corrected at once."Why don't she take it and have
it baptized?"Gerhardt reminded him that some one would have to stand
godfather to the child, and there was no way to have the ceremony
performed without confessing the fact that it was without a legitimate
father.Gerhardt listened to this, and it quieted him for a few moments,
but his religion was something which he could not see put in the
background by any such difficulty.How would the Lord look upon
quibbling like this?It was not Christian, and it was his duty to
attend to the matter.It must be taken, forthwith, to the church,
Jennie, himself, and his wife accompanying it as sponsors; or, if he
did not choose to condescend thus far to his daughter, he must see
that it was baptized when she was not present.He brooded over this
difficulty, and finally decided that the ceremony should take place on
one of these week-days between Christmas and New Year's, when Jennie
would be at her work.This proposal he broached to his wife, and,
receiving her approval, he made his next announcement."It has no
name," he said.Jennie and her mother had talked over this very matter, and Jennie
had expressed a preference for Vesta.Now her mother made bold to
suggest it as her own choice.Daniel travelled to the office.Secretly he had settled the
question in his own mind.Not one of those admirable riders, sculptured so masterly on the frieze
of the Parthenon, sits his horse more gracefully and proudly than this
young Indian, whose fine face, illumined by the setting sun, is radiant
with serene happiness; his eyes sparkle with joy, and his dilated
nostrils and unclosed lips inhale with delight the balmy breeze, that
brings to him the perfume of flowers and the scent of fresh leaves, for
the trees are still moist from the abundant rain that fell after the
storm.A red cap, similar to that worn by the Greeks, surmounting the black
locks of Djalma, sets off to advantage the golden tint of his complexion;
his throat is bare; he is clad in his robe of white muslin with large
sleeves, confined at the waist by a scarlet sash; very full drawers, in
white cotton stuff, leave half uncovered his tawny and polished legs;
their classic curve stands out from the dark sides of the horse, which he
presses tightly between his muscular calves.He has no stirrups; his
foot, small and narrow, is shod with a sandal of morocco leather.The rush of his thoughts, by turns impetuous and restrained, was
expressed in some degree by the pace he imparted to his horse--now bold
and precipitate, like the flight of unbridled imagination--now calm and
measured, like the reflection which succeeds an idle dream.But, in all
this fantastic course, his least movements were distinguished by a proud,
independent and somewhat savage grace.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.Dispossessed of his paternal territory by the English, and at first
detained by them as a state-prisoner after the death of his father--who
(as M. Joshua Van Dael had written to M. Rodin) had fallen sword in
hand--Djalma had at length been restored to liberty.Abandoning the
continent of India, and still accompanied by General Simon, who had
lingered hard by the prison of his old friend's son, the young Indian
came next to Batavia, the birthplace of his mother, to collect the modest
inheritance of his maternal ancestors.And amongst this property, so long
despised or forgotten by his father, he found some important papers, and
a medal exactly similar to that worn by Rose and Blanche.General Simon was not more surprised than pleased at this discovery,
which not only established a tie of kindred between his wife and Djalma's
mother, but which also seemed to promise great advantages for the future.Leaving Dj
