Mary moved to the bathroom.Third Song, written during Fever

   To-night the clouds hang very low,
       They take the Hill-tops to their breast,
       And lay their arms about the fields.The wind that fans me lying low,
       Restless with great desire for rest,
       No cooling touch of freshness yields.I, sleepless through the stifling heat,
       Watch the pale Lightning's constant glow
       Between the wide set open doors.I lie and long amidst the heat,--
       The fever that my senses know,
       For that cool slenderness of yours.A roseleaf that has lain in snow,
       A snowflake tinged with sunset fire.You do not know, so young you are,
       How Fever fans the senses' glow
       To uncontrollable desire!And fills the spaces of the night
       With furious and frantic thought,
       One would not dare to think by day.Ah, if you came to me to-night
       These visions would be turned to naught,
       These hateful dreams be held at bay!Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.But you are far, and Loneliness
       My only lover through the night;
       And not for any word or prayer
   Would you console my loneliness
       Or lend yourself, serene and slight,
       And the cool clusters of your hair.All through the night I long for you,
       As shipwrecked men in tropics yearn
       For the fresh flow of streams and springs.My fevered fancies follow you
       As dying men in deserts turn
       Their thoughts to clear and chilly things.Such dreams are mine, and such my thirst,
       Unceasing and unsatisfied,
       Until the night is burnt away
   Among these dreams and fevered thirst,
       And, through the open doorways, glide
       The white feet of the coming day.The Regret of the Ranee in the Hall of Peacocks

   This man has taken my Husband's life
     And laid my Brethren low,
   No sister indeed, were I, no wife,
     To pardon and let him go.Yet why does he look so young and slim
     As he weak and wounded lies?How hard for me to be harsh to him
     With his soft, appealing eyes.His hair is ruffled upon the stone
     And the slender wrists are bound,
   So young!and yet he has overthrown
     His scores on the battle ground.Would I were only a slave to-day,
     To whom it were right and meet
   To wash the stains of the War away,
     The dust from the weary feet.Were I but one of my serving girls
     To solace his pain to rest!Shake out the sand from the soft loose curls,
     And hold him against my breast!Would God that I were the senseless stone
     To support his slender length!I hate those wounds that trouble my sight,
     Unknown!how I wish you lay,
   Alone in my silken tent to-night
     While I charmed the pain away.I would lay you down on the Royal bed,
     I would bathe your wounds with wine,
   And setting your feet against my head
     Dream you were lover of mine.My Crown is heavy upon my hair,
     The Jewels weigh on my breast,
   All I would leave, with delight, to share
     Your pale and passionate rest!But hands grow restless about their swords,
     Lips murmur below their breath,
   "The Queen is silent too long!""My Lords,
     --Take him away to death!"Protest: By Zahir-u-Din

   Alas!this wasted Night
   With all its Jasmin-scented air,
   Its thousand stars, serenely bright!John went back to the hallway.I lie alone, and long for you,
   Long for your Champa-scented hair,
   Your tranquil eyes of twilight hue;

   Long for the close-curved, delicate lips
   --Their sinuous sweetness laid on mine--
   Here, where the slender fountain drips,
   Here, where the yellow roses glow,
   Pale in the tender silver shine
   The stars across the garden throw.The poets hardly speak the truth,--
   Despite their praiseful litany,
   His season is not all delights
   Nor every night an ecstasy!The very power and passion that make--
   _Might_ make--his days one golden dream,
   How he must suffer for their sake!Till, in their fierce and futile rage,
   The baffled senses almost deem
   They might be happier in old age.Age that can find red roses sweet,
   And yet not crave a rose-red mouth;
   Hear Bulbuls, with no wish that feet
   Of sweeter singers went his way;
   Inhale warm breezes from the South,
   Yet never fed his fancy stray.Sandra journeyed to the garden.Daniel journeyed to the garden.From some near Village I can hear
   The cadenced throbbing of a drum,
   Now softly distant, now more near;
   And in an almost human fashion,
   It, plaintive, wistful, seems to come
   Laden with sighs of fitful passion,

   To mock me, lying here alone
   Among the thousand useless flowers
   Upon the fountain's border-stone--
   Cold stone, that chills me as I lie
   Counting the slowly passing hours
   By the white spangles in the sky.Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.Sandra travelled to the hallway.Some feast the Tom-toms celebrate,
   Where, close together, side by side,
   Gay in their gauze and tinsel state
   With lips serene and downcast eyes,
   Sit the young bridegroom and his bride,
   While round them songs and laughter rise.Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.They are together; Why are we
   So hopelessly, so far apart?Oh, I implore you, come to me!Come to me, Solace of mine eyes!A little, languid, mocking breeze
   That rustles through the Jasmin flowers
   And stirs among the Tamarind trees;
   A little gurgle of the spray
   That drips, unheard, though silent hours,
   Then breaks in sudden bubbling play.Why, therefore, mock at my repose?Is it my fault I am alone
   Beneath the feathery Tamarind tree
   Whose shadows over me are thrown?Nay, I am
