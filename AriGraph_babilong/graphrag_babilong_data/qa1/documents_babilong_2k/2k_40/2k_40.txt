From the sustained and
immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne's
dictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been
seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her
memory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Sandra moved to the kitchen.Hebe moved towards the
door of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to
execute the order of her mistress as to the letter.John travelled to the kitchen.But Florine
precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her
leaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:

"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go
to the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,
seal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the
letter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky
yesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and
he appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.Sandra journeyed to the office.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the
little reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected
her, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep
blue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with
interlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her
nymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,
fastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a
necklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair
countenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral
tresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him
believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been
obliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse
though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell
over upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his
well polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a
cap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,
embroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young
blacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful
folds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and
became him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have
done.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a
magnificent silver vase, admirably graven.Daniel travelled to the garden.John moved to the hallway.A small tablet, of the same
metal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased
by JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only
separated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not
perceived the young lady's entrance.He started, and turned quickly
round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a
beautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de
Cardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an
artist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the
title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order
of a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at
my eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after
having made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I
ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the
goldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of
the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
more graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a
little more at ease, answered:

"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such
a proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but
felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple
silk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of
the same materials.Daniel went back to the bedroom.Seeing Agricola's hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with
embarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to
him gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,
will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,
sir.Sandra went back to the office.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what
good presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure
of being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in
the employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you
offered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of
you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.Daniel travelled to the hallway.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the
greatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at
ease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if
you knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to
me, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.In spite
of my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is
that is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,
who in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to
bring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had
picked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the
