Part of it came from New York and part
from Williamstown, Mass., where Henry goes to college.Ann Eliza is
going down street with us this afternoon to buy us some new summer
bonnets.They are to be trimmed with blue and white and are to come to
five dollars.Stannard's store also, to buy us some
stockings.I ought to buy me a new thimble and scissors for I carried my
sewing to school to-day and they were inside of it very carelessly and
dropped out and got lost.I ought to buy them with my own money, but I
haven't got any, for I gave all I had (two shillings) to Anna to buy
Louisa Field a cornelian ring.Perhaps Father will send me some money
soon, but I hate to ask him for fear he will rob himself.I don't like
to tell Grandfather how very careless I was, though I know he would say,
"Accidents will happen."_Thursday._--I was up early this morning because a dressmaker, Miss
Willson, is coming to make me a new calico dress.It is white with pink
spots in it and Grandfather bought it in New York.It is very nice
indeed and I think Grandfather was very kind to get it for me.I had to
stay at home from school to be fitted.I helped sew and run my dress
skirt around the bottom and whipped it on the top.I went to school in
the afternoon, but did not have my lessons very well.Miss Clark excused
me because I was not there in the morning.Some girls got up on our
fence to-day and walked clear across it, the whole length.It is iron
and very high and has a stone foundation.Grandmother asked them to get
down, but I think they thought it was more fun to walk up there than it
was on the ground.The name of the little girl that got up first was
Mary Lapham.She is Lottie Lapham's cousin.I made the pocket for my
dress after I got home from school and then Grandfather said he would
take us out to ride, so he took us way up to Thaddeus Chapin's on the
hill.Julia Phelps was there, playing with Laura Chapin, for she is her
cousin.Henry and Ann Eliza Field came over to call this evening.Henry
has come home from Williams College on his vacation and he is a very
pleasant young man, indeed.I am reading a continued story in _Harper's
Magazine_.It is called Little Dorritt, by Charles Dickens, and is very
interesting._Friday, May._--Miss Clark told us we could have a picnic down to Sucker
Brook this afternoon and she told us to bring our rubbers and lunches by
two o'clock; but Grandmother was not willing to let us go; not that she
wished to deprive us of any pleasure for she said instead we could wear
our new black silk basks and go with her to Preparatory lecture, so we
did, but when we got there we found that Mr.Daggett was out of town so
there was no meeting.Then she told us we could keep dressed up and go
over to Aunt Mary Carr's and take her some apples, and afterwards
Grandfather took us to ride to see old Mrs.He is ninety years old and blind and deaf, so we had quite a
good time after all.Dickey, of Rochester, agent for the Seaman's Friend Society,
preached this morning about the poor little canal boy.His text was from
the 107th Psalm, 23rd verse, "They that go down into the sea in ships."He has the queerest voice and stops off between his words.When we got
home Anna said she would show us how he preached and she described what
he said about a sailor in time of war.She said, "A ball came--and
struck him there--another ball came--and struck him there--he raised his
faithful sword--and went on--to victory--or death."I expected
Grandfather would reprove her, but he just smiled a queer sort of smile
and Grandmother put her handkerchief up to her face, as she always does
when she is amused about anything.I never heard her laugh out loud, but
I suppose she likes funny things as well as anybody.She did just the
same, this morning, when Grandfather asked Anna where the sun rose, and
she said "over by Gen.Granger's house and sets behind the Methodist
church."She said she saw it herself and should never forget it when any
one asked her which was east or west.I think she makes up more things
than any one I know of.M. L. R. P. Thompson preached to-day.He used to be the
minister of our church before Mr."Alphabet" Thompson, because he has so many letters in his name.He
preached a very good sermon from the text, "Dearly beloved, as much as
lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."I like to hear him preach,
but not as well as I do Mr._Thursday._--Edward Everett, of Boston, lectured in our church this
evening.They had a platform built even with the tops of the pews, so he
did not have to go up into the pulpit.Crowds and crowds came to hear
him from all over everywhere.They say he is the
most eloquent speaker in the U. S., but I have heard Mr.Daggett when I
thought he was just as good._Sunday._--We went to church to-day and heard Rev.His
text was, "The poor ye have with you always and whensoever ye will ye
may do them good."I never knew any one who liked to go to church as
much as Grandmother does.She says she "would rather be a doorkeeper in
the house of our God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness."They
don't have women doorkeepers, and I know she would not dwell a minute in
a tent.Coburn is the doorkeeper in our church and he rings the bell
every day at nine in the morning and at twelve and at nine in the
evening, so Grandfather knows when it is time to cover up the fire in
the fireplace and go to bed.I think if the President should come to
call he would have to go home at nine o'clock.Grandfather's motto is:

    "Early to bed and early to rise
    Makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise."Greig and Miss Chapin called to see us to-day.Grandmother says that we can return the calls as she does not visit any
more.We would like to, for we always enjoy dressing up and making
calls.Anna and I received two black veils in a letter to-day from Aunt
Caroline Dey.Just exactly what we had wanted for a long while.Uncle
Edward sent us five dollars and Grandmother said we could buy just what
we wanted, so we went down street to look at black silk mantillas.We
went to Moore's store and to Richardson's and to Collier's, but they
asked ten, fifteen or twenty dollars for them, so Anna said she resolved
from now, henceforth and forever not to spend her money for black silk
mantillas.Tousley preached to-day to the children and told us
how many steps it took to be bad.I think he said lying was first, then
disobedience to parents, breaking the Sabbath, swearing, stealing,
drunkenness.John moved to the kitchen.I don't remember just the order they came.It wasDaniel went back to the bedroom.
