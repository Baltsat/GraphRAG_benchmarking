Here, louder,
but confused with a gentle scuffing of feet, sounded the voices of the
rival lodge.Toward these he crawled, stopping at every creak of the tiles.Once a
broken roll snapped off, and slid rattling down the roof.He sat up,
every muscle ready for the sudden leap and shove that would send him
sliding after it into the lower darkness.It fell but a short distance,
into something soft.Daniel went back to the kitchen.Gradually he relaxed, but lay very still.John journeyed to the bathroom.Nothing
followed; no one had heard.He tried again, crawled forward his own length, and brought up snug and
safe in the angle where roof met wall.The voices and shuffling feet
were dangerously close.He sat up, caught a shaft of light full in his
face, and peered in through the ragged chink.Two legs in bright,
wrinkled hose, and a pair of black shoes with thick white soles, blocked
the view.For a long time they shifted, uneasy and tantalizing.He could
hear only a hubbub of talk,--random phrases without meaning.Daniel went to the hallway.The legs
moved away, and left a clear space.But at the same instant, a grating noise startled him, directly
overhead, out of doors.The thin right angle of light spread instantly
into a brilliant square.With a bang, a wooden shutter slid open.Heywood lay back swiftly, just as a long, fat bamboo pipe, two sleeves,
and the head of a man in a red silk cap were thrust out into the
night air."_ sighed the man, and puffed at his bamboo.Heywood tried to blot himself against the wall.The lounger, propped on
elbows, finished his smoke, spat upon the tiles, and remained, a pensive
silhouette."_ he sighed again; then knocking out the bamboo, drew in his
head.Not until the shutter slammed, did Heywood shake the burning
sparks from his wrist.In the same movement, however, he raised head and shoulders to spy
through the chink.This time the bright-hosed legs were gone.He saw
clear down a brilliant lane of robes and banners, multicolored, and
shining with embroidery and tinsel,--a lane between two ranks of crowded
men, who, splendid with green and blue and yellow robes of ceremony,
faced each other in a strong lamplight, that glistened on their oily
cheeks.Under the crowded rows of shaven
foreheads, their eyes blinked, deep-set and expectant.At the far end of
the loft, through two circular arches or giant hoops of rattan, Heywood
at last descried a third arch, of swords; beyond this, a tall incense
jar smouldering gray wisps of smoke, beside a transverse table twinkling
with candles like an altar; and over these, a black image with a pale,
carved face, seated bolt upright before a lofty, intricate, gilded
shrine of the Patriot War-God.A tall man in dove-gray silk with a high scarlet turban moved athwart
the altar, chanting as he solemnly lifted one by one a row of symbols: a
round wooden measure, heaped with something white, like rice, in which
stuck a gay cluster of paper flags; a brown, polished abacus; a mace
carved with a dragon, another carved with a phoenix; a rainbow robe,
gleaming with the plumage of Siamese kingfishers.All these, and more,
he displayed aloft and replaced among the candles.When his chant ended, a brisk little man in yellow stepped forward into
the lane."O Fragrant Ones," he shrilled, "I bring ten thousand recruits, to join
our army and swear brotherhood.Behind him, a squad of some dozen barefoot wretches, in coolie clothes,
with queues un-plaited, crawled on all fours through the first arch.They crouched abject, while the tall Master of Incense in the dove-gray
silk sternly examined their sponsor.Sandra journeyed to the office.In the outer darkness, Heywood craned and listened till neck and
shoulders ached.He could make nothing of the florid verbiage.With endless ritual, the crawling novices reached the arch of swords.They knelt, each holding above his head a lighted bundle of
incense-sticks,--red sparks that quivered like angry fireflies.Above
them the tall Master of Incense thundered:--

"O Spirits of the Hills and Brooks, the Land, the swollen seeds of the
ground, and all the Veins of Earth; O Thou, young Bearer of the Axe that
cleared the Hills; O Imperial Heaven, and ye, Five Dragons of the Five
Regions, with all the Holy Influences who pass and instantly re-pass
through unutterable space:--draw near, record our oath, accept the
draught of blood."He raised at arm's length a heavy baton, which, with a flowing movement,
unrolled to the floor a bright yellow scroll thickly inscribed.From
this he read, slowly, an interminable catalogue of oaths.Heywood could
catch only the scolding sing-song of the responses:--

"If any brother shall break this, let him die beneath ten thousand
knives.""--Who violates this, shall be hurled down into the great sky.""--Let thunder from the Five Regions annihilate him."Silence followed, broken suddenly by the frenzied squawking of a fowl,
as suddenly cut short.Near the chink, Heywood heard a quick struggling
and beating.Daniel went back to the office.The shutter grated open, a flood of light poured out.Within reach, in that radiance, a pair of sinewy yellow hands gripped
the neck of a white cock.The wretched bird squawked once more, feebly,
flapped its wings, and clawed the air, just as a second pair of arms
reached out and sliced with a knife.The cock's head flew off upon the
tiles.Hot blood spattered on Heywood's cheek.Half blinded, but not
daring to move, he saw the knife withdrawn, and a huge goblet held out
to catch the flow.Then arms, goblet, and convulsive wings jerked out of
sight, and the shutter slid home."Twice they've not seen me," thought Heywood.It was darker, here, than
he had hoped.He rose more boldly to the peep-hole.Under the arch of swords, the new recruits, now standing upright,
stretched one by one their wrists over the goblet.The Incense Master
pricked each yellow arm, to mingle human blood with the blood of the
white cock; then, from a brazen vessel, filled the goblet to the brim.It passed from hand to hand, like a loving-cup.Each novice raised it,
chanted some formula, and drank.Suddenly, in the pale face of the black image seated before the shrine,
the eyes turned, scanning the company with a cold contempt.The voice, level and ironic, was that of Fang, the Sword-Pen:--

"O Fragrant Ones, when shall the foreign monsters perish like this
cock?"A man in black, with a red wand, bowed and answered harshly:--

"The time, Great Elder Brother, draws at hand.""The hour," replied the Red Wand, "shall be when the Black Dog barks."Sandra went to the hallway.Heywood pressed his ear against the chink, and listened, his five senses
