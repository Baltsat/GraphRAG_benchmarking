John travelled to the kitchen.Back to the office all the afternoon, and that done home for
all night.Mary journeyed to the bathroom.Having the beginning of this week made a vow to myself to
drink no wine this week (finding it to unfit me to look after business),
and this day breaking of it against my will, I am much troubled for it,
but I hope God will forgive me.Montagu's chamber I heard a Frenchman
play, a friend of Monsieur Eschar's, upon the guitar, most extreme well,
though at the best methinks it is but a bawble.From thence to
Westminster Hall, where it was expected that the Parliament was to have
been adjourned for two or three months, but something hinders it for a day
or two.George Montagu, and advised about a
ship to carry my Lord Hinchingbroke and the rest of the young gentlemen to
France, and they have resolved of going in a hired vessell from Rye, and
not in a man of war.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.He told me in discourse that my Lord Chancellor is
much envied, and that many great men, such as the Duke of Buckingham and
my Lord of Bristoll, do endeavour to undermine him, and that he believes
it will not be done; for that the King (though he loves him not in the way
of a companion, as he do these young gallants that can answer him in his
pleasures), yet cannot be without him, for his policy and service.From
thence to the Wardrobe, where my wife met me, it being my Lord of
Sandwich's birthday, and so we had many friends here, Mr.Townsend and his
wife, and Captain Ferrers lady and Captain Isham, and were very merry, and
had a good venison pasty.Pargiter, the merchant, was with us also.Townsend was called upon by Captain Cooke: so we three
went to a tavern hard by, and there he did give us a song or two; and
without doubt he hath the best manner of singing in the world.Mary moved to the kitchen.Back to my
wife, and with my Lady Jem.John went back to the office.and Pall by water through bridge, and showed
them the ships with great pleasure, and then took them to my house to show
it them (my Lady their mother having been lately all alone to see it and
my wife, in my absence in the country), and we treated them well, and were
very merry.Then back again through bridge, and set them safe at home,
and so my wife and I by coach home again, and after writing a letter to my
father at Brampton, who, poor man, is there all alone, and I have not
heard from him since my coming from him, which troubles me.This morning as my wife and I were going to church,
comes Mrs.Ramsay to see us, so we sent her to church, and we went too,
and came back to dinner, and she dined with us and was wellcome.To
church again in the afternoon, and then come home with us Sir W. Pen, and
drank with us, and then went away, and my wife after him to see his
daughter that is lately come out of Ireland.I staid at home at my book;
she came back again and tells me that whereas I expected she should have
been a great beauty, she is a very plain girl.John moved to the bathroom.This evening my wife gives
me all my linen, which I have put up, and intend to keep it now in my own
custody.This morning we began again to sit in the mornings at the office,
but before we sat down.Sir R. Slingsby and I went to Sir R. Ford's to
see his house, and we find it will be very convenient for us to have it
added to the office if he can be got to part with it.Then we sat down
and did business in the office.So home to dinner, and my brother Tom
dined with me, and after dinner he and I alone in my chamber had a great
deal of talk, and I find that unless my father can forbear to make profit
of his house in London and leave it to Tom, he has no mind to set up the
trade any where else, and so I know not what to do with him.After this I
went with him to my mother, and there told her how things do fall out
short of our expectations, which I did (though it be true) to make her
leave off her spending, which I find she is nowadays very free in,
building upon what is left to us by my uncle to bear her out in it, which
troubles me much.While I was here word is brought that my aunt Fenner is
exceeding ill, and that my mother is sent for presently to come to her:
also that my cozen Charles Glassecocke, though very ill himself, is this
day gone to the country to his brother, John Glassecocke, who is a-dying
there.After my singing-master had done with me this morning, I went to
White Hall and Westminster Hall, where I found the King expected to come
and adjourn the Parliament.I found the two Houses at a great difference,
about the Lords challenging their privileges not to have their houses
searched, which makes them deny to pass the House of Commons' Bill for
searching for pamphlets and seditious books.Thence by water to the
Wardrobe (meeting the King upon the water going in his barge to adjourn
the House) where I dined with my Lady, and there met Dr.Thomas Pepys, who
I found to be a silly talking fellow, but very good-natured.So home to
the office, where we met about the business of Tangier this afternoon.Moore, and he and I walked into the City
and there parted.To Fleet Street to find when the Assizes begin at
Cambridge and Huntingdon, in order to my going to meet with Roger Pepys
for counsel.Salisbury, who is now
grown in less than two years' time so great a limner--that he is become
excellent, and gets a great deal of money at it.I took him to Hercules
Pillars to drink, and there came Mr.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.Sandra went back to the garden.Whore (whom I formerly have known), a
friend of his to him, who is a very ingenious fellow, and there I sat with
them a good while, and so home and wrote letters late to my Lord and to my
father, and then to bed.Singing-master came to me this morning; then to the office all the
morning.And the way they do it just gets me!I'll tell ye
somethin' that happened, that's gospel truth!Some of the boys that
reckoned to hev some fun with the Chinee gang over at Cedar Camp started
out one afternoon to raid 'em.They groped along through the woods whar
nobody could see 'em, kalkilatin' to come down with a rush on the camp,
over two miles away.And nobody DID see 'em, only ONE Chinaman wot they
met a mile from the camp, burnin' punk to his joss or devil, and he
scooted away just in the contrary direction.Well, sir, when they
waltzed into that camp, darn my skin!ef there was a Chinaman there, or
as much as a grain of rice to grab!Mary went to the hallway.Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.this
sort o' got the boys, and they set about discoverin' how it was done.One of 'em noticed that there was
