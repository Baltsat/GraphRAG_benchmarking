"Don't'sah' me, you measly old fraud!"John travelled to the garden.howled Scotch, waving his fists
in the air."I don't believe in fighting, but this is about my time to
scrap.If you don't apologize for the intrusion, may I be blown to ten
thousand fragments if I don't give you a pair of beautiful black eyes!""Sah, there seems to be some mistake, sah," fluttered Colonel Vallier,
turning pale.thundered Scotch, leaping to his feet like a
jumping jack."Get up here, and let me knock you down!""I decline to be struck, sah."howled the excited little man, growing still
worse, as the colonel seemed to shrink and falter."Why, I can lick you
in a fraction of no time!Sandra went to the office.You've been making lots of fighting talk, and
now it's my turn.Mary travelled to the garden."I
am no prize-fightah, gentlemen.""That isn't my lookout," said the professor, who was forcing things
while they ran his way."Yes, with pistols, if you want to!"cried the professor, to the
amazement of the boys.We will settle it with pistols,
at once, in this room.""But this is no place foh a duel, sah; yo' should know that, sah.""The one who survives will be arrested, sah.""There won't be a survivor, so you needn't fear arrest."You are such a blamed coward that you won't
fight me with your fists, for fear I will give you the thumping you
deserve; but you know you are a good pistol shot, and you think I am
not, so you hope to shoot me, and escape without harm to yourself.Well,
I am no pistol shot, but I am not going to miss you.We'll shoot across
that center table, and the width of the table is the distance that will
divide us.In that way, I'll stand as good a show as you do, and I'll
agree to shoot you through the body very near to the heart, so you'll
not linger long in agony.he fluttered; "you're shorely crazy!"Daniel journeyed to the garden."But I--I never heard of such a duel--never!""There are many things you have never heard about, Colonel Vallier."Mary travelled to the kitchen."But, sah, I can't fight that way!You'll have to excuse me, sah."howled the little professor, dancing about in his night
robe.Why, I can't----"

"Then I'm going to give you those black eyes just as sure as my name is
Scotch!Hullo, Jedd, how are you?My dear Mardon--are we boys again?[_Boisterously._] Of course we are![_He hits THE DEAN violently in the chest._

THE DEAN.[_Breathing heavily--to himself._] I quite forgot how rough Mardon
used to be.I'm still a bachelor--got terribly jilted by a woman years ago and
have run in blinkers ever since.[_With dignity._] I have been a widower for fifteen years.awfully sorry--can't be helped though, can it?[_Seizing THE
DEAN'S hand and squeezing it._] Forgive me, old chap.[_Withdrawing his hand with pain._] O-o-oh!I've re-opened an old wound--damned stupid of me!What do you think I'm down here for?For the benefit of your health, Mardon?Never had an ache in my life; sha'n't come and hear you preach
next Sunday, Gus.John travelled to the hallway.Hush, my dear Mardon, my girls----

SIR TRISTRAM.May I trot 'em into the paddock to-morrow?You've seen the list of Starters for the Durnstone
Handicap----?Sir Tristram Mardon's Dandy Dick, nine stone two, Tom
Gallawood up![_Digging THE DEAN in the ribs._] Look out for my colors--black and
white, and a pink cap--first past the post to-morrow.Really, my dear Mardon----

SIR TRISTRAM.Jedd, they talk about Bonny Betsy.The tongue of scandal----

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Taking THE DEAN'S arm and walking him about._] Do you imagine, sir,
for one moment, that Bonny Betsy, with a boy on her back, can get down
that bill with those legs of hers?George Tidd knew what she was about when she stuck to
Dandy Dick to the very last.[_Aghast._] George--Tidd?Dandy came out of her stable after she smashed.My dear Mardon, I am of course heartily pleased to revive in this way
our old acquaintance.I wish it were in my power to offer you the
hospitality of the Deanery--but----

SIR TRISTRAM.My horse and I are over the way at "The Swan."Daniel moved to the hallway.Marvells----

SIR TRISTRAM.You mean that the colors you ride
in don't show up well on the hill yonder or in the stable of the
"Swan" Inn.John travelled to the bedroom.You must remember----

SIR TRISTRAM.I remember that in your young days you made the heaviest book on the
Derby of any of our fellows.I always lost, Mardon; indeed, I always lost!I remember that you once matched a mare of your own against another of
Lord Beckslade's for fifty pounds!Yes, but she wasn't in it, Mardon--I mean she was dreadfully beaten.[_Shaking his head sorrowfully._] Oh Jedd, Jedd--other times, other
manners.You're not--you're not offended, Mardon?[_Taking THE DEAN'S hand._] Offended!No--only sorry, Dean, damned
sorry, to see a promising lad come to an end like this.[_GEORGIANA
enters with SALOME on one side of her and SHEBA on the other--all
three laughing and chatting, apparently the best of friends._] By
Jove![_They shake hands warmly._

SIR TRISTRAM.Of all places in the world, to find "Mr.[_Roaring with
laughter._] Ho!Why, Dean, you've been chaffing me, have you?Yes, you have--you've been roasting your old friend!Tidd is a pal of yours, eh?Yes, I've been running a bit dark, Mardon, but that stout,
well-seasoned animal over there and this skittish creature come of the
same stock and were foaled in the same stable.[_Pointing to SALOME
and SHEBA._] There are a couple of yearlings here, you don't know.My
nieces--Salome and Sheba.[_Bowing._] How do you do?John moved to the hallway.[_Heartily taking GEORGIANA'S hand again._]
Well, I don't care whose sister you are, but I'm jolly glad to see
you, George, my boy.Gracious, Tris, don't squeeze my hand so![_In horror._] Salome, Sheba, children![_To himself._] Oh, what shall I do with my widowed
sister?Daniel travelled to the garden.[_He goes into the garden._

SHEBA.[_To SALOME._]
