He advises that in the new
Constitution the principle of arbitration, outside of courts, should
be established.The governor should possess no power of patronage; he
should make one in a Council of Appointments.The Senate is an imitation
of the House of Lords.Daniel journeyed to the kitchen.The Representatives should be divided by lot into
two equal parts, sitting in different chambers.One half, by not
being entangled in the debate of the other on the issue submitted, nor
committed by voting, would become silently possessed of the arguments,
and be in a calm position to review the whole.The votes of the two
houses should be added together, and the majority decide.Judges should
be removable by some constitutional mode, without the formality of
impeachment at "stated periods."(In 1807 Paine wrote to Senator
Mitchell of New York suggesting an amendment to the Constitution of the
United States by which judges of the Supreme Court might be removed by
the President for reasonable cause, though insufficient for impeachment,
on the address of a majority of both Houses of Congress.)In this pamphlet was included the paper already mentioned (on Charters,
etc.The two essays prove that
there was no abatement in Paine's intellect, and that despite occasional
"flings" at the "Feds,"--retorts on their perpetual naggings,--he was
still occupied with the principles of political philosophy.At this time Paine had put the two young Bon-nevilles at a school in
New Rochelle, where they also boarded.He had too much solitude in the
house, and too little nourishment for so much work.So the house was let
and he was taken in as a boarder by Mrs.Bayeaux, in the old Bayeaux
House, which is still standing,*--but Paine's pecuniary situation now
gave him anxiety.He was earning nothing, his means were found to be
far less than he supposed, the needs of the Bonnevilles increasing.Considering the important defensive articles he had written for the
President, and their long friendship, he ventured (September 30th) to
allude to his situation and to remind him that his State, Virginia,
had once proposed to give him a tract of land, but had not done so.He
suggests that Congress should remember his services.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Bayeaux is mentioned in Paine's letter about
     Dederick's attempt on his life."But I wish you to be assured that whatever event this proposal may take
it will make no alteration in my principles or my conduct I have been
a volunteer to the world for thirty years without taking profits from
anything I have published in America or Europe.I have relinquished all
profits that those publications might come cheap among the people for
whom they were intended--Yours in friendship."This was followed by another note (November 14th) asking if it had been
received.What answer came from the President does not appear.About this time Paine published an essay on "The cause of the Yellow
Fever, and the means of preventing it in places not yet infected with
it Addressed to the Board of Health in America."The treatise, which he
dates June 27th, is noticed by Dr.Paine points out
that the epidemic which almost annually afflicted New York, had been
unknown to the Indians; that it began around the wharves, and did not
reach the higher parts of the city.He does not believe the disease
certainly imported from the West Indies, since it is not carried from
New York to other places.He thinks that similar filthy conditions of
the wharves and the water about them generate the miasma alike in the
West Indies and in New York.It would probably be escaped if the wharves
were built on stone or iron arches, permitting the tides to cleanse the
shore and carry away the accumulations of vegetable and animal matter
decaying around every ship and dock.He particularly proposes the use of
arches for wharves about to be constructed at Corlder's Hook and on the
North River.Unless we perceive very clearly that throughout his
ardent speculations on the Papal power his mind was bent upon enforcing
the practical solution of a pressing social problem, we easily
misunderstand him and underrate what he had to say.A charge has been
forcibly urged against him by an eminent English critic, for example,
that he has confounded supremacy with infallibility, than which, as the
writer truly says, no two ideas can be more perfectly distinct, one
being superiority of force, and the other incapacity of error.[14] De
Maistre made logical blunders in abundance quite as bad as this, but he
was too acute, I think, deliberately to erect so elaborate a structure
upon a confusion so very obvious, and that must have stared him in the
face from the first page of his work to the last.If we look upon his
book as a mere general defence of the Papacy, designed to investigate
and fortify all its pretensions one by one, we should have great right
to complain against having two claims so essentially divergent, treated
as though they were the same thing, or could be held in their places by
the same supports.But let us regard the treatise on the Pope not as
meant to convince free-thinkers or Protestants that divine grace
inspires every decree of the Holy Father, though that would have been
the right view of it if it had been written fifty years earlier.It was
composed within the first twenty years of the present century, when the
universe, to men of De Maistre's stamp, seemed once more without form
and void.His object, as he tells us more than once, was to find a way
of restoring a religion and a morality in Europe; of giving to truth the
forces demanded for the conquests that she was meditating; of
strengthening the thrones of sovereigns, and of gently calming that
general fermentation of spirit which threatened mightier evils than any
that had yet overwhelmed society.From this point of view we shall see
that the distinction between supremacy and infallibility was not worth
recognising.Practically, he says, 'infallibility is only a consequence of supremacy,
or rather it is absolutely the same thing under two different names....
In effect it is the same thing, _in practice_, not to be subject to
error, and not to be liable to be accused of it.Thus, even if we should
agree that no divine promise was made to the Pope, he would not be less
infallible or deemed so, as the final tribunal; for every judgment from
which you cannot appeal is and must be (_est et doit etre_) held for
just in every human association, under any imaginable form of
government; and every true statesman will understand me perfectly, when
I say that the point is to ascertain not only if the Sovereign Pontiff
is, but if he must be, infallible.'[15] In another place he says
distinctly enough that the infallibility of the Church has two aspects;
in one of them it is the object of divine promise, in the other it is a
human implication, and that in the latter aspect infallibility is
supposed in the Church, just 'as we are absolutely bound to suppose it,
even in temporal sovereignties (where it does not really exist), under
pain of seeing society dissolved.'The Church only demands what other
sovereignties demand, though she has the immense superiority over them
of having her claim backed by direct promise from heaven.[16] Take away
the dogma, if you will, he says, and only consider the thing
politically, which is exactly what he really does all through the book.The pope, from this point
