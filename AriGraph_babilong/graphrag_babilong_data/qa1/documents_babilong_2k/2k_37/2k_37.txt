When he had finished, Captain Flint stepped up saying that he would
undertake to perform the office, and taking the ring he placed it upon
his own finger.With a firm tread Billings stepped upon the
plank, and the next moment was floundering in the sea.The next thing for the pirates to do was to scuttle the ship, which
they did after helping themselves to so much of the most valuable
portion of the cargo as they thought they could safely carry away with
them.In about an hour afterwards the ship sank, bearing down with her the
bodies of her murdered crew, and burying, as Captain Flint supposed,
in the depths of the ocean all evidences of the fearful tragedy which
had been enacted upon her deck.The captain now directed his course homeward, and the next day the
little vessel was lying in port as if nothing unusual had happened,
Captain Flint pretending that he had returned from one of his usual
trading voyages along the coast.The intercourse between the new and the old world was not so frequent
in those days as now.The voyages, too, were much longer than at
present.So that, although a considerable time passed, bringing no
tidings of the ill-fated vessel without causing any uneasiness.But when week after week rolled by, and month followed month, and
still nothing was heard from her, the friends of those on board began
to be anxious about their fate.At length a vessel which had sailed some days later than the missing
ship, had reported that nothing had been heard from her.The only hope now was that she might have been obliged by stress of
weather to put in to some other port.But after awhile this hope also was abandoned, and all were
reluctantly compelled to come to the conclusion that she had foundered
at sea, and that all on board had perished.After lying a short time in port, Captain Flint set sail up the river
under pretence of going on a trading expedition among the various
Indian tribes.But he ascended the river no further than the Highlands, and come to
anchor along the mountain familiarly known as Butterhill, but which
people of more romantic turn call Mount Tecomthe, in honor of the
famous Indian chief of that name.Mary travelled to the bedroom.Having secured their vessel close to the shore, the buccaneers now
landed, all save one, who was left in charge of the schooner.Each carried with him a bundle or package containing a portion of the
most valuable part of the plunder taken from the ship which they had
so recently robbed.Having ascended the side of the mountain for about two hundred yards,
they came to what seemed to be a simple fissure in the rocks about
wide enough to admit two men abreast.This cleft or fissure they entered, and having proceeded ten or
fifteen feet they came to what appeared to be a deep well or pit.Daniel went to the garden.Here the party halted, and Captain Flint lighted a torch, and
producing a light ladder, which was concealed in the bushes close by,
the whole party descended.On reaching the bottom of the pit, a low, irregular opening was seen
in the side, running horizontally into the mountain.This passage they entered, Indian file, and bending almost double.As they proceeded the opening widened and grew higher, until it
expanded into a rude chamber about twelve feet one way by fifteen feet
the other.Here, as far as could be seen, was a bar to all further progress, for
the walls of the chamber appeared to be shut in on every side.But on reaching the further side of the apartment, they stopped at a
rough slab of stone, which apparently formed a portion of the floor of
the cave.Upon one of the men pressing on one end of the slab, the other rose
like a trap door, disclosing an opening in the floor amply sufficient
to admit one person, and by the light of the torch might be seen a
rude flight of rocky stairs, descending they could not tell how far.These were no doubt in part at least artificial.The slab also had been placed over the hole by the pirates, or by some
others like them who had occupied the cave before this time, by way of
security, and to prevent surprise.Captain Flint descended these steps followed by his men.About twenty steps brought them to the bottom, when they entered
another horizontal passage, and which suddenly expanded into a wide
and lofty chamber.Here the party halted, and the captain shouted at the top of his
voice:

"What ho!there, Lightfoot, you she devil, why don't you light up!"This rude summons was repeated several times before it received any
answer.At length an answer came in what was evidently a female voice, and
from one who was in no very good humor: "Oh, don't you get into a
passion now.How you s'pose I know you was coming back so soon.""Didn't I tell you I'd be back to-day!""Well, what if you did," replied the voice."Do you always come when
you says you will?""Well, no matter, let's have no more of your impudence.We're back
bow, and I want you to light up and make a fire."The person addressed was now heard retiring and muttering to herself.In a few moments the hall was a blaze of light from lamps placed in
almost every place where a lamp could be made to stand.The scene that burst upon the sight was one of enchantment.The walls and ceiling of the cavern seemed to be covered with a
frosting of diamonds, multiplying the lamps a thousand fold, and
adding to them all the colors of the rainbow.Some of the crystals which were of the purest quartz hanging from the
roof, were of an enormous size, giving reflections which made the
brilliancy perfectly bewildering.The floor of the cavern was covered, not with Brussels or Wilton
carpets, but with the skins of the deer and bear, which to the tread
were as pleasant as the softest velvet.Around the room were a number of frames, rudely constructed to be
sure, of branches, but none the less convenient on that account, over
which skins were stretched, forming comfortable couches where the men
might sleep or doze away their time when not actively employed.Near the center of the room was a large flat stone rising about two
feet above the floor.The top of this stone had been made perfectly
level, and over it a rich damask cloth had been spread so as to make
it answer all the purposes of a table.Boxes covered with skins, and
packages of merchandise answered the purpose of chairs, when chairs
were wanted."Where is the king, I should like to know?"said Captain Flint,
looking with pride around the cavern now fully lighted up; "who can
show a hall in his palace that will compare with this?""And where is the king that is half so independent as we are?""And kings we are," said Captain Flint; "didn't they call the
Buccaneers Sea Kings in the olden time?""But this talking isn't getting our supper ready.Where has that
Indian she-devil taken herself off again?"The person here so coarsely alluded to, now made her appearance again,
bearing a basket containing a number of bottles, decanters and
drinking glasses.She was not, to be sure, so very beautiful, but by no means so ugly as
to deserve the epithet applied to her by Captain Flint.She was an Indian woman, apparently thirty, or thirty-five years of
age, of good figure and sprightly in her movements, which circumstance
had probable gained for her among her own people, the name of
Lightfoot.She had once saved Captain Flint's life when a prisoner among the
Indians, and fearing to return to her people
