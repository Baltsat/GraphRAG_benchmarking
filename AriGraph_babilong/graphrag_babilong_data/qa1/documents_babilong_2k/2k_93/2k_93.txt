"I am confident of a good heart under my doublet, such as it is,
bailie," answered the undaunted Henry; "and though I speak but little,
my mouth shall never be padlocked by any noble of them all.""Wear a thick doublet, good Henry, or do not speak so loud," reiterated
the bailie in the same significant tone.John went back to the garden."There are Border men in the
town who wear the bloody heart on their shoulder."Short rede, good rede," said the smith."Let us to our provost, and
demand his countenance and assistance."A murmur of applause went through the party, and Oliver Proudfute
exclaimed, "That is what I have been saying for this half hour, and not
one of ye would listen to me.'Let us go to our provost,' said I.'He is
a gentleman himself, and ought to come between the burgh and the nobles
in all matters.""Hush, neighbours--hush; be wary what you say or do," said a thin meagre
figure of a man, whose diminutive person seemed still more reduced in
size, and more assimilated to a shadow, by his efforts to assume an
extreme degree of humility, and make himself, to suit his argument, look
meaner yet, and yet more insignificant, than nature had made him."Pardon me," said he; "I am but a poor pottingar.Nevertheless, I have
been bred in Paris, and learned my humanities and my cursus medendi as
well as some that call themselves learned leeches.Methinks I can tent
this wound, and treat it with emollients.Here is our friend Simon
Glover, who is, as you all know, a man of worship.Think you he would
not be the most willing of us all to pursue harsh courses here, since
his family honour is so nearly concerned?And since he blenches away
from the charge against these same revellers, consider if he may not
have some good reason more than he cares to utter for letting the matter
sleep.It is not for me to put my finger on the sore; but, alack!we all
know that young maidens are what I call fugitive essences.Suppose now,
an honest maiden--I mean in all innocence--leaves her window unlatched
on St.Valentine's morn, that some gallant cavalier may--in all honesty,
I mean--become her Valentine for the season, and suppose the gallant
be discovered, may she not scream out as if the visit were unexpected,
and--and--bray all this in a mortar, and then consider, will it be a
matter to place the town in feud for?"The pottingar delivered his opinion in a most insinuating manner; but
he seemed to shrink into something less than his natural tenuity when he
saw the blood rise in the old cheek of Simon Glover, and inflame to the
temples the complexion of the redoubted smith.The last, stepping forward, and turning a stern look on the alarmed
pottingar, broke out as follows: "Thou walking skeleton!thou asthmatic
gallipot!if I thought that the puff of
vile breath thou hast left could blight for the tenth part of a minute
the fair fame of Catharine Glover, I would pound thee, quacksalver!in thine own mortar, and beat up thy wretched carrion with flower of
brimstone, the only real medicine in thy booth, to make a salve to rub
mangy hounds with!"cried the glover, in a tone of authority,
"no man has title to speak of this matter but me.Worshipful Bailie
Craigdallie, since such is the construction that is put upon my
patience, I am willing to pursue this riot to the uttermost; and though
the issue may prove that we had better have been patient, you will
all see that my Catharine hath not by any lightness or folly of hers
afforded grounds for this great scandal."Mary went to the bedroom."Neighbour Henry," said he, "we came here to
consult, and not to quarrel.As one of the fathers of the Fair City, I
command thee to forego all evil will and maltalent you may have against
Master Pottingar Dwining.""He is too poor a creature, bailie," said Henry Gow, "for me to harbour
feud with--I that could destroy him and his booth with one blow of my
forehammer.""Peace, then, and hear me," said the official."We all are as much
believers in the honour of the Fair Maiden of Perth as in that of our
Blessed Lady.""But touching our
appeal to our provost, are you agreed, neighbours, to put matter like
this into our provost's hand, being against a powerful noble, as is to
be feared?""The provost being himself a nobleman," squeaked the pottingar, in some
measure released from his terror by the intervention of the bailie."God knows, I speak not to the disparagement of an honourable gentleman,
whose forebears have held the office he now holds for many years--"

"By free choice of the citizens of Perth," said the smith, interrupting
the speaker with the tones of his deep and decisive voice."Ay, surely," said the disconcerted orator, "by the voice of the
citizens.I pray you, friend Smith, interrupt me not.I speak
to our worthy and eldest bailie, Craigdallie, according to my poor
mind.I say that, come amongst us how he will, still this Sir Patrick
Charteris is a nobleman, and hawks will not pick hawks' eyes out.Daniel went to the hallway.He may
well bear us out in a feud with the Highlandmen, and do the part of our
provost and leader against them; but whether he that himself wears silk
will take our part against broidered cloak and cloth of gold, though
he may do so against tartan and Irish frieze, is something to be
questioned.We have saved our Maiden, of whom
I never meant to speak harm, as truly I knew none.They have lost one
man's hand, at least, thanks to Harry Smith--"

"And to me," added the little important bonnet maker.John travelled to the bedroom."And to Oliver Proudfute, as he tells us," continued the pottingar, who
contested no man's claim to glory provided he was not himself compelled
to tread the perilous paths which lead to it."I say, neighbours, since
they have left a hand as a pledge they will never come in Couvrefew
Street again, why, in my simple mind, we were best to thank our stout
townsman, and the town having the honour and these rakehells the loss,
that we should hush the matter up and say no more about it."These pacific counsels had their effect with some of the citizens,
who began to nod and look exceedingly wise upon the advocate of
acquiescence, with whom, notwithstanding the offence so lately given,
Simon Glover seemed also to agree in opinion.But not so Henry Smith,
who, seeing the consultation at a stand, took up the speech in his usual
downright manner."I am neither the oldest nor the richest among you, neighbours, and I am
not sorry for it.Years will come, if one lives to see them; and I can
win and spend my penny like another, by the blaze of the furnace and the
wind of the bellows.But no man ever saw me sit down with wrong done
in word
