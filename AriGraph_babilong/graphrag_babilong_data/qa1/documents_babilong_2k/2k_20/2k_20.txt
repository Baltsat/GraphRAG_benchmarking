_25th October, 1813._

                    W. CONGREVE._Note._--All the cases of service referred to in the above
instructions, will be found particularly detailed in the following
plates.CONSTITUTION AND STRENGTH OF A TROOP OF ROCKET HORSE ARTILLERY.A Troop is proposed to consist of three divisions.Each division to be divided into two sub-divisions.Each sub-division to consist of five sections of three men each, and
two drivers leading four ammunition horses, each mounted man carrying
into action four rounds of 12-pounder Rocket ammunition, and each
ammunition horse eighteen rounds; thus:

Each section carries 12 rounds of ammunition into action, and one
bouche a feù, and, consequently, each sub-division will have five
bouches a feù, and 140 rounds of ammunition: so that the whole troop,
consisting of six of those sub-divisions, will amount to 102 mounted
men, and 24 ammunition horses, and will take into action, without any
wheel carriage, 30 bouches a feù, and 840 rounds of ammunition.It is, however, further proposed to attach to each division two Rocket
cars, one heavy and one light, the first carrying four men with 40
rounds of 24-pounder Rockets, armed with cohorn shells, the latter
carrying two men, and 60 rounds of 12-pounder ammunition.Each of these
cars is capable of discharging two Rockets in a volley.It is proposed, also, to attach to each sub-division a curricle
ammunition cart, or tumbril, for two horses, to carry, in line of
march, three rounds out of four of each mounted man’s Rockets, to
ease the horse: and, in action, when every man carries his full
complement of ammunition on horseback, these cars may contain a reserve
of 60 rounds more for each sub-division, making the whole amount of
ammunition, for each sub-division, 200 rounds.With this addition,
therefore, the whole strength of the Rocket troop will stand thus:

  Officers                                             5
  Non-commissioned Officers                           15
  Troopers                                            90
  Drivers                                             60
  Artificers                                           8
  Cars, heavy                                          3
  Cars, light                                          3
  Curricle ammunition carts, or tumbrils               6
  Bouches a feù                                       42
  Ammunition, heavy shell                            260
  Ammunition, light shell, or case shot             1200

       Making a total of
  Ammunition of all sorts                           1460 rounds.Battery of                                          42 bouches a feù.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.Cars, tumbrils, and forge cart                      13
  Officers, staff artificers, troopers, and drivers  172
  Troop, ammunition, and draft horses                164

The number of sections in a sub-division may vary according to the
actual effective strength of the troop at any time; so that the
distribution may be accommodated to the numbers, without departing from
this principle of constitution.The number of men and horses above
stated is precisely the same as that of a troop of horse artillery.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.The reserve of ammunition is supposed to proceed with the park.THE EQUIPMENT OF ROCKET CAVALRY.Plate 1st represents the mode of equipment for carrying Rockets on
horseback, as it was arranged during the course of experiments, which
were carried on, under my direction, at Bagshot, in 1811; as it was
subsequently carried into actual service, under Captain BOGUE, with the
Allied armies in Germany, in the ever memorable campaign of 1813; and
as it is at present proposed to equip the new corps of Rocket Horse
Artillery, established on the 1st of January, 1814, by Earl MULGRAVE,
Master General of the Ordnance, and composed of two troops, under the
command of Lieutenant Colonel FISHER, of the Royal Artillery.The right hand figure represents a trooper completely armed and
equipped, in review order.The left hand figure is a delineation of
the same, with the shabracque removed, to shew the holsters in which
the Rockets are conveyed.These holsters each contain two 12-pounder
Rockets, each Rocket armed with a 6-pounder shell, or case shot; they
are connected together at top, and are supported by the pummel of the
saddle, which is made in the hussar fashion, though the saddle itself
is, in fact, formed and stuffed the same as a common English saddle.This projection in front keeps the holsters clear of the horse’s
withers and shoulders, which, from their size, it might otherwise be
difficult to do; for the latter of these purposes, also, the flap
of the saddle comes further forward than usual.The holsters, thus
connected, slip on and off from the pummel with great facility, which
is an object of importance, as a part of the service of the Rocket
trooper is, when from some impassable obstacle, he can no longer
advance on horseback, to dismount and pass over such obstacle, with
his ammunition holsters and chamber, on foot.The sticks, which are
seven feet in length, and four in number, answering to the number of
Rockets, are collected in a bundle by means of a strap with four loops,
contrived on purpose, and are carried on the off-side, the thicker ends
being supported in
