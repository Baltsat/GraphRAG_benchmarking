I have not
signed it either with my name or signature (Common Sense) because I
found myself obliged, in order to made such scoundrels feel a little
smart, to go somewhat out of my usual manner of writing, but there are
some sentiments and some expressions that will be supposed to be in my
stile, and I have no objection to that supposition, but I do not wish
Mr.Jefferson to be _obliged_ to know it is from me."Since receiving your letter, which contained no direct information of
any thing I wrote to you about, I have written myself to Mr.Barrett
accompanied with a piece for the editor of the Baltimore Evening Post,
who is an acquaintance of his, but I have received no answer from Mr.B., neither has the piece been published in the Evening Post.I will be
obliged to you to call on him & to inform me about it.John travelled to the kitchen.You did not
tell me if you called upon Foster; but at any rate do not delay the
enclosed.--I do not trouble you with any messages or compliments, for
you never deliver any.* I am indebted for this letter to Mr.editor of the National Reformer,  London.By a minute comparison of the two alleged specifications of immorality,
Paine proved that one was intrinsically absurd, and the other without
trustworthy testimony.As for the charge of cowardice, Paine contended
that it was the duty of a civil magistrate to move out of danger, as
Congress had done in the Revolution.The article was signed "A Spark
from the Altar of '76," but the writer was easily recognized.The
service thus done Jefferson was greater than can now be easily realized.Another paper by Paine was on "Constitutions, Governments and
Charters."It was an argument to prove the unconstitutionality in New
York of the power assumed by the legislature to grant charters.This
defeated the object of annual elections, by placing the act of one
legislature beyond the reach of its successor.He proposes that all
matters of "extraordinary legislation," such as those involving grants
of land and incorporations of companies, "shall be passed only by a
legislature succeeding the one in which it was proposed."Had such an
article been originally in the Constitution [of New York] the bribery
and corruption employed to seduce and manage the members of the late
legislature, in the affair of the Merchants' Bank, could not have taken
place.It would not have been worth while to bribe men to do what they
had no power of doing.Madame Bonneville hated country life, and insisted on going to New
York.Paine was not sorry to have her leave, as she could not yet talk
English, and did not appreciate Paine's idea of plain living and high
thinking.She apparently had a notion that Paine had a mint of money,
and, like so many others, might have attributed to parsimony efforts
the unpaid author was making to save enough to give her children,
practically fatherless, some start in life.Daniel travelled to the bedroom.The philosophic solitude in
which he was left at New Rochelle is described in a letter (July 31st)
to John Fellows, in New York.Bonneville go into some family as
a teacher, for she has not the least talent of managing affairs for
herself.I will take care of him for his
own sake and his father's, but that is all I have to say.... I am
master of an empty house, or nearly so.I have six chairs and a table, a
straw-bed, a featherbed, and a bag of straw for Thomas, a tea kettle, an
iron pot, an iron baking pan, a frying pan, a gridiron, cups, saucers,
plates and dishes, knives and forks, two candlesticks and a pair of
snuffers.I have a pair of fine oxen and an ox-cart, a good horse, a
Chair, and a one-horse cart; a cow, and a sow and 9 pigs.When you come
you must take such fare as you meet with, for I live upon tea, milk,
fruit-pies, plain dumplins, and a piece of meat when I get it; but I
live with that retirement and quiet that suit me.Daniel went back to the hallway.Bonneville was
an encumbrance upon me all the while she was here, for she would not do
anything, not even make an apple dumplin for her own children.If you
cannot make yourself up a straw bed, I can let you have blankets, and
you will have no occasion to go over to the tavern to sleep."As I do not see any federal papers, except by accident, I know not if
they have attempted any remarks or criticisms on my Eighth Letter, [or]
the piece on Constitutional Governments and Charters, the two numbers
on Turner's letter, and also the piece on Hulbert.As to anonymous
paragraphs, it is not worth noticing them.I consider the generality of
such editors only as a part of their press, and let them pass.--I want
to come to Morrisania, and it is probable I may come on to N. Y., but I
wish you to answer this letter first.--Yours in friendship."* I am indebted for an exact copy of the letter from which
     this is extracted to-Dr.Garnett of the British Museum,
     though it is not in that institution.It must not be supposed from what Paine says of Madame Bonneville that
there was anything acrimonious in their relations.She was thirty-one
years younger than Paine, fond of the world, handsome.The old
gentleman, all day occupied with writing, could give her little
companionship, even if he could have conversed in French, But he
indulged her in every way, gave her more money than he could afford,
devoted his ever decreasing means to her family.She had boundless
reverence for him, but, as we have seen, had no taste for country life.Probably, too, after Dederick's attempt on Paine's life she became
nervous in the lonely house.So she had gone to New York, where she
presently found good occupation as a teacher of French in several
families.Her sons, however, were fond of New Rochelle, and of Paine,
who had a knack of amusing children, and never failed to win their
affection.*

     * In the Tarrytown Argus, October 18, 1890, appeared an
     interesting notice of the Rev.Alexander Davis (Methodist),
     by C. K. B[uchanan] in which it is stated that Davis, a
     native of New Rochelle, remembered the affection of Paine,
     who "would bring him round-hearts and hold him on his knee."Many such recollections of his little neighbors have been
     reported.The spring of 1805 at New Rochelle was a pleasant one for Paine.He wrote his last political pamphlet, which was printed by Duane,
Philadelphia, with the title: "Thomas Paine to the Citizens of
Pennsylvania, on the Proposal for Calling a Convention."Sandra journeyed to the office.It opens with a
reference to his former life and work in Philadelphia."Removed as I
now am from the place, and detached from everything of personal party, I
address this token to you on the ground of principle, and in remembrance
of former times and friendships."He gives an historical account of the
negative or veto-power, finding it the English Parliament
