By this arrangement also, they are easily drawn from
the bundle downwards, for fixing to the Rocket, leaving any number that
may remain as securely fixed as when the whole are in the quiver.Daniel went to the bathroom.It has already been stated, that the men are told off in sections of
threes.They are accordingly numbered 1, 2, and 3.Now numbers 1 and
3 have nothing to carry but their proportion of the ammunition, viz.four Rockets and four sticks each, while No.2 has in addition to
carry the chamber from which the Rockets of his section are discharged.Sandra went to the hallway.This chamber is a small iron plate trough, about one foot six inches
in length, capable of being fixed steadily in the ground by four iron
points at the bottom of it, so that the Rockets may be discharged
parallel to the surface and close to it.The weight of this chamber, or
bouche a feù, is about six lbs.and it is carried in a small leather
case, shewn in both these figures, just at the back of the valise.The men are armed with a sabre, which is in action suspended to the
saddle, that they may not be incumbered in mounting and dismounting.Each man has besides a pistol in his cross belt, and a spear head in
his holster, which may be occasionally fixed at the end of one of the
Rocket sticks, so as to give the further aid of a very formidable
lance.Instead of carrying slow match, which would be dangerous as
well as inconvenient, the portfire is lighted in action by a flash of
powder obtained from a pistol lock and pan, mounted on a small stock;
and a light portfire stick for discharging the Rocket, about three feet
in length, is constructed of a thin iron tube, which shuts up, and is
carried in the holster.The sticks are fastened in the loops on the
Rocket case, either by the gripe of a pair of pincers with points in
them, or by the stroke of a small hammer with a point in the head, or
by some equally simple tool.Every part of this equipment, except the
sticks, is so completely concealed by the shabracque, that the Rocket
trooper has the appearance merely of a lancer.The weight of ammunition carried by the troop horse, with the full
complement going into action, is three stone six lbs.; to which the
horse is fully equal for any ordinary operation.But in long marches,
it would be not only useless but improvident to burthen him to this
extent; small tumbrils, therefore, are provided to convey three rounds
of each man’s Rockets, he still carrying one round on the near side,
and the four sticks on the off side to balance, which leaves the
horse, in travelling, only one stone four lbs.weight of ammunition to
carry; a burthen of two stone less on line of march, than that of the
heavy dragoon’s or artillery-man’s horse; allowing for the difference
of the weight of the men requisite for the respective services.The
Rocket trooper has no heavy weights to lift--no guns to spunge, or to
limber up and unlimber.He is required merely to be light and active
for mounting and dismounting, and for moving nimbly on foot with a
single Rocket, when in action: so that, whereas an artillery man cannot
average less than 13 stone, the Rocket trooper need not exceed 10
stone, a difference amounting within a few pounds to the whole weight
of ammunition carried by the men, even in action.It is needless to
add that this difference in the men must also give great facility in
recruiting for a Rocket corps.[Illustration: _Plate 1_]




OF THE EQUIPMENT OF THE AMMUNITION HORSE.Plate 2 represents the mode of equipping the Ammunition Horses.The left hand figure shews that the whole of the ammunition, &c. may be
completely covered and protected from the weather by a painted canvass;
and the other has this cover off, to shew the particular distribution
of the load, which consists of eighteen Rockets and Rocket sticks, and
a proportion of small stores, such as portfires, slow match, &c.

This load is carried on a bat saddle, made as small and as light
as possible, with a pad at the back part of it, extending towards
the crupper.Joy beamed no longer from his face;
      His step was sad and slow;
    His heart was heavy with its grief;
      His bosom with its woe.Whilst gazing at his altered form
      Within the mirrored brook,
    He spied an angel leaning o'er,
      With pity in her look.He turned, distrustful of his sight,
      Unwilling to believe,
    When, lo!in Heaven's own radiance smiled,
      His sweet companion, Eve!Fondly he clasped her to his heart,
      And blissfully he cried,
    "What tho' I've lost a Paradise,
      I've gained an angel bride!No flowers in Eden ever bloomed,
      No!not in heaven above,
    Sweeter than woman brings to man--
      Her friendship, truth, and love!"These buds were brought by Adam's bride,
      Outside of Eden's gate,
    And scattered o'er the world; _to them_
      This book I dedicate.[Decoration]

V._PHASES IN THE LIFE OF JOHN POLLEXFEN._


PHASE THE FIRST.There are but three persons now living who can truthfully answer the
question, "How did John Pollexfen, the photographer, make his fortune?"No confidence will be violated, now that he is dead, and his heirs
residents of a foreign country, if I relate the story of that singular
man, whose rapid accumulation of wealth astonished the whole circle of
his acquaintance.Returning from the old man's funeral a few days since, the subject of
Pollexfen's discoveries became the topic of conversation; and my
companions in the same carriage, aware that, as his attorney and
confidential friend, I knew more of the details of his business than any
one else, extorted from me a promise that at the first leisure moment I
would relate, in print, the secret of that curious invention by which
the photographic art was so largely enriched, and himself elevated at
once to the acme of opulence and renown.Few persons who were residents of the city of San Francisco at an early
day, will fail to remember the site of the humble gallery in which
Pollexfen laid the foundations of his fame.It was situated on Merchant
Street, about midway between Kearny and Montgomery Streets, in an old
wooden building; the ground being occupied at present by the solid brick
structure of Thomas R. Bolton.It fed the flames of the great May fire
of 1851, was rebuilt, but again consumed in December, 1853.It was
during the fall of the latter year that the principal event took place
which is to constitute the most prominent feature of my narrative.I am aware that the facts will be discredited by many, and doubted at
first by all; but I beg to premise, at the outset, that because they are
uncommon, by no means proves that they are untrue.Besides, should the
question ever become a judicial one, I hold in my hands such
