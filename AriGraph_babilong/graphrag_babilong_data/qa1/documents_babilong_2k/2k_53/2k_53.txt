Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!Daniel journeyed to the garden.the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.Daniel went back to the office.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Mary went to the hallway.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.The suburbs are surrounded with huge blocks of
stone.Togawost contains a number of shops and manufactories of good
workmen, who are divided into three distinct classes of people, all
engaged in continual hostilities with one another.The men are, however,
honest and laborious, while the women are pretty and coquettish.Mary went back to the garden.Augustine, whom the Mahometans have dubbed a Marabout, was
born in this city.Their trade is with the Sahara and Timbuctoo.Fedsi is another considerable city, anciently the capital of Sous,
reclining upon a large arm of the river Sous, amidst a fruitful soil,
and contains about fourteen thousand inhabitants, who are governed by
republican institutions.It is twenty miles E.N.E.Beneali is a town placed near to the source of the river Draha, in the
Atlas.It is the residence of the chief of the Berbers of Hadrar, on the
southern Atlas.Beni-Sabih, Moussabal, or Draha, is the capital of the province of
Draha, and a small place, but populated and commercial.On the river of
the same name, was the Draha of ancient geography.Tatta and Akka, are two towns or villages of the province of Draha,
situate on the southern confines of Morocco, and points of rendezvous
for the caravans in their route over the Great Desert.Tatta is four days direct east from Akka, and placed in 28 deg.Akka consists of two hundred houses,
inhabited by Mussulmen, and fifty by Jews.The environs are highly
cultivated.Akka is two days east of Wadnoun, situate on a plain at the
foot of Gibel-Tizintit, and is placed in 28 deg.Messa is, according to Graeberg, a walled city, built
by the Berbers, not far from the river Sous, and divided like nearly all
the cities of Sous, into three parts, or quarters, each inhabited by
respective classes of Shelouhs, Moors, and Jews.Cities are also divided
in this manner in the provinces of Guzzala and Draha.The sea on the
coast of Sous throws up a very fine quantity of amber.The town is named Assah, and
distant about two miles from the sea, there being a few scattered houses
on each side of the river, to within half a mile of the sea.The place
is of no importance, famed only for having near it a market on Tuesday,
to which many people resort.Assah is
also the name of the district though which the Sous river flows.Sandra journeyed to the garden.The
Bas-el-wad (or head of the river) is very properly the name of the upper
part of the river; when passing through Taroudant it takes the name of
Sous.Mary travelled to the office.Fifteen miles from Assah is the town of Aghoulon, containing about
six hundred people.Talent, or Tilin, the difference only is the adding of the Berber
termination.Daniel went to the garden.The other consonants are the same, perhaps, as Mr.It is a strong city, and capital of the province
of Sous-el-Aksa, or the extreme part of Sous.This province is sometimes
called Tesset, or Tissert.A portion of it is also denominated
Blad-Sidi-Hasham, and forms a free and quasi-independant state, founded
in 1810 by the Emir Hasham, son of the Shereef Ahmed Ben Mousa.This
