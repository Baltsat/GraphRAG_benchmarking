She heard it without visible emotion, and
without speaking a single word.Sandra went back to the kitchen.My aunt and I immediately asked to be
allowed to accompany my mother, but this favour was refused us.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.All the
time my mother was making up a bundle of clothes to take with her, these
officers never left her.She was even obliged to dress herself before
them, and they asked for her pockets, taking away the trifles they
contained.She embraced me, charging me to keep up my spirits and my
courage, to take tender care of my aunt, and obey her as a second mother.She then threw herself into my aunt's arms, and recommended her children
to her care; my aunt replied to her in a whisper, and she was then hurried
away.In leaving the Temple she struck her head against the wicket, not
having stooped low enough.[Mathieu, the gaoler, used to say, "I make Madame Veto and her sister and
daughter, proud though they are, salute me; for the door is so low they
cannot pass without bowing."]'No,' she replied,
'nothing can hurt me now."We have already seen what changes had been made in the Temple.Marie
Antoinette had been separated from her sister, her daughter, and her Son,
by virtue of a decree which ordered the trial and exile of the last
members of the family of the Bourbons.Mary went back to the bathroom.She had been removed to the
Conciergerie, and there, alone in a narrow prison, she was reduced to what
was strictly necessary, like the other prisoners.The imprudence of a
devoted friend had rendered her situation still more irksome.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.Michonnis, a
member of the municipality, in whom she had excited a warm interest, was
desirous of introducing to her a person who, he said, wished to see her
out of curiosity.This man, a courageous emigrant, threw to her a
carnation, in which was enclosed a slip of very fine paper with these
words: "Your friends are ready,"--false hope, and equally dangerous for
her who received it, and for him who gave it!Michonnis and the emigrant
were detected and forthwith apprehended; and the vigilance exercised in
regard to the unfortunate prisoner became from that day more rigorous than
ever.[The Queen was lodged in a room called the council chamber, which was
considered as the moat unwholesome apartment in the Conciergerie on
account of its dampness and the bad smells by which it was continually
affected.Under pretence of giving her a person to wait upon her they
placed near her a spy,--a man of a horrible countenance and hollow,
sepulchral voice.This wretch, whose name was Barassin, was a robber and
murderer by profession.Such was the chosen attendant on the Queen of
France!A few days before her trial this wretch was removed and a
gendarme placed in her chamber, who watched over her night and day, and
from whom she was not separated, even when in bed, but by a ragged
curtain.In this melancholy abode Marie Antoinette had no other dress
than an old black gown, stockings with holes, which she was forced to mend
every day; and she was entirely destitute of shoes.--DU  BROCA.]Gendarmes were to mount guard incessantly at the door of her prison, and
they were expressly forbidden to answer anything that she might say to
them.That wretch Hebert, the deputy of Chaumette, and editor of the disgusting
paper Pere Duchesne, a writer of the party of which Vincent, Ronsin,
Varlet, and Leclerc were the leaders--Hebert had made it his particular
business to torment the unfortunate remnant of the dethroned family.He
asserted that the family of the tyrant ought not to be better treated than
any sans-culotte family; and he had caused a resolution to be passed by
which the sort of luxury in which the prisoners in the Temple were
maintained was to be suppressed.They were no longer to be allowed either
poultry or pastry; they were reduced to one sort of aliment for breakfast,
and to soup or broth and a single dish for dinner, to two dishes for
supper, and half a bottle of wine apiece.Tallow candles were to be
furnished instead of wag, pewter instead of silver plate, and delft ware
instead of porcelain.The wood and water carriers alone were permitted to
enter their room, and that only accompanied by two commissioners.Their
food was to be introduced to them by means of a turning box.The numerous
establishment was reduced to a cook and an assistant, two men-servants,
and a woman-servant to attend to the linen.As soon as this resolution was passed, Hebert had repaired to the Temple
and inhumanly taken away from the unfortunate prisoners even the most
trifling articles to which they attached a high value.Eighty Louis which
Madame Elisabeth had in reserve, and which she had received from Madame de
Lamballe, were also taken away.No one is more dangerous, more cruel,
than the man without acquirements, without education, clothed with a
recent authority.If, above all, he possess a base nature, if, like
Hebert, who was check-taker at the door of a theatre, and embezzled money
out of the receipts, he be destitute of natural morality, and if he leap
all at once from the mud of his condition into power, he is as mean as he
is atrocious.Such was Hebert in his conduct at the Temple.He did not
confine himself to the annoyances which we have mentioned.He and some
others conceived the idea of separating the young Prince from his aunt and
sister.A shoemaker named Simon and his wife were the instructors to whom
it was deemed right to consign him for the purpose of giving him a
sans-cullotte education.Simon and his wife were shut up in the Temple,
and, becoming prisoners with the unfortunate child, were directed to bring
him up in their own way.Sandra went to the hallway.Their food was better than that of the
Princesses, and they shared the table of the municipal commissioners who
were on duty.Simon was permitted to go down, accompanied by two
commissioners, to the court of the Temple, for the purpose of giving the
Dauphin a little exercise.Daniel journeyed to the garden.Hebert conceived the infamous idea of wringing from this boy revelations
to criminate his unhappy mother.Whether this wretch imputed to the child
false revelations, or abused his, tender age and his condition to extort
from him what admissions soever he pleased, he obtained a revolting
deposition; and as the youth of the Prince did not admit of his being
brought before the tribunal, Hebert appeared and detailed the infamous
particulars which he had himself either dictated or invented.It was on the 14th of October that Marie Antoinette appeared before her
judges.Dragged before the sanguinary tribunal by inexorable
revolutionary vengeance, she appeared there without any chance of
acquittal, for it was not to obtain her acquittal that the Jacobins had
brought her before it.It was necessary, however, to make some charges.Fouquier therefore collected the rumours current among the populace ever
since the arrival of the Princess in France, and, in the act of
accusation, he charged her with having plundered the exchequer, first for
her pleasures, and afterwards in order to transmit money to her
