A
wonderful change met the eye.A transformation as magnificent as it
was bewildering had occurred.The same grand old bluffs looked proudly
down upon the Father of Water.The same magnificent river pursued
its unmolested course toward the boundless ocean.The hostile warrior no longer impeded the onward march of
civilization, and cultivated fields abounded on every side.John travelled to the bathroom.Steamers were hourly traversing the translucent waters of the great
Mississippi; steam and electricity were carrying people with the
rapidity of lightning in every direction; gigantic buildings appeared
on the earth's surface, visible in either direction as far as the
eye could reach; on every corner was a proud descendant of Erin's
nobility, clad in gorgeous raiment, who had been branded "St.Paul's
finest" before leaving the shores of his native land.Mary went back to the bathroom.In the midst of
this great city was a magnificent building, erected by the generosity
of its people, in which the paleface, supported on either side by the
Okons, was the high and mighty ruler.The Okons and the followers of
the Okons were in possession of every office within the gift of the
paleface.Daniel moved to the bathroom.Daniel went back to the office.John travelled to the garden.Floating proudly from the top of this great building was an
immense banner, on which was painted in monster letters the talismanic
words: "For mayor, 1902, Robert A. Smith," Verily the prophecy of the
dusky maiden had been fulfilled.The paleface had become impregnably
intrenched.The Okons could never be dislodged.With feelings of unutterable anguish at the omnipresence of the Okons,
the aged voyageur quietly retraced his footsteps and was never more
seen by the helpless and overburdened subjects of the paleface.*       *       *       *       *

When I was about twelve years of age I resided in a small village in
one of the mountainous and sparsely settled sections of the northern
part of Pennsylvania.It was before the advent of the railroad and telegraph in that
locality.The people were not blessed with prosperity as it is known
to-day.Neither were they gifted with the intellectual attainments
possessed by the inhabitants of the same locality at the present time.Mary travelled to the hallway.Many of the old men served in the war of 1812, and they were looked up
to with about the same veneration as are the heroes of the Civil War
to-day.It was at a time when the younger generation was beginning to
acquire a thirst for knowledge, but it was not easily obtained under
the peculiar conditions existing at that period.A school district
that was able to support a school for six months in each year was
indeed considered fortunate, but even in these the older children were
not permitted to attend during the summer months, as their services
were considered indispensable in the cultivation of the soil.Reading, writing and arithmetic were about all the studies pursued in
those rural school districts, although occasionally some of the better
class of the country maidens could be seen listlessly glancing over a
geography or grammar, but they were regarded as "stuck up," and the
other pupils thought they were endeavoring to master something far
beyond their capacity.Our winter school term generally commenced the first week in December
and lasted until the first week in March, with one evening set apart
each week for a spelling-match and recitation.We had our spelling
match on Saturday nights, and every four weeks we would meet with
schools in other districts in a grand spelling contest.I was
considered too young to participate in any of the joint spelling
matches, and my heart was heavy within me every time I saw a great
four-horse sleigh loaded with joyful boys and girls on their way to
one of the great contests.One Saturday night there was to be a grand spelling match at a country
crossroad about four miles from our village, and four schools were to
participate.As I saw the great sleigh loaded for the coming struggle
the thought occurred to me that if I only managed to secure a ride
without being observed I might in some way be able to demonstrate to
the older scholars that in spelling at least I was their equal.Daniel went back to the hallway.While
the driver was making a final inspection of the team preparatory to
starting I managed to crawl under his seat, where I remained as quiet
as mouse until the team arrived at the point of destination.I had not
considered the question of getting back--I left that to chance.As
soon as the different schools had arrived two of the best spellers
were selected to choose sides, and it happened that neither of them
was from our school.I stood in front of the old-fashioned fire-place
and eagerly watched the pupils as they took their places in the line.They were drawn in the order of their reputation as spellers.Mary moved to the garden.When
they had finished calling the names I was still standing by the
fireplace, and I thought my chance was hopeless.The school-master
from our district noticed my woebegone appearance, and he arose from
his seat and said:

"That boy standing by the fireplace is one of the best spellers in our
school."My name was then reluctantly called, and I took my place at the
foot of the column.I felt very grateful towards our master for his
compliment and I thought I would be able to hold my position in the
line long enough to demonstrate that our master was correct.John travelled to the bedroom.Daniel travelled to the bathroom.The
school-master from our district was selected to pronounce the words,
and I inwardly rejoiced.After going down the line several times and a number of scholars had
fallen on some simple word the school-master pronounced the word
"phthisic."My heart leaped as the word fell from the school-master's
lips.It was one of my favorite hard words and was not in the spelling
book.It had been selected so as to floor the entire line in order to
make way for the exercises to follow.As I looked over the long line of overgrown country boys and girls I
felt sure that none of them would be able to correctly spell the word.said the school-master, and my pulse beat
faster and faster as the older scholars ahead of me were relegated to
their seats.As the school-master stood directly in front of me and said "Next," I
could see by the twinkle in his eye that he thought I could correctly
spell the word.With a clear and
distinct voice loud enough to be heard by every one in the room
I spelled out "ph-th-is-ic--phthisic.""Correct," said the
school-master, and all the scholars looked aghast at my promptness.I shall never forget the kindly smile of the old school-master, as he
laid the spelling book upon the teacher's desk, with the quiet remark:
"I told you he could spell."I had spelled down four schools, and my
reputation as a speller was established.Our school was declared to
have furnished the champion speller of the four districts, and ever
after my name was not the last one to be called.On my return home I was not compelled to ride under the driver's seat.HALF A CENTURY WITH THE PIONEER PRESS.Pioneer Press, April 18, 1908:--Frank Moore, superintendent of the
