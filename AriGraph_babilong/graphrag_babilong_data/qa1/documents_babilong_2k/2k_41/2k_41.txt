But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am
dragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself
for her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don't know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment's silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised
air; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very
industrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.Sandra travelled to the hallway.She is
deformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,
on the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the
other, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain
that your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own
thought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had
presented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this
comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could
say to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel
misfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,
when we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we
are rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will
quickly put me in a situation to deserve it.Sandra went to the bedroom.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was
always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises
from independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness
of sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
protectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
and kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and
striking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who
inspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I
should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
suspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one
another; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our
excellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves
are far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by
assisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my
mother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is
not only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,
whom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from
Siberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to
his former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much
surprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."Miss Coddle, has he
been shamming deafness, then, all this time?A doctor cured his deafness only half
an hour ago.Dear old master, was it kind to deceive me in this fashion?now ye can hear, I love you tenderer than
ever.Tell you, you pig, you minx!I tell you to walk out of my house.CODDLE (_loud to WHITWELL_).You are an impostor,
sir.EGLANTINE (_shrieks_).(_Hides her
face in her hands._)

WHITWELL.or I should have lost the rapture of
that sweet avowal.Coddle, I love--I adore your daughter.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.You heard
a moment since the confession that escaped her innocent lips.Surely
you cannot turn a deaf ear to the voice of nature, and see us both
miserable for life.Remember, sir, you have now no deaf ear to turn.Give you my daughter after all your frightful
insults?Remember how you treated me, sir; and reflect, too, that you
began it.Insults are not insults unless intended to be heard.For
every thing I said, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.CODDLE (_after a pause_)._Eglantine._ Papa, of course he does.Whittermat, I can't give my daughter to
a man I never heard of in my life,--and with such a preposterous name
too!My name is Whitwell, my dear sir,--not Whittermat: nephew of
your old friend Benjamin Pottle.What did you tell me your name was Whittermat for?Some singular mistake, sir: I never did.Can't imagine how
the mistake could have occurred.Well, since you heard
all _I_ said--Ha, ha, ha!For every Roland of mine you
gave me two Olivers at least.Diamond cut diamond,--ha, ha, ha!All laugh heartily._)

JANE.I never thought I'd live to see this happy day,
master.Mary moved to the hallway.Hold your tongue, you impudent cat!Mollycoddle,
indeed!Coddle, you won't go for to turn off a faithful servant in
this way.(_Aside to WHITWELL._) That legacy's lost.(_To CODDLE._) Ah,
master dear!you won't find nobody else as'll work their fingers to the
bone, and their voice to a thread-paper, as I have: up early and down
late, and yelling and screeching from morning till night.Well, the
house will go to rack and ruin when I'm gone,--that's one comfort.WHITWELL (_aside to JANE_).The money's yours, cash down, the day of my
wedding.Well, well, Jane, I'll forgive you, for luck.But I wish you knew how to boil spinach.Harrold for a week
from to-day, and invite all our friends (_to the audience_) to witness
the wedding.All who mean to come will please signify it by clapping their hands,
and the harder the better.(_Curtain falls._)
