It was while flying in company with this Indian woman, that Captain
Flint had accidently discovered this cave.And here the fugitives had
concealed themselves for several days, until the danger which then
threatened them had passed.It was on this occasion that it occurred to the captain, what a place
of rendezvous this cave would be for himself and his gang; what a
place of shelter in case of danger; what a fine storehouse for the
plunder obtained in his piratical expeditions!Sandra went back to the bathroom.He immediately set about fixing it up for the purpose; and as it would
be necessary to have some one to take charge of things in his absence,
he thought of none whom he could more safely trust with the service,
than the Indian woman who had shared his flight.Mary moved to the garden.From that time, the cave became a den of pirates, as it had probably
at one time been a den of wild beasts.Which was the better condition, we leave it for the reader to decide.The only other occupant of the cave was a <DW64> boy of about fourteen
or fifteen years of age, known by the name of Black Bill.He seemed to be a simple, half-witted, harmless fellow, and assisted
Lightfoot in doing the drudgery about the place."What have you got in your basket, Lightfoot?""Away with your wine," said the captain; "we must have something
stronger than that.Give us some brandy; some fire-water."In de kitchen fixin' de fire," said Lightfoot."All right, let him heat some water," said the captain; "and now,
boys, we'll make a night of it," he said, turning to his men.Mary went back to the hallway.Sandra went to the office.The place here spoken of by Lightfoot as the kitchen, was a recess of
several feet in the side of the cave, at the back of which was a
crevice or fissure in the rock, extending to the outside of the
mountain.John went back to the hallway.This crevice formed a natural chimney through which the smoke could
escape from the fire that was kindled under it.The water was soon heated, the table was covered with bottles,
decanters and glasses of the costliest manufacture.Cold meats of
different kinds, and an infinite variety of fruits were produced, and
the feasting commenced.Yes, the pirate and his crew were now seated round the table for the
purpose as he said, of making a night of it.And a set of more perfect
devils could hardly be found upon the face of the earth.And yet there was nothing about them so far as outward appearance was
concerned, that would lead you to suppose them to be the horrible
wretches that they really were.With the exception of Jones Bradley, there was not one among them who
had not been guilty of almost every crime to be found on the calender
of human depravity.For some time very little was said by any of the party, but after a
while as their blood warmed under the influence of the hot liquor,
their tongues loosened, and they became more talkative.And to hear
them, you would think that a worthier set of men were no where to be
found.John travelled to the office.Not that they pretended to any extraordinary degree of virtue, but
then they had as much as anyone else.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.And he who pretended to any
more, was either a hypocrite or a fool.To be sure, they robbed, and murdered, and so did every one else, or
would if they found it to their interest to do so.Daniel moved to the office.For
I promise, that I will never make any long Answers, but only very freely
confesse my own faults, if I find them; or if I cannot discover them,
plainly say what I shal think requisite in defence of what I have writ,
without adding the explanation of any new matter, that I may not
endlesly engage my self out of one into another.Now if there be any whereof I have spoken in the beginning, of the
Opticks and of the Meteors, which at first jarr, by reason that I call
them Suppositions, and that I seem not willing to prove them; let a man
have but the patience to read the whole attentively, and I hope he will
rest satisfied: For (me thinks) the reasons follow each other so
closely, that as the later are demonstrated by the former, which are
their Causes; the former are reciprocally proved by the later, which are
their Effects.And no man can imagine that I herein commit the fault
which the Logicians call a _Circle_; for experience rendring the
greatest part of these effects most certain, the causes whence I deduce
them serve not so much to prove, as to explain them; but on the
contrary, they are those which are proved by them.Neither named I them
Suppositions, that it might be known that I conceive my self able to
deduce them from those first Truths which I have before discovered: But
that I would not expresly do it to crosse certain spirits, who imagine
that they know in a day al what another may have thought in twenty
yeers, as soon as he hath told them but two or three words; and who are
so much the more subject to erre, and less capable of the Truth, (as
they are more quick and penetrating) from taking occasion of erecting
some extravagant Philosophy on what they may beleeve to be my
Principles, and lest the fault should be attributed to me.For as for
those opinions which are wholly mine, I excuse them not as being new,
because that if the reasons of them be seriously considered, I assure my
self, they will be found so plain, and so agreeable to common sense,
that they will seem less extraordinary and strange then any other which
may be held on the same Subjects.Neither do I boast that I am the first
Inventor of any of them; but of this indeed, that I never admitted any
of them, neither because they had, or had not been said by others, but
only because Reason perswaded me to them.If Mechanicks cannot so soon put in practise the Invention which is set
forth in the Opticks, I beleeve that therefore men ought not to condemn
it; forasmuch as skill and practice are necessary for the making and
compleating the Machines I have described; so that no circumstance
should be wanting.I should no less wonder if they should succeed at
first triall, then if a man should learn in a day to play excellently
well on a Lute, by having an exact piece set before him.And if I write
in French, which is the language of my Country, rather then in Latin,
which is that of my Tutors, 'tis because I hope such who use their meer
naturall reason, wil better judge of my opinions, then those who only
beleeve in old Books.And for those who joyn a right understanding with
study, (who I only wish for my Judges) I assure my self, they will not
be so partiall to the Latin, as to refuse to read my reasons because I
expresse them in a vulgar tongue.To conclude, I will not speak here in particular of the progresse I
hoped to make hereafter in Learning; Nor engage my self by any promise
to the Publick, which I am not certain to perform.Mary went to the office.Sandra went to the office.But I shall onely
say, That I am resolved to employ the remainder of my life in no other
thing but the study to acquire some such knowledge of Nature as may
f
