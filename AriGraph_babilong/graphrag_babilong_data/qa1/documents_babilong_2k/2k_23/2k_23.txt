Her father was exiled, and his estates seized by the officers
of the government, on account of his political tenets.The family
embarked at Marseilles, with just sufficient ready money to pay their
passage to New York, and support them for a few months after their
arrival.It soon became apparent that want, and perhaps starvation, were
in store, unless some means of obtaining a livelihood could be devised.The sole expedient was music, of which M. Marmont was a proficient, and
to this resource he at once applied himself most industriously.He had
accumulated a sufficient sum to pay his expenses to this coast, up to
the beginning of 1851, and took passage for San Francisco, as we have
already seen, in the spring of that year.Reaching here, he became more embarrassed every day, unacquainted as he
was with the language, and still less with the wild life into which he
was so suddenly plunged.Whilst poverty was pinching his body, grief for
the loss of his wife was torturing his soul.Silent, sad, almost morose
to others, his only delight was in his child.Apprehensions for her
fate, in case of accident to himself, embittered his existence, and
hastened the catastrophe above related.Desirous of placing her in a
situation in which she could earn a livelihood, independent of his own
precarious exertions, he taught her drawing and painting, and had just
succeeded in obtaining for her the employment of coloring photographs at
Pollexfen's gallery the very day he was seized with his fatal disorder.Some weeks previous to this, Charles Courtland, the young man before
mentioned, became an inmate of his house under the following
circumstances:

One evening, after the performances at the Jenny Lind Theatre (where M.
Marmont was employed) were over, and consequently very late, whilst he
was pursuing his lonely way homewards he accidentally stumbled over an
impediment in his path.He at once recognized it as a human body, and
being near home, he lifted the senseless form into his house.A severe
contusion behind the ear had been the cause of the young man's
misfortune, and his robbery had been successfully accomplished whilst
lying in a state of insensibility.His recovery was extremely slow, and though watched by the brightest
pair of eyes that ever shot their dangerous glances into a human soul,
Courtland had not fully recovered his strength up to the time that I
made his acquaintance.He was a Virginian by birth; had spent two years in the mines on Feather
River, and having accumulated a considerable sum of money, came to San
Francisco to purchase a small stock of goods, with which he intended to
open a store at Bidwell's Bar.His robbery frustrated all these golden
dreams, and his capture by Lucile Marmont completed his financial ruin.Here terminates the first phase in the history of John Pollexfen.exclaimed John Pollexfen, as he dashed
a glass negative, which he had most elaborately prepared, into the
slop-bucket.After a moment's
silence, he again spoke: "But I know _it exists_.Nature has the secret
locked up securely, as she thinks, but I'll tear it from her.Is not the retina impressible to the faintest gleam of
light?What telegraphs to my soul the colors of the rainbow?Nothing but
the eye, the human eye.And shall John Pollexfen be told, after he has
lived half a century, that the compacted humors of this little organ can
do more than his whole laboratory?I'll wrest the secret from
the labyrinth of nature, or pluck my own eyes from their sockets."Thus soliloquized John Pollexfen, a few days after the events narrated
in the last chapter.He was seated at a table, in a darkened chamber, with a light burning,
though in the middle of the day, and his countenance bore an
unmistakable expression of disappointment, mingled with disgust, at the
failure of his last experiment.He was evidently in an ill-humor, and
seemed puzzled what to do next.Just then a light tap came at the door,
and in reply to an invitation to enter, the pale, delicate features of
Lucile Marmont appeared at the threshold.After surveying the painted photographs a moment, he
broke out into a sort of artistic glee: "Beautiful!Come, have no secrets from me; I'm an
old man, and may be of service to you yet.Before relating any more of the conversation, it becomes necessary to
paint John Pollexfen as he was.John went to the garden.Methinks I can see his tall, rawboned,
angular form before me, even now, as I write these lines.There he
stands, Scotch all over, from head to foot.It was whispered about in
early times--for really no one knew much about his previous career--that
John Pollexfen had been a famous sea captain; that he had sailed around
the world many times; had visited the coast of Africa under suspicious
circumstances, and finally found his way to California from the then
unpopular region of Australia.Without pausing to trace these rumors
further, it must be admitted that there was something in the appearance
of the man sufficiently repulsive, at first sight, to give them
currency.Mary went back to the bathroom.He had a large bushy head, profusely furnished with hair
almost brickdust in color, and growing down upon a broad, low forehead,
indicative of great mathematical and constructive power.His brows were
long and shaggy, and overhung a restless, deep-set, cold, gray eye, that
met the fiercest glance unquailingly, and seemed possessed of that
magnetic power which dazzles, reads and confounds whatsoever it looks
upon.There was no escape from its inquisitive glitter.It sounded the
very depths of the soul it thought proper to search.Whilst gazing at
you, instinct felt the glance before your own eye was lifted so as to
encounter his.It was as
pitiless as the gleam of the lightning.But you felt no less that high
intelligence flashed from its depths.Courage, you knew, was there; and
true bravery is akin to all the nobler virtues.This man, you at once
said, may be cold, but it is impossible for him to be unjust, deceitful
or ungenerous.He might, like Shylock, insist on a _right_, no matter
how vindictive, but he would never forge a claim, no matter how
insignificant.He might crush, like Caesar, but he could never plot like
Catiline.In addition to all this, it required but slight knowledge of
physiognomy to perceive that his stern nature was tinctured with genuine
enthusiasm.Earnestness beamed forth in every feature.His soul was as
sincere as it was unbending.He could not trifle, even with the most
inconsiderable subject.He could smile, but there
was little contagion in his pleasantry.It surprised more than it
pleased you.A detachment of Company K of
the Eighth regiment was sent down from the fort and remained in the
city several days on that especial duty.As soon as the farmers heard
that the government was taking possession of everything that came over
the bridge they ceased hauling their produce to the city and carried
it to Hastings.There was one silver-haired farmer living near the
city limits by the name of Hilks, whose sympathies were entirely with
the South, and he had boasted that all of Uncle Sam's hirelings could
