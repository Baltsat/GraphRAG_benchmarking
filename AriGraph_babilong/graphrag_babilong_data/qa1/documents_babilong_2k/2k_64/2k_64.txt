John went to the bathroom.I walked home, and there found Tom Trice come, and he and my
father gone to Goody Gorum's, where I found them and Jaspar Trice got
before me, and Mr.Greene, and there had some calm discourse, but came to
no issue, and so parted.So home and to bed, being now pretty well again
of my left hand, which lately was stung and very much swelled.At home all the morning, putting my papers in order
against my going to-morrow and doing many things else to that end.John journeyed to the kitchen.Had a
good dinner, and Stankes and his wife with us.To my business again in
the afternoon, and in the evening came the two Trices, Mr.Philips, and so we began to argue.At last it came to some agreement that
for our giving of my aunt L10 she is to quit the house, and for other
matters they are to be left to the law, which do please us all, and so we
broke up, pretty well satisfyed.Barnwell and J. Bowles and
supped with us, and after supper away, and so I having taken leave of them
and put things in the best order I could against to-morrow I went to bed.Old William Luffe having been here this afternoon and paid up his bond of
L20, and I did give him into his hand my uncle's surrender of Sturtlow to
me before Mr.Philips, R. Barnwell, and Mr.Pigott, which he did
acknowledge to them my uncle did in his lifetime deliver to him.Up by three, and going by four on my way to London; but the day
proves very cold, so that having put on no stockings but thread ones under
my boots, I was fain at Bigglesworth to buy a pair of coarse woollen ones,
and put them on.So by degrees till I come to Hatfield before twelve
o'clock, where I had a very good dinner with my hostess, at my Lord of
Salisbury's Inn, and after dinner though weary I walked all alone to the
Vineyard, which is now a very beautiful place again; and coming back I met
with Mr.Looker, my Lord's gardener (a friend of Mr.Mary travelled to the garden.Eglin's), who showed
me the house, the chappell with brave pictures, and, above all, the
gardens, such as I never saw in all my life; nor so good flowers, nor so
great gooseberrys, as big as nutmegs.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Back to the inn, and drank with
him, and so to horse again, and with much ado got to London, and set him
up at Smithfield; so called at my uncle Fenner's, my mother's, my Lady's,
and so home, in all which I found all things as well as I could expect.Made visits to Sir W. Pen and Batten.Sandra journeyed to the garden.Then to
Westminster, and at the Hall staid talking with Mrs.Michell a good while,
and in the afternoon, finding myself unfit for business, I went to the
Theatre, and saw "Brenoralt," I never saw before.It seemed a good play,
but ill acted; only I sat before Mrs.Palmer, the King's mistress, and
filled my eyes with her, which much pleased me.Then to my father's,
where by my desire I met my uncle Thomas, and discoursed of my uncle's
will to him, and did satisfy [him] as well as I could.So to my uncle
Wight's, but found him out of doors, but my aunt I saw and staid a while,
and so home and to bed.Troubled to hear how proud and idle Pall is
grown, that I am resolved not to keep her.This morning my wife in bed tells me of our being robbed of our
silver tankard, which vexed me all day for the negligence of my people to
leave the door open.My wife and I by water to Whitehall, where I left
her to her business and I to my cozen Thomas Pepys, and discoursed with
him at large about our business of my uncle's will.He can give us no
light at all into his estate, but upon the whole tells me that he do
believe that he has left but little money, though something more than we
have found, which is about L500.Here came Sir G. Lane by chance, seeing
a bill upon the door to hire the house, with whom my coz and I walked all
up and down, and indeed it is a very pretty place, and he do intend to
leave the agreement for the House, which is L400 fine, and L46 rent a year
to me between them.Daniel went to the bathroom.Then to the Wardrobe, but come too late, and so dined
with the servants.And then to my Lady, who do shew my wife and me the
greatest favour in the world, in which I take great content.Home by
water and to the office all the afternoon, which is a great pleasure to me
again, to talk with persons of quality and to be in command, and I give it
out among them that the estate left me is L200 a year in land, besides
moneys, because I would put an esteem upon myself.At night home and to
bed after I had set down my journals ever since my going from London this
journey to this house.This afternoon I hear that my man Will hath lost
his clock with my tankard, at which I am very glad.Sandra went back to the bedroom.This morning came my box of papers from Brampton of all my uncle's
papers, which will now set me at work enough.At noon I went to the
Exchange, where I met my uncle Wight, and found him so discontented about
my father (whether that he takes it ill that he has not been acquainted
with things, or whether he takes it ill that he has nothing left him, I
cannot tell), for which I am much troubled, and so staid not long to talk
with him.Thence to my mother's, where I found my wife and my aunt Bell
and Mrs.Ramsey, and great store of tattle there was between the old women
and my mother, who thinks that there is, God knows what fallen to her,
which makes me mad, but it was not a proper time to speak to her of it,
and so I went away with Mr.Moore, and he and I to the Theatre, and saw
"The Jovial Crew," the first time I saw it, and indeed it is as merry and
the most innocent play that ever I saw, and well performed.Daniel went back to the hallway.From thence
home, and wrote to my father and so to bed.Full of thoughts to think of
the trouble that we shall go through before we come to see what will
remain to us of all our expectations.At home all the morning, and walking met with Mr.Hill of Cambridge
at Pope's Head Alley with some women with him whom he took and me into the
tavern there, and did give us wine, and would fain seem to be very knowing
in the affairs of state, and tells me that yesterday put a change to the
whole state of England as to the Church; for the King now would be forced
to favour Presbytery, or the City would leave him: but I heed not what he
says, though upon enquiry I do find that things in the Parliament are in a
great disorder.Moore, and with him to
an ordinary alone and dined, and there he and I
