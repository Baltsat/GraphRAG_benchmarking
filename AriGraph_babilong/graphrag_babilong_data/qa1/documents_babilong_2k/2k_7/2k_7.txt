The man clutches her arm, as
they sing and stagger up past the cafes.The woman holds in her
claw-like hand a half-empty bottle of cheap red wine.Now and then they
stop and share it; the man staggers on; the woman leers and dances and
sings; a crowd forms about them.Some years ago this poor girl sat on
Friday afternoons in the Luxembourg Gardens--her white parasol on her
knees, her dainty, white kid-slippered feet resting on the little stool
which the old lady, who rents the chairs, used to bring her.She was
regarded as a bonne camarade in those days among the students--one of
the idols of the Quarter!But she became impossible, and then an
outcast!That women should become outcasts through the hopelessness of
their position or the breaking down of their brains can be understood,
but that men of ability should sink into the dregs and stay there seems
incredible.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

Near the rue Monge there is a small cafe and restaurant, a place
celebrated for its onion soup and its chicken.Mary travelled to the office.From the tables outside,
one can see into the small kitchen, with its polished copper sauce-pans
hanging about the grill.Lachaume, the painter, and I were chatting at one of its little tables,
he over an absinthe and I over a coffee and cognac.I had dined early
this fresh October evening, enjoying to the full the bracing coolness of
the air, pungent with the odor of dry leaves and the faint smell of
burning brush.I am at one, however, in recognizing the evils of
excess, and would gladly hail their diminution.But I believe that
alcohol properly used may be a comfort and a blessing, just as I know
that improperly used it becomes a bane and a curse.But we are now
concerned with it as an article of diet in relation to useful work, and
it may be well to call attention markedly to the fact that its use in
this way is very limited.Parkes, made
in our laboratory, at Netley, were conclusive on the point, that beyond
an amount that would be represented by about one and a half to two pints
of beer, alcohol no longer provided any convertible energy, and that,
therefore, to take it in the belief that it did do so is an error.It may give a momentary stimulus in considerable doses, but this is
invariably followed by a corresponding depression, and it is a maxim now
generally followed, especially on service, never to give it before or
during work.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.There are, of course, some persons who are better without
it altogether, and so all moderation ought to be commended, if not
enjoyed.There are other beverages which are more useful than the alcoholic,
as restoratives, and for support in fatigue.Another excellent restorative is a weak solution
of Liebig's extract of meat, which has a remarkable power of removing
fatigue.Perhaps one of the most useful and most easily obtainable is
weak oatmeal gruel, either hot or cold.Mary journeyed to the kitchen.With regard to tobacco, it also
has some value in lessening fatigue in those who are able to take it,
but it may easily be carried to excess.Of it we may say, as of alcohol,
that in moderation it seems harmless, and even useful to some extent,
but, in excess, it is rank poison.There is one other point which I must refer to, and which is especially
interesting to a great seaport like this.This is the question of
scurvy--a question of vital importance to a maritime nation.Thomas Gray, of the Board of Trade, discloses the
regrettable fact that since 1873 there has been a serious falling off,
the outbreaks of scurvy having again increased until they reached
ninety-nine in 1881.Gray seems to think, is due to a neglect
of varied food scales; but it may also very probably have arisen from
the neglect of the regulation about lime-juice, either as to issue or
quality, or both.But it is also a fact of very great importance that
mere monotony of diet has a most serious effect upon health; variety
of food is not merely a pandering to gourmandism or greed, but a real
sanitary benefit, aiding digestion and assimilation.Our Board of Trade
has nothing to do with the food scales of ships, but Mr.Gray hints that
the Legislature will have to interfere unless shipowners look to it
themselves.The ease with which preserved foods of all kinds can be
obtained and carried now removes the last shadow of an excuse for
backwardness in this matter, and in particular the provision of a large
supply of potatoes, both fresh and dried, ought to be an unceasing care;
this is done on board American ships, and to this is doubtless owing in
a great part the healthiness of their crews.Scurvy in the present
day is a disgrace to shipowners and masters; and if public opinion is
insufficient to protect the seamen, the legislature will undoubtedly
step in and do so.And now let me close by pointing out that the study of this commonplace
matter of eating and drinking opens out to us the conception of the
grand unity of nature; since we see that the body of man differs in no
way essentially from other natural combinations, but is subject to
the same universal physical laws, in which there is no blindness, no
variableness, no mere chance, and disobedience of which is followed as
surely by retribution as even the keenest eschatologist might desire.*       *       *       *       *




RATTLESNAKE POISON.Mary journeyed to the office.By HENRY H. CROFT.Some time since, in a paper to which I am unfortunately unable to refer,
a French chemist affirmed that the poisonous principle in snakes, or
eliminated by snakes, was of the nature of an alkaloid, and gave a name
to this class of bodies.Pedler has shown that snake poison is destroyed or neutralized
by means of platinic chloride, owing probably to the formation of an
insoluble double platinic chloride, such as is formed with almost if not
all alkaloids.In this country (Texas) where rattlesnakes are very common, and persons
camping out much exposed to their bites, a very favorite anecdote, or
_remedia_ as the Mexicans cull it, is a strong solution of iodine in
potassium iodide.[1]

[Footnote 1: The solution is applied as soon as possible to the wound,
preferably enlarged, and a few drops taken internally.The common
Mexican _remedia_ is the root of the _Agave virginica_ mashed or chewed
and applied to the wound, while part is swallowed.Great faith is placed in this root by all residents here, who are seldom
I without it, but, I have had no experience of it myself; and the
internal administration is no doubt useless.Even the wild birds know of this root; the queer paisano (?ground
woodpecker) which eats snakes, when wounded by a _vibora de cascabel_,
runs into woods, digs up and eats a root of the agave, just like the
mongoose; but more than that, goes back, polishes off his enemy, and
eats him.This has been told me by Mexicans who, it may be remarked, are
not _always
