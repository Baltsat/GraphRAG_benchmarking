“Very well,” she acquiesces meekly.Ruby, looking out after the two as they go down the dark avenue,
pities them for having to go out on such a dismal night.The little
girl does not know that for them it is soon to be illumined with a
light than which there is none brighter save that of heaven, the truest
land of love.It is rather a silent walk home, the conversation made up of the most
common of common-places--Jack trying to steel himself against this
woman, whom, try as he will, he cannot thrust out of his loyal heart;
May tortured by that most sorrowful of all loves, the love which came
too late; than which there is none sadder in this grey old world to-day.“What a nice little girl Ruby is,” says May at length, trying to fill
up a rather pitiful gap in the conversation.“Your mother seems so fond
of her.I am sure she will miss her when she goes.”

“She’s the dearest little girl in the world,” Jack Kirke declares.His
eyes involuntarily meet May’s blue ones, and surely something which was
not there before is shining in their violet depths--“except,” he says,
then stops.“May,” very softly, “will you let me say it?”

May answers nothing; but, though she droops her head, Jack sees her
eyes are shining.They say that silence gives consent, and evidently
in this case it must have done so, or else the young man in question
chooses to translate it in that way.So the stars smile down on an
old, old story, a story as old as the old, old world, and yet new and
fresh as ever to those who for the first time scan its wondrous pages;
a story than which there is none sweeter on this side of time, the
beautiful, glamorous mystery of “love’s young dream.”

“And are you sure,” Jack asks after a time, in the curious manner
common to young lovers, “that you really love me now, May?that I
shan’t wake up to find it all a mistake as it was last time.I’m very
dense at taking it in, sweetheart; but it almost seems yet as though it
was too good to be true.”

“Quite sure,” May says.She looks up into the face of the man beside
whom all others to her are but “as shadows,” unalterable trust in her
blue eyes.“Jack,” very low, “I think I have loved you all my life.”

“_I_ said I would marry you, Jack,” Ruby remarks in rather an offended
voice when she hears the news.“But I s’pose you thought I was too
little.”

“That was just it, Ruby red,” Jack tells her, and stifles further
remonstrance by a kiss.PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED

  Text in italics is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.As the girl was about to answer, the photographer again interposed, "Not
now; I want no answer now; I give you a month for reflection."And so
saying, he left the room as unceremoniously as he had entered.The struggle in the mind of Lucile was sharp and decisive.Dependent
herself upon her daily labor, her lover an invalid, and her nearest
kindred starving, were facts that spoke in deeper tones than the thunder
to her soul.Besides, was not one eye to be spared her, and was not a
single eye quite as good as two?She thought, too, how glorious it would
be if Pollexfen should not be mistaken, and she herself should conduce
so essentially to the noblest triumph of the photographic art.A shade, however, soon overspread her glowing face, as the unbidden idea
came forward: "And will my lover still be faithful to a mutilated bride?But," thought she, "is not this
sacrifice for him?we shall cling still more closely in
consequence of the very misfortune that renders our union possible."One
other doubt suggested itself to her mind: "Is this contract legal?If so," and here her compressed lips, her dilated
nostril, and her clenched hand betokened her decision, "_if so, I
yield_!"Three weeks passed quickly away, and served but to strengthen the
determination of Lucile.At the expiration of that period, and just one
week before the time fixed for the accomplishment of this cruel scheme,
I was interrupted, during the trial of a cause, by the entry of my
clerk, with a short note from Mademoiselle Marmont, requesting my
immediate presence at the office.Apologizing to the judge, and to my
associate counsel, I hastily left the court-room.On entering, I found Lucile completely veiled.Nor was it possible,
during our interview, to catch a single glimpse of her features.She
rose, and advancing toward me, extended her hand; whilst pressing it I
felt it tremble.Falconer, and advise me as to its legality.I
seek no counsel as to my duty.My mind is unalterably fixed on that
subject, and I beg of you, as a favor, in advance, to spare yourself the
trouble, and me the pain, of reopening it."If the speech, and the tone in which it was spoken, surprised me, I need
not state how overwhelming was my astonishment at the contents of the
document.The paper fell from my hands as
though they were paralyzed.Seeing my embarrassment, Lucile rose and
paced the room in an excited manner.Sandra moved to the bathroom.Finally pausing, opposite my desk,
she inquired, "Do you require time to investigate the law?""Not an instant," said I, recovering my self-possession."This paper is
not only illegal, but the execution of it an offense.It provides for
the perpetration of the crime of _mayhem_, and it is my duty, as a good
citizen, to arrest the wretch who can contemplate so heinous and inhuman
an act, without delay.he has even had the insolence to insert my
own name as paymaster for his villainy.""I did not visit your office to hear my benefactor and friend insulted,"
ejaculated the girl, in a bitter and defiant tone."I only came to get
an opinion on a matter of law.""But this monster is insane, utterly crazy," retorted I."He ought, this
moment, to be in a madhouse.""Where they did put Tasso, and tried to put Galileo," she rejoined.said I, solemnly, "are you in earnest?""Were I not, I should not be here.""Then our conversation must terminate just where it began."Lucile deliberately took her seat at my desk, and seizing a pen hastily
affixed her signature to the agreement, and rising, left the office
without uttering another syllable."I have, at least, the paper," thought I, "and that I intend to keep."I sat down and addressed a most pressing letter
to Mr.Courtland, informing him fully of the plot of the lunatic, for so
I then regarded him, and urged him to hasten to San Francisco without a
moment's delay.Then, seizing my hat, I made a most informal call on Dr.White, and consulted him as to the best means of breaking through the
conspiracy.We agreed at once that, as Pollexfen had committed no overt
act in violation of law, he could not be legally arrested, but that
information must be lodged with the chief of police, requesting him to
detail a trustworthy officer, whose duty it should be to obey us
implicitly, and be ready to act at a moment's notice.All this was done, and the officer duly assigned for duty.We explained to him fully the nature of the business
intrusted to his keeping, and took great pains to impress upon him the
necessity of vigilance and fidelity.He entered into the scheme with
alacrity, and was most profuse in his promises.Our settled plan was to meet at the outer door of the photographer's
gallery, at half-past ten o'clock P. M., on the 19th of November, 1853,
and shortly afterwards to make our way, by stratagem or force, into the
presence of Pollexfen, and arrest him on the spot.We hoped to find such
preparations on hand as would justify the arrest, and secure his
punishment.John journeyed to the hallway.If not, Lucile was to be removed, at all events, and
conducted to a place of safety.During the
week we had frequent conferences, and Cloudsdale effected an entrance,
on two occasions, upon some slight pretext, into the room of the artist.But he could discover nothing to arouse suspicion; so, at least, he
informed us.During the morning of the 19th, a warrant of arrest was
duly issued, and lodged in the hands of Cloudsdale for execution.He
then bade us good morning, and urged us to be promptly on the ground at
half-past ten.He told us that he had another arrest to make on the
Sacramento boat, when she arrived, but would not be detained five
minutes at the police office.This was annoying, but we submitted with
the best grace possible.During the afternoon, I got another glimpse at our "trusty."The steamer
left for Panama at one P. M., and I went on board to bid adieu to a
friend who was a passenger.Cloudsdale was also there, and seemed anxious and restive.He told me
that he was on the lookout for a highway robber, who had been tracked to
the city, and it might be possible that he was stowed away secretly on
the ship.Having business up town, I soon left, and went away with a
heavy heart.As night approached I grew more and more nervous, for the party most
deeply interested in preventing this crime had not made his appearance.Sickness or the miscarriage of
my letter, was doubtless the cause.The Doctor and myself supped together, and then proceeded to my
chambers, where we armed ourselves as heavily as though we were about to
fight a battle.The enormity of Pollexfen's
contemplated crime struck us dumb.The evening, however, wore painfully
away, and finally our watches pointed to the time when we should take
our position, as before agreed upon.This we did not specially notice then;
but when five, then ten, and next, fifteen minutes elapsed, and the
officer still neglected to make his appearance, our uneasiness became
extreme.Twenty--_twenty-five_ minutes passed; still Cloudsdale was
unaccountably detained."Can he be already in the rooms above?"exclaimed I, almost
frantically."We have no time to spare in discussion," replied the Doctor, and,
advancing, we tried the door.We had brought a
step-ladder, to enter by the window, if necessary.Next, we endeavored
to hoist the window; it was nailed down securely.Leaping to the ground
we made an impetuous, united onset against the door; but it resisted all
our efforts to burst it in.Acting now with all the promptitude demanded
by the occasion, we mounted the ladder, and by a simultaneous movement
broke the sash, and leaped into the room.Groping our way hurriedly to
the stairs, we had placed our feet upon the first step, when our ears
were saluted with one long, loud, agonizing shriek.The next instant we
rushed into the apartment of Lucile, and beheld a sight that seared our
own eyeballs with horror, and baffles any attempt at description.Before our faces stood the ferocious demon, holding in his arms the
fainting girl, and hurriedly clipping, with a pair of shears, the last
muscles and integuments which held the organ in its place.White, and instantly grappled
with the giant.The work had been
done; the eye torn, bleeding, from its socket, and just as the Doctor
laid his arm upon Pollexfen, the ball fell, dripping with gore, into his
left hand.PHASE THE FIFTH, AND LAST."Monster," cried I, "we arrest you for the crime of mayhem.""Perhaps, gentlemen," said the photographer, "you will be kind enough to
exhibit your warrant."As he said this, he drew from his pocket with his
right hand, the writ of arrest which had been intrusted to Cloudsdale,
and deliberately lighting it in the candle, burned it to ashes before we
could arrest his movement.Lucile had fallen upon a ready prepared bed,
in a fit of pain, and fainting.The Doctor took his place at her side,
his own eyes streaming with tears, and his very soul heaving with
agitation.As for me, my heart was beating as audibly as a drum.With one hand I
grappled the collar of Pollexfen, and with the other held a cocked
pistol at his head.Not a nerve trembled nor a tone
faltered, as he spoke these words: "I am most happy to see you,
gentlemen; especially the Doctor, for he can relieve me of the duties of
surgeon.You, sir, can assist him as nurse."And shaking off my hold as
though it had been a child's, he sprang into the laboratory adjoining,
and locked the door as quick as thought.The insensibility of Lucile did not last long.Sandra travelled to the office.Consciousness returned
gradually, and with it pain of the most intense description.Still she
maintained a rigidness of feature, and an intrepidity of soul that
excited both sorrow and admiration.was all we
could utter, and even that spoken in whispers.Suddenly a noise in the
laboratory attracted attention."Two to one in measure; eight to one in weight; water, only water,"
soliloquized the photographer.Then silence, "Phosphorus; yellow in
color; burns in oxygen."cried I, "Doctor, he is analyzing her eye!The fiend is
actually performing his incantations!"A sudden, sharp explosion; then a fall, as if a chair
had been upset, and----

"Carbon in combustion!in a wild, excited tone,
broke from the lips of Pollexfen, and the instant afterwards he stood at
the bedside of his pupil.At the sound of his voice the girl lifted herself from her pillow,
whilst he proceeded: "Carbon in combustion; I saw it ere the light died
from the eyeball."A smile lighted the pale face of the girl as she faintly responded,
"Regulus gave both eyes for his country; I have given but one for my
art."Pressing both hands to my throbbing brow, I asked myself, "Can this be
real?If real, why do I not assassinate the fiend?Doctor,"
said I, "we must move Lucile."Not so," responded Pollexfen; the excitement of motion might bring on
erysipelas, or still worse, _tetanus_.A motion from Lucile brought me to her bedside.Taking from beneath her
pillow a bank deposit-book, and placing it in my hands, she requested me
to hand it to Courtland the moment of his arrival, which she declared
would be the 20th, and desire him to read the billet attached to the
banker's note of the deposit."Tell him," she whispered, "not to love me
less in my mutilation;" and again she relapsed into unconsciousness.The photographer now bent over the senseless form of his victim, and
muttering, "Yes, carbon in combustion," added, in a softened tone, "Poor
girl!"As he lifted his face, I detected a solitary tear course down
his impressive features.Sandra moved to the garden."The first I have shed," said he, sternly,
"since my daughter's death."Saying nothing, I could only think
