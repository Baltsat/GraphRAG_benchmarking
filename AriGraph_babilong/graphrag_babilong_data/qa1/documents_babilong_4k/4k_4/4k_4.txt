We read in the chronicles that this fashion
still prevailed after the Spanish conquest; and then by little and
little fell into disuse.Travelers tells us that it is yet in vogue
among many of the tribes in the interior of South America; particularly
those whose names seem to connect with the ancient Caribs or Carians.Du Chaillu asserts that the Ashangos, those of Otamo, the Apossos, the
Fans, and many other tribes of equatorial Africa, consider it a mark of
beauty to file their front teeth in a sharp point.He presents the Fans
as confirmed cannibals.We are told, and the bas-reliefs on Chaacmol's
mausoleum prove it, that the Mayas devoured the hearts of their fallen
enemies.It is said that, on certain grand occasions, after offering the
hearts of their victims to the idols, they abandoned the bodies to the
people, who feasted upon them.But it must be noticed that these
last-mentioned customs seemed to have been introduced in the country by
the Nahualts and Aztecs; since, as yet, we have found nothing in the
mural paintings to cause us to believe that the Mayas indulged in such
barbaric repasts, beyond the eating of their enemies' hearts.The Mayas were, and their descendants are still, confirmed believers in
witchcraft.Sandra moved to the bedroom.In December, last year, being at the hacienda of
X-Kanchacan, where are situated the ruins of the ancient city of
Mayapan, a sick man was brought to me.He came most reluctantly, stating
that he knew what was the matter with him: that he was doomed to die
unless the spell was removed.He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from
malarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of
tapeworm.I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my
advice.The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,
probably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched
him.He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial
distinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an
incredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he
simply replied: "No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me."Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of
Equatorial Africa, says: "The greatest curse of the whole country is the
belief in sorcery or witchcraft.If the African is once possessed with
the belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change.He
becomes suspicious of his dearest friends.He fancies himself sick, and
really often becomes sick through his fears.At least seventy-five per
cent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery."In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards
because of their supposed supernatural powers.From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the
chroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious
libations with _Balche_.To-day the aborigines still use it in the
celebrations of their ancient rites._Balche_ is a liquor made from the
bark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left
to ferment.The nectar drank by
the God of Greek Mythology.Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,
a city in which he resided for some time, says: "Next day he was so much
elated with the improvement in his health that he got tipsy on a
fermented beverage which he had prepared two days before he had fallen
ill, and which he made by _mixing honey and water, and adding to it
pieces of bark of a certain tree_."(Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.)I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find
that the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with
the MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to
be a corruption of MAYAB.The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,
where they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,
men and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief
that their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been
sacrificed.I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the
tombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade
or profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered
round the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend
to suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral.The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died.Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for
they believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it.The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their
villages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is
no longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased.Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of
drums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_.They are still used by the
aborigines in their religious festivals and dances.The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to
leave it about one inch in thickness all round.It is generally about
four feet in length.On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave
between them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches
from the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to
form, as it were, tongues.It is by striking on those tongues with two
balls of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the
instrument is played.The volume of sound produced is so great that it
can be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm
weather.The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the
trunk of a tree.On one end a piece of
skin is tightly stretched.It is by beating on the skin with the hand,
the instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a
slanting position, that it is played.Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case
of danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,
and is heard many miles around.Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of
these _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and
describes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas
as follows: "The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in
diameter at one end, but only seven at the other.The wood was hollowed
out quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly.He would come back year after
year, and study his subject and compile his impressions of the Quarter
in the very atmosphere of the place itself; within a stone's throw of
the Luxembourg Gardens and the Pantheon; near the cafes and the Bullier;
next door, if you please, to the public laundry where his washerwoman
pays a few sous for the privilege of pounding his clothes into holes.It all seemed very real to me, as I sat beside him and watched him at
work.I have similar ideas myself about the
value of his kind of study in out-door sketching, compared with the
labored work of the studio, and I have most positive opinions regarding
the quality which comes of it.If then the pages which here follow have in them any of the true
inwardness of the life they are meant to portray, it is due, I feel
sure, as much to the attitude of the author toward his subject, as much
to his ability to seize, retain, and express these instantaneous
impressions, these flash pictures caught on the spot, as to any other
merit which they may possess.Nothing can be made really _real_ without it.Sandra went back to the garden.F. HOPKINSON SMITH.[Illustration: (city rooftop scene)]

CHAPTER I

IN THE RUE VAUGIRARD


Like a dry brook, its cobblestone bed zigzagging past quaint shops and
cafes, the rue Vaugirard finds its way through the heart of the Latin
Quarter.It is only one in a score of other busy little streets that intersect
the Quartier Latin; but as I live on the rue Vaugirard, or rather just
beside it, up an alley and in the corner of a picturesque old courtyard
leading to the "Lavoir Gabriel," a somewhat angelic name for a huge,
barn-like structure reeking in suds and steam, and noisy with gossiping
washerwomen who pay a few sous a day there for the privilege of doing
their washing--and as my studio windows (the big one with the north
light, and the other one a narrow slit reaching from the floor to the
high ceiling for the taking in of the big canvases one sees at the
Salon--which are never sold) overlook both alley and court, I can see
the life and bustle below.[Illustration: LAVOIR GABRIEL]

This is not the Paris of Boulevards, ablaze with light and thronged with
travelers of the world, nor of big hotels and chic restaurants without
prices on the menus.In the latter the maitre d'hotel makes a mental
inventory of you when you arrive; and before you have reached your
coffee and cigar, or before madame has buttoned her gloves, this
well-shaved, dignified personage has passed sentence on you, and you pay
according to whatever he thinks you cannot afford.I knew a fellow once
who ordered a peach in winter at one of these smart taverns, and was
obliged to wire home for money the next day.In the Quartier Latin the price is always such an important factor that
it is marked plainly, and often the garcon will remind you of the cost
of the dish you select in case you have not read aright, for in this
true Bohemia one's daily fortune is the one necessity so often lacking
that any error in regard to its expenditure is a serious matter.In one of the well-known restaurants--here celebrated as a rendezvous
for artists--a waiter, as he took a certain millionaire's order for
asparagus, said: "Does monsieur know that asparagus costs five francs?"At all times of the day and most of the night the rue Vaugirard is busy.During the morning, push-carts loaded with red gooseberries, green peas,
fresh sardines, and mackerel, their sides shining like silver, line the
curb in front of the small shops.Diminutive donkeys, harnessed to
picturesque two-wheeled carts piled high with vegetables, twitch their
long ears and doze in the shady corners of the street.The gutters,
flushed with clear water, flash in the sunlight.Baskets full of red
roses and white carnations, at a few sous the armful, brighten the cool
shade of the alleys leading to courtyards of wild gardens, many of which
are filled with odd collections of sculpture discarded from the
ateliers.[Illustration: (donkey cart in front of market)]

Old women in linen caps and girls in felt slippers and leather-covered
sabots, market baskets on arm, gossip in groups or hurry along the
narrow sidewalk, stopping at the butcher's or the baker's to buy the
dejeuner.Should you breakfast in your studio and do your own
marketing, you will meet with enough politeness in the buying of a pate,
an artichoke, and a bottle of vin ordinaire, to supply a court welcoming
a distinguished guest.Politeness is second nature to the Parisian--it is the key to one's
daily life here, the oil that makes this finesse of civilization run
smoothly.says the well-to-do proprietor of the tobacco-shop
and cafe to an old woman buying a sou's worth of snuff."Bonjour, monsieur," replies the woman with a nod."Merci, madame," continues the fat patron as he drops the sou into his
till."Merci, monsieur--merci!"and she secretes the package in her netted
reticule, and hobbles out into the sunny street, while the patron
attends to the wants of three draymen who have clambered down from their
heavy carts for a friendly chat and a little vermouth.A polished zinc
bar runs the length of the low-ceilinged room; a narrow, winding
stairway in one corner leads to the living apartments above.Behind the
bar shine three well-polished square mirrors, and ranged in front of
these, each in its zinc rack, are the favorite beverages of the
Quarter--anisette, absinthe, menthe, grenadine--each in zinc-stoppered
bottles, like the ones in the barber-shops.At the end of the little bar a cocher is having his morning tipple, the
black brim of his yellow glazed hat resting on his coarse red ears.He
is in his shirt-sleeves; coat slung over his shoulder, and whip in hand,
he is on the way to get his horse and voiture for the day.To be even a
cocher in Paris is considered a profession.If he dines at six-thirty
and you hail him to take you as he rattles past, he will make his brief
apologies to you without slackening his pace, and go on to his plat du
jour and bottle of wine at his favorite rendezvous, dedicated to "The
Faithful Cocher."An hour later he emerges, well fed, revives his
knee-sprung horse, lights a fresh cigarette, cracks his whip like a
package of torpedoes, and goes clattering off in search of a customer.[Illustration: (rooftop)]

The shops along the rue Vaugirard are marvels of neatness.The
butcher-shop, with its red front, is iron-barred like the lion's cage in
the circus.Inside the cage are some choice specimens of filets, rounds
of beef, death-masks of departed calves, cutlets, and chops in paper
pantalettes.On each article is placed a brass sign with the current
price thereon.A placard outside the butcher's announces an
"Occasion" consisting of a mule and a donkey, both of guaranteed
"premiere qualite."A thick-set, powerfully built
fellow, with blue-black hair, curly like a bull's and shining in pomade,
with fierce mustache of the same dye, waxed to two formidable points
like skewers.Dangling over his white apron, and suspended by a heavy
chain about his waist, he carries the long steel spike which sharpens
his knives.All this paraphernalia gives him a very fierce appearance,
like the executioner in the play; but you will find him a mild, kindly
man after all, who takes his absinthe slowly, with a fund of good humor
after his day's work, and his family to Vincennes on Sundays.The windows, too, of these little shops are studies in decoration.If it
happens to be a problem in eggs, cheese, butter, and milk, all these are
arranged artistically with fresh grape-leaves between the white rows of
milk bottles and under the cheese; often the leaves form a nest for the
white eggs (the fresh ones)--the hard-boiled ones are dyed a bright
crimson.There are china hearts, too, filled with "Double Cream," and
cream in little brown pots; Roquefort cheese and Camembert, Isijny, and
Pont Leveque, and chopped spinach.[Illustration: (overloaded cart of baskets)]

Delicatessen shops display galantines of chicken, the windows banked
with shining cans of sardines and herrings from Dieppe; liver pates and
cre
