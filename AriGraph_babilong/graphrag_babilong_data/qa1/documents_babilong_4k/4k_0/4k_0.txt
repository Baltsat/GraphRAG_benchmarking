    Was right suddenly arrested ere he fired, fired, fired.--
  "Hoots!If you'll excuse the hint, that old thing, with lock of flint,
    As a weapon for _this_ sport can't be admired, mired, mired!"It will not bring down _that_ quarry, your horse-pistol!Don't _you_
        worry!That Royal Stag _we_'ll stalk, boy, in good time, time, time;
  But to pop at it just now, and kick up an awful row,
    Scare, and _miss_ it were a folly, nay a crime, crime, crime!"Be you sure 'Our Party' will this fine quarry track and kill;
    Our guns need not your poor toy blunderbuss, buss, buss.This is not the time or place for a-following up this chase;
    So just clear out and leave this game to us, us, us!"*       *       *       *       *

"AUXILIARY ASSISTANCE" IN THE PROVINCES.(_A Tragedy-Farce in several painful Scenes, with many unpleasant
Situations._)

LOCALITY--_The Interior of Country Place taken for the Shooting Season.Preparations for a feast in all directions.It is Six o' Clock, and the
household are eagerly waiting the appearance of_ MONTAGU MARMADUKE, the
Auxiliary Butler, _sent in by Contract.Enter_ MONTAGU MARMADUKE, _in
comic evening dress._

_Master_ (_looking at_ MONTAGU _with an expression of disappointment on
his face_).What, are _you_ the man they have sent me?And I answers to MONTAGU MARMADUKE, or some gentlemen
prefers to call me by my real name BINKS._Master._ Oh, MONTAGU will do._Mon._ Which I was in service, Sir, with Sir BARNABY JINKS, for
twenty-six years, and----

_Master._ Very well, I daresay you will do.I've been a teetotaler ever since I left Sir
BARNABY'S.And mind, do not murder the names of the guests.[_Exit._

    [_The time goes on, and Company arrive._ MONTAGU _ushers them
    upstairs, and announces them under various aliases._ Sir HENRY
    EISTERFODD _is introduced as_ Sir 'ENERY EASTEREGG, _&c., &c._
    _After small talk, the guests find their way to the dining-room._

_Mon._ (_to_ Principal Guest).Do you take sherry, claret, or 'ock, my
Lady?_Principal Guest_ (_interrupted in a conversation_).[MONTAGU _promptly pours the required liquid on to the table-cloth._

_Master._ I must apologise, but our Butler, who is on trial, is very
short-sighted.[_The wine is brought round;_ MONTAGU _interrupting the conversation
    with his hospitable suggestions, and pouring claret into champagne
    glasses, and champagne into sherries._

_Nervous Guest_ (_in an undertone to_ MONTAGU).Do you think you could
get me, by-and-by, a piece of bread?_Mon._ Bread, Sir, yessir!(_In stentorian tones._) Here, NISBET, bring
this gent some bread![_The unfortunate guest, who is overcome with confusion at having
    attracted so much attention, is waited upon by_ NISBET.When I was with Sir BARNABY----
(_Disappears murmuring to himself, and returns with entree, which he
lets fall on dress of_ Principal Guest).Beg pardon, my Lady, but it was
my stud, which _would_ come undone.Very sorry, indeed, Mum, but if you
will allow me----

    [_Produces a soiled dinner-napkin with a flourish._

_P.[_General commiseration, and, a little later, disappearance of
    ladies.After this,_ MONTAGU _does not reappear except to call
    obtrusively for carriages, and tout for tips._

_P.Guest_ (_on bidding her host good-night_).I can assure you my gown
was not injured in the least.I am quite sure it was only an accident.Mary travelled to the bathroom.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.(_With great severity._) As a
matter of fact, the man only came to us this afternoon, but, after what
has happened, he shall not remain in my service another hour!I shall
dismiss him to-night!Master _pays_ MONTAGU _the agreed fee for
    his services for the evening.Curtain._

TO A PHILANTHROPIST.You ask me, Madam, if by chance we meet,
  For money just to keep upon its feet
  That hospital, that school, or that retreat,
                              That home.My doctor's fee
  Absorbs too much.I cannot be
  An inmate there myself; he comes to me
                              At home.Do not suppose I have too close a fist.Rent, rates, bills, taxes, make a fearful list;
  I should be homeless if I did assist
                              That home.I must--it is my impecunious lot--
  Economise the little I have got;
  So if I see you coming I am "not
                              At home."How I should be dunned
  By tailor, hatter, hosier, whom I've shunned,
  If I supported that school clothing fund,
                              That home!I'd help if folks wore nothing but their skins;
  This hat, this coat, at which the street-boy grins,
  Remind me still that "Charity begins

"that statue."_)

"You really must join the Army," said the stern old Puritan to the Lord
Protector."The fate of this fair realm of England depends upon the
promptness with which you assume command."He had laid aside his buff doublet, and had
donned a coat of a thinner material.His sword also was gone, and
hanging by his side was a pair of double spy-glasses--new in those
days--new in very deed.Sandra went to the garden."I cannot go," cried the Lord Protector at last, "it would be too great
a sacrifice.""You said not that," pursued IRETON--for it was he--"when you called
upon CHARLES to lose his head.""But in this case, good sooth, I would wish a head to be won, or the
victory to be by a head;" and then the Uncrowned King laughed long and
heartily, as was his wont when some jest tickled him."This is no matter for merriment," exclaimed IRETON sternly."OLIVER,
you are playing the fool.You are sacrificing for pleasure, business,
duty.""Well, I cannot help it," was the response."But mind you, IRETON, it
shall be the last time.""What is it that attracts you so strongly?What is the pleasure that
lures you away from the path of duty?""I will tell you, and then you will pity, perchance forgive me.To-day
my horse runs at Epsom.Then the two old friends grasped hands and parted.Sandra travelled to the bedroom.One went
to fight on the blood-stained field of battle, and the other to see the
race for the Derby.*       *       *       *       *

  When man will lose his legs, ill-slung,
    Through trams, cars, cabs, and coaches;
  Or that those nether limbs will be
    The merest of survivals.The thought fills TIMBERTOES with glee,
    No more he'll fear his rivals."Without these bulky, blundering pegs
    I shall not fail to score,

    He _can't_ get 'leg-before.'"*       *       *       *       *

SITTING ON OUR SENATE.SIR,--It struck me that the best and simplest way of finding out what
were the intentions of the Government with regard to the veto of the
Peers was to write and ask each individual Member his opinion on the
subject.Accordingly I have done so, and it seems to me that there is a
vast amount of significance in the nature of the replies I have
received, to anyone capable of reading between the lines; or, as most of
the communications only extended to a single line, let us say to anyone
capable of reading beyond the full-stop.Lord ROSEBERY'S Secretary, for
example, writes that "the Prime Minister is at present out of town"--_at
present_, you see, but obviously on the point of coming back, in order
to grapple with my letter and the question generally.Daniel moved to the garden.Sir WILLIAM
HARCOURT, his Secretary, writes, "is at Wiesbaden, but upon his return
your communication will no doubt receive his attention"--_receive his
attention_, an ominous phrase for the Peers, who seem hardly to realise
that between them and ruin there is only the distance from Wiesbaden to
Downing Street.MORLEY "sees no reason to alter his published
opinion on the subject"--_alter_, how readily, by the prefixing of a
single letter, that word becomes _halter_!I was unable to effect
personal service of my letter on the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, possibly because
I called at his chambers during the Long Vacation; but the fact that a
card should have been attached to his door bearing the words "Back at 2
P.M."surely indicates that Sir JOHN RIGBY will _back up_ his leaders in
any approaching attack on the fortress of feudalism!Then surely the
circumstance that the other Ministers to whom my letters were addressed
_have not as yet sent any answer_ shows how seriously they regard the
situation, and how disinclined they are to commit themselves to a too
hasty reply!In fact, the outlook for the House of Lords, judging from
these Ministerial communications, is decidedly gloomy, and I am inclined
to think that an Autumn Session devoted to abolishing it is a most
probable eventuality.Yours,

  FUSSY-CUSS EXSPECTANS.SIR,--The real way of dealing with the Lords is as follows.The next
time that they want to meet, cut off their gas and water!Tell the
butcher and baker _not_ to call at the House for orders, and dismiss the
charwomen who dust their bloated benches.If _this_ doesn't bring them
to reason, nothing will.HIGH-MINDED DEMOCRAT.*       *       *       *       *
