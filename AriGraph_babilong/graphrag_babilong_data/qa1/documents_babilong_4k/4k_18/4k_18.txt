Mary moved to the bathroom.The delicate nerves of
sight felt a sharp pain, and begged to have the pupils made as small as
possible and the eyelid curtains put down.They were trying to see which would bear
it the longest.Great harm was done to the brains as well as eyes of
both these boys.The one who looked longest at the sun died in
consequence of his foolish act.The second story is about a little boy who tried to turn his eyes to
imitate a schoolmate who was cross-eyed.He turned them; but he could
not turn them back again.Although he is now a gentleman more than fifty
years old and has had much painful work done upon his eyes, the doctors
have never been able to set them quite right.You see from the first story, that you must be careful not to give your
eyes too much light.But you must also be sure to give them light
enough.When one tries to read in the twilight, the little nerve of sight says:
"Give me more light; I am hurt, by trying to see in the dark."If you should kill these delicate nerves, no others would ever grow in
place of them, and you would never be able to see again.What you call your ears are only pieces of gristle, so curved as to
catch the sounds and pass them along to the true ears.These are deeper
in the head, where the nerve of hearing is waiting to send an account
of each sound to the brain.The ear nerve is in less danger than that of the eye.Careless children
sometimes put pins into their ears and so break the "drum."That is a
very bad thing to do.Use only a soft towel in washing your ears.You
should never put any thing hard or sharp into them.I must tell you a short ear story, about my father, when he was a small
boy.One day, when playing on the floor, he laid his ear to the crack of the
door, to feel the wind blow into it.He was so young that he did not
know it was wrong; but the next day he had the earache severely.Although he lived to be an old man, he often had the earache.He thought
it began from the time when the wind blew into his ear from under that
door.ALCOHOL AND THE SENSES.All this fine work of touching, tasting, seeing, smelling, and hearing,
is nerve work.The man who is in the habit of using alcoholic drinks can not touch,
taste, see, smell, or hear so well as he ought.Daniel journeyed to the bathroom.His hands tremble, his
speech is sometimes thick, and often he can not walk straight.Sometimes, he thinks he sees things when he does not, because his poor
nerves are so confused by alcohol that they can not do their work.Answer now for your taste, smell, and touch, and also for your sight and
hearing; should their beautiful work be spoiled by alcohol?Where should the light be for reading or
          studying?Tell the story of the boys who looked at the
          sun.Tell the story of the boy who made himself
          cross-eyed.What would be the result, if you should kill
          the nerves of sight?Tell the story of the boy who injured his ear.How is the work of the senses affected by
          drinking liquor?"[Illustration: M]Y thick, warm clothes make me warm," says some child.Take a brisk run, and your blood will flow faster and you will be warm
very quickly.On a cold day, the teamster claps his hands and swings his arms to make
his blood flow quickly and warm him.Every child knows that he is warm inside; for if his fingers are cold,
he puts them into his mouth to warm them.If you should put a little thermometer into your mouth, or under your
tongue, the mercury (m[~e]r'ku r[)y]) would rise as high as it does out
of doors on a hot, summer day.This would be the same in summer or winter, in a warm country or a cold
one, if you were well and the work of your body was going on steadily.Some of the work which is all the time going on inside your body, makes
this heat.The blood is thus warmed, and then it carries the heat to every part of
the body.The faster the blood flows, the more heat it brings, and the
warmer we feel.In children, the heart pumps from eighty to ninety times a minute.This is faster than it works in old people, and this is one reason why
children are generally much warmer than old people.You may breathe in cold air; but that which you breathe out is warm.A
great deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off
through your skin, into the cooler air about you.For this reason, a
room full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty.We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to
prevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much
heat in that way.Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear.You know, however, that woolen under-garments
keep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be
worn in cold weather.Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they
are not safe for winter wear, even at a party.A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the
season, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and
handsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort.When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible.This will make the hot
blood flow all through your body and warm it.If you can not, you should
put on more clothes, go to a warm room, in some way get warm and keep
warm, or the cold will make you sick.If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths of the perspiration tubes are
sometimes closed and can not throw out the waste matter.Then, if one
part fails to do its work, other parts must suffer.Perhaps the inside
skin becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs, and you have a cold, or
a cough.People used to think that nothing would warm one so well on a cold day,
as a glass of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink.It is true that, if a person drinks a little alcohol, he will feel a
burning in the throat, and presently a glowing heat on the skin.The alcohol has made the hot blood rush into the tiny tubes near the
skin, and he thinks it has warmed him.But if all this heat comes to the skin, the cold air has a chance to
carry away more than usual.In a very little time, the drinker will be
colder than before.Perhaps he will not know it; for the cheating
alcohol will have deadened his nerves so that they send no message to
the brain.Then he may not have sense enough to put on more clothing and
may freeze.He may even, if it is very cold, freeze to death.People, who have not been drinking alcohol are sometimes frozen; but
they would have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it.Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers have a hard time on a cold winter
day.They are often cheated into thinking that alcohol will keep them
warm; but doctors have learned that it is the water-drinkers who hold
out best against the cold.Alcohol can not really keep a person warm.All children are interested in stories about Arctic explorers, whose
ships get frozen into great ice-fields, who travel on sledges drawn by
dogs, and sometimes live in Esquimau huts, and drink oil, and eat walrus
meat.These men tell us that alcohol will not keep them warm, and you know
why.The hunters and trappers in the snowy regions of the Rocky Mountains say
the same thing.Alcohol not only can not keep them warm; but it lessens
their power to resist cold.[Illustration: _Scene in the Arctic regions._]

Many of you have heard about the Greely party who were brought home from
the Arctic seas, after they had been starving and freezing for many
months.Seven were
found alive by their rescuers; one of these died soon afterward.The
first man who died, was the only one of the party who had ever been a
drunkard.Of the nineteen who died, all but one used tobacco.Of the six now
living,--four never used tobacco at all; and the other two, very seldom.The tobacco was no real help to them in time of trouble.It had probably
weakened their stomachs, so that they could not make the best use of
such poor food as they had.Why do you wear thick clothes in cold weather?How can you prove that you are warm inside?How can you warm yourself without going to the
          fire?How does it cheat you into thinking that you
          will be warmer for drinking it?What do the people who travel in very cold
          countries, tell us about the use of alcohol?John went back to the hallway.How did tobacco affect the men who went to the
          Arctic seas with Lieutenant Greely?[Illustration: N]OW that you have learned about your bodies, and what
alcohol will do to them, you ought also to know that alcohol costs a
great deal of money.Money spent for that which will do no good, but
only harm, is certainly wasted, and worse than wasted.If a boy or a girl save ten cents a week, it will take ten weeks to save
a dollar.You can all think of many good and pleasant ways to spend a dollar.What
would the beer-drinker do with it?If he takes two mugs of beer a day,
the dollar will be used up in ten days.But we ought not to say used,
because that word will make us think it was spent usefully.We will say,
instead, the dollar will be wasted, in ten days.If he spends it for wine or whiskey, it will go sooner, as these cost
more.If no money was spent for liquor in this country, people would not
so often be sick, or poor, or bad, or wretched.We should not need so
many policemen, and jails, and prisons, as we have now.If no liquor was
drunk, men, women, and children would be better and happier.Most of you have a little money of your own.Perhaps you earned a part,
or the whole of it, yourselves.Sandra journeyed to the garden.You are planning what to do with it, and
that is a very pleasant kind of planning.Daniel journeyed to the garden.Do you think it would be wise to make a dollar bill into a tight little
roll, light one end of it with a match, and then let it slowly burn up?Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.(_See Frontispiece._)

Yes!It would be worse than wasted,
if, while burning, it should also hurt the person who held it.Sandra travelled to the hallway.If you
should buy cigars or tobacco with your dollar, and smoke them, you could
soon burn up the dollar and hurt yourselves besides.Then, when you begin to have some idea how much six
hundred millions is, remember that six hundred million dollars are spent
in this country every year for tobacco--burned up--wasted--worse than
wasted.Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco instead of corn, did any
good to the world by the change?Sandra journeyed to the kitchen.How does the liquor-drinker spend his money?What could we do, if no money was spent for
          liquor?Tell two ways in which you could burn up a
          dollar bill.How much money is spent for tobacco, yearly, in
          this country?*       *       *       *       *

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.All this must precede any attempt
to turn.The turning of the Boston is simplicity itself, but it is, nevertheless,
the one point in the instruction which is most bothersome to
learners.The turn is executed upon the ball of _the supporting foot_,
and consists in twisting half round without lifting either foot from the
ground.In this, the weight is held altogether upon the supporting foot,
and there is no crossing.In carrying the foot forward for the second movement, the knees must
pass close to one another, and care must be taken that _the entire half
turn comes upon the last count of the measure_.To sum up:--

Starting with the weight upon the left foot, step forward, placing the
entire weight upon the right foot, as in the illustration facing page 14
(count 1); swing left leg quickly forward, straightening the left knee
and raising the right heel, and touch the floor with the extended left
foot as in the illustration facing page 16, but without placing any
weight upon that foot (count 2); execute a half-turn to the left,
backward, upon the ball of the supporting (right) foot, at the same time
lowering the right heel, and finish as in the illustration opposite page
18 (count 3).[Illustration]

Starting again, this time with the weight wholly upon the right foot,
and with the left leg extended backward, and the point of the left foot
lightly touching the floor, step backward, throwing the weight entirely
upon the left foot which sinks to a position flat upon the floor, as
shown in the illustration facing page 21, (count 4); carry the right
foot quickly backward, and touch with the point as far back as possible
upon the line of direction without dividing the weight, at the same time
raising the left heel as in the illustration facing page 22, (count 5);
and complete the rotation by executing a half-turn to the right,
forward, upon the ball of the left foot, simultaneously lowering the
left heel, and finishing as in the illustration facing page 24, (count
6).THE REVERSE

The reverse of the step should be acquired at the same time as the
rotation to the right, and it is, therefore, of great importance to
alternate from the right to the left rotation from the beginning of the
turning exercise.The reverse itself, that is to say, the act of
alternating is effected in a single measure without turning (see
preparatory exercise, page 13) which may be taken backward by the
gentleman and forward by the lady, whenever they have completed a whole
turn.The mechanism of the reverse turn is exactly the same as that of the
turn to the right, except that it is accomplished with the other foot,
and in the opposite direction.There is no better or more efficacious exercise to perfect the Boston,
than that which is made up of one complete turn to the right, a measure
to reverse, and a complete turn to the left.This should be practised
until one has entirely mastered the motion and rhythm of the dance.The
writer has used this exercise in all his work, and finds it not only
helpful and interesting to the pupil, but of special advantage in
obviating the possibility of dizziness, and the consequent
unpleasantness and loss of time.[Illustration]

After acquiring a degree of ease in the execution of these movements to
Mazurka music, it is advisable to vary the rhythm by the introduction of
Spanish or other clearly accented Waltz music, before using the more
liquid compositions of Strauss or such modern song waltzes as those of
Danglas, Sinibaldi, etc.It is one of the remarkable features of the Boston that the weight is
always opposite the line of direction--that is to say, in going forward,
the weight is retained upon the rear foot, and in going backward, the
weight is always upon the front foot (direction always radiates from the
dancer).Thus, in proceeding around the room, the weight must always be
held back, instead
