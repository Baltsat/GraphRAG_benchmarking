The confidence of the Glen--and tributary states--was unbounded, and
rested partly on long experience of the doctor's resources, and partly
on his hereditary connection."His father was here afore him," Mrs.Macfadyen used to explain; "atween
them they've hed the countyside for weel on tae a century; if MacLure
disna understand oor constitution, wha dis, a' wud like tae ask?"For Drumtochty had its own constitution and a special throat disease, as
became a parish which was quite self-contained between the woods and the
hills, and not dependent on the lowlands either for its diseases or its
doctors."He's a skilly man, Doctor MacLure," continued my friend Mrs.Macfayden,
whose judgment on sermons or anything else was seldom at fault; "an'
a kind-hearted, though o' coorse he hes his faults like us a', an' he
disna tribble the Kirk often."He aye can tell what's wrang wi' a body, an' maistly he can put ye
richt, and there's nae new-fangled wys wi' him: a blister for the
ootside an' Epsom salts for the inside dis his wark, an' they say
there's no an herb on the hills he disna ken."If we're tae dee, we're tae dee; an' if we're tae live, we're tae live,"
concluded Elspeth, with sound Calvinistic logic; "but a'll say this
for the doctor, that whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a
sharp meisture on the skin.""But he's no veera ceevil gin ye bring him when there's naethin' wrang,"
and Mrs.Macfayden's face reflected another of Mr.Hopps' misadventures
of which Hillocks held the copyright."Hopps' laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they hed to sit up a'
nicht wi' him, an' naethin' wud do but they maun hae the doctor, an' he
writes 'immediately' on a slip o' paper."Weel, MacLure had been awa a' nicht wi' a shepherd's wife Dunleith wy,
and he comes here withoot drawin' bridle, mud up tae the cen."'What's a dae here, Hillocks?"he cries; 'it's no an accident, is't?'and when he got aff his horse he cud hardly stand wi' stiffness and
tire."'It's nane o' us, doctor; it's Hopps' laddie; he's been eatin' ower
mony berries.'[Illustration: "HOPPS' LADDIE ATE GROSARTS"]

"If he didna turn on me like a tiger."<DW37> ye mean tae say----'

"'Weesht, weesht,' an' I tried tae quiet him, for Hopps wes comin' oot."'Well, doctor,' begins he, as brisk as a magpie, 'you're here at last;
there's no hurry with you Scotchmen.My boy has been sick all night, and
I've never had one wink of sleep.You might have come a little quicker,
that's all I've got to say.'"We've mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend tae every bairn that hes a
sair stomach,' and a' saw MacLure wes roosed.Our doctor at home always says to
Mrs.'Opps "Look on me as a family friend, Mrs.'Opps, and send for me
though it be only a headache."'"'He'd be mair sparin' o' his offers if he hed four and twenty mile tae
look aifter.There's naethin' wrang wi' yir laddie but greed.Gie him a
gude dose o' castor oil and stop his meat for a day, an' he 'ill be a'
richt the morn.'"'He 'ill not take castor oil, doctor.We have given up those barbarous
medicines.'"'Whatna kind o' medicines hae ye noo in the Sooth?'MacLure, we're homoeopathists, and I've my little
chest here,' and oot Hopps comes wi' his boxy."'Let's see't,' an' MacLure sits doon and taks oot the bit bottles, and
he reads the names wi' a lauch every time."'Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like?Weel, ma mannie,' he says tae Hopps, 'it's a fine
ploy, and ye 'ill better gang on wi' the Nux till it's dune, and gie him
ony ither o' the sweeties he fancies."'Noo, Hillocks, a' maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh's grieve, for he's
doon wi' the fever, and it's tae be a teuch fecht.A' hinna time tae
wait for dinner; gie me some cheese an' cake in ma haund, and Jess 'ill
tak a pail o' meal an' water."'Fee; a'm no wantin' yir fees, man; wi' that boxy ye dinna need a
doctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae some puir body, Maister Hopps,' an'
he was doon the road as hard as he cud lick."His fees were pretty much what the folk chose to give him, and he
collected them once a year at Kildrummie fair."Well, doctor, what am a' awin' ye for the wife and bairn?Ye 'ill need
three notes for that nicht ye stayed in the hoose an' a' the veesits.""Havers," MacLure would answer, "prices are low, a'm hearing; gie's
thirty shillings.""No, a'll no, or the wife 'ill tak ma ears off," and it was settled for
two pounds.Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields, and one
way or other, Drumsheugh told me, the doctor might get in about L150.a year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper's wages and a
boy's, and keep two horses, besides the cost of instruments and books,
which he bought through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.There was only one man who ever complained of the doctor's charges, and
that was the new farmer of Milton, who was so good that he was above
both churches, and held a meeting in his barn.(It was Milton the Glen
supposed at first to be a Mormon, but I can't go into that now.)He
offered MacLure a pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon
MacLure expressed his opinion of Milton, both from a theological and
social standpoint, with such vigor and frankness that an attentive
audience of Drumtochty men could hardly contain themselves.Sandra went to the hallway.Jamie Soutar
was selling his pig at the time, and missed the meeting, but he hastened
to condole with Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the doctor's
language.[Illustration]

"Ye did richt tae resist him; it 'ill maybe roose the Glen tae mak a
stand; he fair hands them in bondage."Thirty shillings for twal veesits, and him no mair than seeven mile
awa, an' a'm telt there werena mair than four at nicht."Ye 'ill hae the sympathy o' the Glen, for a' body kens yir as free wi'
yir siller as yir tracts."Wes't 'Beware o' gude warks' ye offered him?Man, ye choose it weel,
for he's been colleckin' sae mony thae forty years, a'm feared for him."A've often thocht oor doctor's little better than the Gude Samaritan,
an' the Pharisees didna think muckle o' his chance aither in this warld
or that which is tae come."Heinsius and other Commentators think
that this line and the next are spurious.The story of Cephalus
and Procris is related at the close of the Seventh Book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 201: The Moon gave.--Ver.Ovid says that Diana sent the
sleep upon Endymion, whereas it was Jupiter who did so, as a punishment
for his passion for Juno; he alludes to the youthfulness of the favorite
of Diana, antithetically to the old age of Tithonus, the husband of
Aurora.][Footnote 202: Two nights together.--Ver.When he slept with
Acmena, under the form of her husband Amphion.][Footnote 203: Doctoring your hair.--Ver.Among the ancient Greeks,
black hair was the most frequent, but that of a blonde colour was most
valued.It was not uncommon with them to dye it when turning grey, so as
to make it a black or blonde colour, according to the requirement of the
case.Blonde hair was much esteemed by the Romans, and the ladies were
in the habit of washing their hair with a composition to make it of this
colour.This was called'spuma caustica,' or, 'caustic soap,' wich was
first used by the Gauls and Germans; from its name, it was probably the
substance which had been used inthe present instance.][Footnote 204: So far as ever.--Ver.By this he means as low as her
ancles.][Footnote 205: Afraid to dress.--Ver.He means to say, that it was
so fine that she did not dare to curl it, for fear of injuring it.][Footnote 206: Just like the veils.--Ver.Burmann thinks that
'fila,' 'threads,' is better here than'vela,' and that it is the
correct reading.The swarthy Seres here mentioned, were perhaps the
Chinese, who probably began to import their silks into Rome about this
period.The mode of producing silk does not seem to have been known to
Virgil, who speaks, in the Second Book of the Georgies, of the Seres
combing it off the leaves of trees.Pliny also, in his Sixth Book, gives
the same account.Ovid, however, seems to refer to silkworms under the
name of 'agrestes tineæ,' in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 208: Neither the bodkin.--Ver.This was the
'discerniculum,' a 'bodkin,' which was used in parting the hair.][Footnote 210: Bid the bodkin.--Ver.The 'acus' here mentioned, was
probably the 'discemicirium,' and not the 'crinale,' or hair-pin that
was worn in the hair; as the latter was worn when the hair was bound up
at the back of the head; whereas, judging from the length of the hair
of his mistress, she most probably wore it in ringlets.He says that
he never saw her snatch up the bodkin and stick it in the arm of the
'ornatrix.'][Footnote 211: Iron and the fire.--Ver.He alludes to the
unnecessary application of the curling-iron to hair which naturally
curled so well.][Footnote 212: The very locks instruct.--Ver.Because they
naturally assume as advantageous an appearance as the bodkin could
possibly give them, when arranged with the utmost skill.][Footnote 213: Dione is painted.--Ver.4,
mentions a painting, by Apelles, in which Venus was represented as
rising from the sea.It was placed, by Augustus, in the temple of Julius
Caesar; and the lower part having become decayed, no one could be found
of sufficient ability to repair it.][Footnote 214: Lay down the mirror.--Ver.The mirror was usually
held by the 'ornatrix,' while her mistress arranged her hair.][Footnote 215: Herbs of a rival.--Ver.Daniel went back to the kitchen.No person would be more
likely than the 'pellex,' or concubine, to resort to charms and drugs,
for the purpose of destroying the good looks of the married woman whose
husband she wishes to retain.][Footnote 216: All bad omens.--Ver.So superstitious were the
Romans, that the very mention of death, or disease, was deemed ominous
of ill.][Footnote 217: Germany will be sending.--Ver 45.Germany having been
lately conquered by the arms of Augustus, he says that she must wear
false hair, taken from the German captives.It was the custom to cut
short the locks of the captives, and the German women were famed for the
beauty of their hair.][Footnote 218: Sygambrian girl.--Ver.The Sygambri were a people of
Ger many, living on the banks of the rivers Lippe and Weser.]Mary travelled to the garden.John moved to the garden.[Footnote 219: For that spot.--Ver.She carries a lock of the hair,
which had fallen off, in her bosom.][Footnote 221: My tongue for hire.--Ver.Although the 'patronus
pleaded the cause of the 'cliens,' without reward, still, by the use of
the word 'pros-tituisse,' Ovid implies that the services of the advocate
were often sold at a price.It must be remembered, that Ovid had been
educated for the Roman bar, which he had left in disgust.][Footnote 222: Mæonian bard.--Ver.Strabo says, that Homer was a
native of Smyrna, which was a city of Maeonia, a province of Phrygia.But Plutarch says, that he was called 'Maeonius,' from Maeon, a king of
Lydia, who adopted him as his son.][Footnote 223: Tenedos and Ida.--Ver.Tenedos, Ida, and Simois,
were the scenes of some portions of the Homeric narrative.The first was
near Troy, in sight of it, as Virgil says--'est in conspectu Tenedos.'][Footnote 224: The Ascræan, tool--Ver.Hesiod of Ascræa, in
Boeotia, wrote chieflv upon agricultural subjects.See the Pontic
Epistles, Book iv.[Footnote 225: With its juices.--Ver.The'mustum' was the pure
jidcc of the grape before it was boiled down and became'sapa,'
or 'defrutum.'779, and the Note to the
passage.][Footnote 226: The son of Battus.--Ver.As to the poet Callimachus,
the son of Battus, see the Tristia, Book ii.[Footnote 227: To the tragic buskin.--Ver.On the 'cothurnus,' or
'buskin,' see the Tristia, Book ii.Sophocles was one of the most famous of the Athenian Tragedians.He is
supposed to have composed more than one hundred and twenty tragedies, of
which only seven are remaining.]Aratus was a Greek poet, a native of
Cilicia, in Asia Minor.John went to the bathroom.He wrote some astronomical poems, of which one,
called 'Phænomena,' still exists.His style is condemned by Quintilian,
although it is here praised by Ovid.His 'Phænomena' was translated into
Latin by Cicero, Germanicus Caesar, and Sextus Avienus.][Footnote 229: The deceitful slave.--Ver.Although the plays of
Menander have perished, we can judge from Terence and Plautus, how well
he depicted the craftiness of the slave, the severity of the father, the
dishonesty of the procuress, and the wheedling ways of the courtesan.Four of the plays of Terence are translations from Menander.John went to the garden.See the
Tristia, Book ii.[Footnote 230: Ennius.--Ver.Quintus Ennius was a Latin poet, a
Calabrian by birth.The
few fragments of his works that remain, show the ruggedness and uncouth
