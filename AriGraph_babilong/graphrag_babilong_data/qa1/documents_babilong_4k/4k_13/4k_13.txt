First Elegy of this Book.][Footnote 461: Pelignian land.--Ver.It consists
of a gourd or of the Cuddos nut, hollowed, into which two pipes are
inserted.The _poongi_ therefore somewhat resembles in appearance a
bagpipe.It is generally used by the _Sampuris_ or snake charmers,
who play upon it when they exhibit the antics of the cobra.The name
_magoudi_, given in certain districts to this instrument, rather
tends to corroborate the opinion of some musical historians that the
_magadis_ of the ancient Greeks was a sort of double-pipe, or bagpipe.Many instruments of Hindustan are known by different names in different
districts; and, besides, there are varieties of them.On the whole, the
Hindus possess about fifty instruments.To describe them properly would
fill a volume.Some, which are in the Kensington museum, will be found
noticed in the large catalogue of that collection.THE PERSIANS AND ARABS.Of the musical instruments of the ancient Persians, before the
Christian era, scarcely anything is known.It may be surmised that they
closely resembled those of the Assyrians, and probably also those of
the Hebrews.[Illustration]

The harp, _chang_, in olden time a favourite instrument of the
Persians, has gradually fallen into desuetude.The illustration of a
small harp given in the woodcut has been sketched from the celebrated
sculptures, perhaps of the sixth century, which exist on a stupendous
rock, called Tackt-i-Bostan, in the vicinity of the town of Kermanshah.These sculptures are said to have been executed during the lifetime
of the Persian monarch Khosroo Purviz.They form the ornaments of
two lofty arches, and consist of representations of field sports
and aquatic amusements.John went back to the bedroom.In one of the boats is seated a man in an
ornamental dress, with a halo round his head, who is receiving an
arrow from one of his attendants; while a female, who is sitting
near him, plays on a Trigonon.Towards the top of the bas-relief
is represented a stage, on which are performers on small straight
trumpets and little hand drums; six harpers; and four other musicians,
apparently females,--the first of whom plays a flute; the second,
a sort of pandean pipe; the third, an instrument which is too much
defaced to be recognizable; and the fourth, a bagpipe.Two harps of a
peculiar shape were copied by Sir Gore Ousely from Persian manuscripts
about four hundred years old resembling, in the principle on which they
are constructed, all other oriental harps.There existed evidently
various kinds of the _chang_.It may be remarked here that the
instrument _tschenk_ (or _chang_) in use at the present day in Persia,
is more like a dulcimer than a harp.The Arabs adopted the harp from
the Persians, and called it _junk_.An interesting representation of a
Turkish woman playing the harp (p.53) sketched from life by Melchior
Lorich in the seventeenth century, probably exhibits an old Persian
_chang_; for the Turks derived their music principally from Persia.Here we have an introduction into Europe of the oriental frame without
a front pillar.[Illustration]

The Persians appear to have adopted, at an early period, smaller
musical intervals than semitones.When the Arabs conquered Persia (A.D.641) the Persians had already attained a higher degree of civilisation
than their conquerors.The latter found in Persia the cultivation of
music considerably in advance of their own, and the musical instruments
superior also.They soon adopted the Persian instruments, and there
can be no doubt that the musical system exhibited by the earliest
Arab writers whose works on the theory of music have been preserved
was based upon an older system of the Persians.In these works the
octave is divided in seventeen _one-third-tones_--intervals which are
still made use of in the east.Some of the Arabian instruments are
constructed so as to enable the performer to produce the intervals
with exactness.The frets on the lute and tamboura, for instance, are
regulated with a view to this object.[Illustration]

The Arabs had to some extent become acquainted with many of the
Persian instruments before the time of their conquest of Persia.An
Arab musician of the name of Nadr Ben el-Hares Ben Kelde is recorded
as having been sent to the Persian king Khosroo Purviz, in the sixth
century, for the purpose of learning Persian singing and performing
on the lute.Through him, it is said, the lute was brought to Mekka.Saib Chatir, the son of a Persian, is spoken of as the first performer
on the lute in Medina, A.D.682; and of an Arab lutist, Ebn Soreidsch
from Mekka, A.D.683, it is especially mentioned that he played in the
Persian style; evidently the superior one.The lute, _el-oud_, had
before the tenth century only four strings, or four pairs producing
four tones, each tone having two strings tuned in unison.About the
tenth century a string for a fifth tone was added.The strings were
made of silk neatly twisted.The neck of the instrument was provided
with frets of string, which were carefully regulated according to
the system of seventeen intervals in the compass of an octave before
mentioned.Other favourite stringed instruments were the _tamboura_,
a kind of lute with a long neck, and the _kanoon_, a kind of dulcimer
strung with lamb’s gut strings (generally three in unison for each
tone) and played upon with two little plectra which the performer had
fastened to his fingers.The _kanoon_ is likewise still in use in
countries inhabited by Mahomedans.Mary travelled to the garden.The engraving, taken from a Persian
painting at Teheran, represents an old Persian _santir_, the prototype
of our dulcimer, mounted with wire strings and played upon with two
slightly curved sticks.[Illustration]

Al-Farabi, one of the earliest Arabian musical theorists known, who
lived in the beginning of the tenth century, does not allude to the
fiddle-bow.This is noteworthy inasmuch as it seems in some measure
to support the opinion maintained by some historians that the bow
originated in England or Wales.Unfortunately we possess no exact
descriptions of the Persian and Arabian instruments between the tenth
and fourteenth centuries, otherwise we should probably have earlier
accounts of some instrument of the violin kind in Persia.Ash-shakandi,
who lived in Spain about A.D.1200, mentions the _rebab_, which may
have been in use for centuries without having been thought worthy of
notice on account of its rudeness.Persian writers of the fourteenth
century speak of two instruments of the violin class, viz., the _rebab_
and the _kemangeh_.As regards the _kemangeh_, the Arabs themselves
assert that they obtained it from Persia, and their statement appears
all the more worthy of belief from the fact that both names, _rebab_
and _kemangeh_, are originally Persian.We engrave the _rebab_ from an
example at South Kensington.[Illustration]

The _nay_, a flute, and the _surnay_, a species of oboe, are still
popular in the east.The Arabs must have been indefatigable constructors of musical
instruments.Kiesewetter gives a list of above two hundred names of
Arabian instruments, and this does not include many known to us through
Spanish historians.A careful investigation of the musical instruments
of the Arabs during their sojourn in Spain is particularly interesting
to the student of mediæval music, inasmuch as it reveals the eastern
origin of many instruments which are generally regarded as European
inventions.Introduced into Spain by the Saracens and the Moors they
were gradually diffused towards northern Europe.The English, for
instance, adopted not only the Moorish dance (morrice dance) but also
the _kuitra_ (gittern), the _el-oud_ (lute), the _rebab_ (rebec), the
_nakkarah_ (naker), and several others.In an old Cornish sacred drama,
supposed to date from the fourteenth century, we have in an enumeration
of musical instruments the _nakrys_, designating “kettle-drums.” It
must be remembered that the Cornish language, which has now become
obsolete, was nearly akin to the Welsh.Indeed, names of musical
instruments derived from the Moors in Spain occur in almost every
European language.Not a few fanciful stories are traditionally preserved among the Arabs
testifying to the wonderful effects they ascribed to the power of their
instrumental performances.Al-Farabi had
acquired his proficiency in Spain, in one of the schools at Cordova
which flourished as early as towards the end of the ninth century: and
his reputation became so great that ultimately it extended to Asia.The mighty caliph of Bagdad himself desired to hear the celebrated
musician, and sent messengers to Spain with instructions to offer rich
presents to him and to convey him to the court.But Al-Farabi feared
that if he went he should be retained in Asia, and should never again
see the home to which he felt deeply attached.Mary went back to the office.At last he resolved
to disguise himself, and ventured to undertake the journey which
promised him a rich harvest.Dressed in a mean costume, he made his
appearance at the court just at the time when the caliph was being
entertained with his daily concert.Al-Farabi, unknown to everyone, was
permitted to exhibit his skill on the lute.Scarcer had he commenced
his performance in a certain musical mode when he set all his audience
laughing aloud, notwithstanding the efforts of the courtiers to
suppress so unbecoming an exhibition of mirth in the royal presence.In
truth, even the caliph himself was compelled to burst out into a fit
of laughter.Presently the performer changed to another mode, and the
effect was that immediately all his hearers began to sigh, and soon
tears of sadness replaced the previous tears of mirth.Again he played
in another mode, which excited his audience to such a rage that they
would have fought each other if he, seeing the danger, had not directly
gone over to an appeasing mode.Sandra moved to the bedroom.After this wonderful exhibition of his
skill Al-Farabi concluded in a mode which had the effect of making
his listeners fall into a profound sleep, during which he took his
departure.It will be seen that this incident is almost identical with one
recorded as having happened about twelve hundred years earlier at the
court of Alexander the great, and which forms the subject of Dryden’s
“Alexander’s Feast.” The distinguished flutist Timotheus successively
aroused and subdued different passions by changing the musical modes
during his performance, exactly in the same way as did Al-Farabi.If the preserved antiquities of the American Indians, dating from a
period anterior to our discovery of the western hemisphere, possess
an extraordinary interest because they afford trustworthy evidence
of the degree of progress which the aborigines had attained in the
cultivation of the arts and in their social condition before they came
in contact with Europeans, it must be admitted that the ancient musical
instruments of the American Indians are also worthy of examination.Several of them are constructed in a manner which, in some degree,
reveals the characteristics of the musical system prevalent among the
people who used the instruments.And although most of these interesting
relics, which have been obtained from tombs and other hiding-places,
may not be of great antiquity, it has been satisfactorily ascertained
that they are genuine contrivances of the Indians before they were
influenced by European civilization.Some account of these relics is therefore likely to prove of interest
also to the ethnologist, especially as several facts may perhaps be
found of assistance in elucidating the still unsolved problem as to the
probable original connection of the American with Asiatic races.Among the instruments of the Aztecs in Mexico and of the Peruvians
none have been found so frequently, and have been preserved in their
former condition so unaltered, as pipes and flutes.They are generally
made of pottery or of bone, substances which are unsuitable for the
construction of most other instruments, but which are remarkably
well qualified to withstand the decaying influence of time.There
is, therefore, no reason to conclude from the frequent occurrence of
such instruments that they were more common than other kinds of which
specimens have rarely been discovered.[Illustration]

The Mexicans possessed a small whistle formed of baked clay, a
considerable number of which have been found.Some specimens (of which
we give engravings) are singularly grotesque in shape, representing
caricatures of the human face and figure, birds, beasts, and flowers.Some were provided at the top with a finger-hole which, when closed,
altered the pitch of the sound, so that two different tones were
producible on the instrument.Others had a little ball of baked clay
lying loose inside the air-chamber.When the instrument was blown the
current of air set the ball in a vibrating motion, thereby causing a
shrill and whirring sound.A similar contrivance is sometimes made
use of by Englishmen for conveying signals.Sandra went to the garden.The Mexican whistle most
likely served principally the same purpose, but it may possibly have
been used also in musical entertainments.In the Russian horn band
each musician is restricted to a single tone; and similar combinations
of performers--only, of course, much more rude--have been witnessed by
travellers among some tribes in Africa and America.[Illustration]

Rather more complete than the above specimens are some of the whistles
and small pipes which have been found in graves of the Indians of
Chiriqui in central America.The pipe or whistle which is represented
in the accompanying engraving appears, to judge from the somewhat
obscure description transmitted to us, to possess about half a dozen
tones.It is of pottery, painted in red and black on a cream-
ground, and in length about five inches.Among the instruments of this
kind from central America the most complete have four finger-holes.By means of three the following four sounds (including the sound
which is produced when none of the holes are closed) can be emitted:
[Illustration] the fourth finger-hole, when closed, has the effect of
lowering the pitch a semitone.By a particular process two or three
lower notes are obtainable.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The pipe of the Aztecs, which is called by the Mexican Spaniards
_pito_, somewhat resembled our flageolet: the material was a reddish
pottery, and it was provided with four finger-holes.Although among
about half a dozen specimens which the writer has examined some are
considerably larger than others they all have, singularly enough, the
same pitch of sound.The smallest is about six inches in length, and
the largest about nine inches.Mary travelled to the bathroom.Several _pitos_ have been found in a
remarkably well-preserved condition.They are easy to blow, and their
order of intervals is in conformity with the pentatonic scale, thus:
[Illustration] The usual shape of the _pito_ is that here represented;
showing the upper side of one pipe, and a side view of another.A
specimen of a less common shape, also engraved, is in the British
museum.Indications suggestive of the popular estimation in which the
flute (or perhaps, more strictly speaking, the pipe) was held by the
Aztecs are not wanting.It was played in religious observances and
we find it referred to allegorically in orations delivered on solemn
occasions.For instance, at the religious festival which was held in
honour of Tezcatlepoca--a
