See the story of the Nymph
Coronis, in the Second Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 367: After nine ages.--Ver.Pliny makes the life of the
crow to last for a period of three hundred years.][Footnote 368: Destined numbers.--Ver.'Numeri' means here, the
similar.parts of one whole: 'the allotted portions of human life.'][Footnote 369: Seventh day was come.--Ver.Hippocrates, in his
Aphorisms, mentions the seventh, fourteenth, and twentieth, as the
critical days in a malady.Ovid may here possibly allude to the seventh
day of fasting, which was supposed to terminate the existence of the
person so doing.][Footnote 370: Corinna, farewell.--Ver.It may have said 'Corinna;'
but Ovid must excuse us if we decline to believe that it said 'vale,'
'farewell,' also; unless, indeed, it had been in the habit of saying so
before; this, perhaps, may have been the case, as it had probably often
heard the Poet say 'vale' to his mistress.][Footnote 371: The Elysian hill.--Ver.He kindly imagines a place
for the souls of the birds that are blessed.][Footnote 372: By his words.--Ver.His calling around him, in
human accents, the other birds in the Elysian fields, is ingeniously and
beautifully imagined.][Footnote 377: This very tomb.--Ver.This and the following line
are considered by Heinsius to be spurious, and, indeed, the next line
hardly looks like the composition of Ovid.][Footnote 378: Am I then.--Ver.'Am
I always then to be made the subject of fresh charges?'][Footnote 379: Long-eared ass.--Ver.Perhaps the only holiday that
the patient ass got throughout the year, was in the month of June,
when the festival of Vesta was celebrated, and to which Goddess he had
rendered an important service.John moved to the bedroom.See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 380: Skilled at tiring.--Ver.She was the 'ornatrix,'
or 'tiring woman' of Corinna.As slaves very often received their names
from articles of dress, Cypassis was probably so called from the
garment called 'cypassis,' which was worn by women and men of effeminate
character, and extended downwards to the ancles.][Footnote 387: With the whip.--Ver.From this we see that the whip
was applied to the female slaves, as well as the males.][Footnote 388: Carpathian ocean..--Ver.See the Metamorphoses, Book
xi.][Footnote 389: Swarthy Cypassis.--Ver.From this expression, she
was probably a native of Egypt or Syria.][Footnote 390: With his spear.--Ver.He alludes to the cure of
Telephus by the aid of the spear of Achilles, which had previously
wounded him.][Footnote 391: Cottages of thatch.--Ver.In the First Book of the
Fasti, 1.199, he speaks of the time when 'a little cottage received
Quiriuus, the begotten of Mars, and the sedge of the stream afforded him
a scanty couch.'The straw-thatched cottage of Romulus was preserved at
Rome for many centuries.184, and the Note
to the passage.][Footnote 392: Off to the fields.--Ver.John moved to the kitchen.The 'emeriti,' or veterans
of the Roman legions, who had served their full time, received a regular
discharge, which was called'missio,' together with a bounty, either in
money, or an allotment of land.Virgil was deprived of his property near
Mantua, by the officers of Augustus; and in his first Eclogue, under
the name of Tityrus, he relates how he obtained restitution of it on
applying to the Emperor.][Footnote 393: Free from the race.--Ver.Literally, 'the starting
place.'][Footnote 394: Wand of repose--Ver.For an account of the 'rudis,'
and the privilege it conferred, see the Tristia, Book, iv, El.[Footnote 395: Græcinus.--Ver.He addresses three of his Pontic
Epistles, namely, the Sixth of the First Book, the Sixth of the Second
Book, and the Ninth of the Fourth Book, to his friend Græcinus.In the
latter Epistle, he congratulates him upon his being Consul elect.][Footnote 396: Without my arms.--Ver.'Inermis,' may be rendered,
'off my guard.'][Footnote 397: Like the skiff.--Ver.'Pliaselos' is perhaps here
used as a general name for a boat or skiff; but the vessel which was
particularly so called, was long and narrow, and probably received its
name from its resemblance to a kidney-bean, which was called 'ptaselus.'The 'phaseli' were chiefly used by the Egyptians, and were of various
sizes, from that of a mere boat to a vessel suited for a long voyage.Appian mentions them as being a medium between ships of war and merchant
vessels.Being built for speed, they were more noted for their swiftness
than for their strength.127, speaks of them as
being made of clay; but, of course, that can only refer to 'pha-seli' of
the smallest kind.]Daniel went to the hallway.[Footnote 401: That are thin.--Ver 23.[Footnote 402: Arm his breast --Ver.He alludes to the 'lorica,' or
cuirass, which was worn by the soldiers.][Footnote 403: Of his battles.--Ver.He probably was thinking at
this moment of the deaths of Cornelius Gallus, and T. Haterius, of the
Equcstriai order, whose singular end is mentioned by Valerius Maximus,
11. ix c.8, and by Pliny the Elder, B.[Footnote 404: The meeting rocks.--Ver 3.See the 121st line of the
Epistle of Medea to Jason, and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 405: Tinted pebbles.--Ver.The 'picti lapilli' are
probably camelians, which are found on the sea shore, and are of various
tints.]'Mora,' 'delay,' is put here
for that which causes the delay.'That is a pleasure which belongs to
the shore.'][Footnote 407: In what Malea.--Ver.Propertius and Virgil also
couple Malea, the dangerous promontory on the South of Laconia, with the
Syrtes or quicksands of the Libyan coast.][Footnote 409: Stars of the fruitful Leda.--Ver.Commentators are
divided upon the exact meaning of this line.Some think that it refers
to the Constellations of Castor and Pollux, which were considered to be
favourable to mariners; and which Horace mentions in the first line
of his Third Ode, B. i., 'Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,' 'The
brothers of Helen, those brilliant stars.'Others think that it refers
to the luminous appearances which were seen to settle on the masts
of ships, and were called by the name of Castor and Pollux; they were
thought to be of good omen when both appeared, but unlucky when seen
singly.][Footnote 410: In the couch.--Ver.'Torus' most probably means, in
this place a sofa, on which the ladies would recline while reading.][Footnote 411: Amusing books.--Ver.By using the diminutive
'libellus' here, he probably means some light work, such as a bit of
court scandal, of a love poem.]Mary journeyed to the bathroom.[Footnote 412: My Divinities.--Ver.126,
and the Note to the passage.]Sandra moved to the hallway.[Footnote 413: As a table.--Ver.This denotes his impatience to
entertain her once again, and to hear the narrative of her adventures.][Footnote 414: Though they be fictions.--Ver.He gives a sly hit
here at the tales of travellers.][Footnote 415: Twice five years.--Ver.Or the 'lustrum' of the
Romans, see the Fasti, Book iii.166, and the Tristia, Book iv.[Footnote 416: And the cause.--Ver.This passage is evidently
misunderstood in Nisard's translation, 'Je ne serai pas non plus la caus
d'une nouvelle guerre,' 'I will never more be the cause of a new war.'][Footnote 417: A female again.--Ver.He alludes to the war in
Latium, between Æneas and Turnus, for the hand of Lavinia, the daughter
of Latinus and Amata.See the narrative in the Fourteenth book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 421: 'Twas the females--Ver.The rape of the Sabines, by
the contrivance of Romulus, is here alluded to.The narrative will
be found in the Third Book of the Fasti, 1.Mary went back to the kitchen.It has been
suggested, but apparently without any good grounds, that Tarpeia is here
alluded to.][Footnote 422: Thou who dost.--Ver.Io was said to be worshipped
under the name of Isis.][Footnote 423: Parætonium.--Ver.This city was situate at the
Canopic mouth of the Nile, at the Western extremity of Egypt, adjoining
to Libya.According to Strabo, its former name was Ammonia.It
still preserves its ancient name in a great degree, as it is called
al-Baretoun.][Footnote 424: Fields of Canopus.--Ver.Canopus was a city at one
of the mouths of the Nile, now called Aboukir.The epithet
'genialis,' seems to have been well deserved, as it was famous for its
voluptuousness.Strabo tells us that there was a temple there dedicated
to Serapis, to which multitudes resorted by the canal from Alexandria.He says that the canal was filled, night and day, with men and women
dancing and playing music on board the vessels, with the greatest
licentiousness.The place was situate on an island of the Nile, and
was about fifteen miles distant from Alexandria.Ovid gives a similar
description of Alexandria, in the Tristia, Book i. El.Memphis was a city situate on the
North of Egypt, on the banks of the Nile.It was said to have been built
by Osirit.]See the Metamorphoses, Book ix.[Footnote 428: By thy sistra.Sandra went to the garden.For an account of the mystic
'sistra' of Isis, see the Pontic Epistles, Book i. El.For an account of Anuhis, the Deity
with the dog's head, see the Metamorphoses, Book ix.See the Metamorphoses, Book ix.Sandra travelled to the kitchen.[Footnote 431: The sluggish serpent.--Ver.Macrobius tells us, that
the Egyptians accompanied the statue of Serapis with that of an animal
with three heads, the middle one that of a lion, the one to the right,
of a dog, and that to the left, of a ravenous wolf; and that a serpent
was represented encircling it in its folds, with its head below the
right hand of the statue of the Deity.To this the Poet possibly
alludes, or else to the asp, which was common in the North of Egypt, and
perhaps, was looked upon as sacred.If so, it is probable that the word
'pigra,''sluggish,' refers to the drowsy effect produced by the sting
of the asp, which was generally mortal.This, indeed, seems the more
likely, from the fact of the asp being clearly referred to, in company
with these Deities, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.93; which
see, with the Note to the passage.][Footnote 432: The horned Apis.--Ver.See the Ninth Book of the
Metamorphoses, 1.Isis is here addressed, as
being supposed to be the same Deity as Diana Lucina, who was invoked by
pregnant and parturient women.Thus Isis appears to Telethusa, a Cretan
woman, in her pregnancy, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 434: Thy appointed days.--Ver.Votaries who were
worshipping in the temples of the Deities sat there for a considerable
time, especially when they attended for the purpose of sacrifice.In
the First Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep.50, Ovid says, 'I have
beheld one who confessed that he had offended the Divinity of Isis,
clothed in linen, sitting before he altars of Isis.']'Queis' seems a preferable reading
to 'qua.'][Footnote 436: The Galli.--Ver.Some suppose that Isis and Cybele
were the same Divinity, and that the Galli, or priests of Cybele,
attended the rites of their Goddess under the name of Isis.It seems
clear, from the present passage, that the priests of Cybele, who were
called Galli, did perform the rites of Isis, but there is abundant proof
that these were considered as distinct Deities.In imitation of the
Corybantes, the original priests of Cybele, they performed her rites
to the sound of pipes and tambourines, and ran to and fro in a frenzied
manner.][Footnote 437: With thy laurels.--Ver.See the Note to the 692nd
line of the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses.While celebrating the
search for the limbs of Osiris, the priests uttered lamentations,
accompanied with the sound of the'sistra'; but when they had found the
body, they wore wreaths of laurel, and uttered cries, signifying their
joy.][Footnote 438: Ilithyia.--Ver.As to the Goddess Ilithyia, see the
Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 439: With their bucklers.--Ver.Armed with 'peltæ,' or
bucklers, like the Amazons.][Footnote 440: The sand must.--Ver.This figure is derived from the
gladiatorial fights of the amphitheatre, where the spot on which they
fought was strewed with sand, both for the purpose of giving a firm
footing to the gladiators, and of soaking up the blood that was shed.][Footnote 441: Again throw stones.--Ver.He alludes to Deucalion
and Pyr-rha.See the First Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 442: Ilia had destroyed.--Ver.See
her story, related at the beginning of the Third Book of the Fasti.][Footnote 443: Why pierce.--Ver.He alludes to the sharp
instruments which she had used for the purpose of procuring abortion:
a practice which Canace tells Macareus that her nurse had resorted to.See the Metamorphoses, Book
viii.[Footnote 445: Many a time.--Ver.He seems here to speak of this
practice as being frequently resorted to.][Footnote 446: She deserved it.--Ver.From this, it would seem that
the practice was considered censurable; but, perhaps it was one of those
cases whose heinousness is never fully discovered till it has brought
about its own punishment.][Footnote 447: O ring.--Ver.On the rings in use among the ancients,
see the note to the First Book of the Aruores, El.See also
the subject of the seventh Elegy of the First Book of the Tristia.][Footnote 448: Carpathian old man.--Ver.For some account of
Proteus, who is here referred to, see the First Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 449: Be able to seal--Ver.From this, it appears to have
been a signet ring.][Footnote 450: Touch the lips.--Ver.See the Tristia, Book v., El.1 5, and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 459: In her desk.--Ver.'Loculi' used in the plural,
as in the present instance, signified a receptacle with compartments,
similar, perhaps, to our writing desks; a small box, coffer, casket, or
cabinet of wood
