Perhaps out of my reach.” Don's friend returned smiling.“Lucky,
lucky,” and Don's friend concluded with a laugh.“What now?” said Don,
impatiently.“That lady is the girl that drew Don Carlo out of the river, her name
is Suza Fairfield, and she is the belle of Port William.An orphan girl
raised and educated by old Aunt Katy Demitt.She has had a number of
suitors, but has never consented to leave Aunt Katy's house as a free
woman.”

When the congregation dispersed in the evening, Don Carlo and Suza
Fairfield rode side by side toward Port William.The ever open ear of the
Angel of observation, has only furnished us with these words:

“You are old, my liege, slightly touched with gray.Pray let me live and
with Aunt Katy stay.”

“With old Aunt Katy you shall live my dear, and on her silent grave drop
a weeping tear.”

We can only speak of Suza Fairfield as we wish to speak of all other
belles.=

````The outward acts of every belle,

`````Her inward thoughts reveal;

````And by this rule she tries to tell

`````How other people feel.=

It was the neighborhood talk, that Suza Fairfield, the belle of Port
William, and Don Carlo, the hero of Shirt-Tail Bend, were engaged to be
married.Aunt Katy at the table, Betsey Green and
Cousin Sally; the meeting and the show; all neighborhoods will talk, for
God has made them so.Secrets should be kept, but neighbors let them go; with caution on the
lip, they let a neighbor know, all secrets here below.Some add a little
and some take away.They hold a secret _sacred_ and only tell a friend, and then whisper
in the ear, Silly told me this and you must keep it dear; when all have
kept it and every body knows, true or false, they tell it as it goes.SCENE SIXTH.--THE SECOND GENERATION.````The son may wear the father's crown,

|How few realize that we are so swiftly passing away, and giving our
places on earth, to new men and women.Tramp, tramp, tramp, and on we go, from the cradle to the grave, without
stopping to reflect, that an old man is passing away every hour, and a
new one taking his place.Like drops of rain, descending upon the mountains, and hurrying down to
form the great river, running them off to the ocean, and then returning
in the clouds.New men come upon the stage of life as it were unobserved, and old ones
pass away in like manner, and thus the great river of life flows on.Were the change sudden, and all at once, it would shock the philosophy
of the human race.John travelled to the hallway.A few men live to witness the rise and fall of two
generations.Long years have intervened and the characters portrayed in
the preceding part of our story, have all passed away.Some of their descendants come upon the stage to fight the great battle
of life.Young Simon will first claim our attention; he is the only son of S. S.
Simon by a second wife, his mother is dead, and Young Simon is heir to a
large estate.The decade from eighteen hundred and forty to eighteen hundred and
fifty, is, perhaps, the most interesting decade in the history of the
settlement and progress of the Western States.In that era, the great motive power of our modern civilization, the iron
horse and the magnetic telegraph were put into successful operation,
across the broad and beautiful Western States.The history of the West and Southwest in the first half of the
nineteenth century, is replete with romance, or with truth stranger than
fiction.The sudden rise of a moneyed aristocracy in the West, furnishes
a theme for the pen of a historian of no mean ability.This American aristocracy, diverse from the aristocracy of the old
world, who stimulated by family pride, preserved the history of a long
line of ancestors, born to distinction, and holding the tenure of office
by inheritance, could trace the heroic deeds of their fathers back to
the dark ages, while some of our American aristocrats are unable to give
a true history of their grandfather.In the first half of the nineteenth century the cultivation of the cotton
plant in the Southern States assumed gigantic proportions.The Northern
States bartered their slaves for money, and the forest of the great
Mississippi river fell by the ax of the <DW52> man; salvation from the
_demons of want_ was preached by the <DW65> and the mule.Young Simon was a cotton planter, inheriting from his father four
plantations of one thousand acres, and more than six hundred slaves.Young Simon knew very little of the history of his family, and the
more he learned of it, the less he wanted to know.His father in his
lifetime, had learned the history of Roxie Daymon alias Roxie Fairfield,
up to the time she left Louisville, and had good reason to believe
that Roxie Daymon, or her descendants, also Suza Fairfield, or her
descendants still survived.But as we have said, S. S. Simon stood in
the half-way-house, between the honest man and the rogue.He reflected
upon the subject mathematically, as he said mentally, “Twenty thousand
dollars and twenty years interest--why!it would break me up; I wish to
die a _rich man_.”

And onward he strove, seasoned to hardship in early life, he slept but
little, the morning bell upon his plantations sounded its iron notes up
and down the Mississippi long before daylight every morning, that the
slaves might be ready to resume their work as soon as they could see.Simon's anxiety to die a _rich man_ had so worked upon his feelings for
twenty years, that he was a hard master and a keen financier.The time to die never entered his brain; for it was all absorbed
with the _die rich_ question.Unexpectedly to him, death's white face
appeared when least expected, from hard work, and exposure, S. S. Simon
was taken down with the _swamp fever_; down--down--down for a few days
and then the _crisis_, the last night of his suffering was terrible, the
attending physician and his only son stood by his bedside.All night he
was delirious, everything he saw was in the shape of Roxie Daymon,
every movement made about the bed, the dying man would cry, “_Take Roxie
Daymon away._”

Young Simon was entirely ignorant of his father's history--and the name
_Roxie Daymon_ made a lasting impression on his brain.Young Simon grew
up without being inured to any hardships, and his health was not good,
for he soon followed his father; during his short life he had everything
that heart could desire, except a family name and good health, the lack
of which made him almost as poor as the meanest of his slaves.Young Simon received some comfort in his last days from his cousin
Cæsar.John travelled to the office.Cæsar Simon was the son of the brother of S. S. Simon who died in
early life, leaving three children in West Tennessee.Cousin Cæsar was
raised by two penniless sisters, whom he always called “big-sis” and
“little-sis.” “Big-sis” was so called from being the eldest, and had the
care of cousin Cæsar's childhood.Cousin Cæsar manifested an imaginary
turn of mind in early childhood.He was, one day, sitting on his little
stool, by the side of the tub in which “big-sis” was washing, (for she
was a washer-woman,) gazing intently upon the surface of the water.“What in the world are you looking at C-a-e-s-a-r?” said the woman,
straightening up in astonishment.“Looking at them bubbles on the suds,” said the boy, gravely.“And what of the bubbles?” continued the woman.“I expected to see one of them burst into a l-o-a-f of b-r-e-a-d,” said
the child honestly.Mary went back to the kitchen.“Big-sis” took cousin Cæsar to the fire, went to the cupboard and cut
her last loaf of bread, and spread upon it the last mouthful of butter
she had in the world, and gave it cousin Cæsar.And thus he received his first lesson of reward for imagination which,
perhaps, had something to do with his after life.Cousin Cæsar detested work, but had a disposition to see the bottom of
everything.No turkey-hen or guinea fowl could make a nest that cousin
Cæsar could not find.He grew up mischievous, so much so that “big-sis”
 would occasionally thrash him.Mary went back to the bathroom.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.He would then run off and live with
“little-sis” until “little-sis” would better the instruction, for she
would whip also.He would then run back to live with “big-sis.” In this
way cousin Cæsar grew to thirteen years of age--too big to whip.He
then went to live with old Smith, who had a farm on the Tennessee river,
containing a large tract of land, and who hired a large quantity
of steam wood cut every season.Rob Roy was one of old Smith's wood
cutters--a bachelor well advanced in years, he lived alone in a cabin
made of poles, on old Smith's land.His sleeping couch was made with
three poles, running parallel with the wall of the cabin, and filled
with straw.He never wore any stockings and seldom wore a coat, winter
or summer.The furniture in his cabin consisted of a three-legged stool,
and a pine goods box.His ax was a handsome tool, and the only thing he
always kept brightly polished.He was a good workman at his profession
of cutting wood.He was a man that
seldom talked; he was faithful to work through the week, but spent
the Sabbath day drinking whisky.He went to the village every Saturday
evening and purchased one gallon of whisky, which he carried in a stone
jug to his cabin, and drank it all himself by Monday morning, when he
would be ready to go to work again.Old Rob Roy's habits haunted the
mind of cousin Cæsar, and he resolved to play a trick Upon the old
wood cutter.Old Smith had some _hard cider_ to which cousin Cæsar had
access.One lonesome Sunday cousin Cæsar stole Roy's jug half full
of whisky, poured the whisky out, re-filled the jug with cider, and
cautiously slipped it back into Roy's cabin.On Monday morning Rob Roy
refused to work, and was very mad.Old Smith demanded to know the
cause of the trouble.“You can't fool a man with _cider_ who loves
good _whisky_,” said Roy indignantly.Old Smith traced the trick up and
discharged cousin Cæsar.At twenty years of age we find Cousin Cæsar in Paducah, Kentucky,
calling himself Cole Conway, in company with one Steve Sharp--they were
partners--in the game, as they called it.In the back room of a saloon,
dimly lighted, one dark night, another party, more proficient in the
sleight of hand, had won the last dime in their possession.The sun had crossed the meridian on the other side of
the globe.Cole Conway and Steve Sharp crawled into an old straw shed,
in the suburbs, of the village, and were soon soundly sleeping.Daniel moved to the kitchen.The
sun had silvered the old straw shed when Sharp awakened, and saw Conway
sitting up, as white as death's old horse.“What on earth is the matter,
Conway?” said Sharp, inquiringly.“I slumbered heavy in the latter end of night, and had a brilliant
dream, and awoke from it, to realize this old straw shed doth effect
me,” said Conway gravely.“I
dreamed that we were playing cards, and I was dealing out the deck; the
last card was mine, and it was very thick.Sharp, it looked like a
box, and with thumb and finger I pulled it open.In it there were
three fifty-dollar gold pieces, four four-dollar gold pieces, and ten
one-dollar gold pieces.I put the money in my pocket, and was listening
for you to claim half, as you purchased the cards.You said nothing more
than that 'them cards had been put up for men who sell prize cards.'I
took the money out again, when lo, and behold!one of the fifty-dollar
pieces had turned to a rule about eight inches long, hinged in the
middle.Looking at it closely I saw small letters engraved upon it,
which I was able to read--you know, Sharp, I learned to read by spelling
the names on steamboats--or that is the way I learned the letters of the
alphabet.The inscription directed me to a certain place, and there I
would find a steam carriage that could be run on any common road where
carriages are drawn by horses.It was
a beautiful carriage--with highly finished box--on four wheels, the box
was large enough for six persons to sit on the inside.The pilot sat
upon the top, steering with a wheel, the engineer, who was also fireman,
and the engine, sat on the aft axle, behind the passenger box.The whole
structure was very light, the boiler was of polished brass, and sat upon
end.The heat was engendered by a chemical combination of phosphorus
and tinder.The golden rule gave directions how to run the engine--by
my directions, Sharp, you was pilot and I was engineer, and we started
south, toward my old home.People came running out from houses and
fields to see us pass I saw something on the beautiful brass boiler that
looked like a slide door.I shoved it, and it slipped aside, revealing
the dial of a clock which told the time of day, also by a separate hand
and figures, told the speed at which the carriage was running.On the
right hand side of the dial I saw the figures 77.They were made of
India rubber, and hung upon two brass pins.I drew the slide door over
the dial except when I wished to look at the time of day, or the rate of
speed at which we were running, and every time I opened the door, one
of the figure 7's had fallen off the pin.I would replace it, and again
find it fallen off.So I concluded it was only safe to run seven miles
an hour, and I regulated to that speed.In a short time, I looked again,
and we were running at the rate of fifteen miles an hour.I knew that I
had not altered the gauge of steam.A hissing sound caused me to think
the water was getting low in the boiler.On my left I saw a brass handle
that resembled the handle of a pump.I
could hear the bubbling of the water.I look down at the dry road, and
said, mentally, 'no water can come from there.'It
so frightened me that I found myself wide awake.”

“Dreams are but eddies in the current of the mind, which cut off from
reflection's gentle stream, sometimes play strange, fantastic tricks.I have tumbled headlong down from high and rocky cliffs; cold-blooded
snakes have crawled 'round my limbs; the worms that eat through
dead men's flesh, have crawled upon my skin, and I have dreamed of
transportation beyond the shores of time.My last night's dream hoisted
me beyond my hopes, to let me fall and find myself in this d----old
straw shed.”

“The devil never dreams,” said Sharp, coolly, and then continued:
“Holy men of old dreamed of the
