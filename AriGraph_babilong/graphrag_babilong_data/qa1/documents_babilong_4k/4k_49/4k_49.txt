I
then asked him what canton I was in?Daniel travelled to the bedroom.and upon his answering that I was
in the canton of Berne, I cried out transported with joy, "I thank God
that I am."The good man answered, "And so do I."I then told him who I
was, and that I was going to Berne but had quite lost myself by keeping
out of all the high roads, to avoid falling into the hands of those
who sought my destruction.He thereupon opened the door, received and
entertained me with all the hospitality his poverty would admit of;
regaled me with sour crout and some new laid eggs, the only provision
he had, and clean straw with a kind of rug for a bed, he having no other
for himself and wife.The good woman expressed as much good nature as
her husband, and said many kind things in the Swiss language, which
her husband interpreted to me in the Italian; for that language he well
understood, having learned it in his youth, while servant in a public
home on the borders of Italy, where both languages are spoken.I never
passed a more comfortable night; and no sooner did I begin to stir in
the morning, than the good man and his wife both came to know how
I rested; and, wishing they had been able to accommodate me better,
obliged me to breakfast on two eggs, which providence, they said, had
sent them for that purpose.I took leave of the wife, who seemed most
sincerely to wish me a good journey.As for the husband, he would by all
means attend me to the high road leading to Berne; which road he said
was but two miles distant from that place.But he insisted on my first
going back with him, to see the way I had come the night before; the
only way, he said, I could have possibly come from the neighboring
canton of Lucerne.I saw it, and shuddered at the danger I had escaped;
for I found I had walked and led my horse a good way along a very narrow
path on the brink of a very dangerous precipice.The man made so
many pertinent and pious remarks on the occasion, as both charmed and
surprised me.I no less admired his disinterestedness than his piety;
for, upon our parting, after he had attended me till I was out of all
danger of losing my way, I could by no means prevail upon him to accept
of any reward for his trouble.He had the satisfaction, he said, of
having relieved me in the greatest distress, which was in itself a
sufficient reward, and he wished for no other.Having at length got safe into French Flanders, I there repaired to the
college of the Scotch Jesuits at Douay, and discovering myself to the
rector, I acquainted him with the cause of my sudden departure from
Italy, and begged him to give notice of my arrival, as well as the
motives of my flight to Michael Angelo Tambuvini, general of the order,
and my very particular friend.The rector wrote as I desired him, to the general, and he, taking no
notice of my flight, in his answer, (for he could not disapprove, and
did not think it safe to approve of it,) ordered me to continue where I
was till further notice.I arrived at Douay early in May, and continued
there till the beginning of July, when the rector received a second
letter from the general, acquainting him that he had been commanded by
the congregation of the Inquisition, to order me, wherever I was, back
into Italy; to promise me, in their name, full pardon and forgiveness if
I obeyed, but if I did not obey, to treat me as an apostate.He added,
that the same order had been transmitted, soon after my flight, to
the nuncios at the different Roman Catholic courts; and he, therefore,
advised me to consult my own safety without further delay.Upon the receipt of the general's kind letter, the rector was of opinion
that I should repair by all means, and without loss of time, to England,
not only as the safest asylum I could fly to, in my present situation,
but as a place where I should soon recover my native language, and be
usefully employed, either there or in Scotland.The place being thus
agreed on, and it being at the same time settled between the rector and
me, that I should set out the very next morning, I solemnly promised, at
his request and desire, to take no kind of notice, after my arrival
in England, of his having been in any way privy to my flight, or the
general's letter to him.This promise I have faithfully and honorably
observed; and should have thought myself guilty of the blackest
ingratitude if I had not observed it, being sensible that, had it been
known at Rome, that, either the rector or general had been accessary to
my flight, THE INQUISITION WOULD HAVE RESENTED IT SEVERELY IN BOTH.Daniel moved to the bathroom.For
although a Jesuit in France, in Flanders, or in Germany, is out of the
reach of the Inquisition, the general is not; and the high tribunal not
only have it in their power to punish the general himself, who resides
constantly at Rome, but may oblige him to inflict what punishment they
please on any of the order obnoxious to them.The rector went that very night out of town, and in his absence, but not
without his privity, I took one of the horses of the college, early
next morning, as if I were going for a change of air, being somewhat
indisposed, to pass a few days at Lisle; but steering a different
course, I reached Aire that night and Calais the next day.I was there
in no danger of being stopped and seized at the prosecution of the
Inquisition, a tribunal no less abhorred in France than in England.But being informed that the nuncios at the different courts had been
ordered, soon after my flight, to cause me to be apprehended in Roman
Catholic countries through which I must pass, as an apostate and
deserter from the order, I was under no small apprehension of being
discovered and apprehended as such even at Calais.No sooner, therefore,
did I alight at the Inn, than I went down to the quay, and there as I
was very little acquainted with the sea, and thought the passage much
shorter than it is, I endeavored to engage some fishermen to carry me
that very night, in one of their small vessels, over to England.This
alarmed the guards of the harbor, and I should have been certainly
apprehended as a person guilty, or suspected of some great crime,
fleeing from justice, had not Lord Baltimore, whom I had the good luck
to meet in the Inn, informed me of my danger, and pitying my condition,
attended me that moment, with all his company, to the port, and conveyed
me immediately on board his yacht.There I lay that night, leaving every
thing I had but the clothes on my back, in the Inn; and the next day his
Lordship set me ashore at Dover, from whence I came in the common stage
to London.In the year 1706, the Inquisition at Arragon was broken up by the French
troops, under the command of the Duke of Orleans.The Holy Inquisitors
were driven from their beautiful house, and in answer to their indignant
remonstrance were told that the king wanted the house to quarter his
troops in, and they were therefore compelled to leave it immediately.The doors of the prisons were then thrown open, and among the four
hundred prisoners who were set at liberty were sixty young women, very
beautiful in person, and clad in the richest attire.Anthony Gavin, formerly one of the Roman Catholic priests of Saragossa,
Spain, relates (in a book published by him after his conversion) that
when travelling in France he met one of those women in the inn at
Rotchfort; the son of the inn-keeper, formerly an officer in the French
army, having married her for her great beauty and superior intelligence.In accordance with his request, she freely related to him the incidents
of her prison life, from which we take the following extract:

"Early the next morning, Mary got up, and told me that nobody was up
yet in the house; and that she would show me the DRY PAN and the GRADUAL
FIRE, on condition that I should keep it a secret for her sake as well
as my own.This I promised, and she took me along with her, and showed
me a dark room with a thick iron door, and within it an oven and a large
brass pan upon it, with a cover of the same and a lock to it.The oven
was burning at the time, and I asked Mary for what purpose the pan was
there.Without giving me any answer, she took me by the hand and led
me to a large room, where she showed me a thick wheel, covered on both
sides with thick boards, and opening a little window in the center of
it, desired me to look with a candle on the inside of it, and I saw all
the circumference of the wheel set with SHARP RAZORS.After that she
showed me a PIT FULL OF SERPENTS AND TOADS.Then she said to me, 'Now,
my good mistress, I'll tell you the use of these things.The dry pan and
gradual fire are for those who oppose the holy father's will, and for
heretics.They are put naked and alive into the pan, and the cover of it
being locked up, the executioner begins to put in the oven a small fire,
and by degrees he augmenteth it, till the body is burned to ashes.The
second is designed for those who speak against the Pope and the holy
fathers.They are put within the wheel, and the door being locked, the
executioner turns the wheel till the person is dead.Mary travelled to the hallway.The third is for
those who contemn the images, and refuse to give the due respect and
veneration to ecclesiastical persons; for they are thrown alive into the
pit, and there they become the food of serpents and toads.'Then Mary
said to me that another day she would show me the torments for public
sinners and transgressors of the commandments of holy mother church;
but I, in deep amazement, desired her to show me no more places; for the
very thought of those three which I had seen, was enough to terrify me
to the heart.Sandra went back to the hallway.So we went to my room, and she charged me again to be very
obedient to all commands, for if I was not, I was sure to undergo the
torment of the dry pan."Llorente, the Spanish historian and secretary-general of the
Inquisition, relates the following incident: "A physician, Juan de
Salas, was accused of having used a profane expression, twelve months
before, in the heat of debate.He denied the accusation, and produced
several witnesses to prove his innocence.But Moriz, the inquisitor at
Valladolid, where the charge was laid, caused de Salas to be brought
into his presence in the torture-chamber, stripped to his shirt, and
laid on a LADDER or DONKEY, an instrument resembling a wooden trough,
just large enough to receive the body, with no bottom, but having a
bar or bars to placed that the body bent, by its own weight, into an
exquisitely painful position.His head was lower than his heels, and the
breathing, in consequence, became exceedingly difficult.The poor man,
so laid, was bound around the arms and legs with hempen cords, each of
them encircling the limb eleven times."During this part of the operation they admonished him to confess the
blasphemy; but he only answered that he had never spoken a sentence
of such a kind, and then, resigning himself to suffer, repeated the
Athanasian creed, and prayed to God and our Lady many times.Being
still bound, they raised his head, covered his face with a piece of fine
linen, and, forcing open the mouth, caused water to drip into it from an
earthen jar, slightly perforated at the bottom, producing in addition
to his sufferings from distension, a horrid sensation of choking.But
again, when they removed the jar for a moment, he declared that he had
never uttered such a sentence; and this he often repeated.They then
pulled the cords on his right leg, cutting into the flesh, replaced the
linen on his face, dropped the water as before, and tightened the cords
on his right leg the second time; but still he maintained that he
had never spoken such a thing; and in answer to the questions of his
tormentors, constantly reiterated that he HAD NEVER SPOKEN THOSE WORDS.Moriz then pronounced that the said torture should be regarded as
begun, but not finished; and De Salas was released, to live, if he could
survive, in the incessant apprehension that if he gave the slightest
umbrage to a familiar, he would be carried again into the same chamber,
and be RACKED IN EVERY LIMB."Llorente also relates, from the original records, another case quite as
cruel and unjust as the above."On the 8th day of December, 1528, one
Catalina, a woman of BAD CHARACTER, informed the inquisitors that,
EIGHTEEN YEARS BEFORE she had lived in the house with a Morisco named
Juan, by trade a coppersmith, and a native of Segovia; that she had
observed that neither he nor his children ate pork or drank wine, and
that, on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings they used to wash their
feet, which custom, as well as abstinence from pork and wine, was
peculiar to the Moors.The old man was at that time an inhabitant of
Benevente, and seventy-one years of age.But the inquisitors at once
summoned him into their presence, and questioned him at three several
interviews.All that he could tell was, that he received baptism when he
was forty-five years of age; that having never eaten pork or drunk wine,
he had no taste for them; and that, being coppersmiths, they found it
necessary to wash themselves thoroughly once a week.After some other
examinations, they sent him back to Benevente, with prohibition to go
beyond three leagues' distance from the town.Two years afterwards the
inquisitor determined that he should be threatened with torture, IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP THEM TO CRIMINATE OTHERS.He was accordingly taken to Valladolid, and in a subterranean chamber,
called the 'chamber, or dungeon, of torment,' stripped naked, and bound
to the 'ladder.'This might well have extorted something like confession
from an old man of seventy-one; but he told them that whatever he might
say when under torture would be merely extorted by the extreme anguish,
and therefore unworthy of belief; that he would not, through fear of
pain, confess what had never taken place.They kept him in close prison
until the next Auto de Fe, when he walked among the penitents, with a
lighted candle in his hand, and, after seeing others burnt to death,
paid the holy office a fee of four ducats, and went home, not acquitted,
but released.He was not summoned again, as he died soon afterwards."It sometimes happened that an individual was arrested by mistake, and
a person who was entirely innocent was tortured instead of the real or
supposed criminal.Bower found related at length
in the "Annals of the Inquisition at Macerata.""An order was sent from the high tribunal at Rome to all the inquisitors
throughout Italy, enjoining them to apprehend a clergyman minutely
described in that order.One Answering the description in many
particulars being discovered in the diocese of Osimo, at a small
distance from Macerata, and subject to that Inquisition, he was there
decoyed into the holy office, and by an order from Rome SO RACKED AS TO
LOSE HIS SENSES.In the mean time, the true person being apprehended,
the unhappy wretch was dismissed, by a second order from Rome, but he
never recovered the use of his senses, NOR WAS ANY CARE TAKEN OF HIM BY
THE INQUISITION."
