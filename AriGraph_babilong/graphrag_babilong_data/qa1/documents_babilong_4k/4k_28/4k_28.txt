They fully understand how necessary it is to the successful
working of their grafts to keep the people in ignorance of what a
physician may legitimately and conscientiously do.Our medical brethren who preach the "all but holy" doctrine, and want to
maintain the "attitude of infallibility toward the public," will disagree
with me about there being "a host" of incompetents in the regular school
of medical practice.I shall not ask that they take the possibly biased
opinion of an ex-Osteopath, but refer them to the report of the committee
appointed by the American Medical Association to examine the medical
colleges of the United States as to their ability to make competent
physicians."One-half of all the medical schools of our country are
utterly unfit to turn out properly qualified physicians, and many of them
are so dominated by commercialism that they are but little better than
diploma mills"!It has been argued that the capable physician need not fear the
incompetent pretender, for, like dregs, he must "settle to the bottom" and
find his place.This might be true if the people had correct notions of
the true theory of therapeutics.As it is, the scholarly, competent
physician knows (and intelligent laymen often know) that the pretenders
too often are the fellows who get the reputations of being the "big
doctors."I think mainly because, being ignorant, they practice
largely as quacks, and by curing (?)all kinds of dangerous (on their own
diagnosis) diseases quickly, "breaking up" this and "aborting" that
unbreakable and unabortable disease (by "hot air" treatment mainly), they
place the whole system upon such a basis of quackery that the deluded
masses often pronounce the best equipped and most conscientious physician
a "poor doctor," because he will not pretend to do all that the
wind-jamming grafter claims _he has_ done and _can_ do.Here is a case in point which I know to be true.The farce began some
years ago in a small college in Oregon.A big, awkward, harmless-looking
fellow came to the college one fall and entered the preparatory
department.At the end of the year, after he had failed in every
examination and shown conclusively that he had no capacity to learn
anything, he was told that it was a waste of time for him to go to school,
and they could not admit him for another year.The fires of ambition yet burned in his breast, and the next year he
turned up at a medical college.I presume it had the same high educational
requirements for admission that some other medical colleges have, and
enforced them in about the same way.At any rate he met the requirements
($$$), and pursued his medical researches with bright visions of being a
doctor to lure him on.But his inability to learn anything manifested
itself again, and, presumably, his money gave out.At any rate he was sent
away without a diploma.Still the fire of ambition was not extinguished in
his manly bosom.Regulations were not strict in those days, so he went to
a small town, wore fine clothes, a silk hat and a pompous air, and--within
a short time was being called for forty miles around to "counsel little
doctors" in their desperate cases.Such cases are all too common, as
honest physicians know.How humiliating to the conscientiously equipped doctor to hear people say
of a man who never had more brains than he needed, and had hopelessly
muddled what he had by using his own dope and stimulants: "I tell you Doc
Booze is the best doctor in town yet when he's half sober!"Strange, isn't
it, that in many communities people have an idea that an inclination on
the part of a physician toward whisky or dope indicates some peculiar
mental fitness for a doctor?"Poor fellow, he formed the habit of taking
stimulants to keep up when he had to go night and day during the big
typhoid epidemic, you know."of cases of medical
dipsomaniacs this constitutes a stock excuse, only medical men know.As an
Osteopathic physician I was never rushed so that I felt the necessity for
"keeping up on stimulants."If I had been, to be consistent, I should have
had to stimulate (?)Not only do shysters and pretenders abuse the confidence of the masses in
matters of diagnosis and medication, but of late years they are working
another species of graft that is beginning to react against the
profession.This graft consists in the over-use of therapeutic appliances
that are all right in their place when legitimately used.By what standard is the physician judged by the people who enter his
office?It used to be the display of medical literature.Sometimes some of
it was pseudo-medical literature.Did you ever know a shyster to pad his
library with Congressional reports?The literature used to be
conspicuously placed in the waiting-room, with a ponderous volume lying
open on the desk.Have you a "leading doctor" in your town?Often he is not only in the lead
but has flagged all the others at the quarter post--put them all into the
"has been" class.Plush rugs and luxurious
couches in the waiting-room.Double doors into the private and
operating-rooms, left open when not in actual use to give impressive
glimpses of glass cases filled with glittering instruments, any one of
which would give the lie to Solomon's declaration that "there is nothing
new under the sun."An X-ray machine fills a conspicuous corner.In the
same room are tanks, tubes, inhalers, hot-air appliances, vibrators, etc.One full side of the room is filled with shelves that groan under a load
of the medicines he "keeps and dispenses."What are all of these hundreds
of bottles for if it is true, as many of our greatest physicians say, that
a comparatively few people are benefited by drugs?I do not know as to that, but I do know something of
the impression such a display makes on the mind of an intelligent layman.The query in his mind is how much of that entire display is for its
legitimate effect on the minds of the patients, and how much of it is to
impress the people with the powers of this physician, with his "wonderful
equipment" to cope with all manner of disease?If there is any doubt in the minds of physicians that laymen do know and
think well over the sayings of drug nihilists, let them talk with
intelligent people and hear them quote from the editorial page of a great
daily such sentiments as this (from the Chicago _Record-Herald_):

    "Prof.William Osier, the distinguished teacher of medicine, who was
    taken from this country a few years ago to occupy the most important
    medical chair in Great Britain, has shocked his profession repeatedly
    by his pronouncements against the use of drugs and medicines of almost
    every kind.Only a few days ago he made an address in which he
    declared that even though most physicians will be deprived of their
    livelihood, the time must soon come when sound hygienic advice for the
    prevention of disease will take the place of the present system of
    prescription and _pretense of cure_.The most able physicians agree
    with him, even when they are not frank enough to express themselves to
    the same effect."Medical men need not think, either, that the people who happened to read
the editorial pages referred to are the only ones who know of that
declaration from Osier.Osteopathic journals, Christian Science journals,
health culture journals, and all the riff-raff of journals published as
individual boosters, are ever on the watch for just such things, and when
they find them they "roll them under their tongue as sweet morsels."They
chew them, as Carleton says, with "the cud of fancy," and hand them along
as latest news to tens of thousands of people who are quick to believe
them.Going back to the physician who has the well-equipped office, is he a
grafter in any sense?Perhaps every thing he
has in the office is legitimate.In the opinion of the masses of that
community he is the greatest doctor that ever prescribed a pill or
purloined an appendix.Taking the word of the physicians whom he has put
into the "has been" class for it, he is the greatest fake that ever fooled
the people.Most of those outclassed doctors will talk at any time, in any
place, to any one, of the pretensions of this type of physician.They will
tell how he dazzles the people with his display of apparatus "kept for
show;" how he diagnoses malarial fever as typhoid, and thus gets the
reputation of curing a larger per cent.of typhoid than any other doctor
in town; how he gets the reputation of being a big surgeon by cutting out
healthy ovaries and appendices, and how he assists with his knife women
who do not desire Rooseveltian families.They point to the number of
appendectomies he has performed, and recall how rare such cases were
before his advent, and yet how few people died with appendicitis.Is it to
be wondered that intelligent laymen sometimes lose faith in and respect
for the profession of medicine and surgery?To show that people may be imposed upon by illegitimate use of legitimate
agencies I call attention to an article published recently in the _Iowa
Health Bulletin_.The Iowa Medical Board is winning admiration from many
by conducting a campaign to educate the people of the State in matters
pertaining to hygienic living.In line with this work they published an
article to correct the erroneous idea the laity have of the X-ray.They
say:

    "The people think that with the X-ray the doctor can look right into
    the body and examine any part or organ and tell just what is the
    matter with it, when the fact is all that is ever seen is a lot of dim
    shadows that even the expert often fails to understand or recognize."Why do the people have such erroneous conceptions of the X-ray?Is it
accidental, or the result of their innate stupidity?The people have just such conceptions of the X-ray as they receive from
the faker who uses it as he uses his opiates and stimulants--to get an
effect and give the people wrong ideas of his power.A lady of a small town who was far advanced in consumption was taken to a
city to be examined by a "big doctor" who possessed an X-ray.He
"examined" her thoroughly by the aid of the penetrating light made by his
machine, and sent them home delighted with the assurance that his
wonderful instrument revealed no tuberculosis.He assured her that if she
would avail herself of his superior skill she might yet be restored to
health.She died within a year from the ravages of tuberculosis.A boy of four had an aggravated attack of bronchitis.His symptoms were
such that his parents thought some object might have lodged in his
trachea.A noted surgeon who had come one hundred miles from a hospital to
see another case was consulted.He told the parents that the boy had
sucked something down his windpipe, and advised them to bring him to the
hospital for an operation.They did so, and a $100 incision was made
after the X-ray had located (?)an object lodged at the bifurcation of the
trachea.The knife found nothing, however, and the boy still had his
bronchitis, and the parents had their hospital and surgeon's bills, and,
incidentally, their faith in the X-ray somewhat shattered.The X-rays, Finsen rays, electric light and sunlight have their place in
therapy.However, the history
of the use of these agents is a common one.A scientist, after possibly a
lifetime of research, develops a new therapeutic agent or a new
application of some old agent.Immediately a lot of half-baked professional men seize upon it, more with
the object of self-laudation and advertisement than in a true scientific
spirit.Serious study in the application of the new agent is not thought
of.The object is rather to have the reputation of being an up-to-snuff
man.The results obtained are not what the originator claimed, which is
not to be wondered at.The abuse of the remedy leads to abuse of the
originator, which is entirely unfair to both.This state of affairs has grown so bad that scientists now are beginning
to restrict the application of their discoveries to their own pupils.A
Berlin _savant_, assistant to Koch, has developed the use of tuberculin to
such a point as to make it one of the most valuable remedies in
tuberculosis.It is manufactured under his personal supervision, and sold
only to such physicians as will study in his laboratory and show
themselves competent to grasp the principles involved.TURBID THERAPEUTICS.An Astounding Array of Therapeutic
    Systems--Diet--Water--Optics--Hemotherapy--Consumption
    Cures--Placebos--Inconsistencies and Contradictions--Osler's Opinion
    of Appendicitis--Fair Statement of Limitations in Medicine Desirable.To be convinced that therapeutics are turbid, note the increasing numbers
of diametrically opposed schools springing up and claiming to advocate the
only true system of healing.Look at the astounding array:

Allopathy, Homeopathy, Eclecticism, Osteopathy, Electrotherapy, Christian
Science, Emmanuel movement, Hydrotherapy, Chiropractics, Viteopathy,
Magnetic Healing, Suggestive Therapeutics, Naturopathy, Massotherapy,
Physio-Therapy, and a host of minor fads that are rainbow-hued bubbles for
a day.They come and go as Byron said some therapeutic fads came and went
in his day.He spoke of the new things that astounded the people for a
day, and then, as it has been with

  "Cowpox, tractors, galvanism and gas,
  The bubble bursts and all is air at last."One says he has found that fasting is a panacea.Another says: "He is a
fool; you must feed the body if you expect it to be built up."One says drinking floods of water is a cure-all.John moved to the office.Another says the water is
all right, but you must use it for the "internal bath."Still another
agrees that water is the thing, but it must be used in hot and cold
applications.One faker says _he_ has found that most diseases are caused by defective
eyes, and proposes to cure anything from consumption to ingrown toe-nails
with glasses.Another agrees that the predisposing cause of diseases is
eye strain, but the first fellow is irrational in his treatment.Glasses
are unnatural and therefore all wrong.To cure the eyes use his wonderful
nature-assisting ointment; that goes right to the optic nerve and makes
old eyes young, weak eyes strong, relieves nerve strain and thereby makes
sick people well.Another has found that "infused" blood is the real elixir of life.of twenty cases of tuberculosis cured by his
beneficent discovery.I wonder why we have a "Great White Plague" at all;
or why we have international conventions to discuss means of staying the
ravages of this terrible disease; or why State medical boards are devoting
so much space in their bulletins to warn and educate the people against
the awful fatality of consumption, when to cure it is so easy if doctors
will only use blood?Even if the hemotherapist does claim a little too much, there is yet no
cause for terror.A leading Osteopathic journal proclaims in large
letters that the Osteopath can remove the obstruction so that nature will
cure consumption.Christian Scientists and Magnetic Healers have not yet admitted their
defeat, and there are many regulars who have not surrendered to the
plague.So the poor consumptive may hope on (while his money lasts).Our
most conscientious physicians not only admit limitations in curing
tuberculosis, but try to teach the people that they must not rely on being
"cured" if they are attacked, but must work with the physician to prevent
its contagion.The intelligent layman can say "Amen" to that doctrine.The question may be fairly put: "Why not have more of such frankness from
the physician?"The manner in which the admissions of doctors that they
are unable to control tuberculosis with medicine or surgery aloneJohn went back to the garden.
