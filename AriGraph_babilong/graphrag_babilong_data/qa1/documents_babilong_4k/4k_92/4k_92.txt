The long night through we stood around her bed.With the dawn, Martha,
the housekeeper, returned, and we then learned, for the first time, with
what consummate skill Pollexfen had laid all his plans.For even the
housekeeper had been sent out of the way, and on a fictitious pretense
that she was needed at the bedside of a friend, whose illness was
feigned for the occasion.Nor was the day over before we learned with
certainty, but no longer with surprise, that Cloudsdale was on his way
to Panama, with a bribe in his pocket.As soon as it was safe to remove Lucile, she was borne on a litter to
the hospital of Dr.Peter Smith, where she received every attention that
her friends could bestow.Knowing full well, from what Lucile had told me, that Courtland would be
down in the Sacramento boat, I awaited his arrival with the greatest
impatience.I could only surmise what would be his course.But judging
from my own feelings, I could not doubt that it would be both desperate
and decisive.Finally, the steamer rounded to, and the next moment the pale, emaciated
form of the youth sank, sobbing, into my arms.Eagerly, most eagerly, Courtland read the
little note accompanying the bankbook.It was very simple, and ran thus:

   MY OWN LIFE'S LIFE: Forgive the first, and only act, that you
   will ever disapprove of in the conduct of your mutilated but
   loving Lucile.can I still hope for your love, in the future,
   as in the past?Give me but that assurance, and death itself
   would be welcome.L. M.

We parted very late; he going to a hotel, I to the bedside of the
wounded girl.Our destinies would have been reversed, but the surgeon's
order was imperative, that she should see no one whose presence might
conduce still further to bring on inflammation of the brain.The next day, Courtland was confined to his bed until late in the
afternoon, when he dressed, and left the hotel.I saw him no more until
the subsequent day.About eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st, the day after his
arrival, Courtland staggered into the gallery, or rather the den of John
Pollexfen.He had no other arms than a short double-edged dagger, and
this he concealed in his sleeve.They had met before; as he sometimes went there, anterior to the death
of M. Marmont, to obtain the photographs upon which Lucile was
experimenting, previous to her engagement by the artist.Pollexfen manifested no surprise at his visit; indeed, his manner
indicated that it had been anticipated."You have come into my house, young man," slowly enunciated the
photographer, "to take my life.""I do not deny it," replied Courtland.As he said this, he took a step forward.Pollexfen threw open his vest,
raised himself to his loftiest height, and solemnly said: "Fire!as the case may be; I shall offer no resistance.I only beg of
you, as a gentleman, to hear me through before you play the part of
assassin.""I will hear you," said
Courtland, sinking into a chair, already exhausted by his passion.Confronting the lover, he told his story
truthfully to the end.He plead for his life; for he felt the proud
consciousness of having performed an act of duty that bordered upon the
heroic.Still, there was no relenting in the eye of Courtland.It had that
expression in it that betokens blood.Caesar saw it as Brutus lifted his
dagger.Henry of Navarre recognized it as the blade of Ravillac sank
into his heart.Joaquin beheld it gleaming in the vengeful orbs of Harry
Love!Pollexfen, too, understood the language that it spoke.Dropping his hands, and taking one stride toward the young man, he
sorrowfully said: "I have but one word more to utter.Your affianced
bride has joyfully sacrificed one of her lustrous eyes to science.In
doing so, she expressed but one regret, that you, whom she loved better
than vision, or even life, might, as the years roll away, forget to love
her in her mutilation as you did in her beauty.Perfect yourself, she
feared mating with imperfection might possibly estrange your heart.Your
superiority in personal appearance might constantly disturb the perfect
equilibrium of love."The covert meaning was seized with lightning rapidity by
Courtland.Springing to his feet, he exclaimed joyfully: "The sacrifice
must be mutual.God never created a soul that could outdo Charles
Courtland's in generosity."Flinging his useless dagger upon the floor, he threw himself into the
already extended arms of the photographer, and begged him "to be quick
with the operation."The artist required no second invitation, and ere
the last words died upon his lips, the sightless ball of his left eye
swung from its socket.There was no cry of pain; no distortion of the young man's features with
agony; no moan, or sob, or sigh.As he closed firmly his right eye, and
compressed his pallid lips, a joyous smile lit up his whole countenance
that told the spectator how superior even human love is to the body's
anguish; how willingly the severest sacrifice falls at the beck of
honor!I shall attempt no description of the manner in which I received the
astounding news from the lips of the imperturbable Pollexfen; nor
prolong this narrative by detailing the meeting of the lovers, their
gradual recovery, their marriage, and their departure for the vales of
Dauphiny.It is but just to add, however, that Pollexfen added two
thousand five hundred dollars to the bank account of Mademoiselle
Marmont, on the day of her nuptials, as a bridal present, given, no
doubt, partially as a compensation to the heroic husband for his
voluntary mutilation.Long months elapsed after the departure of Lucile and her lover before
the world heard anything more of the photographer.One day, however, in the early spring of the next season, it was
observed that Pollexfen had opened a new and most magnificent gallery
upon Montgomery Street, and had painted prominently upon his sign, these
words:

    +----------------------------------------------------+
    |          JOHN POLLEXFEN, PHOTOGRAPHER.|
    |                                                    |
    |       _Discoverer of the Carbon Process,           |
    | By which  Pictures are Painted by the Sun._ |
    +----------------------------------------------------+

The news of this invention spread, in a short time, over the whole
civilized world; and the Emperor Napoleon the Third, with the liberality
characteristic of great princes, on hearing from the lips of Lucile a
full account of this wonderful discovery, revived, in favor of John
Pollexfen, the pension which had been bestowed upon Niepce, and which
had lapsed by his death, in 1839; and with a magnanimity that would have
rendered still more illustrious his celebrated uncle, revoked the decree
of forfeiture against the estates of M. Marmont, and bestowed them, with
a corresponding title of nobility, upon Lucile and her issue.I trust the patient reader will excuse its length,
for it was all necessary, in order to explain how John Pollexfen made
his fortune.[Decoration]

VI._THE LOVE KNOT._


    Upon my bosom lies
      A knot of blue and gray;
    You ask me why tears fill my eyes
      As low to you I say:

    "I had two brothers once,
      Warmhearted, bold and gay;
    They left my side--one wore the blue,
      The other wore the gray.One rode with "Stonewall" and his men,
      And joined his fate with Lee;
    The other followed Sherman's march,
      Triumphant to the sea.Both fought for what they deemed the right,
      And died with sword in hand;
    One sleeps amid Virginia's hills,
      And one in Georgia's land.Why should one's dust be consecrate,
      The other's spurned with scorn--
    Both victims of a common fate,
      Twins cradled, bred and born?tell me not--a patriot one,
      A traitor vile the other;
    John was my mother's favorite son,
      But Eddie was my brother.The same sun shines above their graves,
      My love unchanged must stay--
    And so upon my bosom lies
      Love's knot of blue and gray."_THE AZTEC PRINCESS._

"Speaking marble."--BYRON.CHAPTER I.

In common with many of our countrymen, my attention has been powerfully
drawn to the subject of American antiquities, ever since the publication
of the wonderful discoveries made by Stephens and Norman Among the ruins
of Uxmal and Palenque.Yucatan and Chiapas have always spoken to my imagination more forcibly
than Egypt or Babylon; and in my early dreams of ambition I aspired to
emulate the fame of Champollion _le Jeune_, and transmit my name to
posterity on the same page with that of the decipherer of the
hieroglyphics on the pyramids of Ghizeh.The fame of warriors and statesmen is transient and mean, when compared
to that of those literary colossii whose herculean labors have turned
back upon itself the tide of oblivion, snatched the scythe from the
hands of Death, and, reversing the duties of the fabled Charon, are now
busily engaged in ferrying back again across the Styx the shades of the
illustrious dead, and landing them securely upon the shores of true
immortality, the ever-living Present!Even the laurels of the poet and
orator, the historian and philosopher, wither, and

    "Pale their ineffectual fires"

in the presence of that superiority--truly godlike in its
attributes--which, with one wave of its matchless wand, conjures up
whole realms, reconstructs majestic empires, peoples desolate
wastes--voiceless but yesterday, save with the shrill cry of the
bittern--and, contemplating the midnight darkness shrouding Thebes and
Nineveh, cries aloud, "Let there be light!"and suddenly Thotmes starts
from his tomb, the dumb pyramids become vocal, Nimroud wakes from his
sleep of four thousand years, and, springing upon his battle-horse, once
more leads forth his armies to conquest and glory.The unfamiliar air
learns to repeat accents, forgotten ere the foundations of Troy were
laid, and resounds once more with the echoes of a tongue in which old
Menes wooed his bride, long before Noah was commanded to build the Ark,
or the first rainbow smiled upon the cloud.Daniel went to the kitchen.All honor, then, to the shades of Young and Champollion, Lepsius and De
Lacy, Figeac and Layard.Alexander and Napoleon conquered kingdoms, but
they were ruled by the living.On the contrary, the heroes I have
mentioned vanquished mighty realms, governed alone by the

    "Monarch of the Scythe and Glass,"

that unsubstantial king, who erects his thrones on broken columns and
fallen domes, waves his sceptre over dispeopled wastes, and builds his
capitals amid the rocks of Petraea and the catacombs of Egypt.#       #       #       #       #

Such being the object of my ambition, it will not appear surprising that
I embraced every opportunity to enlarge my knowledge of my favorite
subject--American Antiquities--and eagerly perused every new volume
purporting to throw any light upon it.I was perfectly familiar with the
works of Lord Kingsborough and Dr.Robertson before I was fifteen years
of age, and had studied the explorations of Bernal Diaz, Waldeck, and
Dupaix, before I was twenty.My delight, therefore, was boundless when a
copy of Stephens's travels in Yucatan and Chiapas fell into my hands,
and I devoured his subsequent publications on the same subject with all
the avidity of an enthusiast.Very early I
saw the importance of an acquaintance with aboriginal tongues, and
immediately set about mastering the researches of Humboldt and
Schoolcraft.This was easily done; for I discovered, much to my chagrin
and disappointment, that but little is known of the languages of the
Indian tribes, and that little is soon acquired.Dissatisfied with such
information as could be gleaned from books only, I applied for and
obtained an agency for dispensing Indian rations among the Cherokees and
Ouchitaws, and set out for Fort Towson in the spring of 1848.Soon after my arrival I left the fort, and took up my residence at the
wigwam of Sac-a-ra-sa, one of the principal chiefs of the Cherokees.My
intention to make myself familiar with the Indian tongues was noised
abroad, and every facility was afforded me by my hospitable friends.I
took long voyages into the interior of the continent, encountered
delegations from most of the western tribes, and familiarized myself
with almost every dialect spoken by the Indians dwelling west of the
Rocky Mountains.John journeyed to the bathroom.I devoted four years to this labor, and at the end of
that period, with my mind enriched by a species of knowledge
unattainable by a mere acquaintance with books, I determined to visit
Central America in person, and inspect the monuments of Uxmal and
Palenque with my own eyes.Full of this intention, I took passage on the steamship "Prometheus," in
December, 1852, bound from New York to Greytown, situated in the State
of Nicaragua; a point from which I could easily reach Chiapas or
Yucatan.And at this point of my narrative, it becomes necessary to digress for a
moment, and relate an incident which occurred on the voyage, and which,
in its consequences, changed my whole mode of investigation, and
introduced a new element of knowledge to my attention.It so happened that Judge E----, formerly on the Bench of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, was a fellow-passenger.He had been
employed by the Nicaragua Transit Company to visit Leon, the capital of
Nicaragua, and perfect some treaty stipulations with regard to the
project of an interoceanic canal.Fellow-passengers, we of course became
acquainted almost immediately, and at an early day I made respectful
inquiries concerning that science to which he had of late years
consecrated his life--I mean the "Theory of Spiritual Communion between
the Two Worlds of Matter and Spirit."The judge was as communicative as
I could desire, and with the aid of two large manuscript volumes (which
were subsequently given to the public), he introduced me at once into
the profoundest arcana of the science.I read his books through with the
deepest interest, and though not by any means convinced, I was startled
and bewildered.The most powerful instincts of my nature were aroused,
and I frankly acknowledged to my instructor, that an irresistible
curiosity had seized me to witness some of those strange phenomena with
which his volumes superabounded.Finally, I extorted a promise from him,
that on our arrival at Greytown, if a favorable opportunity presented,
he would endeavor to form the mystical circle, and afford me the
privilege I so much coveted--_to see for myself_.The anticipated
exper
