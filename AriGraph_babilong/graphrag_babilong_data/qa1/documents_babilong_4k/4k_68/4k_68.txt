His report was as follows: "I found undoubted evidence of acute
inflammation.There was an increased number of small, round cells
(leucocytes) in the mucous and submucous coats.This accumulation of
new cells was most abundant in and around the solitary follicles, which
were greatly swollen.Clumps of lymphoid cells were found extending
even a little into the muscular coat.The epithelial lining of the
intestine was not demonstrable, but this is usually the case with
post-mortem specimens of human intestine, and justifies no inferences
as to pathological changes.The glands of Lieberkuhn were rich in the
so-called goblet-cells, and some of the glands were distended with
mucus and desquamated epithelium, so as to present sometimes the
appearance of little cysts.This was observed especially in the
neighborhood of the solitary follicles.The blood-vessels, especially
the veins of the submucous coat, were abnormally distended with blood.I searched for micro-organisms, and found them in abundance upon the
free surface of the intestine in the mucous accumulations there, and
also in the mouths of the glands of Lieberkuhn.Both rod-shaped and
small round bacteria were found.I attach no especial importance to
finding bacteria upon the surface of the intestine.The general result
of the examination is to confirm the view that cholera infantum is
characterized by an acute intestinal inflammation."NATURE.--Cholera infantum appears from its symptoms and lesions to be
the most severe form of intestinal catarrh to which infants are liable.The alvine discharges, to which the rapid prostration is largely due,
probably consist in part of intestinal secretions and in part of serum
which has transuded from the capillaries of the intestines.That the
intestinal mucous membrane sometimes presents a pale appearance at the
autopsy of an infant who, previously well, has died of cholera infantum
after a sickness of twenty-four or forty-eight hours, is perhaps due to
the great amount of liquid secretion and transudation in which the
inflamed surface is bathed.Moreover, it is, I believe, a recognized
fact that the hyperaemia of an acutely-inflamed surface when of short
duration frequently disappears in the cadaver, as that of scarlet fever
and erysipelas.The early hyperplasia of the solitary and mesenteric
glands, and the hyperaemia and thickening of the surface of the ileum
and colon in those who have survived a few days, indicate the
inflammatory character of the malady.The opinion has been expressed by certain observers that cholera {745}
infantum is identical with thermic fever or sunstroke.There is indeed
a resemblance to thermic fever as regards certain important symptoms.In cholera infantum the temperature is from 105 degrees to 108 degrees;
in sunstroke it is also very high, often running above 108 degrees.Great heat of head, contracted pupils, thin fecal evacuations,
embarrassed respiration, scanty urine, and cerebral symptoms are common
toward the close of cholera infantum, and they are the prominent
symptoms in sunstroke.Nevertheless, I cannot accept the theory which
regards these maladies as identical, and which removes cholera infantum
from the list of intestinal diseases.In cholera infantum the
gastro-intestinal symptoms always take the precedence, and are, except
in advanced cases, always more prominent than other symptoms.It does
not commence as by a stroke like coup de soleil, but it comes on more
gradually, though rapidly, and it often supervenes upon a diarrhoea or
some error of diet.In the commencement of cholera infantum the infant
is not apt to be drowsy, and it is often wide awake and restless from
the thirst.Contrast this with the alarming stupor of sunstroke.Sunstroke only occurs during the hours of excessive heat, but cholera
infantum may occur at any hour or in any day during the hot weather,
provided that there be sufficient dietetic cause.Again, intestinal
inflammation is not common in sunstroke, while it is the common or, as
I believe, the essential lesion of cholera infantum.These facts show,
in my opinion, that the two maladies are essentially and entirely
distinct.Nevertheless, cases of apparent sunstroke sometimes occur in
the infant, and if the bowels are at the same time relaxed the disease
is apt to be regarded as cholera infantum, and if fatal is usually
reported as such to the health authorities.Cases of this kind I have
occasionally observed or they have been reported to me, although they
are not common.With the exception of the organs of digestion no uniform lesions are
observed in any of the viscera in cholera infantum, except such as are
due to change in the quantity and fluidity of the blood and its
circulation.John journeyed to the bathroom.Writers describe an anaemic appearance of the thoracic and
abdominal viscera, and occasionally passive congestion of the cerebral
vessels.The cerebral symptoms often present toward the close of life
in unfavorable cases of cholera infantum are often due to spurious
hydrocephalus, which we have described above; but as the urinary
secretion is scanty or suppressed, cerebral symptoms may in certain
cases be due to uraemia.DIAGNOSIS.--This form of the summer diarrhoea is diagnosticated by the
symptoms, and especially by the frequency and character of the stools.The stools have already been described as frequent, often passed with
considerable force, deficient in fecal matter, and thin, so as to soak
into the diaper almost like urine.The vomiting, thirst, rapid sinking,
and emaciation serve to distinguish cholera infantum from other
diarrhoeal maladies.When Asiatic cholera is prevalent the differential diagnosis between
the two is difficult if not impossible.PROGNOSIS.--Cholera infantum is one of those diseases in regard to
which physicians often injure their reputation by not giving sufficient
notice of the danger, or even by expressing a favorable opinion when
the case soon after ends fatally.A favorable prognosis should seldom
be expressed without qualification.If the urgent symptoms be relieved,
{746} still the disease may continue as an ordinary intestinal
inflammation, which in hot weather is formidable and often fatal.If
the stools become more consistent and less frequent without the
occurrence of cerebral symptoms, while the limbs are warm and the pulse
good, we may confidently express the opinion that there is no present
danger.The duration of true cholera infantum is short.It either ends fatally,
or it begins soon to abate and ceases, or it continues, and is not to
be distinguished in its subsequent course from an attack of summer
diarrhoea beginning in the ordinary manner.TREATMENT.--Preventive Measures.--Obviously, efficient preventive
measures consist in the removal of infants so far as practicable from
the operation of the causes which produce the disease.Weaning just
before or in the hot weather should, if possible, be avoided, and
removal to the country should be recommended, especially for those who
are deprived of the breast-milk during the age when such nutriment is
required.If for any reason it is necessary to employ artificial
feeding for infants under the age of ten months, that food should
obviously be used which most closely resembles human milk in
digestibility and in nutritive properties.Care should be taken to
prevent fermentation in the food before its use, since much harm is
done by the employment of milk or other food in which fermentative
changes have occurred and which occur quickly in dietetic mixtures in
the hot months.It is also very important that the infant receive its food in proper
quantity and at proper intervals, for if the mother or nurse in her
anxiety to have it thrive feed it too often or in too large quantity,
the surplus food which it cannot digest if not vomited undergoes
fermentation, and consequently becomes irritating to the
gastro-intestinal surface.The physician should be able to give advice
not only in reference to the frequency of feeding, but also in regard
to the quantity of food which the infant requires at each feeding.Correct knowledge and advice in this matter aid in the prevention and
cure of the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Chadbourne of this city and myself made some observations in order to
ascertain how much food well-nourished infants receive daily.We
selected infants that had an abundance of breast-milk, and weighed them
before and after each nursing, so as to determine how much each infant
took during twenty-four hours.The avoirdupois ounce contains 437.5
grains, and we ascertained by careful weight and measurement, employing
the metric system for its greater accuracy, that one fluidounce of
human milk, with a specific gravity of 1.031, weighed 451.9 grains.With these data it was easy to determine the quantity of milk in
fluidounces from its weight.Our first observations related to 12
infants under the age of five weeks, 8 of which nursed twelve times,
and the remaining 4 eight, nine, nine, and eleven times respectively,
in the twenty-four hours.The quantity of milk received by them in
twenty-four hours varied considerably in the different cases, but the
average was 12.41 fluidounces.Therefore if a baby in the first five
weeks nurse every two hours, it receives only a little more than one
fluidounce at each nursing.The next observations were made upon 15 infants between the ages of
five weeks and ten months: 8 of the 15 were under the age of six {747}
months, and the remaining 7 were between the ages of six months and ten
months.The weighing showed that the younger took nearly the same
quantity per day, on the average, as the older infants in this group.The average quantity received by each was twenty-four and six-tenths
fluidounces.Hence if the nursings were eight in the twenty-four hours,
three ounces were taken at each nursing; if the nursings were twelve,
the quantity each time was two ounces.Biedert of Germany has also made similar observations in order to
determine the amount of nutriment required by infants.The results of
his weight-studies, as he designates them, were published in the
_Jahrbuch fur Kinderheilkunde_, xix.B., 3 H. His weighing showed that
infants during their first month, if fed on cow's milk, required from
160 to 200 grammes of milk daily, and in the third month 300 grammes.These quantities in fluid measure are 5.44 to 6.83 ounces, the quantity
required each day in the first month, and 10.22 ounces, the quantity
required daily the second month.Therefore, both my weights and
Biedert's show that infants under the age of two months assimilate a
smaller quantity of milk than is usually supposed.For infants older
than two months he estimates the quantity of milk required by infants
by their weight.He believes that the greater the weight the greater is
the amount of food which the infant needs.The method pursued by
Chadbourne and myself is more simple, and it seems to indicate with
sufficient exactness the amount of food required.Some infants, like adults, need more food than others, so that there
can be no exact schedule of the quantity which they require at each
feeding; but while in the first and second months they do not need more
than from one to one and a half fluidounces at each feeding, whether of
breast-milk, or of cow's milk prepared so as to resemble as closely as
possible human milk, infants as they grow older and their stomachs
enlarge can take food in larger quantity, and therefore require less
frequent feeding.Under the age of two months the stomach is so small
that it cannot receive much more than one or one and a half fluidounces
without undue distension.At the age of six months it can probably
receive and digest without discomfort three ounces, and in the last
half of the first year even four ounces.Infants nourished at the
breast should be allowed to nurse every two hours in the daytime,
whatever the age, after the second month, but less frequently at night,
for frequent nursing promotes the secretion of milk, and the milk is of
better quality than when it is long retained in the breast.If by the
fifth or sixth month mothers or wet-nurses find, as is frequently the
case, that they do not have sufficient milk, other food should be given
in addition, perhaps after each second nursing or every fourth hour.The kind of food which it is best to employ to supplement the nursing
will be mentioned under the head of curative measures.By knowledge on
the part of the mother and nurse of the dietetic needs of the infant,
and by consequent judicious alimentation, and by measures also to
procure the utmost purity of the air, there can be no doubt that the
summer diarrhoea may to a great extent be prevented.Sandra went back to the garden.Curative Treatment.--The indications for treatment are--1st, to provide
the best possible food; 2d, to procure pure air; 3d, to aid the
digestive function of the infant; 4th, to employ such medicinal agents
as can be safely given to check the diarrhoea and cure the intestinal
catarrh.{748} The infant with this disease is thirsty, and is therefore apt to
take more nutriment in the liquid form than it requires for its
sustenance.If nursing, it craves the breast, or if weaned, craves the
bottle, at short intervals to relieve the thirst.No more nutriment
should be allowed than is required for nutrition, for the reason stated
above, and the thirst may best be relieved by a little cold water,
gum-water, or barley-water, to which a few drops of brandy or whiskey
are added.Since one of the two important factors in producing the summer
diarrhoea is the use of improper food, it is obviously very important
for the successful treatment of this disease that the food should be of
the right kind, properly prepared, and given in proper quantity.I need
not repeat that for infants under the age of one year no food is so
suitable as breast-milk, and one affected with the diarrhoea and
remaining in the city should, if possible, at least if under the age of
ten months, be provided with breast-milk.It can be more satisfactorily
treated and the chances of its recovery are much greater if it be
nourished with human milk than by any other kind of diet.If, however,
the mother's milk fail or become unsuitable from ill-health or
pregnancy, and on account of family circumstances a wet-nurse cannot be
procured, the important and difficult duty devolves upon the physician
of deciding how the infant should be fed.In order to solve this
problem it will be well to recall to mind the part performed in the
digestive function by the different secretions which digest food:

1st.It converts starch into glucose
or grape-sugar.It has no effect upon fat or the protein group.It is
the secretion of the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands,
which in infants under the age of three months are very small, almost
rudimentary.The two parotid glands at the age of one month weigh only
thirty-four grains.The power to convert starch into sugar possessed by
saliva is due to a ferment which it contains called ptyalin.The gastric juice is a thin, nearly transparent, and colorless
fluid, acid from the presence of a little hydrochloric acid.It
produces no change in starch, grape-sugar, or the fats, except that it
dissolves the covering of the fat-cells.Its function is to convert the
proteids into peptone, which is effected by its active principle,
termed pepsin.The bile is alkaline and neutralizes the acid product of gastric
digestion.It forms soaps with the
fatty acids and has a slight emulsifying action on fat.The soaps are
said to promote the emulsion of fat.John went to the bedroom.Their emulsifying power is
believed to be increased by admixture with the pancreatic secretion.Moreover, the absorption of oil is facilitated by the presence of bile
upon the surface throughSandra moved to the bathroom.
