Grocery shops, their interiors resembling the toy ones of our childhood,
are brightened with cones of snowy sugar in blue paper jackets.The
wooden drawers filled with spices.Here, too, one can get an excellent
light wine for eight sous the bottle.As the day begins, the early morning cries drift up from the street.At
six the fishwomen with their push-carts go their rounds, each singing
the beauties of her wares."Voila les beaux maquereaux!"Sandra journeyed to the hallway.chants the
sturdy vendor, her sabots clacking over the cobbles as she pushes the
cart or stops and weighs a few sous' worth of fish to a passing
purchaser.The goat-boy, piping his oboe-like air, passes, the goats scrambling
ahead alert to steal a carrot or a bite of cabbage from the nearest
cart.And when these have passed, the little orgue de Barbarie plays its
repertoire of quadrilles and waltzes under your window.It is a very
sweet-toned organ, this little orgue de Barbarie, with a plaintive,
apologetic tone, and a flute obbligato that would do credit to many a
small orchestra.I know this small organ well--an old friend on dreary
mornings, putting the laziest riser in a good humor for the day.The
tunes are never changed, but they are all inoffensive and many of them
pretty, and to the shrunken old man who grinds them out daily they are
no doubt by this time all alike.[Illustration: (cat on counter)]

It is growing late and time for one's coffee.The little tobacco-shop
and cafe around the corner I find an excellent place for cafe au lait.The coffee is delicious and made when one chooses to arrive, not stewed
like soup, iridescent in color, and bitter with chicory, as one finds it
in many of the small French hotels.Two crescents, flaky and hot from
the bakery next door, and three generous pats of unsalted butter,
complete this morning repast, and all for the modest sum of twelve sous,
with three sous to the garcon who serves you, with which he is well
pleased.I have forgotten a companionable cat who each morning takes her seat on
the long leather settee beside me and shares my crescents.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.The cats are
considered important members of nearly every family in the Quarter.Big
yellow and gray Angoras, small, alert tortoise-shell ones, tiger-like
and of plainer breed and more intelligence, bask in the doorways or
sleep on the marble-topped tables of the cafes.[Illustration: (woman carrying shopping box)]

"Qu'est-ce que tu veux, ma pauvre Mimi?"condoles Celeste, as she
approaches the family feline."Mimi" stretches her full length, extending and retracting her claws,
rolls on her back, turns her big yellow eyes to Celeste and mews.The
next moment she is picked up and carried back into the house like a
stray child.At noon the streets seem deserted, except for the sound of occasional
laughter and the rattle of dishes coming from the smaller restaurants as
one passes.At this hour these places are full of workmen in white and
blue blouses, and young girls from the neighboring factories.A big fellow in a blue gingham blouse
attempts to kiss the little milliner opposite him at table; she evades
him, and, screaming with laughter, picks up her skirts and darts out
of the restaurant and down the street, the big fellow close on her
dainty heels.A second later he has overtaken her, and picking her up
bodily in his strong arms carries her back to her seat, where he places
her in her chair, the little milliner by this time quite out of breath
with laughter and quite happy.This little episode affords plenty of
amusement to the rest of the crowd; they wildly applaud the good-humored
captor, who orders another litre of red wine for those present, and
every one is merry.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.[Illustration: (city house)]

The Parisian takes his hour for dejeuner, no matter what awaits him.It
is the hour when lovers meet, too.Edmond, working in the atelier for
the reproduction of Louis XVI furniture, meets Louise coming from her
work on babies' caps in the rue des Saints-Peres at precisely twelve-ten
on the corner of the rue Vaugirard and the Boulevard Montparnasse.Louise comes without her hat, her hair in an adorable coiffure, as
neatly arranged as a Geisha's, her skirt held tightly to her hips,
disclosing her small feet in low slippers.There is a golden rule, I
believe, in the French catechism which says: "It is better, child, that
thy hair be neatly dressed than that thou shouldst have a whole frock."The two breakfast on a ragout and a bottle of
wine while they talk of going on Sunday to St.Cloud for the day--and so
they must be economical this week.Cloud
and spend all day in the woods.It is the second Sunday in the month,
and the fountains will be playing.They will take their dejeuner with
them.Louise will, of course, see to this, and Edmond will bring
cigarettes enough for two, and the wine.Then, when the stars are out,
they will take one of the "bateaux mouches" back to Paris.Dear Paris--the Paris of youth, of love, and of romance!*     *     *     *     *

The pulse of the Quarter begins really to beat at 6 P.M.At this hour
the streets are alive with throngs of workmen--after their day's work,
seeking their favorite cafes to enjoy their aperitifs with their
comrades--and women hurrying back from their work, many to their homes
and children, buying the dinner en route.Henriette, who sews all day at one of the fashionable dressmakers' in
the rue de la Paix, trips along over the Pont Neuf to her small room in
the Quarter to put on her best dress and white kid slippers, for it is
Bullier night and she is going to the ball with two friends of her
cousin.In the twilight, and from my studio window the swallows, like black
cinders against the yellow sky, dart and swoop above the forest of
chimney-pots and tiled and gabled roofs.It is the hour to dine, and with this thought uppermost in every one's
mind studio doors are slammed and night-keys tucked in pockets.And arm
in arm the poet and the artist swing along to that evening Mecca of good
Bohemians--the Boulevard St.[Illustration: (basket of flowers)]




CHAPTER II

THE BOULEVARD ST.MICHEL


From the Place St.Michel, this ever gay and crowded boulevard ascends a
long incline, up which the tired horses tug at the traces of the
fiacres, and the big double-decked steam trams crawl, until they reach
the Luxembourg Gardens,--and so on a level road as far as the Place de
l'Observatoire.Within this length lies the life of the "Boul' Miche."Nearly every highway has its popular side, and on the "Boul' Miche" it
is the left one, coming up from the Seine.Here are the cafes, and from
5 P.M.until long past midnight, the life of the Quartier pours by
them--students, soldiers, families, poets, artists, sculptors, wives,
and sweethearts; bicycle girls, the modern grisette, the shop girl, and
the model; fakirs, beggars, and vagrants.Yet the word vagrant is a
misnomer in this city, where economy has reached a finesse that is
marvelous.That fellow, in filth and rags, shuffling along, his eyes
scrutinizing, like a hungry rat, every nook and corner under the cafe
tables on the terrace, carries a stick spiked with a pin.The next
instant, he has raked the butt of your discarded cigarette from beneath
your feet with the dexterity of a croupier.The butt he adds to the
collection in his filthy pocket, and shuffles on to the next cafe.It
will go so far at least toward paying for his absinthe.He is hungry,
but it is the absinthe for which he is working.He is a "marchand de
megots"; it is his profession.[Illustration: TERRACE TAVERNE DU PANTHEON]

One finds every type of restaurant, tavern, and cafe along the "Boul'
Miche."There are small restaurants whose plat du jour might be traced
to some faithful steed finding a final oblivion in a brown sauce and
onions--an important item in a course dinner, to be had with wine
included for one franc fifty.There are brasseries too, gloomy by day
and brilliant by night (dispensing good Munich beer in two shades, and
German and French food), whose rich interiors in carved black oak,
imitation gobelin, and stained glass are never half illumined until the
lights are lit.[Illustration: A "TYPE"]

All day, when the sun blazes, and the awnings are down, sheltering those
chatting on the terrace, the interiors of these brasseries appear dark
and cavernous.John went back to the bathroom.The clientele is somber too, and in keeping with the place; silent
poets, long haired, pale, and always writing; serious-minded lawyers,
lunching alone, and fat merchants who eat and drink methodically.Then there are bizarre cafes, like the d'Harcourt, crowded at night with
noisy women tawdry in ostrich plumes, cheap feather boas, and much
rouge.The d'Harcourt at midnight is ablaze with light, but the crowd is
common and you move on up the boulevard under the trees, past the shops
full of Quartier fashions--velvet coats, with standing collars buttoning
close under the chin; flamboyant black silk scarfs tied in a huge bow;
queer broad-brimmed, black hats without which no "types" wardrobe is
complete.On the corner facing the square, and opposite the Luxembourg gate, is
the Taverne du Pantheon.This is the most brilliant cafe and restaurant
of the Quarter, forming a V with its long terrace, at the corner of the
boulevard and the rue Soufflot, at the head of which towers the superb
dome of the Pantheon.[Illustration: (view of Pantheon from Luxembourg gate)]

It is 6 P.M.and the terrace, four rows deep with little round tables,
is rapidly filling.The white-aproned garcons are hurrying about or
squeezing past your table, as they take the various orders."Deux pernod nature, deux!"cries another, and presently the "Omnibus"
in his black apron hurries to your table, holding between his knuckles,
by their necks, half a dozen bottles of different aperitifs, for it is
he who fills your glass.[Illustration: ALONG THE "BOUL' MICHE"]

It is the custom to do most of one's correspondence in these cafes.The
garcon brings you a portfolio containing note-paper, a bottle of violet
ink, an impossible pen that spatters, and a sheet of pink blotting-paper
that does not absorb.With these and your aperitif, the place is yours
as long as you choose to remain.Mary travelled to the bedroom.No one will ask you to "move on" or pay
the slightest attention to you.Should you happen to be a cannibal chief from the South Seas, and dine
in a green silk high hat and a necklace of your latest captive's teeth,
you would occasion a passing glance perhaps, but you would not be a
sensation.[Illustration: (hotel sign)]

Celeste would say to Henriette:

"Regarde ca, Henriette!est-il drole, ce sauvage?"And Henriette would reply quite assuringly:

"Eh bien quoi!c'est pas si extraordinaire, il est peut-etre de
Madagascar; il y en a beaucoup a Paris maintenant."There is no phase of character, or eccentricity of dress, that Paris has
not seen.Daniel travelled to the hallway.Nor will your waiter polish off the marble top of your table, with the
hope that your ordinary sensibility will suggest another drink.It would
be beneath his professional dignity as a good garcon de cafe.The two
sous you have given him as a pourboire, he is well satisfied with, and
expresses his contentment in a "merci, monsieur, merci," the final
syllable ending in a little hiss, prolonged in proportion to his
satisfaction.Sandra journeyed to the garden.After this just formality, you will find him ready to see
the point of a joke or discuss the current topics of the day.He is
intelligent, independent, very polite, but never servile.[Illustration: (woman walking near fountain)]

It is difficult now to find a vacant chair on the long terrace.Sandra moved to the bedroom.A group
of students are having a "Pernod," after a long day's work at the
atelier.They finish their absinthe and then, arm in arm, start off to
Madame Poivret's for dinner.It is cheap there; besides, the little
"boite," with its dingy room and sawdust floor, is a favorite haunt of
theirs, and the good old lady, with her credit slate, a friendly refuge
in time of need.At your left sits a girl in bicycle bloomers, yellow-tanned shoes, and
short black socks pulled up snug to her sunburned calves.She has just
ridden in from the Bois de Boulogne, and has scorched half the way back
to meet her "officier" in pale blue.Farther on are four older men, accompanied by a pale, sweet-faced woman
of thirty, her blue-black hair brought in a bandeau over her dainty
ears.She is the model of the gray-haired man on the left, a man of
perhaps fifty, with kindly intelligent eyes and strong, nervous,
expressive hands--hands that know how to model a colossal Greek
war-horse, plunging in battle, or create a nymph scarcely a foot high
out of a lump of clay, so charmingly that the French Government has not
only bought the nymph, but given him a little red ribbon for his pains.[Illustration: (omnibus)]

He is telling the others of a spot he knows in Normandy, where one can
paint--full of quaint farm-houses, with thatched roofs; picturesque
roadsides, rich in foliage; bright waving fields, and cool green
woods, and purling streams; quaint gardens, choked with lavender and
roses and hollyhocks--and all this fair land running to the white sand
of the beach, with the blue sea beyond.He will write to old Pere
Jaqueline that they are all coming--it is just the place in which to
pose a model "en plein air,"--and Suzanne, his model, being a Normande
herself, grows enthusiastic at the thought of going down again to the
sea.Long before she became a Parisienne, and when her beautiful hair
was a tangled shock of curls, she used to go out in the big boats,
with the fisherwomen--barefooted, brown, and happy.She tells them of
those good days, and then they all go into the Taverne to dine, filled
with the idea of the new trip, and dreaming of dinners under the
trees, of "Tripes a la mode de Caen," Normandy cider, and a lot of new
sketches besides.
