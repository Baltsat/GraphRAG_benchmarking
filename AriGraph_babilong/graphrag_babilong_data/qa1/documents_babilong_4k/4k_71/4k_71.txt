I'll ask all the boys and girls I know to come
and look on, and we might have quite a grand entertainment.We can march about all over, and fire off the cannons and
everything!"Yes, but how's General McClellan to hear anything about it?""Why--I don't know," said Peter, rather taken aback by this view of the
subject."Well, somehow--never mind, it will be grand fun, and I mean
to ask my father right away."Finally it was
concluded that it might make more impression on Mr.Schermerhorn's mind,
if the application came from the regiment in a body; so, running for
their swords and guns, officers and men found their places in the
battalion, and the grand procession started on its way--chattering all
the time, in utter defiance of that "article of war" which forbids
"talking in the ranks."Just as they were passing the lake, they heard
carriage wheels crunching on the gravel, and drew up in a long line on
the other side of the road to let the vehicle pass them; much to the
astonishment of two pretty young ladies and a sweet little girl, about
Freddy's age, who were leaning comfortably back in the handsome
barouche.exclaimed one of the ladies, "what in the world is all
this?"cried Peter, running up to the carriage, "why, these are the
Dashahed Zouaves, Miss Carlton.Good morning, Miss Jessie," to the little girl on the front seat, who
was looking on with deep interest."Oh, to be sure, I remember," said Miss Carlton, laughing; "come,
introduce the Zouaves, Peter; we are wild to know them!"The boys clustered eagerly about the carriage and a lively chat took
place.The Zouaves, some blushing and bashful, others frank and
confident, and all desperately in love already with pretty little
Jessie, related in high glee their adventures--except the celebrated
court martial--and enlarged glowingly upon the all-important subject of
the grand review.Colonel Freddy, of course, played a prominent part in all this, and with
his handsome face, bright eyes, and frank, gentlemanly ways, needed only
those poor lost curls to be a perfect picture of a soldier.He chattered
away with Miss Lucy, the second sister, and obtained her special promise
that she would plead their cause with Mr.Schermerhorn in case the
united petitions of the corps should fail.The young ladies did not know
of Mrs.Schermerhorn's departure, but Freddy and Peter together coaxed
them to come up to the house "anyhow."The carriage was accordingly
taken into the procession, and followed it meekly to the house; the
Zouaves insisting on being escort, much to the terror of the young
ladies; who were in constant apprehension that the rear rank and the
horses might come to kicks--not to say blows--and the embarrassment of
the coachman; who, as they were constantly stopping unexpectedly to turn
round and talk, didn't know "where to have them," as the saying is.However, they reached their destination in safety before long, and
found Mr.Schermerhorn seated on the piazza.He hastened forward to meet
them, with the cordial greeting of an old friend."Well, old bachelor," said Miss Carlton, gayly, as the young ladies
ascended the steps, "you see we have come to visit you in state, with
the military escort befitting patriotic young ladies who have four
brothers on the Potomac."Gone to Niagara and left me a 'lone lorn creetur;'" said Mr."Basely deserted me when my farming couldn't be
left.But how am I to account for the presence of the military,
mademoiselle?""Really, I beg their pardons," exclaimed Miss Carlton."They have come
on a special deputation to you, Mr.Schermerhorn, so pray don't let us
interrupt business."Thus apostrophised, the boys scampered eagerly up the steps; and Freddy,
a little bashful, but looking as bright as a button, delivered the
following brief oration: "Mr.Schermerhorn: I want--that is, the boys
want--I mean we all want--to have a grand review on Saturday, and ask
our friends to look on.Schermerhorn,
smiling; "but what will become of you good people when I tell you that
I have just received a letter from Mrs.Schermerhorn, asking me to join
her this week instead of next, and bring Peter with me."interrupted Peter; "can't you tell ma
I've joined the army for the war?"No, the army
must give you up, and lose a valuable member, Master Peter; but just
have the goodness to listen a moment.The review shall take place, but
as the camp will have to break up on Saturday instead of Monday, as I
had intended, the performances must come off to-morrow.The boys gave a delighted consent to this arrangement, and now the only
thing which dampened their enjoyment was the prospect of such a speedy
end being put to their camp life.what was the fun for a
fellow to be poked into a stupid watering place, where he must bother to
keep his hair parted down the middle, and a clean collar stiff enough to
choke him on from morning till night?"as Tom indignantly remarked to
George and Will the same evening."The fact is, this sort of thing is
_the_ thing for a _man_ after all!"an opinion in which the other _men_
fully concurred.But let us return to the piazza, where we have left the party.After a
few moments more spent in chatting with Mr.Schermerhorn, it was decided
to accept Colonel Freddy's polite invitation, which he gave with such a
bright little bow, to inspect the camp.You may be sure it was in
apple-pie order, for Jerry, who had taken the Zouaves under his special
charge, insisted on their keeping it in such a state of neatness as only
a soldier ever achieved.The party made an extremely picturesque
group--the gay uniforms of the Zouaves, and light summer dresses of the
ladies, charmingly relieved against the background of trees; while Mr.Schermerhorn's stately six feet, and somewhat portly proportions, quite
reminded one of General Scott; especially among such a small army; in
which George alone quite came up to the regulation "63 inches."Little Jessie ran hither and thither, surrounded by a crowd of adorers,
who would have given their brightest buttons, every "man" of them, to be
the most entertaining fellow of the corps.They showed her the battery
and the stacks of shining guns--made to stand up by Jerry in a wonderful
fashion that the boys never could hope to attain--the inside of all the
tents, and the smoke guard house (Tom couldn't help a blush as he looked
in); and finally, as a parting compliment (which, let me tell you, is
the greatest, in a boy's estimation, that can possibly be paid), Freddy
made her a present of his very largest and most gorgeous "glass agates;"
one of which was all the colors of the rainbow, and the other
patriotically adorned with the Stars and Stripes in enamel.Peter
climbed to the top of the tallest cherry tree, and brought her down a
bough at least a yard and a half long, crammed with "ox hearts;" Harry
eagerly offered to make any number of "stunning baskets" out of the
stones, and in short there never was such a belle seen before."Oh, a'int she jolly!"was the ruling opinion among the Zouaves.A
private remark was also circulated to the effect that "Miss Jessie was
stunningly pretty."The young ladies at last said good-by to the camp; promising faithfully
to send all the visitors they could to the grand review, and drove off
highly entertained with their visit.Schermerhorn decided to take
the afternoon boat for the city and return early Friday morning, and the
boys, left to themselves, began to think of dinner, as it was two
o'clock.A brisk discussion was kept up all dinner time you may be sure,
concerning the event to come off on the morrow."I should like to know, for my part, what we do in a review," said
Jimmy, balancing his fork artistically on the end of his finger, and
looking solemnly round the table."March about,
and form into ranks and columns, and all that first, then do charming
"parade rest," "'der humps!"and the rest of it; and finish off by
firing off our guns, and showing how we can't hit anything by any
possibility!""But I'm sure father won't let us have any powder," said Peter
disconsolately."You can't think how I burnt the end of my nose last
Fourth with powder!It was so sore I couldn't blow it for a week!"The boys all burst out laughing at this dreadful disaster, and George
said, "You weren't lighting it with the end of your nose, were you?""No; but I was stooping over, charging one of my cannon, and I dropped
the 'punk' right in the muzzle somehow, and, would you believe it, the
nasty thing went off and burnt my nose!and father said I shouldn't play
with powder any more, because I might have put out my eyes.""Well, we must take it out in marching, then," said Freddy, with a
tremendous sigh.Mary journeyed to the bedroom."No, hold on; I'll tell you what we can do!""I have
some 'double headers' left from the Fourth; we might fire them out of
the cannon; they make noise enough, I'm sure.I'll write to my mother
this afternoon and get them."The boys couldn't help being struck with the generosity of this offer,
coming from Tom after their late rather unkind treatment of him; and the
older ones especially were very particular to thank him for his present.As soon as dinner was over, he started for the house to ask Mr.As he hurried along the road, his
bright black eyes sparkling with the happiness of doing a good action,
he heard trotting steps behind him, felt an arm stealing round his neck,
schoolboy fashion, and there was Freddy."I ran after you all the way," he pantingly said."I want to tell you,
dear Tom, how much we are obliged to you for giving us your crackers,
and how sorry we are that we acted so rudely to you the other day.Please forgive us; we all like you so much, and we would feel as mean as
anything to take your present without begging pardon.George, Peter, and
I feel truly ashamed of ourselves every time we think of that abominable
court martial.""There, old fellow, don't say a word more about it!"was the hearty
response; and Tom threw his arm affectionately about his companion."It
was my fault, Freddy, and all because I was mad at poor old Jerry; how
silly!I was sorry for what I said right afterward.""Yes; I'll like you as long as I live!And so
we will leave the two on their walk to the house, and close this
abominably long chapter.THERE are really scarcely words enough in the dictionary properly to
describe the immense amount of drill got through with by the Dashahed
Zouaves between three o'clock that afternoon and twelve, noon, of the
following day.This Friday afternoon was going to be memorable in
history for one of the most splendid reviews on record.They almost ran
poor old Jerry off his legs in their eagerness to go over every possible
variety of exercise known to "Hardee's Tactics," and nearly dislocated
their shoulder blades trying to waggle their elbows backward and forward
all at once when they went at "double quick;" at the same time keeping
the other arm immovably pinioned to their sides.Then that wonderful
operation of stacking the rebellious guns, which obstinately clattered
down nine times and a half out of ten, had to be gone through with, and
a special understanding promulgated in the corps as to when Jerry's
"'der arms!"meant "shoulder arms," and when "order arms" (or bringing
all the muskets down together with a bang); and, in short, there never
was such a busy time seen in camp before.Friday morning dawned, if possible, still more splendidly than any of
the preceding days, with a cool, refreshing breeze, just enough snowy
clouds in the sky to keep off the fiery summer heat in a measure, and
not a headache nor a heartache among the Zouaves to mar the pleasure of
the day.John went back to the garden.The review was to come off at four o'clock, when the July sun
would be somewhat diminished in warmth, and from some hints that Jerry
let fall, Mrs.Lockitt, and the fat cook, Mrs.Mincemeat, were holding
high council up at the house, over a certain collation to be partaken of
at the end of the entertainments.As the day wore on the excitement of our friends the Zouaves increased.They could hardly either eat their dinners, or sit down for more than a
moment at a time; and when, about three o'clock, Mr.Schermerhorn
entered the busy little camp, he was surrounded directly with a crowd of
eager questioners, all talking at once, and making as much noise as a
colony of rooks."Patience, patience, my good friends!"Schermerhorn, holding
up a finger for silence.Tom, here are your 'double
headers,' with love from your mother.Fred, I saw your father to-day,
and they are all coming down to the review.George, here is a note left
for you in my box at the Post Office, and Dashahed Zouaves in
general--I have one piece of advice to give you.Get dressed quietly,
and then sit down and rest yourselves.You will be tired out by the end
of the afternoon, at all events; so don't frisk about more than you can
help at present;" and Mr.Schermerhorn left the camp; while the boys,
under strong pressure of Jerry, and the distant notes of a band which
suddenly began to make itself heard, dressed themselves as nicely as
they could, and sat down with heroic determination to wait for four
o'clock.Presently, carriages began to crunch over the gravel road one after
another, filled with merry children, and not a few grown people besides.Jourdain, with Bella, were among the first to arrive; and
soon after the Carltons' barouche drove up.Jessie, for some unknown
reason, was full of half nervous glee, and broke into innumerable little
trilling laughs when any one spoke to her.A sheet of lilac note paper,
folded up tight, which she held in her hand, seemed to have something to
do with it, and her soft brown curls and spreading muslin skirts were in
equal danger of irremediable "mussing," as she fidgetted about on the
carriage seat, fully as restless as any of the Zouaves.Schermerhorn received his guests on the piazza, where all the chairs
in the house, one would think, were placed for the company, as the best
view of the lawn was from this point.To the extreme right were the
white tents of the camp, half hidden by the immense trunk of a
magnificent elm, the only tree that broke the smooth expanse of the
lawn.On the left a thick hawthorne hedge separated the ornamental
grounds from the cultivated fields of the place, while in front the view
was bounded by the blue and sparkling waters of the Sound.Soon four o'clock struck; and, punctual to the moment, the Zouaves could
be seen in the distance, forming their ranks.Jerry, in his newest suit
of regimentals, bustled about here and there, and presently his voice
was heard shouting, "Are ye all ready now?and to
the melodious notes of "Dixie," performed by the band, which was
stationed nearer the house, the regiment started up the lawn!Jerry
marching up beside them, and occasionally uttering such mysterious
mandates as, "Easy in the centre!Oh, what a burst of delighted applause greeted them as they neared the
house!The boys hurrahed, the girls cl
