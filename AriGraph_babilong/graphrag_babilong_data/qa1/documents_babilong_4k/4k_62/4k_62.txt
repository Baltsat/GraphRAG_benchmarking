And now the music died away, and everybody was as still as a mouse,
while Jerry advanced to the front, and issued the preliminary order:

"To the rear--open order!"and the rear rank straightway fell back;
executing, in fact, that wonderful "tekkinapesstoth'rare" which had
puzzled them so much on the first day of their drilling.Then came those
other wonderful orders:

          "P'_sent_ humps!And so on, at which the muskets flew backward and forward, up and down,
with such wonderful precision.The spectators were delighted beyond
measure; an enthusiastic young gentleman, with about three hairs on
each side of his mustache, who belonged to the Twenty-second Regiment,
declared "It was the best drill he had seen out of his company room!"a
celebrated artist, whose name I dare not tell for the world, sharpened
his pencil, and broke the point off three times in his hurry, and at
last produced the beautiful sketch which appears at the front of this
volume; while all the little boys who were looking on, felt as if they
would give every one of their new boots and glass agates to belong to
the gallant Dashahed Zouaves.[Illustration: "DOUBLE-QUICK."]Sandra went back to the garden.After the guns had been put in every possible variety of position, the
regiment went through their marching.They broke into companies,
formed the line again, divided in two equal parts, called "breaking into
platoons," showed how to "wheel on the right flank," and all manner of
other mysteries.Finally, they returned to their companies, and on Jerry's giving the
order, they started at "double quick" (which is the most comical
tritty-trot movement you can think of), dashed down the <DW72> of the
lawn, round the great elm, up hill again full speed, and in a moment
more were drawn up in unbroken lines before the house, and standing once
again like so many statues.Round after round of applause greeted the
Zouaves, who kept their positions for a moment, then snatching off
their saucy little fez caps, they gave the company three cheers in
return, of the most tremendous description; which quite took away the
little remaining breath they had after the "double quick."Sandra went to the hallway.Thus ended the first part of the review; and now, with the assistance of
their rather Lilliputian battery, and Tom's double headers, they went
through some firing quite loud enough to make the little girls start and
jump uncomfortably; so this part of the entertainment was brought to
rather a sudden conclusion.Jerry had just issued the order, "Close up
in ranks to dismiss," when Mr.Schermerhorn, who, with Miss Carlton and
Jessie, had left the piazza a few minutes before, came forward, saying,
"Have the goodness to wait a moment, Colonel; there is one more ceremony
to go through with."The boys looked at each other in silent curiosity, wondering what could
be coming; when, all at once, the chairs on the piazza huddled back in a
great hurry, to make a lane for a beautiful little figure, which came
tripping from the open door.It was Jessie; but a great change had been made in her appearance.Over
her snowy muslin skirts she had a short classic tunic of red, white, and
blue silk; a wreath of red and white roses and bright blue jonquils
encircled her curls, and in her hand she carried a superb banner.Daniel went back to the garden.It
was made of dark blue silk, trimmed with gold fringe; on one side was
painted an American eagle, and on the other the words "Dashahed
Zouaves," surrounded with a blaze of glory and gold stars.She advanced
to the edge of the piazza, and in a clear, sweet voice, a little
tremulous, but very distinct, she said:

          "COLONEL AND BRAVE SOLDIERS:

          "I congratulate you, in the name of our friends,
          on the success you have achieved.You have shown
          us to-day what Young America can do; and as a
          testimonial of our high admiration, I present you
          the colors of your regiment!"Take them, as the assurance that our hearts are
          with you; bear them as the symbol of the Cause you
          have enlisted under; and should you fall beneath
          them on the field of battle, I bid you lay down
          your lives cheerfully for the flag of your
          country, and breathe with your last sigh the name
          of the Union!Freddy's cheeks grew crimson, and the great tears swelled to his eyes as
he advanced to take the flag which Jessie held toward him.And now our
little Colonel came out bright, sure enough.Perhaps not another member
of the regiment, called upon to make a speech in this way, could have
thought of a word to reply; but Freddy's quick wit supplied him with
the right ideas; and it was with a proud, happy face, and clear voice
that he responded:

          "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

          "I thank you, in the name of my regiment, for the
          honor you have done us.Inspired by your praises,
          proud to belong to the army of the Republic, we
          hope to go on as we have begun.To your kindness
          we owe the distinguishing colors under which we
          march hereafter; and by the Union for which we
          fight, they shall never float over a retreating
          battalion!"the cheers and clapping of hands which followed this little speech!Everybody was looking at Freddy as he stood there, the colors in his
hand, and the bright flush on his cheek, with the greatest admiration.Of course, his parents weren't proud of him; certainly not!But the wonders were not at an end yet; for suddenly the band began
playing a new air, and to this accompaniment, the sweet voice of some
lady unseen, but which sounded to those who knew, wonderfully like Miss
Lucy Carlton's, sang the following patriotic ballad:

          "We will stand by our Flag--let it lead where it will--
          Our hearts and our hopes fondly cling to it still;
          Through battle and danger our Cause must be won--
          Yet forward!still unsullied and bright,
          As when first its fair stars lit oppression's dark night
          And the standard that guides us forever shall be
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"A handful of living--an army of dead,
          The last charge been made and the last prayer been said;
          What is it--as sad we retreat from the plain
          That cheers us, and nerves us to rally again?to our country God-given,
          That gleams through our ranks like a glory from heaven!And the foe, as they fly, in our vanguard shall see
          The Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"We will fight for the Flag, by the love that we bear
          In the Union and Freedom, we'll baffle despair;
          Trust on in our country, strike home for the right,
          And Treason shall vanish like mists of the night.every star in it glows,
          The terror of traitors!And the victory that crowns us shall glorified be,
          'Neath the Star-spangled Banner, the Flag of the Free!"As the song ended, there was another tumult of applause; and then the
band struck up a lively quickstep, and the company, with the Zouaves
marching ahead, poured out on the lawn toward the camp, where a
bountiful collation was awaiting them, spread on the regimental table.Two splendid pyramids of flowers ornamented the centre, and all manner
of "goodies," as the children call them, occupied every inch of space on
the sides.At the head of the table Jerry had contrived a canopy from a
large flag, and underneath this, Miss Jessie, Colonel Freddy, with the
other officers, and some favored young ladies of their own age, took
their seats.The other children found places around the table, and a
merrier fete champetre never was seen.The band continued to play lively
airs from time to time, and I really can give you my word as an author,
that nobody looked cross for a single minute!Between you and me, little reader, there had been a secret arrangement
among the grown folks interested in the regiment, to get all this up in
such fine style.Every one had contributed something to give the Zouaves
their flag and music, while to Mr.Schermerhorn it fell to supply the
supper; and arrangements had been made and invitations issued since the
beginning of the week.The regiment, certainly, had the credit, however,
of getting up the review, it only having been the idea of their good
friends to have the entertainment and flag presentation.So there was a
pleasant surprise on both sides; and each party in the transaction, was
quite as much astonished and delighted as the other could wish.The long sunset shadows were rapidly stealing over the velvet sward as
the company rose from table, adding a new charm to the beauty of the
scene.Everywhere the grass was dotted with groups of elegant ladies and
gentlemen, and merry children, in light summer dresses and quaintly
pretty uniforms.The little camp, with the stacks of guns down its
centre, the bayonets flashing in the last rays of the sun, was all
crowded and brilliant with happy people; looking into the tents and
admiring their exquisite order, inspecting the bright muskets, and
listening eagerly or good-humoredly, as they happened to be children or
grown people, to the explanations and comments of the Zouaves.And on the little grassy knoll, where the flag staff was planted,
central figure of the scene, stood Colonel Freddy, silent and thoughtful
for the first time to-day, with Jerry beside him.The old man had
scarcely left his side since the boy took the flag; he would permit no
one else to wait upon him at table, and his eyes followed him as he
moved among the gay crowd, with a glance of the utmost pride and
affection.The old volunteer seemed to feel that the heart of a soldier
beat beneath the little dandy ruffled shirt and gold-laced jacket of the
young Colonel.Suddenly, the boy snatches up again the regimental
colors; the Stars and Stripes, and little Jessie's flag, and shakes
them out to the evening breeze; and as they flash into view and once
more the cheers of the Zouaves greet their colors, he says, with
quivering lip and flashing eye, "Jerry, if God spares me to be a man,
I'll live and die a soldier!"The soft evening light was deepening into night, and the beautiful
planet Venus rising in the west, when the visitors bade adieu to the
camp; the Zouaves were shaken hands with until their wrists fairly
ached; and then they all shook hands with "dear" Jessie, as Charley was
heard to call her before the end of the day, and heard her say in her
soft little voice how sorry she was they must go to-morrow (though she
certainly couldn't have been sorrier than _they_ were), and then the
good people all got into their carriages again, and drove off; waving
their handkerchiefs for good-by as long as the camp could be seen; and
so, with the sound of the last wheels dying away in the distance, ended
the very end of

                                THE GRAND REVIEW.AND now, at last, had come that "day of disaster," when Camp McClellan
must be deserted.The very sun didn't shine so brilliantly as usual,
thought the Zouaves; and it was positively certain that the past five
days, although they had occurred in the middle of summer, were the very
shortest ever known!Eleven o'clock was the hour appointed for the
breaking up of the camp, in order that they might return to the city by
the early afternoon boat.Sandra moved to the kitchen."Is it possible we have been here a week?"exclaimed Jimmy, as he sat
down to breakfast."It seems as if we had only come yesterday.""What a jolly time it has been!""I don't want
to go to Newport a bit."To Baltimore--but I don't mean to Secesh!"added Tom, with a little
blush.Mary journeyed to the bedroom."I have a cousin in the Palmetto Guards at Charleston, and that's
one too many rebels in the family."cried George Chadwick; "the Pringles are a first rate
family; the rest of you are loyal enough, I'm sure!"and George gave
Tom such a slap on the back, in token of his good will, that it quite
brought the tears into his eyes.When breakfast was over, the Zouaves repaired to their tents, and
proceeded to pack their clothes away out of the lockers.Mary journeyed to the garden.John went to the kitchen.Mary travelled to the office.They were not
very scientific packers, and, in fact, the usual mode of doing the
business was to ram everything higgledy-piggledy into their valises, and
then jump on them until they consented to come together and be locked.Presently Jerry came trotting down with a donkey cart used on the farm,
and under his directions the boys folded their blankets neatly up, and
placed them in the vehicle, which then drove off with its load, leaving
them to get out and pile together the other furnishings of the tents;
for, of course, as soldiers, they were expected to wind up their own
affairs, and we all know that boys will do considerable _hard work_ when
it comes in the form of _play_.Just as the cart, with its vicious
little wrong-headed steed, had tugged, and jerked, and worried itself
out of sight, a light basket carriage, drawn by two dashing black
Canadian ponies, drew up opposite the camp, and the reins were let fall
by a young lady in a saucy "pork pie" straw hat, who was driving--no
other than Miss Carlton, with Jessie beside her.The boys eagerly
surrounded the little carriage, and Miss Carlton said, laughing, "Jessie
begged so hard for a last look at the camp, that I had to bring her."Really," repeated Freddy; "but I am so glad you came, Miss Jessie, just
in time to see us off.""You know soldiers take themselves away houses and all," said George;
"you will see the tents come down with a run presently."As he spoke, the donkey
cart rattled up, and Jerry, touching his cap to the ladies, got out, and
prepared to superintend the downfall of the tents.By his directions,
two of the Zouaves went to each tent, and pulled the stakes first from
one corner, then
